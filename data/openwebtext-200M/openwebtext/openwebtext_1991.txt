Let me start with a question , and it's not at all flippant :
Why does Frank Gaffney hate America ?
Specifically , why is he so opposed to the fundamental philosophy of openness and free debate upon which this country was founded ?
Anyway , on to the column .
He starts off with
It is , of course , unimaginable that the penalties proposed by one of our most admired presidents for the crime of dividing America in the face of the enemy would be contemplated — let alone applied — today .
Still , as the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate engage in interminable debate about resolutions whose effects can only be to " damage morale and undermine the military " while emboldening our enemies , it is time to reflect on what constitutes inappropriate behavior in time of war .
Get that ?
Dully elected members of Congress can't say anything that Gaffney decides would constitute damaging morale and undermining the military .
If they do , it 's the noose for them .
Or maybe lethal injection .
One wonders whether holding oversight hearings on how contractors are overcharging the government and underserving the troops would count as " damaging morale " .
Think I 'm joking about the noose ?
Take a look at the very next line :
Scarcely anyone seems to consider the conduct of the Congress inappropriate , to say nothing of a hanging offense .
Gaffney then spends a lot of ink trying to convince readers that the prewar intelligence was n't really warped and skewed to promote the war .
That 's a rehash , reprinted in the context of the Inspector General report about Feith and his " inappropriate " activities .
He then calls Sen. Levin the Captain Ahab of the Senate , chasing the Great White Whale ( Dennis Hastert ? Rush Limbaugh ? ) of bad intelligence .
Let 's skip ahead toward the end of the column :
Doug Feith is an old friend of mine .
He is among the most thoughtful , careful and conscientious public servants I have ever known .
The only truly " inappropriate " behavior evident is the ongoing effort led by Sens.
Levin and Rockefeller to impugn the integrity , quality and , yes , the appropriateness of policymakers ' efforts to ensure that far - reaching national security decisions are made on the basis of the best information available .
The Journal has properly warned that Senator Ahab 's misbehavior is likely to have implications far beyond the immediate disservice it does to Mr. Feith and those who labored so ably under him .
It will likely also have a severely chilling effect on the willingness of policymakers rigorously to challenge , and thereby to improve , the quality of the intelligence they are getting about tomorrow 's threats .
If there 's one thing that really should be a hanging offense , it is behavior that results in our being even less equipped to deal with such threats than we were before this phase of the War for the Free World began on September 11 , 2001
So , let 's review .
Carl Levin thinks that the Inspector General report reflects badly , to put it mildly , upon the administration 's use and misuse of intelligence in support of policy goals .
For sane people , this is called " conducting oversight of the executive branch " , and it's one of the primary parts of the Senate 's job description .
But to Frank Gaffney , and others of his ilk , any criticism of the administration , as embodied by Douglas " stupidest f***** man on the planet " Feith , is proof positive of an intent to undermine the security of the country , and is quite literally a hanging offense .
Let me repeat the question at the top :
Why does Frank Gaffney hate America ?
( More from Glenn Greenwald , who of course says things better than I ever could )

200 Days Binary Newsgroup Retention at Giganews !
This news item is older than six months .
Information presented here may no longer reflect current Giganews services or offers .
Giganews has completed its third significant storage upgrade of the year which will increase binary retention day by day through the end of the summer to 200 days !
Giganews continues to hold text newsgroup articles indefinitely and as a result Giganews ' retention in text newsgroups is well over 1400 days .
This latest upgrade comes just two months after Giganews announced 120 day retention in binary groups and only four months after Giganews announced 100 day retention in binary newsgroups .
" This recent push to 200 days retention fits into our normal cycle of perpetual upgrades .
Traditionally we have n't increased retention by as large a margin as we are during this current upgrade ; however , we have decided to accelerate our upgrade cycle so that we can continue to lead Usenet and provide more value for our customers .
By nearly doubling our storage capacity Giganews is investing in our service so our customers can continue to enjoy the best Usenet experience possible . " said David Vogelpohl , Giganews ' Vice President of Marketing and Sales .
This retention upgrade follows closely after a series of additional security offerings , utility releases , and other value additions to the Giganews service .
Encrypted Usenet Access
In late 2006 , Giganews deployed 256 - Bit SSL Encrypted Usenet Access over port 563 , which was quickly expanded to offer support over port 443 .
256 - Bit SSL encryption allows Giganews customers to browse and download headers and articles in a private , secure , and anonymous environment with similar performance they would expect from an unsecured connection .
Encrypted Usenet access is included with all Diamond accounts and can be added as an upgrade to all other accounts .

Bush Administration falls behind in keeping track of US history John Byrne
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Nobody 's keeping track of US history in the Bush Administration -- at least not in the form required by law .
According to Secrecy News ' Steven Aftergood , this week marks the one year anniversary of the date when the US last published the latest print volume of the Foreign Relations of the United States ( FRUS ) series , " the official documentary record of U.S. foreign policy which dates back to the Abraham Lincoln Administration . "
That volume covered the " Organization and Management of U.S. Foreign Policy " from 1969 - 1972 .
The volume 's publication is required by law , not more than 30 years later than the historical events .
Aftergood asserts that the journal of US foreign policy has long lagged behind its 30 - year deadline , but the failure to print even a single volume " is extraordinary and unprecedented in living memory . "
In an email exchange with RAW STORY Thursday , he said he did n't believe it was fair to link the journal 's failure to publish with the Bush Administration .
" I dont believe there is any direct connection between the Bush White House and the failure to publish , " he wrote .
" Many if not all of the FRUS volumes in question are remote from any current foreign policy issue .
" But I think its fair to say that this is part of a larger pattern of Administration disdain for legal requirements to disclose government records , " he added .
As recently as June , the State Department promised 10 or 11 volumes would go to the presses this year .
Two electronic document collections were posted on the department 's website in September , but nothing in print .
The site cited an unnamed source , who explained " the situation has been complicated by staff turnover , ' indifferent management , ' and even a pending Inspector General complaint . "
" It is not quite as bad as you think , " the journal 's general editor Edward Keefer was quoted as saying .
" We have two print volumes ready to go .
The books are overdue from the printer , but we will try to release them before the end of the year . "
Dr. Keefer said he would provide a fuller response after the holidays .
Keeping up with history is n't the only thing bedeviling the State Department .
Following the reassignment of hundreds of foreign service officers to priority embassy positions in Afghanistan and Iraq , the director general of the US foreign service , Harry Thomas , last week instructed State Department officials to identify for elimination the " least critical " ten percent of diplomatic posts .
As reported by the Washington Post , however , Congress has not allocated the additional funding to staff vacancies which account for almost one quarter of diplomatic positions around the world .
Nasa 's space shuttle Atlantis is due to blast off from Kennedy Space Centre this evening on a mission to deliver Europe 's long - delayed science lab to the International Space Station .
Officials at the space agency gave the all - clear for a 4.31 pm ( 21.31 GMT ) liftoff from Cape Canaveral following emergency repairs to patch up gouges in the insulating foam that shrouds the shuttle 's 15 - storey main fuel tank .
The launch of the € 1bn ( £ 700 m ) Columbus laboratory will end an agonising wait for scientists and engineers , some of whom have dedicated more than 20 years to the project .
For several of those , the lab has languished in a warehouse in Germany , grounded by a string of funding cuts and accidents which severely set back its construction .
When the lab was conceived in the early 1980s , scientists expected it would be aloft and running by 1992 .
The shuttle is expected to reach the space station on Saturday for a 17,500 mph rendezvous 213 miles above the Earth .
On arrival , Commander Steve Frick will ease the shuttle into a gentle backflip , allowing cameras aboard the 200 - tonne station to scan heat - resistant tiles on the craft 's underbelly and wing edges for damage .
The safety checks were introduced after falling insulation struck the wing of another shuttle , Columbia , causing damage that led to the loss of the ship and her seven crew on re-entry in 2003 .
On Sunday , astronauts will spacewalk to the shuttle 's cargo hold to power up the science lab before it is swung into place by the station 's robotic arm .
" Excitement is very high .
A lot of engineers are looking forward to seeing their baby finally flying and operating , " said Dr Martin Zell , head of research operations at the European Space Agency .
Columbus is Europe 's cornerstone contribution to the $ 100bn ( £ 48 bn ) space station project and will double its capacity for scientific research .
Once it is in place , European Space Agency astronauts will be entitled to more seats on future flights to the space station , a change that is expected to shift the culture of a construction project that has so far been dominated by the US and Russia .
" The way it is managed will take on a European flavour because they will have more influence now , " said Tim Stevenson , chief engineer at the space research centre at Leicester University .
" When it 's the Russians and the Americans , the level of negotiation is almost zero - they 're constantly at each other 's throats . "
The seven - metre - long cylindrical laboratory carries five major science facilities , three within the lab and two attached to the outside .
In one , the BioLab , experiments will investigate conundrums such as how germinating plant seeds know which way is up , and whether gravity makes their roots curl .
Physiological tests will examine how the space environment affects the human body , information which will be crucial if astronauts are ever to attempt more ambitious forays into the solar system .
Those aboard will give blood samples before and after the flight to assess whether space radiation damages immune cells in their veins .
They will also be monitored for early signs of osteoporosis , a condition accelerated by spaceflight .
Further experiments will expose fungal spores and lichens to the icy vacuum of space to find out whether probes flung from Earth to other planets risk contaminating them with homegrown microbes .
Professor Steve Gabriel , head of astronautics at Southampton University , is one of a handful of British scientists with experiments aboard the new lab .
His research will expose materials to space radiation to see how they degrade over time , the results of which will influence how future spacecraft are built .
" It is my first piece of hardware to actually fly in space and that it will be launched on the space shuttle is particularly gratifying , " he said .
" I 'm really looking forward to when it 's switched on for the first time and we start to get some data back .
I just hope it works . "
After the mission - the 121st shuttle flight - Nasa will face an intense schedule to complete the assembly of the orbiting station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 .
Early next year , Kibo , a huge Japanese science lab , is due to be delivered to the space station , further expanding its capability for space - based research .
Dr Keith Cowing , a former Nasa engineer who worked on the space station before starting the Nasawatch website , said the addition of the European and Japanese labs would change the face of the space station and make it more than a mere destination for the space shuttle to fly to .
" It 's going to go from a lot of people floating around saying hi to each other to something far more serious , " he said .
Though drastically scaled down by a string of budget cuts , the space station was a crucial nursery slope for future space missions , such as the Bush administration 's much - publicised hopes for a moon base and a crewed voyage to Mars , said Cowing .
" You 've got to practise things first .
To say the purpose of the space station is to be fixed is to some extent true .
There 's a difference between sitting down here and thinking ' will this work in space ? ' versus being there and testing it out in real conditions .
" If you 're going to Mars , you 're going to need a big spaceship , it 'll be complex and it will need a lot of taking care of , " he said .
If we lacked experience of what could go wrong in Earth orbit , the consequences could be disastrous if something broke on the way to Mars , he added .
The mission is projected to last at least 11 days , and will be the first trip to space for Nasa astronaut Leland Melvin , a snowboarder and former wide - receiver for the Detroit Lions American football team .
Of those questioned , 89 % said they think people are still judged by their class - with almost half saying that it still counts for " a lot " .
Only 8 % think that class does not matter at all in shaping the way people are seen .
The poorest people in society are most aware of its impact , with 55 % of them saying class , not ability , greatly affects the way they are seen .
Gordon Brown claimed at this year 's Labour conference that " a class - free society is not a slogan but in Britain can become a reality " .
But even the supposedly meritocratic
Thatcher generation of adults born in the 1980s appear to doubt that : 90 % of 18 - 24 year - olds say people are judged by their class .
The poll also shows that after 10 years of Labour government , social change in Britain is almost static .
Despite the collapse of industrial employment , the working class is an unchanging majority .
In 1998 , when ICM last asked , 55 % of people considered themselves working class .
Now the figure stands at 53 % .
Of people born to working class parents , 77 % say they are working class too .
Only one fifth say they have become middle class .
Despite huge economic change and the government 's efforts to build what it calls an opportunity society , people who think of themselves as middle class are still in a minority .
In 1998 , 41 % of people thought of themselves as middle class , exactly the same proportion as today .
The upper class is almost extinct , with only 2 % of those who answered claiming to be part of it .
The poll paints a picture of a nation divided by social attitudes and life - chances , with 47 % of those living in south - east England considering themselves middle class , against 39 % in the north and 35 % in Wales and the west .
Northern England remains a working - class heartland , with 57 % of people describing themselves as part of it .
Scots - 47 % of whom think they are middle class - are just as class - bound as English citizens .
Almost half of Scots say that class plays an important part in the way people are judged by others .
Social change is taking place slowly .
The middle class has grown : although 41 % of people think they are part of it , only 32 % say their parents were .
In 1998 , 69 % of people thought their parents were working class .
Now only 63 % say so , and of those only 53 % say they are working class themselves .
That shift mirrors the attitude of the former deputy prime minister John Prescott , who admitted " I 'm pretty middle class " despite his working class origins .
But many class attitudes have survived economic change .
That suggests people are still judged by where they come from rather than how much they earn .

The Complete Unexpurgated AIPAC Tape
( Following is a transcript of the Oct. 22 , 1992 conversation with President David Steiner of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) recorded without his knowledge by New York businessman Haim ( Harry ) Katz .
Its existence was first revealed to the Washington Times and its release triggered Steiner 's resignation .
David Steiner : Haim .
Harry Katz : Hello , how are you ?
DS : Where are you located ?
HK : I 'm located in Queens , New York .
DS : Queens .. . Far Rockaway ?
HK : Belle Harbor .
DS : Belle Harbor .
I 'm trying to get this list together .
Would you ever get into the city ?
HK : Sure , I do .
Sure , you come frequently ?
DS : Well I come in from time to time .
I have an office there , at AIPAC in the city .
You know , I want you to understand . . . where did you get my name and phone number ?
HK : Oh , I , um , I called AIPAC .
. .
DS : Yeah .
HK : And ahh . . . I know you 're the president of AIPAC ...
DS : You should understand that , the political information that I gave you , those are personal choices . . .
HK : Sure , I understand .
DS : AIPAC does not rate or endorse candidates , does not solicit money .
. .
HK : Yeah , look .
DS : I want you to understand that the choices I would give you are personal choices .
HK : I understand .
DS : I wonder if before . . .
I want to get together with you next week .
HK : Next week would be fine .
DS : But in the meantime , I wonder if I can have one of my people get together with you and talk to you about it . . .
They 'll want to meet you and know who you are and all this .
I have a .. . maybe if I can have Seth Buchwald call you , my New York director .
HK : That would be terrific .
DS : And we have a guy out there , Joel Schnur .
And , are you orthodox ?
HK : Ah , yes .
DS : Okay , Joel is orthodox too .
I am not .
HK : You 're reform or ?
DS : I 'm reform .
HK : Okay , let me just say .
. .
DS : I was raised orthodox but I 'm reform .
HK : Okay , let me just tell you that , I 'll just hold you a minute .
I 'll be happy to meet with them , I know , I 've heard the names , I 'd be happy to meet with them , as a matter of fact I could , when I 'm in Manhattan ... Are you ever in Manhattan ?
DS : Sure , today I 'm going to be there , but I can't .
I 'm meeting with the ambassador .
HK : Okay , I 'll just ask you very very quickly .
You know , like , in New York , you know , this is your own personal opinion , like in New York we have Abrams against D'Amato .
DS : Well , let me tell you what my personal position is .
Okay ?
HK : Yeah .
DS : From a Jewish point of view , I believe in political loyalty .
HK : Right .
DS : And if someone has been good for Israel , no matter who , if my brother would run against them , I would support them because they 'd been good to Israel because that 's an important message to people .
HK : Right .
DS : What I 'm going to be doing for you .
. .
HK : Now D'Amato , has he been good for Israel ?
DS : You could n't have a better . . . listen I think Abrams would be good too , but that 's not the message .
HK : Yeah .
DS : Ah ...
HK : So the message , so the message is that ah ... I agree with you all the way , that if somebody 's been good for Israel , I 'll take D'Amato .
But you have no complaints with D'Amato ?
DS : I have no complaints with D'Amato .
HK : Uh huh , so and ah , you know , let me tell you , Abrams might be , might be too liberal .
I do n't know if Abrams supported , let 's say the ah , the war against Iraq .
DS : Yeah , I do n't know , and ah , I do n't know .
But all I know is if I have a guy who is there and he 's doing it , then I do n't want to change , you know ?
HK : Right .
Let me ask you this very quickly and then I will .
. .
DS : I 'm going to have Seth call you because in the meantime I 'm going to be preparing this list , what I 'm doing is , I 've asked my friends in the various campaigns , I 've made about 30 calls , what I 'm trying to put together who needs it the most , you know ?
Because you could dissipate a million dollars , but the point is to put it where it 's going to do the most , I know Bob Kasten , who 's been an outstanding friend and needs it I know .
. .
HK : Excuse my ignorance .
Bob Kasten is what state ?
DS : From Wisconsin . . .
HK : Okay , is he Jewish ?
DS : . . .
He 's for loan guarantees , he happens to be a Republican .
HK : Okay , and but , he 's good ?
He's . . .
DS : You could n't have better .
HK : Is Kasten , Kasten 's been very , very good and he 's in trouble ?
DS : He 's in big trouble .
Les Aspin , who 's the Chairman of the Military Appropriations , a Democrat also from Wisconsin is really [ unintelligible ] .
HK : You mean , Les Aspin is in trouble ?
DS : In big trouble .
HK : I can't believe it .
I mean , I do n't , I do n't follow . . .
DS : Well see , what happened was , you know ah , when you get to know me , I 'll put you on my list and I 'll be sending all these things .
A wealthy businessman decided to run , using all his own money .
Aspin , ' cause they sit on the finance committee for Aspin . . .
HK : Right .
DS : . .. programmed the last two weeks of , well the last month of the campaign , for TV .
This guy came in two months early and we did n't have the money budgeted , so we 're out scratching around to raise money for him .
So we , heck , I told him , I said that I 'd go , I 'll sign on the bank on a loan for you , you know , that 's how important it is .
HK : Unbelievable .
You know I read , I wo n't hold you long , but I 'd just tell you this .
. .
DS : That 's okay .
HK : . . . I 'll just tell you this , I read the New York Post , and I do n't even read the papers too much , I do n't follow politics . . . are you ready for this ?
DS : Yeah .
HK : Get ready for this .
I read in the papers this morning , I think it was the ( NY ) Post , Barbara Boxer , in California . . .
DS : Yeah .
HK : . .. do you know who she is ?
DS : I know who ...
HK : She 's originally from , ah. . .
New York I think . . .
DS : A friend of yours ?
HK : No , no , no .
She 's not a friend of mine , but she , ah , I think she 's in trouble .
DS : Yeah , that 's ah , in that race we 're okay either way , ' cause Bruce Herschensohn , who she 's running against , is Jewish , and he 's very strong on our issues .
HK : Okay , but Herschensohn .. .
DS : Herschensohn's a very conservative Republican .
HK : You know , he 's come out of nowhere .
He was like 30 points behind .. .
DS : Right .
HK : He 's come out of nowhere with it .
DS : Because the truth of the matter is , she did n't always vote for foreign aid .
We had a big meeting , I had a program in L.A .
I had all four senatorial candidates there , and he ripped her apart .
She has always voted against foreign and .
HK : What about the one , in ah , the one in .
. . um , what 's his name ?
I read it in the paper , it 's just a shocker , politics is a crazy game .
The black woman in Chicago . . .
DS : Carol Moseley Braun ?
HK : She was going to win by 50 points .
. .
DS : Oh it 's down , she took the money , it 's a big problem .
HK : It 's a big problem with her . . .
DS : And we have a problem with another good friend .
You know Daniel Inouye , from Hawaii he 's one of our best friends .
It was Kasten - Inouye on the loan guarantees , Kasten - Inouye and Leahy .. .
HK : I heard , I saw it on , I know Inouye 's in trouble because of , he sexually harassed his hairdresser .
. .
DS : We commissioned a poll and got some people , and I 've got to raise $ 27,000 to pay for the poll . . . so I have , so what I 'm trying to do is make a priority list , because I do n't know how far you want to go .
. . how old are your kids by the way ?
. . .
You had three children that could write checks , do they have their own checking accounts ?
HK : Yes .
DS : Oh , so that 's not going to be .
. .
HK : How old do they have to be ?
DS : They can't be one year old .
HK : I mean , could they be 18 , 17 ?
DS : Sure , no problem , so they could make , nobody 's going to bother you , but if you had infants , a four - year - old , let 's say , it 's not a contest .
HK : Let me tell you , I was planning , I was planning to , to . . .
Inouye , by the way , is in real trouble ?
He 's been there forever .
. .
DS : Yeah !
Well , we might lose him .
There 's been such a sea change , such trouble this year , I can't believe all our friends that are in trouble .
Because there 's an anti-incumbency mood , and foreign aid has not been popular .
You know what I got for , I met with [ U.S. Secretary of State ] Jim Baker and I cut a deal with him .
I got , besides the $ 3 billion , you know they 're looking for the Jewish votes , and I 'll tell him whatever he wants to hear .
. .
HK : Right .
DS : Besides the $ 10 billion in loan guarantees which was a fabulous thing , $ 3 billion in foreign , in military aid , and I got almost a billion dollars in other goodies that people do n't even know about .
HK : Such as ?
DS : $ 700 million in military draw - down , from equipment that the United States Army 's going to give to Israel ; $ 200 million the U.S. government is going to preposition materials in Israel , which Israel can draw upon ; put them in the global warning protection system ; so when if there 's a missile fired , they 'll get the same advanced notification that the U.S. , is notified , joint military exercises — I 've got a whole shopping list of things .
HK : So this is from Baker ?
DS : From Baker and from the Pentagon .
HK : So , not so , not .. .
DS : Why did he do it , you know , why did he do it ?
Last year I was a bum .
This year I said look Jim , we 're going to fight on the F - l5s .
Israel does n't want to fight , I said , but some people on it are going to come up on the floor of the Senate and the House and they 're going to fight .
If you 'll do this , I think I can hold them back .
But you 've got to do it right away .
They did n't want to fight .
I said , " You do n't want a fight before the election .
It 's going to hurt Bush .
We do n't want a fight before the election .
We do n't want to fight at all .
Why can't we work something out ? "
So we cut a deal .
You can't repeat this .
HK : You 're right .
But you met with Baker . . .
DS : Personally .
HK : Personally .
Because you know , he 's the one who cursed , who cursed the Jews .
DS : Of course , do you think I 'm ever going to forgive him for that ?
HK : Unbelievable .
I said ...
DS : Do you think I could ever forgive Bush for what he did September 12th a year ago ?
What he said about the Jews for lobbying in Washington ?
HK : Do you think that Baker has a legitimate concern for the Jews ?
From what I hear , do you think he 's anti-Semitic ?
DS : I would n't go so far as to say that .
He 's a pragmatic businessman , he 's a very tough lawyer .
He does whatever it takes .
HK : And that 's why .. .
DS : If we did n't have an election this year , you would get [ unintelligible ] from him .
HK : Let me ask you a quick question .
Just a quick question here .
You know Perot , you know , I 'm telling you this is scary .
I do n't know what you think of Perot , but if Perot had n't backed out , I watched the debates .
I thought Perot did marvelous in the debates .
DS : He does n't know how to govern .
He 's not going to make it .
And there was an incident where his daughter was going out with a Jewish professor at school and he said , " I would n't have my daughter marry a Jew . "
HK : So Perot , they say that if Perot had n't backed out in July , and if he would have gotten himself a good running mate , you know . . .
DS : He would n't win , but it would go to the House of Representatives .
The Democrats would win in the House of Representatives .
HK : So if it goes to the House , the Democrats would win for sure .
DS : For sure .
HK : Okay let me ask you , last question and then I 'll be happy to meet with your New York people .
. .
DS : You know , you sound like my kind of guy .
How old are you ?
HK : Forty - two .
DS : You 're a kid .
HK : I 'm not a kid , I 'm 42 . . .
DS : I 'm 63 , you 're a kid .
HK : I wish I was ...
DS : We 'll have to get you involved .
I like you , we have a lot to talk about , about real estate , you know , I have so many great activities going on at AIPAC , you ought to think about coming to some of these things .
I 'll have a dinner this fall .
I 'll have 18 - 20 senators there .
I run programs in Washington .
We just had a , I had at Ted Kennedy 's house last month kosher dinner .
I brought foremost caterers down .
I had 60 people on the couch for dinner .
Last year , I did it in Al Gore 's house .
HK : Right .
DS : Those are the things you should be getting involved in and knowing what 's going on .
. .
HK : Let me just ask you about Clinton .
I want to tell you , you may not believe this , but I think that if Perot . . .
DS : Yeah , he would 've given us a hard time .
What 's the name of your company , what do you do business as ?
HK : We do business as HK , Inc .
DS : HK , Inc . ?
HK : Right .
DS : Do you have a street address ?
HK : Sure .
621 Beach 129th Street , Belle Harbor , Queens , New York , 11694 .
DS : Yeah , because on my computer you only show a post office box .
This is your house ?
You work out of your house ?
HK : Yeah , out of an office in the house .
. .
Look , Mr. Steiner ...
DS : David .
My father 's Mr. Steiner .
HK : David , let me just ask you about Clinton .
Honestly , what do you feel about Clinton ?
DS : Well , I 've known Bill Clinton for seven eight years .
I think he 's got to be a lot better than George Bush .
. . we have a lot of people in there .
But he does n't need money , he really does n't need money .
I 'm a trustee of the Democratic National Committee .
We collected $ 63 million for him so far .
HK : Who 's collected $ 63 million ?
DS : The Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign have raised $ 63 million .
HK : So they 've already raised $ 63 million , so they do n't need money .
DS : No , we need money , like we got a guy , Byron Dorgan , in North Dakota , who 's going to be very good for us and we need money to make sure that he gets in .
We 've got people like that , because [ unintelligible ] , whatever you give them would be a tickle on the elephant 's behind .
But when you give $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 to Bob Kasten , that 's very meaningful .
HK : Let me ask you , I understand what you 're saying .
Clinton , when Clinton first started running a year ago , did he need money at that time ?
DS : Yes he did .
HK : I mean , did you help him out , ' cause that 's the time .
. .
DS : I personally am not allowed , as president of AIPAC , to get involved in the presidential campaign , because I have to deal with whoever wins .
You know , I 've got to go see Bush if he 's there , but I helped him , we raised over a million dollars for him in New Jersey .
HK : For Clinton ?
DS : For Clinton .
HK : And this was when , in the beginning ?
DS : In the beginning , yes .
After he won , before the convention .
HK : This is before the convention ?
DS : Oh sure .
HK : Okay , let me ask you , you know , T
DS : We 've also raised for other guys who are running too , because they 're friends .
Harkin , the senator , you know you have to be with everybody .
HK : Let me ask you , [ talks about getting cheated in business by Gentiles ] .
Let me ask you , Clinton , if he becomes , I mean what will he do for Israel , better than Bush , if he becomes , I know Bush gave you a hard time , this and that .
..
DS : I'II tell you , I have friends on the Clinton campaign , close associates .
Gore is very committed to us .
HK : Right .
Clinton if he , have you spoken to him ?
DS : I 've known Bill for seven , eight years from the National Governors Association .
I know him on a personal basis .
I have friends .
One of my friends is Hillary Clinton 's scheduler , one of my officer 's daughters works there .
We gave two employees from AIPAC leave of absences to work on the campaign .
I mean , we have a dozen people in that campaign , in the headquarters .
HK : You mean in Little Rock ?
DS : In Little Rock , and they 're all going to get big jobs .
We have friends .
I also work with a think tank , the Washington Institute .
I have Michael Mandelbaum and Martin Indyk being foreign policy advisers .
Steve Speigel — we've got friends — this is my business .
HK : I understand , David .
DS : It 's very complicated and the more you get into it , you 'll love it .
You sound like a smart guy .
HK : I 'm a smart guy , but I have a , maybe because I 'm more orthodox than you are , I 've had bad experiences with Gentiles .
Let me ask you , you know what " tachlis " means ?
DS : Yeah , sure .
HK : From a practical point of view , if Clinton wins the presidency , and I 'm sure he will , I hope so at least , what will be the benefits to Israel better than Bush ?
From a very practical point . . .
I mean , you just told me that Bush gave you everything you wanted .
. .
DS : Only , not everything , at the end , when we did n't want the F - 15s , that 's a terrible thing .
HK : Selling the F - 15s ?
If Clinton is elected . . .
DS : Let me tell you the problem with the $ 10 billion in loan guarantees , right ?
We only have the first year .
We have authorization from Congress , but it's at the discretion of the president every year thereafter , so if Bush is there , he could say , you know , use it as a club , you know .
' If you do n't give up Syria , I wo n't give you the money .
If you do n't give up the Golan Heights . '
It 's at the discretion of the president .
And that 's why we need a friendly president and we have Bill Clinton 's ear .
I talked to Bill Clinton .
HK : And Bill Clinton has made a commitment that if he 's elected . . . ?
DS : He 's going to be very good for us .
HK : And he 'll go ahead with the loan guarantees ?
DS : We did n't talk about that specifically , listen , I did n't ask him that , but I have full confidence that we 're going to have a much better situation .
He 's got Jewish friends .
A girl who worked for me at AIPAC stood up for them at their wedding .
Hillary lived with her .
I mean we have those relationships .
We have never had that with Bush .
Susan Thomases , who 's in there , worked with me on the Bradley campaign .
We worked together for 13 years .
She 's
In there with the family .
They stay with her when they come to New York .
One of my officers , Monte Friedkin , is one of the biggest fund - raisers for them .
I mean , I have people like that all over the country .
HK : So , I mean from a practical point of view . . .
DS : He 's going to be with us .
HK : I do n't say , this business , you say , Bush only went ahead with the loan guarantees for one year .
DS : We only have .
It 's mandatory they give us the $ 2 billion for one year .
After that it 's subject to the discretion of the president .
HK : You mean the other $ 8 billion ?
DS : That 's correct .
On an annualized basis .
HK : Also , I heard that .
. .
DS : They do n't have to give it to us .
HK : But if Clinton is elected . . .
DS : ... feel reasonably certain we 're gonna get It .
HK : He 's made that commitment ?
DS : Well , he said he 's going to help us .
He 's got something in his heart for the Jews , he has Jewish friends .
Bush has no Jewish friends .
HK : Right .
DS : Reagan had something . . . meshuga , but at least he had a commitment .
He knew Jews from the film industry , he was one of the best guys for us .
He had an emotional thing for the Jews .
Bush does n't have it .
That 's what it is really , if you have a feeling for our people , for what we believe in .
Bush is , there 's a man with no principles .
Absolutely no principles .
HK : I heard something about , but I never really understood it , with the scoring .
One of my friends told me there 's a difference in the scoring , but I do n't understand .
. .
DS : Scoring is like points that you pay .
HK : So let 's say , if Bush is elected on the loans . . .
DS : No , we 've got the scoring arranged , it 's four and a half percent .
It 's all done .
HK : That 's all done , even with Bush ?
DS : Even with Bush .
I 've got that worked out .
HK : So that 's all done .
DS : It 's in the bill .
It 's all passed .
He signed the bill .
It 's a matter of law .
HK : So it 's already four and a half percent ?
DS : We could 've had it less , but then we could n't .
. .
HK : And Clinton , if he was president , he would give ...?
DS : He could not change it , you can not change it .
HK : No , but I 'm saying , if he was president now , before the bill was signed , he would 've given you the four and a half percent .
. .
DS : I would 've gotten less .
HK : I 'm sorry ?
DS : I would 've gotten it cheaper .
HK : How much ?
Even two percent ?
DS : Yeah , we thought we were going to get two percent .
But Rabin gave it away .
HK : You mean Rabin did n't bargain as good as he could have ?
DS : That 's right .
HK : Unbelievable .
So , if Clinton is elected , that will be the best . ..
DS : I think that will be the best we could do .
HK : You know , I just want to tell you one last thing .
Do you have parents that come from Europe ?
DS : Yeah , of course , from Glolitzano , near Krakow . ,
HK : You 're kidding , your parents are from Krakow ?
DS : Near Krakow .
HK : Guess what ?
DS : You too ?
HK : My parents are from Krakow .
DS : Well , we 're not from Krakow , but from near Krakow .
My mother 's from Rudnick , my father from Gruns , near Tano .
Do you know where Tano is ?
HK : Yes .
Let me tell you .
. .
DS .. do n't have many left .
Everybody got
HK : Let me tell you .
The same with me .
Let me tell you , my parents were the only ones who came out .
Let me tell you , my .
. .
DS : You 're a Holocaust survivor ?
HK : Yeah , no , not me , my parents .
DS : That 's some experience , I 've got two cousins , I 've got one in Israel and one in France that came out of Mauthausen , I 'll tell you , and everybody else dead on my father 's side , in Russia .
I just brought six of them from Koshkent to Israel last year .
HK : Right .
Let me tell you that , you know what my father always says ?
My father was a rich man in Poland , and he says , he says , " Economic power is very good .
You have to have money , but if you just have economic power and you do n't have political power . . . "
DS : " You 've got nothing . "
HK : You 've got nothing .
DS : If we had AIPAC in the '30s and ' 40s , we would have saved millions of Jews .
We would have the political power .
But Jews were afraid to open their mouths .
They did n't know how .
HK : AIPAC started after WWII ?
DS : Oh , sure .
HK
And if you would have had AIPAC in the
DS : I feel we would 've saved a lot of Jews .
HK : And Franklin Roosevelt , he could 've done a lot better ?
DS : Sure , he could .
The Jews never opened their mouths .
They were afraid .
We 're not afraid .
They can curse me out , I do n't care if they hate me , just as long as I get what we need for our people .
HK : So if you had a little lamp , a wishing lamp and you could wish for either Bush , Clinton or Perot . . .
DS : Clinton .
HK : Clinton all the way ?
And in terms of Israel having political power , between the three candidates , the one who will give us the most political power ?
DS : Clinton is the best guy for us .
HK : He 's the best one .
DS : I hope you 're serious about what you told me .
HK : I am , I 'll tell you this [ tells a long anecdote about David Souter promising to oppose abortion as a nominee and then reversing himself on the Supreme Court ] .
So I wish we had a Jewish candidate for president .
DS : I do n't think the country 's ready .
HK : If the country was ready , is there any Jewish candidate ...?
DS : I would n't venture to say anything .
HK : You know who ?
I do n't know him , I 've never met him , Joe Lieberman .
DS : Oh , I 'm very friendly with Joe .
I 'm having dinner with him Monday night .
HK : Let me tell you , I think Joe Lieberman would have , uh , would have , if he was n't Jewish , that 's the only problem he has .
He 's highly respected .
DS : I 'd like to see him on the Supreme Court .
HK : If Clinton is elected , has he told you who he 's going to put on the Supreme Court ?
DS : We 're talking now .
We do n't have no commitments yet .
We 're just negotiating .
We 're more interested right now , in the secretary of state and the secretary of National Security Agency .
That 's more important to us .
HK : If Clinton is elected , who do you think will be secretary of state ?
DS : We do n't know yet , we 're negotiating .
HK : Who are you hoping for ?
DS : I 've got a list .
But I really can't go through it .
I 'm not allowed to talk about it .
HK : But you figure , God willing , if Clinton 's elected . . .
DS : We 'll have access .
HK : You 'll have access and you 'll have a good input into who 's secretary of state .
DS : I do believe so .
HK : And the other position is . . .
DS : National security adviser .
HK : Those are the two critical positions .
DS : Right .
HK : Gotcha .
Well , David , thanks for talking with me .
W : And we 're going to get together next week .
I hope you 'll have your checkbook ready .
HK : Will do .
DS : Okay , thanks .
HK : And let me ask you about the real estate .

In 2002 and 2003 , in making the case for a war with Iraq , the president and his team would frequently tell Americans that we could n’t wait for actual proof to justify an invasion , because the “ smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud . ”
In 2007 , in describing a possible confrontation with Iran , Bush has decided to be even less subtle .
The United States demanded Tuesday that Iran end any support for extremists in Iraq “ at once ” and raised the specter of a “ nuclear holocaust ” in the Middle East if Tehran gets atomic weapons .
US President George W. Bush branded the Islamic Republic “ the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism , ” citing its backing of Hamas , Hezbollah , Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Shiite fighters killing US troops in Iraq .
“ And Iran ’s active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust , ” he told the American Legion veterans group .
“ Iran ’s actions threaten the security of nations everywhere , and the United States is rallying friends and allies to isolate Iran ’s regime , to impose economic sanctions .
We will confront this danger before it is too late , ” he said .
It 's like deja vu all over again .

Hundreds of people have again gathered in Rangoon , despite three days of a government crackdown on pro-democracy protests .
The protesters have been surrounded by security forces and pro-military vigilante groups .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the international community to step up pressure on Burma and demanded that UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari should be allowed to meet democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been under house arrest for several years .
But it 's been reported that UN mission is facing failure because the country 's ruling generals have refused to allow a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi .
It 's also been claimed at least 200 protesters have died as Burma 's military rulers crush the prodemocracy protests .
The generals are continuing to defy the growing worldwide outcry over their ruthless crackdown .
There were also unconfirmed reports that troops had opened fire on students gathered outside a school in Rangoon , killing many of them .
Scroll down for more ...
The sound of gunfire could be heard across the city as columns of soldiers broke up protests , firing teargas and wielding clubs against campaigners .
Authorities admitted there had been ten deaths in the last three days .
But the U.S. - based Campaign For Burma group put the figure at at least 200 with scores more seized and beaten .
It is believed many arrested monks have been taken to Insen Prison , renowned for its torture of political prisoners .
Inmates are said to be given a combination of water and lead to make them too lethargic to protest about their appalling conditions .
There are also rumours the military is preparing to parade the bodies of dead marchers in the streets or on television as a warning to the demonstrators .
Scroll down for more ...
The authorities also moved to cut Burma off from the outside world by blocking access to the internet and mobile phone networks so campaigners could not transmit blogs or images of the violence .
As Burma 's Asian neighbours spoke of their " revulsion " at the military regime 's actions , Gordon Brown held a video conference with George Bush to discuss the crisis .
The White House condemned the crackdown as " barbaric " .
Mr Brown said he feared the number of deaths in the crackdown was " far greater " than had been reported .
He called on the international community to step up pressure on Burma and demanded that UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari should be allowed to meet democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been under house arrest for several years .

He also called for EU sanctions to be applied as soon as possible .
He said : " The eyes of the world are not only upon the military junta but the anger of the world is now being expressed .
" We will now step up our efforts in the international community .
. . to make sure the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people for reconciliation in their country is impressed on the minds of everybody in the world . "
In Burma , the prevailing mood was one of fear and terror - mingled with shock and disgust that soldiers could attack monks revered for their peace - loving way of life .
In the north Burmese town of Myawadda haunted faces stared out from shop doorways and small groups of frightened women carried armloads of emergency supplies as fear spread that troops might be heading to the area .
Satellite images revealed last night that villages have been burned down , residents forced to new locations and troops have been moved in to at least 25 areas across eastern Burma , towards the Thai border .
One anti-government crusader in Myawadda admitted he was one of " many scores " of protesters who had planned the uprisings across the country .
He said : " If you think we are losing , if you think the protests against this government will end because of the violence brought down upon us by the troops , you should think again . "
Meanwhile , satellite images showed that 18 villages have vanished from the face of the map .
The American Association for the Advancement of Science revealed yesterday that high - resolution photos taken from space identified burn scars on the ground - " square shaped burn scars the size of houses " said association researcher Lars Bromley .

Analysis Blade servers , virtualization software and fancy accelerators might be all the rage in the server business , but Google does n't want any part of the hype .
Google will continue crafting its own low - cost , relatively low - performing boxes to support its software - over - the - wire plans .
The ad broker looks to focus on lowering energy costs , improving its parallelized code and boosting component life spans rather than messing with things such as VMware and GPGPUs ( general purpose GPUs ) .
So , those of you buying into the software as a service idea might want to have a think about Google 's contrarian approach when the likes of HP , IBM , Sun Microsystems and Dell come hawking their latest and greatest kit .
Okay , sure , basing your data center designs on Google 's whims might not be the most practical course of action .
Google builds new data centers at an astonishing pace and works on a scale seen by only the largest service providers .
" Our applications do n't run on anything smaller than a data warehouse , " said Google engineer Luiz André Barroso , while speaking last week at the Usenix event in Santa Clara , California .
By data warehouse , Barroso means a facility with software spread across thousands of systems .
Google has announced at least four such $ 600 m systems in the last few months just in the US .
This type of scale has Google working on software problems , energy issues and component conundrums beyond the realm of conception for most companies .
For that reason , Google has largely bypassed the Tier 1 server and software vendors ' pitches .
For example , Barroso noted that he " loves " the people at VMware but does n't plan to use their software .
" I think it will be very sad if we need to use virtualization , " he said .
" It is hard to claim we will never use it , but we do n't really use it today . "
Instead , Google relies on maintaining tight control over its entire software infrastructure from the OS level on up to the applications and management packages .
It 's constantly fine - tuning these systems to create a data warehouse that almost asks as a single , massive virtualized system .
And rather than waiting for ISVs to write multi- threaded code for dual - and quad - core chips out there , Google has decided to do much of the work on its own .
" We might be one of the few companies on the planet that throws software away and writes it from scratch , " Barroso said .
Along those lines , Google recently acquired PeakStream - a start - up dedicated to improving the performance of software written in a single - threaded model on multi-core processors such as GPGPUs .
Google sidestepped right past the GPGPU technology to have the PeakStream crew focus instead on improving Google 's existing code .
" Our problems do n't fit ( GPGPUs ) today , " Barroso said .
Google is ready and willing to spend any amount of money to wring the last bit of extra performance out of its data centers .
This attitude comes from a company struggling to keep AdWords , Gmail and YouTube powered .
It also seems to come from a company that has hopes of sending even more software - say a client OS and all the accompanying applications - over the wire in the future , as far as we can tell .
Few , if any , vendors will be willing to match Google dollar for dollar in this race .
Although , according to Barroso , Google 's current experiments could end up as standard computing models .
A PC in ten years " might have similar problems as a warehouse computer does today , " Barroso said , noting the silicon makers ' push to create processors with tens and even hundreds of cores .
In addition , Google 's current battles with power consumption might lead to a new model for selling servers .
Normally when I go to a store where everything costs one dollar , the only mystery I ’m prepared for is how coarse and unpleasant toilet paper can be .
A recent trip to a nearby Dollar Tree offered a more pronounced mystery in the form of so - called grab bags , which were strewn about a rack that taunted , “ We know you just love surprises ! ”
Families who shop at the Dollar Tree are known for their love of surprises , such as the surprise that they only have twenty - eight dollars per week to spend on groceries , or the surprise that Christmas is being canceled due to mother 's crystal meth addiction .
These grab bags merge poor people ’s penchant for surprise with their complete lack of taste .
The grab bags were divided into three categories : blue ( “ a surprise for a boy ” ) , pink ( “ a surprise for a girl ” ) , and green ( I have no idea in hell what kind of bag this is ) .
I decided to compose a comparative analysis of these grab bags by purchasing one of each type and sharing my findings , even though I knew full well that opening three mystery bags in succession might give me a heart attack , or that the contents of my new bags could compel me to commit suicide .
But at a total cost of $ 3 , I really could n’t complain about the fine value .
A Surprise For a Boy CONTENTS :
1 Green slinky
4 Decks of cards
It is an exciting day to be a boy .
It is true that everyone loves a slinky , but only a boy can appreciate the nuance of using the slinky as a kind of tube prison for his G.I.
Joes , or whipping the slinky around at his friend .
My earth science teacher in middle school used a slinky to demonstrate the P - waves and S - waves of an earthquake ; no thanks , Mr. Strempek — I demonstrated how to drop an F - bomb and got the hell out of that class .
Slinkys are n't for learning , they 're for slinking .
This particular slinky , unfortunately , is particularly shoddy .
My G.I . Joes escaped after about a minute .
When you ’re finished with your slinky , it is time to play with your four decks of cards .
I do n’t know any card game that requires four separate decks — or for that matter any card game in which gambling or alcohol is n’t prominently involved .
Now is a good time for a boy to learn about these activities as he struggles with the fact that his mom allowed the employees of the Dollar Tree to select his birthday gifts this year .
A Surprise For a Girl CONTENTS :
3 Empty pink bottles
1 Empty pink container
1 Pink loofah
1 Mirror
2 Packages of facial tissue Instead of printing that pink “ grab bag ” motif across this bag , perhaps they should have just called it a “ garbage bag ” and saved me the trouble of opening it up .
Included are a bunch of empty plastic containers , some tissues , and a loofah , which is girl for “ spongy body wash applicator . ”
Yes , fellows , you can fling the loofah at a group of G.I.
Joes and pretend that it ’s some sort of missile , but after some preliminary research I ’ve concluded that this provides no more than a scant few hours of entertainment .
The only other application for you males would be to hang it up in your shower and pretend that you have a girlfriend .
If you ’ve purchased the pink grab bag , though , you ’re probably a girl , in which case you could always use another loofah .
Maybe a new loofah is what you need to actually become pretty .
The empty plastic containers I ’m not so sure about .
You could put shampoo in them , I suppose , but why are you buying shampoo that does n’t already come in its own bottle ?
Maybe the plastic bottles are to teach girls how to recycle , since that ’s the only humane thing to do with their new grab bag toys .
The mirror is useful for reflecting that priceless look of disappointment as girls open up their bag .
I hope you girls enjoy blowing your nose while imagining what it would be like to own hotel shampoo — I ’ve got to go play four simultaneous games of High Low Ohama Poker with my new good luck charm , Mr. Green Slinky .
Green Bag
This grab bag is such a badass mystery , it does n’t even clue you in as to which gender it ’s for .
That ’s probably why the grab bag rack was about 90 % green bags — nobody knows who 's supposed to buy them .
I think they made the bag green so that stoners are tricked into thinking there might be some marijuana in one of them .
They'd be disappointed — as would anybody hoping to find anything the least bit practical .
CONTENTS :
1 Pair of underwear
4 Decks of playing cards
Now is a good time to mention that four plus four equals eight , which means that this article has caused me to own no fewer than eight decks of cards .
If you assembled these decks together to play a game of war , it would actually take longer to complete than the war in Iraq .
I challenge anybody reading this to the most epic game of war of all time , the winner getting the blue underwear .
In the meantime I ’m going to try to get a bank to give me a loan so that I can use the playing cards to open up The Green Slinky Casino .
The underwear is baffling .
You would think that the gender - neutral bag would be the least eligible place to include underwear , since you kind of have to know what gender you are before you buy something to wear around your junk .
But I have to admit : this underwear design does n’t seem to exclude either boys or girls .
It ’s cut sort of like a pair of men ’s briefs , but it has the luxurious sheen and delicate softness of a pair of panties .
The only thing I can say for sure about this underwear is that it fits me wonderfully , and you really can't put a price on that .
Oh wait , yes you can : one dollar .
It is time to put on my new underwear and roll around in all my terrific prizes .
Newsweek 's Oct. 15 , 2007 issue :
The colonel was furious .
" Can you believe it ?
They actually drew their weapons on U.S. soldiers . "
He was describing a 2006 car accident , in which an SUV full of Blackwater operatives had crashed into a U.S. Army Humvee on a street in Baghdad 's Green Zone .
The colonel , who was involved in a follow - up investigation and spoke on the condition he not be named , said the Blackwater guards disarmed the U.S.
Army soldiers and made them lie on the ground at gunpoint until they could disentangle the SUV .
His account was confirmed by the head of another private security company .
Asked to address this and other allegations in this story , Blackwater spokesperson Anne Tyrrell said , " This type of gossip has led to many soap operas in the press . "
Read more ...
As if being trapped in the middle of a bloody civil war by their civilian leadership has n't been humiliating enough for our troops , we find out they also have to protect themselves from high - paid thugs from Blackwater -- in the Green Zone , no less .
I wonder if Crayzie Shayzie will still hold the same unbridled passion for these guys after learning of this hackery ?
Oh , and Mr. Romney you STILL have Blackwater 's Vice Chairman on your campaign payroll -- how 's that working out for you ?
A team of researchers from North Carolina State University , the University of Michigan and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have constructed a low - energy positron beam at NC State ’s PULSTAR nuclear reactor with the highest positron rate of any such facility worldwide .
Positrons , the antiparticle of electrons , are generated using the intense radiation in the vicinity of the reactor core .
Dr. Ayman Hawari , associate professor of nuclear engineering and director of the Nuclear Reactor Program at NC State , reports that the measurements of the beam rate are 5-6x108 positrons per second .
“ These numbers are two orders of magnitude higher than those available using regular lab sources and exceed intensities currently reported by other international facilities , ” says Hawari .
Once the stuff of science fiction , these anti-matter , or positron , beams have a multitude of uses in nanoscience and materials engineering because of the positron ’s ability to gravitate toward and trap in defects or pores in a material at sizes as small as a single atom .
Positrons are used to detect damage from radiation in nuclear reactors and are impacting the emerging field of nanoengineered materials where nanometer - sized voids control properties such as dielectric constant in microelectronic devices and hydrogen storage in fuel cells .
An intense positron beam means that researchers will have better measurements of a material ’s porosity , especially in high - tech thin film applications where traditional techniques falter .
This beam will be used in Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectrometry ( PALS ) and Doppler Broadening Spectrometry ( DBS ) .
Hawari also believes that other positron analysis techniques will become possible .
While the spectrometers are not yet built , they are on the books for completion next year .
NC State has a pioneering history in the field of Nuclear Engineering .
Its first nuclear reactor , which began operation in 1953 , was the first public research nuclear reactor ever constructed .
The PULSTAR Nuclear Reactor , in operation since 1972 , is a 1 - MW pool - type research reactor using 4 % enriched , pin -type fuel of uranium dioxide with a zircaloy cladding .
These characteristics make it similar to some commercial reactors and make it possible for an array of research and teaching opportunities .
In 2002 the PULSTAR reactor program received U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) funding from the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education ( INIE ) program .
NC State led the Multi- University South East INIE Consortium ( MUSIC ) and used that funding to start several projects , including the Intense Positron Beam collaboration with Michigan and Oak Ridge .

Veteran investor calls Bernanke `a nut ' over rate cuts
BLOOMBERG
US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is " a nut " and interest - rate cuts by the central bank are harming the US economy by fueling inflation , investor Jim Rogers said .
" Bernanke loves printing money , " Rogers said in an interview in New York .
" This man is a nut .
The dollar is collapsing , commodities are going through the roof , which means inflation 's going through the roof .
These people are leading us to terrible problems down the line . "
Rogers , the 65 - year - old chairman of Beeland Interests Inc , also said he was selling short shares of Citigroup Inc , the biggest US bank , and Fannie Mae , the largest provider of money for US home loans .
Investors should buy commodities and the Chinese currency , Rogers said .
The Fed this week cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 4.5 percent .
Policymakers have now lowered their target rate for overnight loans between banks by 0.75 percentage points in six weeks , the most aggressive easing since the economy was emerging from its last recession in 2001 .
Although they look normal , people suffering from body dysmorphic disorder ( BDD ) perceive themselves as ugly and disfigured .
New imaging research reveals that the brains of people with BDD look normal , but function abnormally when processing visual details .
Reported in the December edition of the Archives of General Psychiatry , the UCLA findings are the first to demonstrate a biological reason for patients ’ distorted body image .
“ Our discovery suggests that the BDD brain ’s hardware is fine , but there ’s a glitch in the operating software that prevents patients from seeing themselves as others do , ” explained Dr. Jamie Feusner , principal investigator and assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA ’s Semel Institute .
“ Now that we ’ve identified a possible physical cause , down the road we may be able to pinpoint ways that patients ’ brains can be retrained to perceive faces more accurately . ”
Individuals with BDD fixate on an imagined flaw in appearance or a slight physical abnormality .
To fix their “ problem , ” they tend to pursue plastic surgery -- sometimes repeatedly .
They often feel ashamed , depressed and anxious , increasing their risk of suicide .
Affecting an estimated two percent of the population , BDD tends to run in families and is especially common in persons with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
Thirty percent of people with BDD suffer from eating disorders , which are also linked to a distorted self - image .
Feusner was curious whether BDD patients ’ brains interfered with the interpretation of visual input , and if so , whether this glitch occurred when looking at faces other than their own .
“ We hoped that asking patients to focus on others ’ faces would allow them to be less emotionally engaged during the experiment , ” he said .
For the first time , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) was used to reveal how the patients ’ brains processed visual input .
The UCLA team outfitted 12 BDD patients with special goggles that enabled them to view digital photos of various faces as they underwent a brain scan .
Each volunteer viewed three types of images .
The first type was an untouched photo .
The second type was a photo altered to eliminate facial details that appear frequently , such as freckles , wrinkles and scars .
This “ low frequency ” technique blurred the final image .
The third type of image essentially subtracted the blurred second image from the untouched photo .
This “ high frequency ” technique resulted in a finely detailed line drawing .
Feusner ’s team compared the BDD patients ’ responses to 12 control subjects matched by age , gender , education and handedness .
What the scientists observed surprised them .
“ We saw a clear difference in how the right and left sides of the brain worked in people with BDD versus those without the disorder , ” noted Feusner .
BDD patients more often used their brain ’s left side -- the analytic side attuned to complex detail -- even when processing the less intricate , low - frequency images .
In contrast , the left sides of the control subjects ’ brains activated only to interpret the more detailed high - frequency information .
Their brains processed the untouched and low - frequency images on the right side , which is geared toward seeing things in their entirety .
“ We do n’t know why BDD patients analyze all faces as if they are high frequency , ” said Feusner .
“ The findings suggest that BDD brains are programmed to extract details -- or fill them in where they do n’t exist .
It ’s possible they are thinking of their own face even when they are looking at others . ”
Feusner also recently discovered that the more severe the BDD patient ’s symptoms , the more strongly the brain ’s left side activates during visual processing .
He is currently studying how BDD patients process their own faces in order to explore how emotional arousal may influence visual processing .
“ All of these findings indicate that BDD has a biological link and can no longer be attributed solely to our society ’s focus on appearance , ” he concluded .

A post in The Medium that appeared on Monday about the Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and his purported adoption by white supremacist and neo -Nazi groups contained several errors .
Stormfront , which describes itself as a “ white nationalist ” Internet community , did not give money to Ron Paul ’s presidential campaign ; according to Jesse Benton , a spokesman for Paul ’s campaign , it was Don Black , the founder of Stormfront , who donated $ 500 to Paul .
The original post also repeated a string of assertions by Bill White , the commander of the American National Socialist Workers Party , including the allegation that Paul meets regularly “ with members of the Stormfront set , American Renaissance , the Institute for Historic Review and others ” at a restaurant in Arlington , Va .
Paul never attended these dinners , according to Benton , who also says that Paul has never knowingly met Bill White .
Norman Singleton , a congressional aide in Paul ’s office , says that he met Bill White at a dinner gathering of conservatives several years ago , after which Singleton expressed his indignation at the views espoused by White to the organizer of the dinner .
The original post should not have been published with these unverified assertions and without any response from Paul .

Happy Binary Anniversary !
Happy Binaversary !
Happy Binaversary !
Do you ever feel your birthdays are coming around too often ?
That 's because you are thinking linear , dude .
Time to get with the logarithms .
Most people count their age in years , an archaic unit of time based on how often a certain lump of rock swings around a certain ball of gas .
Those people are ( no offense ) idiots .
As they get older , they scratch their heads , wondering why the years seem to be blurring together , going by faster and faster .
It never occurs to them that maybe lumps of rock and balls of gas are not the ultimate authorities on human aging .
That 's where binaversaries come in .
Binaversaries are celebrations based on your age in byears .
Byears , or binary years , scale with your age .
When you are young , the byears pass quickly .
But when you 're older , the byears show mercy and slow down .
For example when you 're 32 years old , you 've just turned 5 byears .
This saves a lot on candles .
Here 's a conversion chart :
age in years : age in byears :
This makes life a lot more systematic .
Byear 0 , we are born and start crawling around .
Byear 1 , we walk and talk .
Byear 2 , we go to kid school .
Byear 3 , we go to high school .
Byear 4 , we find a likely mate and settle down ( possibly several times ) .
Byear 5 , we raise a family and work to retirement .
Byear 6 , we die .
Done !
Binaversaries are celebrated at years 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , and ( almost certainly not ) 128 .
These are byears 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 respectively .
You can celebrate fractional binaversaries each regular year if you really want to , but the math is a little fiddly , and you 'll know in the back of your mind that they do n't really " count " .
Nice properties of binaversaries and byears ?
For people growing old together , their ages in byears quickly converge - matching the intuition that differences in ages matter less as you get older .
The ages of infants younger than one year ( before byear 0 ) are represented with exploding precision , which appropriately reflects their rate of development .
For example , byear - 1 corresponds to being six months old , byear - 2 corresponds to being 3 months old , etc .
If you are unlucky and die a byear or two earlier , the difference does n't seem as drastic !

UC Berkeley protester says he broke wrist , ankle in fall from tree BERKELEY
One of the tree - sitting protesters in a grove of oaks next to UC Berkeley 's Memorial Stadium was in the hospital Monday after taking a bone - breaking fall .
Nathaniel Hill , who fell at least 30 feet on Sunday night , was in stable condition at Highland Hospital in Oakland , a nursing supervisor at the hospital said .
" It 's just kind of a fluke that it happened , " the 24 - year - old Hill said in a phone interview from his hospital bed Monday afternoon .
He said he broke his wrist and ankle , both of which are in casts .
His father , who had come from New York to see his son , was waiting outside a double line of fences erected by the campus around the protest site when Hill fell shortly before 8:30 p.m. , the younger Hill said .
Hill estimated he was between 30 and 40 feet in the air when he fell from a rope he mistakenly thought his harness was attached to .
Protesters have been illegally occupying a grove of oak trees next to the stadium since December .
They seek to block construction of a $ 117 million athletic training center for Cal football players and other athletes .
A judge is expected to rule as early as this week on three lawsuits seeking to block construction of the center .
Hill said he 's been in the trees intermittently since the beginning of the protest .
When he fell , inside the fenced area , he had been trying to reach a traverse line running from a tree inside the fenced area to a tree outside the fenced area , he said .
UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said Hill was attended by Berkeley Fire Department paramedics before being taken to the hospital Sunday night .
" It 's a really regrettable accident but , to state the obvious , completely avoidable , " Mogulof said .
" Things like that would n't happen if the people who are illegally occupying university property were abiding by the law . "
Hill said that if UC had n't put fences around the site , then there would have been no need for the traverse line that he'd been trying to reach .
The number of protesters occupying the trees has varied between about two and a dozen for the past several months , Mogulof said .
Hill said he asked to be taken to Highland Hospital because that 's where he was born , although he was raised in Buffalo , N.Y .
He said he came back to the Bay Area to participate in the tree protest .
" I really felt a calling to be back in the place where I was born , " he said , stressing that he was stirred by the threat to the trees , which would be cut down for the athletic center .
" Initially , the trees called to me , " he said , adding that after arriving his motives broadened to include other issues such as protection of Native American burial grounds , which the protesters say are at the site .
The grandmother has agreed not to bring the children sweets
The grandmother , known as EM , launched a legal battle against her own daughter over access to the four children .
Perth Sheriff Court was told EM would often bring two carrier bags of sweets with her on visits .
Sheriff Daniel Kelly QC granted the grandmother one visit a month on the condition she did not give them sweets .
The grandmother took her daughter to court after contact with the four children was cut off in March 2006 .
The daughter , known as DR , believed her mother had called in the SSPCA to visit her home in Perth because of concerns over her two dogs .
DR told the court that it was " the final straw " and came on top of concerns she had about her mother 's domineering nature and the amount of confectionery she lavished on the children .
I accept that the pursuer did give the children excessive sweets
Sheriff Daniel Kelly
The court was told the two oldest children had suffered dental problems and had to have teeth removed .
Sheriff Kelly said : " She said the SSPCA visit was not the reason for stopping contact , but was ' the final straw ' .
" Other reasons which she advanced related to her considering that the pursuer gave the children too many sweets and fizzy drinks , was domineering and interfering .
" She said that the pursuer would often bring two carrier bags of sweets .
She said she had asked her not to bring them . "
The sheriff said it was not possible to ascertain whether the dental problems were solely because of the sweets provided by the grandmother .
' Best interests '
" I accept that the pursuer did give the children excessive sweets , " he said .
" The dental health of the children is undoubtedly important , but I regard it as significant that the pursuer has given an undertaking not to give them sweets during contact .
" I am fully satisfied it would be in the children 's best interests to continue to see their grandmother . "
He ruled that initially the grandmother should be allowed to see her grandchildren for two hours once a month .
He adopted EM 's undertaking not to give the children sweets during contact - and said he would rely on the children confessing if the rule was broken .
It 's my first time sleeping on a lofted bed , and every time I walk in my room I see the bare bones of a potential fort .
I am already on a waiting list to get a slide that will attach at the ledge and extend to the floor , and my roommate has kindly agreed to drill a hole in the wall separating our bedrooms in order to thread a string for our tin-can phones .
So now I 'm on to details .
I never had a fort as a kid , and our neighborhood was equally bereft of tree houses .
What do you remember about those spaces that you especially liked , and what can I do to recreate that in a tiny Brooklyn apartment ?
Any insights or details you can think of to make this feel authentic , or just look awesome ?
Unfortunately , I do n't have a way to upload any pictures of my bedroom , but my loft is twin - sized and under a relatively high ceiling .
Help me turn my bedroom into a sweet fort .
Dec. 13 , 2007  -- " Dear God , no ! "
It was the first , anguished thought that sprung to the mind of the mother of the Omaha mall sniper Robert Hawkins when she realized her son was the killer .
" Dear God , no ! , '' Maribel Rodriguez repeated Thursday morning in an exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer on " Good Morning America "
" No , not him , '' she said , carefully framing her thoughts at that moment .
" He is NOT doing this ! '' she said emphatically , then sighed deeply .
Rodriguez said her son's life had been a challenge from the start .
She divorced Hawkins ' father when the boy was 3 - years - old , she said , and by 5 he was taking prescription Ritalin and Zoloft .
She said she watched , feeling helpless the way a parent can , as raw anger took root inside her son .
First there were fights at school , she said .
Then he was caught smoking cigarettes .
Then marijuana .
He became a ward of the state in 2002 after apparently threatening his stepmother .
He was moved through facilities and foster homes for several years , until he was released in 2005 .
Two weeks before the shooting rampage , Hawkins parted ways with his girlfriend .
Rodriguez said she sympathizes deeply with the families of her son's victims .
" I 'm not a dictator , so I can't tell you what to think , '' Rodriguez said on ' Good Morning America ' Thursday .
" But as his mother I loved him , deeply and without end .
If you want to hate Rob , hate Rob , '' she continued .
" You do n't need that type of pain .
It destroys your soul . "
She said she , too , feels the enormity of the tragedy .
" It 's massive , '' she told Sawyer , her eyes widening .
" It 's massive .
It 's turmoil .
It 's confusion .
It 's…absolute devastation . "
Hawkins killed eight people before turning a gun on himself and committing suicide .
Two more of the funerals for his victims were conducted Tuesday .
" There were nine worlds shattered , " the Rev. Donald Shane told mourners at St. Robert Bellarmine Catholic Church during a service for victim Angie Schuster , according to the Associated Press .
" The worlds of Beverly Flynn .
And Janet Jorgensen .
And Gary Joy .
And John McDonald , my classmate .
And Gary Scharf .
And Dianne Clavin Trent .

Tactics in Suburban Policing
STRIPPED OF THEIR RIGHTS
Pennsylvania Jails Have Been Strip - Searching Thousands of People Detained on Minor Charges , Often Without Legal Justification .
It Could Cost Taxpayers Millions .
Second of Three Parts
Tameka
Flythe was arrested by Darby police as she walked home from a pickup basketball game in Philadelphia .
Strip - searched on an officer 's suspicion that she might have drugs , she was released without any charges being filed .
No drugs were found .
" It was almost like being raped , " she said .
In Harrisburg , Devon Sheppard , a biophysicist at Johns Hopkins University , was arrested for attending an outdoor party that did n't have a city permit .
She was jailed and given a body - cavity search when she could n't come up with bail money , $ 1,051 in cash .
" I 'm sure there are places where this happens regularly , " Sheppard said .
" I just did n't think the United States was one of them . "
And in Philadelphia , former schoolteacher George L. Byrd was arrested when he was on his way home from a party for his niece and charged with drunken driving .
Unable to post the $ 2,500 bail , he was taken to a Philadelphia prison and stripped .
Afterward , he said , he went to an empty prison cell , and " I stayed there and cried . "
Sheppard , Byrd and Flythe are among thousands of people arrested on minor charges and strip - searched in Pennsylvania , though federal courts across the country have repeatedly ruled that such practices are unconstitutional .
New Jersey 's attorney general restricts strip searches by local police .
New York long ago did the same for county jails .
But Pennsylvania sets no such rules .
The state 's silence has produced wild disparities from town to town and county to county .
Citizens who are n't accused of any serious crimes are being forced to remove their clothing and submit to invasive searches courts have described as " demeaning , " " dehumanizing " and " repulsive . "
" In a nutshell , blanket strip searches are prohibited , " said Robert Herbst , a former federal prosecutor in Philadelphia who now works as a civil - rights lawyer in New York .
In Pennsylvania , No Rules
Strip searches are strictly controlled in numerous other states , but not in Pennsylvania .
An investigation by The Inquirer has found that questionable strip searches have taken place routinely in some Pennsylvania police lockups and county jails , using policies that appear to fall short of long - established federal court standards .
Courts permit strip searches to keep jails safe from drugs and weapons - so long as they meet legal guidelines .
Until October , though , Philadelphia 's prisons were strip - searching all new inmates , more than 30,000 every year - even people arrested on charges as minor as disorderly conduct .
After a civil - rights lawsuit , the city adopted stricter regulations .
The Delaware County jail , now run by a private firm , strip - searches thousands of inmates annually , regardless of charge , according to three current and former guards .
County officials would not talk about the strip searches ; neither would executives from the company , the Geo Group of Boca Raton , Fla .
The Inquirer found similar practices in some police departments .
Darby , Chester and Erie police routinely strip - searched people detained in their lockups on minor offenses such as disorderly conduct or public drunkenness , records and interviews show .
And the Pottstown police chief , Mark Flanders , said blanket strip searches were still the rule in his jail .
To be sure , there are model towns in Southeastern Pennsylvania .
Swarthmore 's nine - member department recently adopted a written policy forbidding strip - searching " unless there is probable cause to believe the individual is concealing a weapon , " drugs or other contraband .
It also requires officers to report any strip search .
Police Chief Brian H. Craig said there had never been a strip search in his jail , as far as he knew .
It 's difficult to determine the full extent of the problematic strip searches .
In many Pennsylvania towns , police have no written policies on strip searches and keep no records on them , according to a national Justice Department survey .
These strip searches are another legally suspect law - enforcement practice uncovered during a yearlong Inquirer examination of policing in the suburbs .
This examination also found that some small cities across Pennsylvania - including Darby , Pottstown and Erie - aggressively used nuisance laws to clear the streets and curtail drug dealing .
The arrests stemming from those laws - and the strip searches that often result - hit blacks at rates far above their numbers in the population , an analysis shows .
The typical subject of a questionable strip search is " the African American teenage male brought in on loitering " charges , said attorney Charles J. LaDuca , one of the lawyers suing Philadelphia .
Lawyers for both sides are discussing a possible settlement .
LaDuca , who recently negotiated a $ 7.5 million settlement agreement for inmates strip - searched in Camden County , has filed similar lawsuits against the jails in Allegheny and Dauphin Counties .
Sheppard , the Johns Hopkins biophysicist strip - searched after the party , is one of his clients .
For the last several years , class - action lawyers have roamed the country , filing lawsuits against county jails with unconstitutional strip - search policies - and have won multimillion dollar settlements in California , New Mexico , New York , New Jersey and Florida , often without a trial .
A Pennsylvania official says new rules will be ready by next year .
By then , experts say , more such lawsuits are almost guaranteed .
" It 's going to go from one county to another like wildfire , " says Raymond Sabbatine , a former Kentucky jail warden who advises corrections officials across the country on proper strip - search procedures .
Given Pennsylvania 's lack of policies and the inconsistent practices from county to county , he said , " it 's kind of like a duck shoot , hunting at a baited field . "
Harrisburg Strip Search
The Seventh Annual Camp - Out With DJs , a weekend of camping and music on McCormick 's Island in the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg , ended early for Devon Sheppard and hundreds of other partygoers .
Sheppard , looking for a break from her Johns Hopkins laboratory , drove up from Baltimore the Friday before Labor Day this year and pitched her tent with hundreds of others .
But organizers shut down the festival after a man drowned in the river in the wee hours of Saturday .
By 9 a.m. , they announced that boats would begin shuttling the partygoers back to Harrisburg .
When the 31 - year - old scientist and her group disembarked , Harrisburg police charged all of them with violating a city parks ordinance .
Locals were told to expect citations in the mail and released .
Sheppard and dozens of others from out of state were handcuffed , put in police vans , and taken to the Harrisburg police station to await a court hearing .
Some were shackled together with leg irons .
Hours later , Sheppard said , a district judge ordered each to post $ 1,051 bail .
Anyone who did n't have that amount - in cash - was going to Dauphin County Prison .
At 1 a.m. Sunday , shortly after she arrived , a female prison officer escorted Sheppard into a shower room .
" She asked me to remove all of my clothing , " Sheppard said .
Naked , she first faced the guard and then was told to turn around and bend over .
Sheppard was having her period : " I was asked to remove a tampon , " she said .
She could hear male guards talking just around the corner ; mortified , she realized they could hear everything .
Much of the rest is a daze for Sheppard .
When the search was over , the female guard handed her a uniform , and another guard took her to a cell .
Hours later , a friend retrieved Sheppard 's belongings , and used her credit card to get cash for her release .
The charges were later dropped .
" This whole thing was very upsetting , " Sheppard said .
" It was humiliating . "
Defining ' Unreasonable '
When is a police order to strip for a search " unreasonable " - and thus prohibited by the Fourth Amendment ?
In deciding this question , federal courts around the country weigh a number of factors - including the seriousness of the subject 's offense , the length of the jail stay , and the evidence that the suspects might really have been hiding something underneath their clothes .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1979 that the federal prison in Washington did not violate inmates ' rights by strip - searching them in order to keep out drugs and weapons .
But the judges shied away from drawing a clear line between a legal strip search and an illegal one .
" In each case , it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails , " the court said .
In the 28 years since , state and federal courts have tried , case by case , to define what is an unreasonable search .
Some guidelines have emerged .
Strip searches are permitted on inmates who have been convicted of serious felonies and sentenced to prison , so long as the searches are done in a private setting .
Likewise , courts have found , it is appropriate to strip - search people arrested for violent felonies - but not those held merely for suspicion of drug use .
Tighter restrictions apply when people have been charged with minor crimes but not convicted .
Courts say those suspects can be made to strip only when police have a clear reason to believe they are hiding something that can't be found any other way .
Although the standards are still evolving , one rule has been clear for more than a decade : Jails and police departments cannot strip - search everyone brought into detention regardless of the offense .
Federal appeals courts from New York to California have affirmed that rule again and again .
Judge Pamela Ryder , of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , wrote in a 2006 case that it was wrong to strip - search a female bartender suspected of using drugs .
" Being under the influence of a drug does not necessarily indicate that the person has concealed more drugs in a body cavity , " Ryder wrote .
The U.S. Supreme Court has let Ryder 's ruling stand , as it has done with similar opinions .
In Pennsylvania , the key federal court decision came in 1993 , when a group of women protesting a Labor Day pigeon shoot were held in the Schuylkill County jail and strip - searched .
" The feelings of humiliation and degradation associated with being forced to expose one 's nude body to strangers for visual inspection is beyond dispute , " federal judge Franklin Van Antwerpen ruled .
At the time of his ruling , state prison regulations actually required county jails to strip - search everyone , regardless of the crime .
Seven years later , the state finally rescinded that rule , belatedly taking notice of Van Antwerpen 's decision that the protesters ' rights were violated by " unreasonable and unjustifiable " strip searches .
But it failed to write a new policy .
Even today , 14 years after the pigeon - shoot case , Pennsylvania still has not issued any legally acceptable rules for how jails should conduct strip searches .
Instead , the state has remained silent , allowing county jails to do as they see fit .
Pennsylvania Department of Corrections spokeswoman Susan McNaughton said her department would complete new rules in 2008 but would not comment further , other than to say the department is still working with counties on a complex issue .
' I Had to Get Away '
In March 2005 , after a late night of visiting his grown nieces and drinking beer , retired music teacher Byrd was on his way home to Sewell when he started to feel drowsy .
Byrd , 50 , who taught music for 22 years at University City High School and FitzSimons Middle School , stopped his van beside the road in the Germantown section of the city and went to sleep .
Police said they found Byrd slumped over the steering wheel , with the van 's door partially open .
When they woke him up , Byrd had watery eyes and spoke incoherently .
He refused to take a Breathalyzer test , they said , and was arrested for drunken driving and having a suspended license .
Byrd - who had two previous drunken - driving arrests - said he was simply tired , so he pulled over and took a nap .
When Byrd could n't come up with $ 2,500 in bail money , he was shipped to a Philadelphia Corrections Department jail on State Road .
There , a guard took Byrd to a room and ordered him to take off all his clothes .
" He had me bend over , you know , on the bench .
And I have no clothes on .
I 'm scared .
Man , I 'm not built for prison , " Byrd said in a deposition .
After the search , Byrd told a guard that he needed to use the bathroom - just so he could be alone for a moment .
The guard told him to use an empty cell .
" I had to get away because I did n't want anyone to see me as being soft , because I 'm getting really scared now , " said Byrd , whose case later was dismissed by a judge .
" I 'm crying .
I stayed there and cried . "
He was bailed out the next day , and , after a trial , a judge found him not guilty .
But his wife gave him an ultimatum - leave alcohol alone or she would leave him - and he entered a treatment program .
" She did n't back down , " he said .
' They 're Getting Searched '
Flanders , the Pottstown chief , defends his policy of strip - searching everyone entering the city jail , even the town drunks .
" Without question , they 're getting searched , " he said during an interview last year , saying that is the only way to keep jails and inmates safe .
" I 'm not going to have somebody hiding a razor blade or something like that and go in there and commit suicide . "
He did not return calls seeking additional comment .
Delaware County 's Chester Township has a similar practice , says its police chief , Booker T. Wilson .
He said about five people a week enter the jail - 260 a year - and they are strip - searched .
" If you 're being arrested , you 're subject to a strip search , " he said in a recent interview , adding that no one has ever sued or even complained .
Wilson said he would rather risk a lawsuit than take a chance on drugs ' slipping into his jail .
Few police chiefs will admit to having blanket strip - search policies , as Flanders and Wilson do .
But even when departments have written tough policies limiting the searches , the actual practices followed by police officers vary widely from town to town , The Inquirer found .
In Chester City , the written policy is similar to what courts say is permitted : Police can strip - search a suspect if they believe it is " necessary to locate and recover a concealed weapon or contraband . "
But Chester City Chief John Finnegan says he gives his officers wide discretion .
They have a green light to strip - search everyone detained in the city lockup , he said , even accused shoplifters held for a few hours , if officers believe they may be holding drugs .
" It 's not just officer safety , it 's for [ the prisoners ] themselves , also , " Finnegan said .
As a result , Finnegan said , his officers strip from 1,000 to 2,000 people each year .
Nor are these catchall strip searches confined to Southeastern Pennsylvania .
Police in Erie , the state 's fourth largest city , have no written strip - search policy - and no plans to write one .
" If we had a strip - search policy that you strip - search everyone , you 're going to get holy hell for that , " Police Chief Stephen Franklin said .
He says he simply tells officers that if they believe someone might be holding drugs , " you can search as far as you want to . "
Each year , he said , they conduct " a couple thousand " strip searches .
That 's highly unusual : A Justice Department survey of departments across the nation said 93 percent of cities of Erie 's size or larger had written policies .
Strip - search practices can even vary widely from jail to jail within the same city .
A case in point : Philadelphia , where radically different practices are followed in police overnight lockups and in the city 's prisons .
For years , until October , city prisons searched everyone .
Not so in the temporary lockups in police headquarters , where police each year detain 20,000 people arrested on drug and gun charges - but only strip - search about two dozen of them .
Lt. Francis Healy , a former Philadelphia street cop who now is a department attorney , said officers , using pat - downs , are able to do thorough searches , genital areas included , without stripping people .
Healy said a strip search was justified only in limited circumstances , such as if an officer saw drug dealers hiding narcotics in their underwear .
" We 're getting what we need , " Healy said .
" We know they are free of weapons .
We do n't see it in any way endangering the officers any more than necessary .
" It 's humiliating to be strip - searched , without a doubt , " Healy added .
" To say otherwise would be a lie . "
Stopped on the Way Home
Tameka
Flythe said it was " one of the worst days of my life .
" The daughter of a psychologist from Wallingford , she was arrested and strip - searched on June 1 , 2005 .
According to sworn testimony in federal court , Flythe , 32 , said she was stopped two blocks after she crossed the Darby Borough line , walking home from an afternoon shooting hoops in West Philadelphia .
Once a star basketball player at Strath Haven High School , Flythe had seen a friend , Stacey Brinson , and shot hoops with Brinson 's nephews Ry'shom , 11 , and Ty 'shom , 12 .
Part - time Darby officer Tina Selimis pulled up next to her in an unmarked car with its light flashing , and began questioning her about where she was coming from and whom she had been visiting .
Flythe , who has never been in trouble with the law , said she answered patiently , expecting that would be the end of it .
But then , she said , the officer asked , " ' I 'm sure you can give me a couple of drug houses in Darby . ' "
" ' Ma'am , ' " Flythe said she responded , " ' I do n't know what you 're talking about .
I do n't do drugs . ' "
Flythe said the officer then asked , " ' Do you mind if I pat you down ? ' "
Nothing was found .
Afterward , Selimis handcuffed
Flythe and told her she wanted to take her to the station house to check her further .
At the station , Flythe said , she followed the officer into a harshly lit , windowless room with no furniture .
" The door shut behind us , and she asked me to start removing my clothes , " Flythe said .
" I 'm thinking , this must be what she means by the more thorough search . "
When Flythe was naked , she says , " She told me to bend over and cough . "
Selimis again found nothing .
Flythe said the officer then handed back her clothes and told her she was free to go .
In a sworn court statement , Selimis , a 26 - year - old part - time officer , gave a different account .
She said she stopped Flythe because she was staggering .
" Her eyes were red and glassy , bloodshot , and she had a hyper - fidgety demeanor .
She stated that she was coming from the Paschall projects and she had just smoked crack with her children . "
Selimis said she picked up Flythe for " public drunkenness , " and strip - searched her on the possibility that she might be concealing contraband .
She ultimately released Flythe without charging her with anything because she had " calmed down , she did n't appear intoxicated to me at all . "
" I 'm going to tell you honestly , [ Flythe was ] one of the nicest people I 've encountered in Darby , " Selimis testified .
Flythe 's friend , Brinson , said in a recent interview that she spoke with Flythe immediately after the basketball game and saw no red eyes , fidgety demeanor or stumbling .
Likewise , her nephews , both honor students in Philadelphia middle schools , said they had never used drugs of any kind , with Flythe or anyone else .
Flythe said Selimis ' assertion that she smoked crack with boys who were 8 and 10 at the time was absurd and outrageous .
" First of all , I do n't do drugs , " she said .
Several months after the encounter , Flythe contacted a lawyer through an aunt 's friend - former Philadelphia Housing Authority counsel Michael Pileggi , who now specializes in civil - rights litigation .
In October 2005 , Pileggi filed a federal lawsuit on Flythe 's behalf , alleging that Darby 's police force had a pattern and practice of strip - search abuses .
Pileggi's arguments went to U.S. District Judge Jan E. DuBois , who was not impressed .
Significantly , the judge said Pileggi presented no evidence that Darby had such a blanket strip - search policy .
As a result , he ruled that Flythe could not sue the town itself .
Only Selimis ' conduct would be on trial .
The ruling placed Flythe at a considerable disadvantage ; courts usually grant police officers a lot of leeway for decisions made on the street , even when mistakes are made .
During a brief trial before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas J. Rueter , Selimis told the jury that she did not single out Flythe for special treatment .
In fact , she testified , she had strip - searched more than 100 people in just two years .
She and her bosses argued strenuously that strip searches were an essential part of the war against drugs .
" We 've brought people in that have two bags of marijuana in their pocket and 10 bags of marijuana in their rectum , " Lt. Richard Gibney , Selimis ' supervisor , testified .
Because of the limits on the case , the jury never learned that many municipalities strictly control strip searches .
Darby Chief Robert F. Smythe did not appear as a witness in the case and did not responded to requests for comments for this article .
Pileggi also said he was blocked from calling former Darby Mayor Paula M. Brown , who says she was regularly asked to help strip - search women prisoners when she was in office from 1998 to 2006 .
Frequently , she said , police requested searches that were clearly unconstitutional .
" I refused more than I conducted , " she said in an interview .
The jury quickly ruled against Flythe .
In interviews afterward , jurors said they believed police could strip - search anyone entering jails , even people arrested for minor offenses .
Foreman Roger Ruggles , 53 , an engineering professor at Lafayette College in Easton , Pa. , said jurors were swayed by arguments about jail safety .
Jurors also did n't think Flythe 's search sounded that terrible .
" If they conducted the strip search in the lobby , now , that 's wrong , " said Ruggles .
As for Flythe , she was determined to appeal , but another lawyer declined the case .
Even if she won , he said , Darby was too impoverished to pay much in damages .
Flythe knows there is little more she can do .
But she still holds out hope that her fight will make a difference .
" It may be justice for someone else , " she said , " a step toward some type of justice for good citizens . "

What is the problem ?
The growing use of non-lethal weapons such as tasers by the police has to calls to ban or restrict their use .
The real issue being debated is the extent to which police officers should risk their safety to detain suspects .
Should they only use force when someone ’s life is in danger , or to avoid the risk of injury when attempting to tackle a suspect , or to avoid a sprain from having to run after someone ?
It is likely that further debate will result in a consensus enforced by the legislative and judicial branches of government .
But what criteria should be used to determine the level of risk that police officers may be exposed to before using force ?
Under the current system , police officers are only held responsible for injuring others only if found guilty of a miscarriage of justice , that is , willful malice or negligent behavior in the performance of their job .
This provides an incentive for the judicial branch to minimize liability by maximizing the leeway officers have in deciding whether to use force .
Furthermore , establishing standards for proper police procedure is a highly - non objective process , based on factors such as the public ’s fear of police brutality , their desire for safety , the cost of lawsuits from police actions , and the political gain politicians find from pushing more or less draconian policies .
One means of improving on this process is to establish a strict liability criteria for police actions .
What is strict liability ?
Under a strict liability standard , it is not necessary to find a party guilty of malice or negligence , only of fault .
Perpetrators of damages arising from inherently dangerous activities are responsible for damages regardless of whether they acted improperly .
For instance , drivers at fault for damaging another car or injuring a driver are held financially responsible regardless of whether they acted maliciously or negligently .
Under strict liability , a police agency would be held responsible for personal injury and property damage if an officer injures an innocent suspect , or unnecessarily injures a criminal — even if the officer acted properly in the performance of his duty .
For example , an officer who fires at a guilty suspect who poses a real threat would not be liable , but an officer who fires at a suspect who does not pose a threat will be held liable for damages whether the officer is guilty of a miscarriage of duty or simply made an error in judgment .
Furthermore , such a system would repay defendants who are exonerated at trial for their time and suffering .
Strict liability shifts incentives to the party best qualified to control costs
One objection to the strict liability standard is that it would greatly increase the financial risk faced by police departments and courts .
However , by placing the burden of minimizing costs on the judicial agency , a strong incentive is created to minimize mistakes – and therefore costs .
It is likely that police departments would attempt to insure themselves against risk , and the insurance agents would in turn establish guidelines that seek to minimize their risk .
Such guidelines may ban tasers because of their health dangers – or they may require them in most situations where deadly weapons were formerly employed .
Police agencies may prefer to hire men because they would find it easier to tackle suspects ( and thus avoid a major incentive for taser use ) or women because they are better at resolving conflicts peacefully .
Because they would bear the cost of mistakes , police agencies would be motivated to experiment on the most effective way to perform their jobs , while the public they protect would be financially shielded from their mistakes by a strict liability standard .
Strict liability discourages prosecution of victimless crimes
Another objection to strict liability under the current legal framework is that it would make police agencies averse to enforcing laws that are prone to mistakes or unsuccessful prosecutions – namely , those known as “ victimless crimes . ”
Adultery , gambling , homosexuality , and the trade of illicit substances and goods are areas where the lack of a victim makes errors in suspect identification and successful prosecutions especially likely .
This is especially true of laws pushed by vocal voters on unwilling recipients – for example , communities that favor drug or alcohol prohibition on communities that tolerate drug and alcohol users .
Yet this only illustrates the insulation of government policies ( and by extension taxpayers ) from the cost of economically expensive ( and thus socially destructive ) laws .
If enforcement agencies are required to pay for their mistakes , they will favor laws that can be objectively enforced , and violations of which result in victims pushing for enforcement .

In these days of Blair 's Death Sauce , Bayou Butt Burner , and Da Bomb , Tabasco sauce , that granddaddy of piquant condiments , has come to seem rather tame .
But the history of Tabasco and its creators , the McIlhenny family , makes for a spicy enough tale , and Jeffrey Rothfeder , a former BusinessWeek editor , serves it up nicely in McIlhenny 's Gold : How a Louisiana Family Built the Tabasco Empire .
The McIlhennys have controlled McIlhenny Co. since its inception in 1869 , excluding nonfamily members from the top job until 1996 , and then only for two years .
They built an idiosyncratic world on tiny Avery Island , La. , keeping their workforce and manufacturing system in a quaint bubble until well into the 20th century .
Tabasco has managed to remain first among hot sauces worldwide , and the $ 250 million company turns out about 600,000 bottles a day in its Louisiana factory alone .
But the obstacles to its continued reign have been increasing in recent decades and now loom large .
The McIlhennys ' challenge , the author concludes , is to maintain dominance when " anyone can create a recipe for pepper sauce in a kitchen in Boise , Berlin , or New Delhi , " market it online , outsource manufacturing to Vietnam , and distribute via the Philippines .
Rothfeder 's account , though occasionally wandering , paints a vivid picture of just how tough hanging on will be .
He spoke with former and current company executives , factory workers , household help , and pepper pickers , and researched archival material .
But members of the " extremely guarded " Avery Island branch of the McIlhennys , which runs the company , declined to be interviewed .
Nevertheless , Rothfeder weaves a story rich in anecdote and color , and entrepreneurs with family businesses may find it an inspiring if cautionary tale .
Founder Edmund McIlhenny did not , according to the author , invent Tabasco sauce ; a local plantation owner did , developing a hot sauce based on Mexican Tabasco peppers in the 1840s .
But McIlhenny , a New Orleans banker who married into the land - owning Avery family , did co-opt the idea after giving up banking .
In 1870 , he patented his mash of pepper juice , vinegar , and salt , as well as the fermenting process that transformed it into a consistent product .
McIlhenny also remade Avery Island into what the author calls a " post - bellum plantation , " a workers ' community where housing , medical care , schooling , and the like were provided in exchange for lower - than - average wages .
The arrangement , which continued until after World War II , may have been morally dubious , but it led to profit margins that sometimes approached 50 % .
The company started overseas operations in the 1970s , when a shortage of Avery Island peppers and pickers made expansion necessary .
Rothfeder maintains that the company 's set - up demands that it find more ways to expand .
When it was established , all family members were deemed shareholders — the only shareholders .
Consequently , the dividends owed them multiply with each generation .
Rothfeder calls this a " silent time bomb " that forces the company to continually boost sales " exponentially . "
Fourth - and fifth - generation shareholders , he writes , " are increasingly impatient with the company 's torpid pace of growth and the lack of imagination in the executive suite . "
Rothfeder takes a dim view of current president Paul McIlhenny , the founder 's great - grandson .
Paul " has surrounded himself with family members who lack experience in consumer goods , management , agriculture , or manufacturing . "
He calls the recent launch of habanero , garlic , and chipotle sauces " unpromising , " in part because the company did n't support them with what he considers an appropriate advertising campaign .
The McIlhenny family has long frowned on selling shares to outsiders or taking in investors .
That may change , as frustrated family members start asking tough questions .
But the McIlhennys , " caught between tradition and modernity — indeed , between Avery Island and the new world — are so far without answers . "
For the great Tabasco heritage , that really burns .

All those Saturday morning stock shows that constantly beat the drum of a supposedly great economy is not being believed by the American people .
I guess when the rich keep getting richer and the average American keeps piling up credit card debits and spending more time at work to make ends meet --- that might be a possible reason for these negative feelings .
Environmentalists have clashed with the crew of Nisshin Maru before
The fleet is conducting its largest hunt in the South Pacific - it has instructions to kill up to 1,000 whales , including 50 humpbacks .
The humpback hunt is the first since a mid-1960s global ban and has drawn strong protests from environmentalists .
Commercial whaling was stopped in 1986 but Japan is permitted whaling in the name of scientific research .
Four whaling ships , including the lead craft Nisshin Maru , set off from the southern port of Shimonoseki on Sunday .
The 239 - man mission plans to kill more than 900 minke whales as well as fin whales and humpbacks , in a South Pacific whale hunt that will run until mid-April .
The 8,000 - metric ton Nisshin Maru was crippled by a fire on a whaling mission in the Antarctic in March .
One crew member was killed .
A Greenpeace campaign ship will be following the Japanese fleet .
Sensitive mammals
Tokyo's plan to target the humpback - which was hunted to near extinction four decades ago - has drawn condemnation from environmentalists .
Crowds gathered to wave off the whaling boats
" Humpbacks are very sensitive and live in close - knit pods so even one death can be extremely damaging , " Greenpeace spokesman Junichi Sato said .
Japanese fisheries officials insist both humpback and fin populations are back to sustainable levels .
" Humpback whales in our research area are rapidly recovering , " said fisheries spokesman Hideki Moronuki .
" Taking 50 humpbacks from a population of tens of thousands will have no significant impact whatsoever . "
Mr Moronuki said killing whales allowed marine biologists to study their internal organs .
Meat from Japan 's scientific catch is sold commercially but Japanese officials deny that the mission plans to make a profit .
Tokyo argues that whaling is an ancient Japanese tradition , and has pushed unsuccessfully at the International Whaling Commission to reverse the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
Environmentalists say Japan 's research programme is a pretext for keeping the whaling industry alive .
Remember StarTrek , The Next Generation , when Captain Jean - Luc Picard was captured by the Borg Collective ?
Well , now it 's happened to me .
I 'm being assimilated .
I fought it as long as could , but they 're right when they warn that " resistance is futile . "
It really is .
And yes , you 'll be next .
( Oh yes you will . )
While my new overlords are busy recharging , let me explain how this came to pass .
All the way back to my earliest years I 've been an out - layer .
I never joined groups , unless forced to , like when I ended up in the military in the late 60's .
And when I was forced to join a group it was nothing but irritation for everyone involved , me , them and anyone close enough to hear my complaints .
The bigger the group , the more I distrust and dislike it .
Beginning right with kindergarden I instinctively knew that group size and efficiency were inversely proportional .
The larger the group the less real stuff gets done , and what does get done costs more and misses the original goals by a mile .
Large working groups are especially vulnerable to a form of social affirmative action .
At least a third of the people who make up a large working group are always useless as tits on a boar .
Still everyone has to treat them as valuable members of " the team . "
They never do anything useful , say anything useful and , when given a task that requires them to actually produce something , they scurry from cubicle to cubicle bothering the other two - thirds : " Hey , Steve , can I pick your brain for minute . "
Then they turn in their ( your ) report .
If these people were not allowed to be part of a group they would most surely die of starvation .
That 's been my experience , anyway .
So I have spent my entire adult life avoiding large groups , be they in they workplace , political , religious , clubs , fads ... you name it .
And , up until last month , it worked pretty well -- except for that military business ... but trust me , when my term of service was over , they were as glad to see me gone as I was to be gone .
( Corporal Klinger could n't hold a candle to Lance Corporal Pizzo . )
But I digress .
A few months ago my wife , Sue , who works in private practice as a family nurse practitioner , decided to cut back to just two days a week .
That meant we lost our health insurance which had been provided by her office .
So out onto the health insurance marketplace I ventured , for the first time .
I 've written many times that nearly 50 million Americans were without health insurance , but in the abstract .
Suddenly there I was about to be one of them if I did not pick a plan .
So we applied to all kinds of companies to see what we could get that was affordable .
That meant a high deductible , but I was alright with that .
The first place we applied rejected me .
This was the first time the shoe was on my other foot .
Suddenly a group had rejected ME .
Bastards , I thought .
Then I noticed the reason .
A couple of years earlier my doctor had noticed my recent blood test showed my liver enzymes were up a bit .
Nothing serious , but he wanted to see if that was just the way my liver worked or if there was something else going on .
Doctor Paul asked me how much alcohol I consumed each day .
Not very much , I told him , a glass of wine with dinner and shot of brandy before bedtime .
He suggested I try dropping one or the other for a while and retest later to see if that was what causing it .
( It was n't )
What I did n't know was the doc had written on my chart : " Try reducing alcohol consumption . "
I know it now because it was the reason the insurnace company cited for rejecting me -- that one sentence .
I could just see the image the insurance company screener had in her head of wino Steve , laying in a puddle of his own urine , drinking Ripple out of a brown paper bag behind the local Stop - n - Shop .
Lesson :
Do n't tell your doctor anything .
" Do you consume alcohol ? " Nope .
" Do you now or have you ever smoked ? " Nope .
" Do you use recreational drugs ? " Nope .
" Do you eat a lot of red meat ? " Nope .
That 's all that 's ever going to appear on my future medical files , page after page of " nope . "
Well , to make a long story shorter , we ended up at Kaiser Permanente -- the Borg of American health care .
Now I do n't want to diss Kaiser because they do a fine job .
They are completely modern , wired to extreme , Web - friendly and remarkably efficient .
Even so , they ain't cheap .
With a high deductible we still have to cough up $ 760 a month .
( It 's like having to make two car payments every month , but you do n't get the cars . )
Even with that hefty outlay every month , if I want to talk to a doctor I have to cough up another seventy bucks .
Consequently the only time I 'll be seeing a Kaiser doc is if I can't staunch the bleeding by fashioning a tourniquet out of my own belt .
Of course what you really are paying for under these high - deductible plans is coverage for the day when the big " C " or something like it , gets it 's teeth into you .
Without catastrophic coverage you end up in the hospital with doctors pumping you full of stuff that costs so much it chews through a lifetime of savings in three days then goes to work on your house , cars and jewelry .
( All that platinum plated healthcare is still only likely to keep you alive long enough to drag your now hairless , emaciated and totally broke self to the nearest bankruptcy court . )
Then came the prescription meds shock .
When I found out how much the two meds I take cost I almost fell off the butcher - paper covered exam table .
But then I was advised that there was an alternative -- Wal - Mart , the Borg of American retailing .
Wal - Mart would provide my generic prescription drugs for just four bucks for a 30 - day supply !
And so here I am , after a lifetime of skipping around the edges of society , all at once -- assimilated .
Just like that .
Now I can " look forward " to being promoted in three years to the Borg of American Social Programs , MediCare / Social Security and AARP , which has been on my tail since I turned 50 , and is gaining on me .
Let me tell ya , its all come as quite a shock to this old Haight - Ashbury hippie .
It 's like totally un -groovy .
Nevertheless , here I am , assigned my very own recharging station at the local Kaiser cube , and schlepping around Wal - Mart in search of cheap drugs that do n't even make me " happy , " when they 're taken as directed .
And what are you smiling about ?
They 're gonna get you too , eventually .
It 's all a matter of scale .
As more and more people occupy finite earth - space , and consume more and more finite resources , the only way all of them can get a piece of the action is through maximization of efficiencies of scale .
Eventually the US will go with a single Borg - ish insurance system , because nothing else works , as we are already seeing .
We are about to all be living in a world that bears a striking similarity to the old science fiction movies we used to watch as kids , you know where everyone dresses alike and says things like , " It 's another beautiful day in the village . "
It 's not as much Big Brother as it is Big Borg .
Big Brother just controlled what people said , saw , heard , and knew .
The Borg cuts out the middle man and simply assimilates .
It 's not the kind of world I chose on my own .
Instead it 's like climate change .
It 's too late to avoid it .
Now we have to learn to adjust to conditions beyond our control .
Most of what 's about to happen is already baked into the cake .
I wish it were otherwise , but it is what is .
Sometimes we can change events and sometimes events change us .
And so it has come to pass - my assimilation has begun .
Resistance is futile .
My goal now has become to be the most annoying , under - achieving , obnoxious , passive - aggressive little shit the Borg ever assimilated .
Who knows , maybe I 'll get lucky and they 'll spit me back out .
In the meantime here 's where I draw a red line in the sand : they 'll have to pry my nightly snort of brandy out of my cold , dead fingers .

Democrat Barack Obama 's presidential campaign launched a new website Monday that has a single purpose : to track and highlight rival Hillary Clinton 's negative comments about Obama .
The minisite , simply named Hillary Attacks , catalogs negative newspaper articles , speeches and press releases that the New York senator 's campaign has issued that the Obama campaign says are personal attacks on Obama 's character .
The site is the latest entry in a trend of specialized candidate microwebsites to refract opponents ' campaign rhetoric in a way that 's favorable to their own campaigns .
Earlier this year Clinton 's campaign launched The Fact Hub , an online rapid - response site responding to rumors and speculation from the campaign trail and the blogosphere .
And North Carolina Democrat John Edwards launched a tongue - in - cheek Plants for Hillary website ahead of a recent televised presidential debate .
That microsite , which has since been taken down , made fun of Clinton for her campaign 's admitted planting of a question in an Iowa forum .
The Hillary Attacks site launches as Clinton and Obama are trying hard to distinguish their candidacies from one another in the minds of Iowans , who will be the first in the nation to start selecting their party 's 2008 national - convention delegates next month .
Negative campaigning has traditionally turned voters off the voting process , and polling shows that Iowans believe Clinton runs the most negative campaign .
The latest poll results of likely caucus participants in Iowa show Clinton and Obama running neck and neck .
On the new Obama site , next to the excerpts of Clinton 's negative attacks is an embedded YouTube video clip that shows Clinton saying at a Des Moines , Iowa , fundraising dinner that she 's only interested in attacking America 's problems – and Republicans .
There 's also a Hillary Attacks timeline , and a call from Obama 's campaign manager for supporters to help the campaign keep a tally of all the attacks .
" Today we 're launching a website that will keep track of all the attacks Senator Clinton has launched since she said she was n't interested in attacking other Democrats at the Jefferson - Jackson Dinner on November 10 , " campaign manager David Plouffe wrote in a Monday - morning blog entry .
" We 're asking all of you to be vigilant and notify us immediately of any attacks from Senator Clinton or her supporters as soon as you see them , so that we can respond with the truth swiftly and forcefully ....
These attacks could be phone calls , literature drops , blog posts , mail pieces as well as radio and TV ads .
Some could even be anonymous or designed to be . "
This is a " very , very impressive effort to enlist the full range of online campaign tools to exploit Hillary 's biggest mistake in the campaign to date , which was to go after Obama 's personal history ( as opposed to his record and rhetoric ) and say it was fun , " notes Michael Cornfield , vice president of research and media strategy at consulting firm 720 Strategies in Washington D.C. Cornfield was referring to a remark Clinton made to the New York Times , reported Sunday , in which she criticized Obama for consistently launching personal attacks on her for the past several months .
Clinton 's campaign was quick to respond to Obama 's new site on Clinton 's own press site , with a new entry that mirrored the Obama campaign 's rhetoric .
The entry linked to several of Obama 's attacks on Clinton .
" When he entered the race , Sen .
Obama said he believed in a new kind of politics where ' the campaigns should n't be about making each other look bad , ' " read the entry .
" He railed against the ' slash and burn , negative campaigning of the past . '
His chief strategist said they did n't have a strategy to tear people down . "
The Iran NIE has elicited a range of emotions in those opposed to the Bush administration ’s policies from gloating to discreet celebration .
In the minds of many , it ’s like V - Day : Let the church bells peal , kiss a girl in Times Square .
Others , particularly Iranian commentators located in the US , are considerably less sanguine .
They fear , as Farideh Farhi writes at Juan Cole ’s spin - off , Informed Comment : Global Affairs , that the NIE can “ easily become an instrument in support of the Bush Administration ’s current policy . ”
In fact , according to Kaveh Afrasiabi at Asia Times Online , “ The temporary freeze on the military option [ resulting from ] the new intelligence report has nested within it its exact opposite . ”
In other words , a Trojan horse .
Even though , he maintains , the nuclear programs that Iran halted in 2004 - 2005 were not weapons , the NIE and the administration painted them as such .
If a follow - up report were to indicate that Iran planned to resurrect said weapons program , that would provide “ ample justification for Washington ’s planned ‘ pre-emptive strikes ’ on Iran , not to mention added sanctions . ”
Thus leaving “ the pendulum capable of swinging in wildly different directions almost at will . ”
Meanwhile , at CASMII ( Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Action Against Iran ) , Daniel Pourkesali writes , “ Forgive this writer for being a spoiler . ”
But he too finds that the resurrection theme is like a ticking time bomb embedded in the NIE .
He mentions the “ assertions on page 7 paragraph D [ of the NIE ] that ‘ Iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to produce nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so . ' ”
They leave “ the door wide open for administration hawks like Mr. Cheney to abruptly accuse Iran of resurrecting its ‘ nuclear weapons program much as he did back in 2002 , claiming that Saddam Hussein had ‘ resumed his effort to acquire nuclear weapons . ' ”
In other words , the hawks are fixated on another bird , the phoenix .
At NIAC ( National Iranian - American Council ) , Trita Parsi explains how the administration further unrolls the rock before the resurrection justification .
“ Rather than adjusting policy on Iran in accordance to the reality - check provided by the NIE , the President moved the goal post on Iran .
“ As the NIE declared that Iran likely does n’t have a weapons program , the President shifted the red line from weaponization to the mere knowledge of enriching uranium [ which , of course ] is not of a military nature and is permitted by the Non-Proliferation Treaty . ”
“ The President also pointed out , as though to justify military strikes , that Iran ’s knowledge of the enrichment process would permit Tehran to have a clandestine program .
[ But , of course ] a full suspension of the Iranian program would not eliminate the Iranian knowledge of the enrichment program and , as a result , the risk of a clandestine program would continue to exist . ”
Unless , of course , the atomic scientists of Iran submitted to the erasure of their memories as if their minds were hard drives .
Finally , Ms. Farhi comments on the “ propitious convergence between the NIE and the Bush Administration ’s current policy and the timing of the release of this report , ” which was finished a year ago .
( See Gareth Porter for a full explanation . )
First she reminds us of Stephen Hadley ’s statement that “ the President has the right strategy , intensified international pressure along with the willingness to negotiate .
. . [ and for it ] to succeed , the international community has to turn up the pressure on Iran â€ “ - with diplomatic isolation , United Nations Sanctions , and with other financial pressure . ”
Then she frets that “ this NIE can so easily become an instrument in support of the Bush Administration ’s current policy . ”
We ’ll allow Dr. Afrasiabi to be the last to rain on the parade .
“ The bottom line . . . [ is that the US ] has now pre-positioned itself for yet another disastrous gambit in the volatile Middle East . ”
Cuitlacoche
Cuitlacoche is a black fungus that infects corn fields , making the kernels bulbous and swollen as they fill with spores .
It also goes by the name Huitlacoche .
If you 're having trouble with the pronounciation , it 's : Cuitlacoche ( kweet - lah - KOH- chay ) or Huitlacoche ( dat- sfuckin - NAS - tee ) .
It 's safe to say this is the first time I 've ever paid for an infection .
I am , of course , not counting the one I got from your mother .
( YES !
You walked right into that . )
I 've read that U.S. farmers consider it a disease and destroy it .
Farmers in Mexico put it in cans and sell it as a delicacy .
I travelled far and wide to find my own precious can of Cuitlacoche .
Okay , it was at my supermarket , but I had to drive like two miles to get there and got stuck at a couple of lights .
Enough chit-chat .
I 'm gonna go dine on a can of disease .
But before I do , I really do feel bad about that cheap mother joke .
My sincere apologies to you and your lovely mom .
( The filthy whore . )
Be right back !
Oh , sweet Christ .
Visually , I think the bar for Steve , Do n't Eat It ! is about to be set at a new low .
So I 'm going to ease you people into this one .
Let 's begin with a single spore - filled kernel before we examine the entire contents .
The following picture is a swear - to - God - unretouched - side - by - side comparison of a normal kernel of corn and an infected huitlacoche kernel , both from the same can .
These results can also be achieved by bombarding a kernel of corn with gamma rays and then making it angry .
( But be warned .
You wo n't like it when it 's angry . )
Alright , you 've waited long enough .
Presenting the entire can of imported sludge ( that I was actually charged money for ) ...
Do n't worry , I checked the ingredients before I tasted it .
" Smoker 's lung " was not on there .
Before I even got the whole can open , I detected a vague aroma of sweet corn , along with what I can only describe as a deep musky funk .
Put 'em together and it smells like corn that forgot to wipe .
In just a single serving , you 'll experience a wide array of textures .
Without getting too gross , it 's because the disease is more advanced in some kernels than others .
One bite might be kinda chewy , while the next might burst in your mouth like a black pus-filled blister .
( Whoops , forgot about the not - too - gross thing .
Oh well .
Nuts to you ! )
So , how does Huitlacoche taste ?
Does it matter ??
LOOK AT IT !
I guess it would be fair to say it does n't taste as truly horrible as it looks .
The flavor is elusive and difficult to describe , but I 'll try : " Kinda yucky . "
Hey , that was n't so hard after all .
( Sometimes I forget I 'm a goddamn wordsmith . )
For any connoisseurs , I 'm not sure if this stuff would go better with red wine or white .
How about with a bottle of Bactine ?
I 've always found that goes great with infections .
Huitlacoche also goes by some other names .
It 's frequently called Maize Mushroom , Corn Smut , and Mexican Truffle .
I 've even heard it referred to as " Devil Poop " -- but that was only after I said it .
( For God 's sake , it comes with little bits of corn already in it !
Talk about a time - saver . )
I thought it was interesting that Monteblanco chose to make their company logo the focal point of the can .
I also found a can of huitlacoche from Goya .
They , too , have downplayed the visuals by hiding it in a mild - mannered burrito .
I went ahead and made a new can label for the gang back at Cuitlacoche Central .
As always , this is a free service .
Well , that brings us to the end of a long overdue Steve , Do n't Eat It !
And now I have a belly full of diseased corn .
Maybe I should go see a doctor about a penicillin shot .
For your mom .
( YES !
In your face !
Oh man ... )
All Steve , Do n't Eat Its can be found here .

( hand in pic borrowed from girlfriend )
Not entirely a new idea , but it 's got some nifty extras , and looks pretty dang sexay while its at it .
And no , it 's not a portable !
Entirely home TV based !( if you want to go ahead and jump to the pics ,
here they are I took a famiclone ( Super Joy III ) and put it in a controller , with a bit of style and quality added .
It was made for my girlfriend who 's a big NES nut like me .
That made it easy to guess a gift for her birthday .
Just thought , " what would I want ? " I got it made a little late , but it was worth it to make right .
Anyways , here 's the info on the stuff I packed into this sweet little rectangular gaming goodie !- Came with built - in pirate games , including the 2 player version of tetris , and a level select hacked Contra , among 70 or so more games .
Nearly endless supply of old - school - nes there .
I did n't even get to play every one before I gave it away , lol . - Catridge connector on back for playing those NES games that are n't built in .
Just switch the power switch over to the left and it disables built in games , and the catridge is playing .
I was n't going to add this at first , but thought about how she had a weird pirate game with a guy who threw rocks , and it would n't work on her blinking NES .
I really wanted to play it , so thats why I added it .
A bit selfish maybe , but I do n't think anyone will complain - 2nd player controller port !
Lightgun works with it too .
Which is nice , because there 's at least 3 lightgun games built in .
- Controller got a nice new white paint job !
Makes it look both old school , and newer iPod-ish .
I basically wanted to make it look like something that Nintendo would make if they were to re-release the NES .
I think it ended up better than what they 'd make - Nintendo logo is backlit !
Looks insanely cool in real life .
I 'm going to do this to all my NES controllers when I can get around to it !
It 's that cool .
Only thing that bugs me is that one LED is too close to the logo and unblablances the light .
Something only a perfectionist would notice .
- Fixed those little " notches " that were near the cord and on the bottom of the controller .
I did this by filling them with bondo spot putty and sanding smooth .
Those little things alwasy bugged me , they detract from the beauty of the controller in my opinion , and needed to be killed Thats about it , here are the piccies .
Hacked , 2 player version of tetris playing .
No cartridge needed , ha ha !!!
The system .
It will be well played , no doubt .
The LED back light looks awesome .
Even when it 's not dark , you can see it .
The insides .
PACKED !
TIGHT !Size comparison to Tetris - mint game thing the I made for her also .
seemed appropriate .
well , enjoy !
I had a blast making it !
If you 've got questions , fire away !
I like answering .
There are tons more pics of the assembly and finished unit here http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v510/
... ES %20 mini/ Check 'em out !
EDIT : Hello Digg and Etechblog !
All the photobucket pics went out long ago , lets see how long these imageshack ones will hold up .
( BTW , everyone seems to get it wrong , it 's G - force .
Small f , big G. Just noting .
Ooo !
Tetris playing with no cartridge .
Built in pirate games or witchcraft , you decide .
Compared to the Tetris case mint game system I madeMy friend Kyle playing a cartridge .
Some pirate game called Big Nose .
Cavemen games , you can't get enough .
A small junction box houses the player 2 / lightgun port , AV out jacks , and the power jack .
here you can see the power switch .
In the middle its off , to the left it plays cartridges , and to the right it plays the built in games .
White LED backlighting .
Gotta love it , such a classic mod and it works so great on this .
some larger pictures of the whole thing .
Thats an entire NES system and a pretty large game library right there .
Build pics .
As you might know , this uses a pirate famiclone called a Super Joy 3 , there was no real NES hacking involved .
Here is the wikipedia link which has a list of the games included onboard .
I found my Super Joy 3 for a few bucks at thrift store , and knew exactly what I wanted to do with it when i saw it .
Shown here is the SJ3 with a neat little thing called a family converter plugged in , these are used to convert this from a japanese connector to a US cartridge connector .
I just had to make it smaller .
Here everything is shown already taken apart , desoldered and dremeled apart , ready to be soldered to the famiclone .
I later wired every connection by hand .
Took a few hours , but since I 've done it before on the NES Boy and NES p0cket , it was n't too bad .
After using goo gone to get rid of old sticker residue , using bondo on the case , doing several coats of primer and sanding , it was painted white with Krylon Fusion paint .
Tough stuff from the testing I did .
The sticker was put back on with some Duro spray on glue , worked excellent .
After all that , you would n't know this case was n't from 1988 , and not some new gadget off the internet .
It even fooled several people into thinking it was a real thing I had just bought somewhere .
It took showing pictures of the insides to prove i had made it , lol .
The player 2 port came from a broken NES .
It was dremeled down a lot so it would fit in the junction box .
The cable going from the controller to the junction box is from an old broken 6 button genesis controller .
It had just the right amount of wires , and was just thick enough to fit .
Inside the junction box .
Before hotglue was very generously applied to prevent wires coming apart from use .
The NES controller IC had to be " flipped " in order to fit the famiclone in .
So the pins were all bent the opposite direction , and then soldered in place .
The board had to be cut in a few places too and rewired , so that the switch would fit .
Almost done wiring Everything was hotglued later , to prevent anything coming loose in the years it will be around .
That was pretty much it .
I 've been asked if I could make more of these , and yeah , I think I could .
But I wo n't take any orders , it 's just too complicated that way , I will just post the ebay auction on this thread when I get one made .
Thanks for all the interest guys !
Keep the NES love going !
And if you 're interested in making one of these I would recommend reading Ben 's NES portable stories , then checking out the NES forums here ( most notably , the sticky at the top ) .
September 26 , 2007
If you would like a glimpse of the raging , death - clotted hell that George W. Bush and his willing executioners in the bipartisan American Establishment have created in Iraq , then steel yourself and plunge into Nir Rosen 's shattering report in the latest issue of Boston Review : No Going Back .
Rosen , long one of the most dogged and fearless truth - tellers about Iraq , portrays a reality light - years away from the obscenely mendacious and ignorant American " debate " over Bush 's rapine and its consequences .
He takes as his theme the millions of Iraqis driven from their homes by the invasion and occupation � and by the Iraqi " government 's " own " security forces . "
These ruthless militias � armed , trained , funded and empowered by the United States � are , as Rosen rightly terms them , death squads , carrying out a savage ethnic cleansing � with American connivance � while waging a multi- sided civil war , again with the eager assistance of the White House and its myrmidons .
You should read the whole piece � a deftly - woven tapestry of individual stories of the actual human beings whose lives and families have been ravaged by this war crime carried out in your name � but below are some excerpts , mostly drawn from Rosen 's devastating conclusion :
For the U.S. to acknowledge the size and seriousness of the humanitarian disaster in Iraq would be to admit that the recent troop " surge " is not working .
According to a senior UN official , " the U.S. government doesn�t want to admit there is a refugee problem because it is a sign of failure . "
It would also mean acknowledging that a massive process of ethnic cleansing has taken place under the watch of the U.S. - backed government�indeed , that it has been perpetrated by the Iraqi government�s own security forces ....
What will happen to Iraq ?
Think Mogadishu , small warlords controlling various neighborhoods , militias preying on those left behind , more powerful warlords controlling areas with resources , such as oil fields , ports , and lucrative pilgrimage routes and shrines .
Irredentist Sunni militias will attempt to retake their lost land , but they will be pushed into the Anbar Province , Jordan , and Syria , where they may link up with local Islamist militants to destabilize Amman and Damascus .
Some will look to fight elsewhere ; unable to continue the jihad in Iraq they will find common cause with Palestinians , Lebanese , Syrians , and others alienated from their societies and hateful of Shias .
The new rump Shia statelet , including Baghdad and the South , will be quarantined by the Sunni states in the region and pushed inexorably into Iranian hands whether Shia Iraqis want this or not .
It will be isolated and radicalized , and Shia militias loyal to Muqtada al Sadr , Abdul Aziz al Hakim , Muhamad al Yaqubi , and others will battle for power .
There is no " surge . "
At best it can be called an ooze , a slow increase of American occupying forces by a mere 15 percent , consisting of few new soldiers and many whose terms of service have been merely extended .
Yet the U.S. has doubled the size of its mission , announcing it will also take on the Shia militias as well as the Sunni ones .
On the ground , that means American soldiers secure areas and then hand them over to Iraqi security forces who impose a reign of terror on the inhabitants .
In the Iraqi civil war the army and police are not the solution ; they are combatants , fighting on behalf of Shia- sectarian Islamist parties .
The vaunted efforts to train Iraqi security forces have merely trained better death squads .
The Americans continue to imprison thousands of Iraqis , and kill many others .
Meanwhile , humanitarian organizations that would normally demand that the United States comply with international law and hand over imprisoned Iraqis to the " sovereign " Iraqi government are not doing so , knowing that their treatment at the hands of the government would be far worse than anything they would endure while in American captivity .
The occupation is not benign .
It is profoundly painful , humiliating , and lethal .
An American withdrawal would certainly lead other countries in the region , whether Turkey , Jordan , Iran , Syria , or Saudi Arabia , to increase their involvement in Iraq .
It would also mean an expedited removal of Sunnis in Baghdad .
But all this is happening anyway , so it doesn�t make much difference in terms of the fate of Iraq whether American military forces stay or leave .
The truth is that the American military will remain in Iraq for a long time .
The large bases in Anbar Province , such as al Assad and Taqaddum are built to last , " an enduring presence , " as one Marine officer told me .
Located in the remote desert , impregnable and only occasionally targeted by mortars , these bases will remain for decades .
The Americans may eventually withdraw from the urban areas of Iraq , but full withdrawal , through the treacherous roads of the Anbar to Jordan , through the south past Shia militias on the way to Kuwait or even through the so - called Sunni Triangle , Samarra , and Tikrit or through Mosul to Kurdistan or Turkey , would be a withdrawal under fire and involve slaughter for the Iraqis .
The American occupation has been more disastrous than the Mongols� sack of Baghdad in the 13th century .
Iraq�s human capital has fled , its intellectuals and professionals , the educated , the moneyed classes , the political elite .
They will not return .
And the government is nonexistent at best .
After finally succumbing to Iraqi pressure , the Americans submitted to elections but deliberately emasculated the central government and the office of the prime minister .
Now Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki is the scapegoat for American failure in Iraq , and there are calls to remove him or overthrow him .
But talk of a coup to replace Maliki fails to understand that he is irrelevant .
Gone are the days when Baghdad was the only major city in Iraq , and whoever controlled Baghdad controlled the country .
The continued focus on the theater in the Green Zone ignores the reality that events there have never determined what happens outside of it .
Iraq is a collection of city states such as Baghdad , Mosul , Basra , Ramadi , Erbil , and others , each controlled by various warlords with their own militias .
And the villages are entirely unprotected .
Maliki will be the last prime minister of Iraq .
When he is run out there will be no new elections , since they can�t be run safely and fairly anymore , and the pretense of an Iraqi state will be over .
It has become popular with former supporters of the war to blame the Iraqis for the Americans� failure .
The Iraqis did not choose democracy or the Iraqis did not choose freedom , Americans like to say , or the Iraqis have to decide to stop killing each other or Iraqis have to " step up . "
But such complaints misplace the blame .
Sunni and Shia Iraqis protested the American occupation as soon as it began , and demanded elections and sovereignty .
The U.S. ignored their demands and instead imposed a dictator on them , Paul Bremer , hoping he would pave the way for an Iraqi strongman to rule in our stead .
Other former supporters of the war , echoing the simplistic sentiments heard during the Balkan wars , now blame the alleged " ancient hatred " between Sunnis and Shias , who have been fighting each other for " thousands of years . "
But Iraq had no history of civil war or sectarian violence even approaching this scale until the Americans arrived .
Iraq is not Rwanda , where Hutus and Tutsis slaughtered each other and America could pretend it had no role .
We did this to Iraq .
And it is time the U.S and the international community " step up " to the resulting humanitarian nightmare .
***
One follow - up note .
As Arthur Silber has noted , Hillary Clinton is prominent among those " former supporters of the war [ who ] blame the Iraqis for the Americans� failure . "
As Arthur puts it :
Cconsider the unforgivable inhumanity of Hillary Clinton proclaiming :
Our troops did the job they were asked to do .
They got rid of Saddam Hussein .
They conducted the search for weapons of mass destruction .
They gave the Iraqi people a chance for elections and to have a government .
It is the Iraqis who have failed to take advantage of that opportunity .
Inhumanity indeed .
This astonishing statement bespeaks a depraved and dangerous mind , addled by long exposure to imperial power and privilege .
Read the stories that Rosen tells of ordinary people being chewed to pieces by the engine that Clinton helped set in motion , then see if you too , like the honorable senator from New York , believe they are just ungrateful wretches " who have failed to take advantage " of the wonderful opportunity Bush and Clinton have given them .
Via TPM :
The metaphorical statue of L. Paul Bremer III has come crashing down .
Today the Iraqi government formally revoked one of the Coalition Provisional Authority 's enduring vestiges -- a decree of immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts for U.S. security contractors .
" The cabinet held a meeting yesterday and decided to scrap the article pertaining to security companies operating in Iraq that was issued by the CPA ( Coalition Provision Authority ) in 2004 , " government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said in a statement .
" It has decided to present a new law regarding this issue which will be taken in the next cabinet meeting . "

In 1977 , when Gerald L. Hessell was sentenced to life in prison for second - degree murder , a gallon of gas cost 62 cents and a life term in Michigan meant about 15 years .
But Michigan changed its parole system in 1992 , replacing a parole board made up of civil servants with political appointees .
The new board summarized its thinking in a presentation to the state ’s judges in 2001 : “ A life sentence means life in prison . ”
Mr. Hessell was released the other day , thanks in part to a decision from a federal judge in Detroit last month ruling that the state had violated the ex post facto clause of the Constitution when it changed the parole rules .
The clause says the government cannot increase punishments retroactively .
Mr. Hessell was 19 when he was sentenced , and he is 50 now .
“ I was told by my attorney at the time that I could look to do about 12 to 15 years provided I had a clean record , ” he said last week .

Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro said the US Government misinformed Americans and the world about September 11 , echoing conspiracy theories about the terror attacks against the United States six years ago .
In an essay read by a Cuban television presenter on Tuesday night , President Castro said the Pentagon was hit by a rocket , not a plane , because no traces were found of its passengers .
" Today one knows there was deliberate misinformation , " wrote Castro , who has not appeared in public since July of 2006 when life - threatening surgery for a secret illness forced him to hand over power to his brother Raul Castro .
" Studying the impact of planes , similar to those that hit the Twin Towers , that had accidentally fallen on densely populated cities , one concludes that it was not a plane that crashed into the Pentagon , " Castro said .
" Only a projectile could have caused the geometrically round hole that allegedly was made by the plane , " he said .
" We were fooled like the rest of the planet 's inhabitants , " he wrote .
President Castro said the truth behind the 2001 attacks with hijacked planes that killed nearly 3,000 people will probably never be known .
His 4,256 - word essay made no mention of Osama bin Laden and his militant Islamist Al Qaeda network behind the attacks on New York 's World Trade Centre and Washington .

Corruption runs rampant in Iraq , and fact , this fledging democracy that we 're bankrolling has been ranked the third most corrupt nation in the world .
When you consider that the government has only been in existence for a few years , that 's pretty impressive .
Is there any doubt that with another few billion of our dollars , the Iraqi government will be able to proudly proclaim , " We 're number one " ?
From top to bottom , there is apparently no aspect of Iraqi life that is free from corruption .
Fuel , water , electricity , medication , school books ... you name it and if the government controls it , it can be found on the black market .
Says a Shiite tribal leader :
Everyone is stealing from the state .
It ’s a very large meal , and everyone wants to eat .
Even a spot on the police force we 've spent billions to train can be had for a $ 500 bribe to the Ministry of the Interior .
But most disturbing ?
Some American officials estimate that as much as a third of what they spend on Iraqi contracts and grants ends up unaccounted for or stolen , with a portion going to Shiite or Sunni militias .
We 're helping to finance the very groups that have killed thousands of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians .
Acrylamide is found in chips
The fears surround acrylamides , chemicals produced when you fry , grill or roast a wide range of foods .
Dutch researchers quizzed 120,000 people on their eating habits , and found that women who ate more acrylamide appeared more at risk .
UK experts say other factors could be to blame , and urged women there was not need to panic .
General advice , resulting from this project , is to avoid overcooking when baking , frying or toasting carbohydrate - rich foods
EU spokesman
Laboratory tests highlighted acrylamides as a possible danger five years ago , but the University of Maastricht study , published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers and Prevention , is the first to find a link between acrylamides in the diet and cancer risk .
Food which has been coloured or burned by cooking is far more likely to contain acrylamides .
Food experts say it is virtually impossible to eliminate them from our diets altogether .
The Dutch study followed the 120,000 volunteers - 62,000 of whom were women - for 11 years after their initial questionnaire , during which time 327 of them developed endometrial ( womb ) cancer , and 300 developed ovarian cancer .
Analysis of these findings suggested that those who ate 40 micrograms of acrylamide a day - equivalent to half a pack of biscuits , a portion of chips or a single packet of crisps - were twice as likely to fall prey to these cancers compared with those who ate much less acrylamide .
Despite the size of the study , the researchers said that the results needed to be confirmed by other research .
Golden brown
In the UK , there are approximately 6,400 cases of womb cancer , and 7,000 cases of ovarian cancer a year .
Women should n't be unduly worried by this news
Lesley Walker
Cancer Research UK
A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency urged people to try a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables .
" This new study supports our current advice , which already assumes that acrylamide has the potential to be a human carcinogen .
" Since acrylamide forms naturally in a wide variety of cooked foods , it is not possible to have a healthy , balanced diet that avoids it . "
Experts at the EU said that food should not be overcooked .
An EU spokesman said : " General advice , resulting from this project , is to avoid overcooking when baking , frying or toasting carbohydrate - rich foods .
" French fries and roast potatoes should be cooked to a golden yellow rather than golden brown colour . "
However , Dr Lesley Walker , from Cancer Research UK said that it was hard to be sure that the extra cancers were due to just acrylamides , rather than some other unhealthy component of the women 's diets .
" Women should n't be unduly worried by this news .
It 's not easy to separate out one component of the diet from all the others when studying the complex diets of ordinary people . "
The food industry says it has made efforts to reduce the acrylamides within processed foods in recent years .
A study published in 2005 found no evidence that acrylamide increased the risk of breast cancer .
Right now the angry rhetoric and saber - rattling is a boon to the most hard - line , anti-American elements in their government .
It strengthens their grip , intimidates moderates , and confuses our allies around the world , who want to see Iran 's hegemonic aspirations contained without the use of force .
We should send a top level mission into the region , just as Bill Clinton did in the Balkans , and talk to all parties , both inside and outside Iraq .
Armed with a statement of principles , some inducements , and a sharp explanation of the consequences of failure , we might well craft some understandings that could help pave a successful US exit from Iraq , check Iran 's quest for nuclear weapons , and reassure anxious neighbors .
I reject the use of force at this time .
While all agree that Iran should not be permitted to acquire nuclear weaponry , the intelligence that has been shared with me suggests there is still time for a diplomatic initiative , not only to head off their nuclear plans but also to persuade Iran to end its military assistance to militia inside Iraq .
Surely the United States will have the wisdom and courage to try diplomacy first , and save the use of force for a last , last , last resort .
I look forward to continuing our dialogue in the comments .

Bush administration moves to block inquiries into CIA ’s destruction of torture tapes
By Joe Kay
17 December 2007
The Bush administration has taken aggressive steps to undermine congressional and judicial inquiries into the CIA ’s destruction of videotapes showing the torture of at least two prisoners .
The move is only the latest demonstration of the administration ’s lawlessness and contempt for democratic and constitutional norms .
The tapes in question recorded hundreds of hours of interrogation of two alleged Al Qaeda members , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , both captured by the CIA in 2002 .
Among the techniques used on the prisoners was water - boarding , a notorious torture method involving the near - drowning of the prisoner .
Earlier this month , CIA director Michael Hayden acknowledged that the intelligence agency had destroyed the tapes in November 2005 .
Since that admission , it has become clear that the Bush administration and leading congressmen of both parties knew about the CIA torture program and the existence of the tapes for years before the tapes were destroyed .
The White House and officials in the Justice Department and CIA are now implicated in both the crime of torture and possible obstruction of justice and perjury in relation to the tapes ’ destruction .
Even as it works to squelch inquiries into past torture , the White House and its congressional allies have moved to block a bill that would ban the CIA from using “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” including water - boarding , in the future .
Senate Republicans are using a procedural technicality to strip language from a bill passed by the House of Representatives that would require the CIA to follow the same rules as the US military .
Bush has threatened to veto the bill if it gets through the House and Senate .
Late last week , the administration indicated that it would not cooperate with inquires announced by the Judiciary and Intelligence committees in the House and Senate .
In a letter to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Attorney General Michael Mukasey made the absurd declaration that any cooperation with congressional investigations would raise questions as to the independence of the Justice Department ’s own inquiry .
“ At my confirmation hearing , I testified that I would act independently , resist political pressure and ensure that politics plays no role in cases brought by the Department of Justice , ” Mukasey wrote .
Therefore , “ I will not at this time provide further information in response to your letter . ”
Thus Mukasey , in Orwellian fashion , defends bowing to political pressure from the White House in the name of “ resisting political pressure . ”
The Senate committee had requested from Mukasey an account of the Justice Department ’s role in and knowledge of the tapes ’ destruction .
Mukasey was confirmed as attorney general with the support of several key Democratic leaders last month , despite his refusal to condemn water - boarding as torture .
Among those voting for Mukasey were key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee — Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York .
Also last week , the House Intelligence Committee requested testimony from CIA officials , including Jose Rodriguez , the former head of clandestine operations who has been named as the individual who authorized the tapes ’ destruction , and John Rizzo , the top lawyer at the CIA .
The committee has also requested that the CIA turn over documents and e-mails relating to the decision to destroy the videotapes .
The Justice Department responded with a December 14 letter to the committee requesting that it delay any investigation in order to avoid “ significant risks ” to the joint inquiry being organized by the department and the CIA .
The White House also instructed the CIA not to cooperate with congressional requests for information .
The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Silvestre Reyes , and the ranking Republican , Peter Hoekstra , issued a joint statement declaring , “ Parallel investigations occur all the time , and there is no basis upon which the attorney general can stand in the way of our work . ”
They threatened to “ use all the tools available to Congress , including subpoenas ” to continue the congressional investigation .
The administration is also moving to scuttle court requests for information on the tapes ’ destruction .
Lawyers in one case before the US District Court for the District of Columbia filed a motion asking Judge Henry Kennedy to determine whether the destruction of the tapes constitutes a violation of a 2005 order by the judge .
The court at that time ordered the government to preserve all evidence regarding the interrogation and torture of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay .
The Justice Department submitted a brief on Friday evening warning that any request for information “ could potentially complicate the ongoing efforts to arrive at a full factual understanding of the matter . ”
A judicial inquiry is “ both unnecessary and potentially disruptive , ” the department declared .
The government is claiming that the tapes are not relevant to the investigation because the prisoners in question were not at Guantánamo Bay at the time of the order .
The judge could nevertheless rule that the destruction was a criminal act because the videotapes were of likely significance to a legal case .
The Bush administration did not acknowledge the existence of secret overseas CIA prisons , where the two alleged Al Qaeda operatives were tortured , until late 2006 , when both Zubaydah and al - Nashiri were transferred to Guantánamo Bay .
In a separate court case filed last Wednesday , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) asked a federal judge in New York to find the CIA in contempt for violating a 2004 court order requiring the CIA to turn over or account for all documents relating to the interrogation of prisoners in US custody , regardless of their location .
“ These tapes were clearly responsive to the Freedom of Information Act requests that we filed in 2003 and 2004 , and accordingly the CIA was under a legal obligation to produce the tapes to us or to provide a legal justification for withholding them , ” said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
“ By destroying these tapes , the CIA violated the statute as well as an order of the court .
In the circumstances , it would be entirely appropriate for the court to hold the agency in contempt . ”
In addition to these cases , the CIA likely violated the law in withholding the videotapes from the 9/11 Commission and from the court involved in the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui , who was ultimately convicted of participating in the planning for 9/11 .
The tapes were destroyed shortly after a judge in the Moussaoui trial requested that the CIA turn over videotapes of the interrogation of Al Qaeda suspects .
The Bush administration is using the same pretext — the existence of an ongoing investigation — to justify its refusal to make any public comments on the tapes , aside from the declaration that Bush “ has no recollection ” of the tapes or their destruction .
The administration is essentially arguing that because it is investigating itself and possible crimes that it committed , no other investigations can proceed .
The position of the Bush administration on the current scandal is in line with its previous assertions of unconstrained executive power and the rejection of any accountability for its actions .
A major constitutional crisis is possible , though the White House is once again counting on leading Democrats — themselves complicit in the CIA torture program — to back down .
In an interview on “ Fox News Sunday , ” Peter Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , and Democrat Jane Harman , former ranking Democrat on the committee , said their committee would proceed with their investigation despite opposition from the White House and the Justice Department .
Hoekstra repeated the threat to subpoena CIA officials to compel their testimony .
In the event of a subpoena , the administration might invoke executive privilege , as it has done in the past , to block testimony .
While indicating that the committee would defy the White House , Hoekstra focused most of his ire on the CIA and the intelligence apparatus .
“ I think it ’s important for Congress to hold this community accountable , ” he said .
“ The CIA did not tell us about the existence of these tapes .
They did not tell us that they were going to be destroyed . ”
Hoekstra said of the CIA that “ they do n’t believe they are accountable to anybody .
They do n’t believe that they are accountable to the president . ”
Hoekstra ’s statement that Congress was never informed of the tapes was immediately contradicted by Harman , who noted that “ Congress — specifically , I — warned them not to destroy the videotapes ” in 2003 .
Harman and other leading members of both parties were informed of the CIA ’s intention to destroy the tapes , but did nothing to inform the American people about the existence of the tapes or the existence of the CIA torture program .
Both Harman and Hoekstra have rejected the appointment of a special prosecutor , which a few Democrats have called for .
Harman voiced concern , however , that any investigation carried out solely by the Justice Department and the CIA would be widely perceived as a whitewash .
“ On a bipartisan basis , ” she said , “ the House Intelligence Committee wants to get to the bottom of this and is n’t going to back off for the attorney general here , who I think ... may be doing something that wo n’t give the public confidence that it was a full and fair investigation . ”
She and Hoekstra reflected concerns within the political establishment that without a congressional investigation , the demand for a special prosecutor will grow .
Democratic Senator Evan Bayh , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , voiced similar concerns on CNN ’s “ Late Edition . ”
“ It ’s entirely possible there was nothing illegal on those tapes , ” he said .
“ It ’s even entirely possible that their destruction was not illegal .
But the way they ’re going about this makes it look like they ’re trying to hide something which may embarrass them when , by being more forthcoming , they could avoid that . ”
His statement amounted to a plea to the White House that it stop stonewalling and instead cooperate in a joint whitewash .
In their appearance on the CNN program , Bayh and Republican Senator Kit Bond both rejected the naming of a special prosecutor .
Whatever conflicts may develop between Congress and the White House over the destruction of the tapes , both the Democrats and the Republicans are agreed on the need to obscure the fundamental issue involved : that the CIA , with the sanction of both parties and under the direction of the White House , engaged in torture in violation of international and domestic law .
Sure , we 've heard RIAA - admiring lawyers affirm that ripping your own CDs is in fact " stealing , " but it seems the aforementioned entity is putting its money where its mouth is in a case against Jeffrey Howell .
Reportedly , the Scottsdale , Arizona resident is being sued by the RIAA , and rather than Mr. Howell just writing a check and calling it a day , he 's fighting back in court .
Interestingly , it seems that the industry is maintaining that " it is illegal for someone who has legally purchased a CD to transfer that music into their computer . "
Ira Schwartz , the industry 's lawyer in the case , is arguing that MP3 files created on his computer from legally purchased CDs are indeed " unauthorized copies , " and while we 've no idea what will become of all this , we suppose you should go on and wipe those personal copies before you too end up in handcuffs .
Update :
We got some more info on the case -- it looks like Jeffrey 's actually being sued for illegal downloading , not ripping , but this whole " ripping is illegal " tactic is still pretty distasteful .
Check out this post for the full story .

MY PSYCHIATRIST WANTS TO GIVE ME TWO ANTIPSYCHOTICS AT THE SAME TIME .
WHAT SHOULD I DO ?
Undoubtedly , your first impulse will be to punch him in the testicles , but as you know , the Kellogg - Briand pact ( 1928 ) expressly forbids this .
However , it is notably silent on the issue of voodoo / shark attacks , which can be used with discretion .
Go back and read Parts 1 and 2 .
I 'll wait .
Antipsychotics exhibit their antipsychotic effect through D2 blockade .
( 1 ) Got it ?
Take a look at the following figure again , showing % blockade of receptors ( serotonin or dopamine ) as a function of dose .
So you 'll observe a few things .
First , these antipsychotics will have equivalences in dosage .
If you use 10mg Zyprexa as a baseline , how much dopamine does it block ?
70 % .
How much Risperdal does it take to block the same amount ?
3 mg . Therefore , 10mg Zyprexa = 3 mg Risperdal .
If you look at the graphs for the other antipsychotics ( not shown -- sheer laziness ) , you get the following conversion for antipsychotic effects :
10mg Zyprexa = 3 mg Risperdal= 500mg Seroquel= 120mg Geodon
Interestingly , most comparator trials done -- which look at symptom responses -- show these same equivalences .
For example , ZEUS Geodon vs. Zyprexa trial : 126mg Geodon=11mg Zyprexa .
This should n't be surprising since THAT'S HOW THE DRUGS ARE WORKING .
Second , no drug company can claim their drug has superior efficacy , because , again , they 're all working through the same mechanism .
Certainly , people tolerate each drug differently , but that 's not efficacy , is it ?
Certainly an individual might respond to one better , but you have no way of predicting that .
You simply cannot tell , by looking at someone , which drug will work and which wo n't .
I 'll show you : which drug will work best for this guy ?
It 's a trick question : the correct answer is penicillin .
The only way a drug company or study could claim to find superiority is if they do n't use comparable dosages .
" We found that Risperdal 6 mg was significantly more effective than 100 mg of Seroquel . "
Really ?
Bite me .
Third , and this is really a math question :
Since there are a finite number of D2 receptors in your skull , if you are on 6 mg or Risperdal -- which blocks 90 % of them , and the doctor decides to augment with some Zyprexa , where 's the Zyprexa going to go ?
Answer : your thighs .
Tom recognized her instantly despite the red anonymity bar
It 's not going to D2 receptors , because they 're all already blocked with Risperdal .
So it 's just going to go around to other receptors -- H1 , a1 , M1 , etc -- all of which have nothing to do with bipolar or psychosis .
Issues of tolerability aside , mixing two antipychotics is no different than giving more of just one antipsychotic .
" Abiliquel " -- taking Abilify and adding Seroquel -- is sheer idiocy of such magnitude that even Eli Roth is repulsed .
The first time someone told me what Abiliquel was , the room became filled with the sounds of six guys screaming in horrific pain , and that was because I was punching them in the testicles .
Why not just give him Motrin +
Advil ?
Oh : " But I use it cleverly : I give 15 mg of Abilify and 25 mg of Seroquel .
See ? " I see .
I see that you 're bleeding from the testicles .
Guess why .
You give 15 mg Abilify -- that 's acting as a D2 blocker .
25 mg Seroquel is n't even a D2 blocker , it 's an H1 blocker , you 're paying for an antipsychotic and getting Benadryl .
You say , " well , I know , " ( liar ) , " but I 'm using the Abilify as an antipsychotic and Seroquel as a sedative . "
But , Gwyneth , you could have gotten the exact same effect by giving Abilify and Benadryl+ trazodone -- which would be cheaper , and safer ; or giving simply 500mg Seroquel alone , which would have gotten you both antipsychotic effect and sedative effect , thus reducing the cost by half , etc , etc .
Remember that scene in the movie Hostel where Matthew McConaughey gets bitten by a radioactive lab rat and transforms into an immortal superhero ?
Matthew McConaughey ( Owen Wilson ) proves there can be only one .
No ?
Do you know why ?
Because you knew better than to see that celluloid atrocity .
How come you did n't know better than to prescribe two antipsychotics at once ?
You do n't mix Zoloft and Paxil together , do you ?
Haldol and Prolixin ?
Seriously , do you just make crap up as you go along , or do you have pharmacological non-sequitors prepared in your Moleskine ?
The same , by the way , goes for all you nutboxes who work in hospitals .
If you have a patient on , say , 10,000 mg of Seroquel , and he goes into an ER and gets indignant and flips a table over , and you inject him with 5 mg of Haldol ( 90 % blockade ) , you think that 10,000 mg of Seroquel is doing him any good as an antipsychotic ?
I gots news for youse all : every time you prn ( emergency dose ) someone with Haldol , their brain is only on Haldol .
Any other antipsychotic you give them that day is strictly a monetary gift to Big Pharma ; you may as well PayPal them $ 180 and spare the patient the exposure .
On second thought , you may as well PayPal me .
-------------------
1 . There may come a day where a drug is invented that works through some other mechanism , maybe glutamate , but as of right now , all the available antipsychotics work through D2 blockade .
Everything else is irrelevant .
Now , these other receptors might be relevant for other effects ( reducing anxiety , antidepression , etc ) but let 's try to focus on the specific problem and not get all Andrew Weil here .
We received a report this afternoon from someone who had recently received a digital picture frame .
Unfortunately , it had a extra component with it .
The built - in storage came with what appears to be some malware already loaded on it -- a file called ' cfhskjn.exe ' was on it when unpacked .
Some of the behavior seen when the digital picture frame was connected to the computer was :
MSCONFIG would not run - it would briefly open and then terminate
The system would blue screen when starting in safe mode
Going to various anti-virus websites would result in the web browser terminating
Various popups for random name .exe " with ' not valid image ' messages
This specific product was an " ADS Digital Photo Frame - 8 " ( sold by Sam 's Club - see http://www.samsclub.com/shopping/navigate.do?dest=5&item=368725) but this type of infection can , and has affected other portable devices with internal storage .
Kaspersky has a blog entry ' Adventures at altitude ' ( see http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=208187471&return=1) about one of their employees who bought a Kingston CF memory card that came with a virus on it .
Whether its a picture frame , a digital camera or any USB , CF , SD , etc memory card , the portable nature of these devices dredges up of memories of all the floppy boot viruses we used to have to deal with . [
What 's a ' floppy disk ' you ask ? ;-) ]
Care should be taken when attaching storage devices to your computer to ensure you scan them for possible malware and handle them in as secure a fashion as is possible .

Stewart : Justice officials are ' taking [ a crap ] inside my head ! '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email This On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart skewered many of the evasions in Monica Goodling 's Congressional testimony concerning the US attorney firings , ranging from her attempt to invoke the 5th Amendment despite having been given immunity to her seeming inability , despite being a lawyer herself , to say whether she had broken the law .
" What am I supposed to be , some kind of law - knowing person ? " mocked Stewart .
He then compared Goodling 's statements to those of Attorney General Gonzales , concluding , " They 're both lying . "
" So ultimately , this whole sordid affair boils down to who came up with the list of people to fire , " Stewart said , and proceeded to show a series of clips of Goodling , Kyle Sampson , and Gonzales denying responsibility and contradicting each other and even themselves .
" Listening to their testimony , it 's like the entire Department of Justice is taking [ a crap ] inside my head ! " agonized Stewart .
" What are you doing ?
If it was n't McNulty , Goodling , Sampson , Gonzales , or OJ , then this list must have ...
I know how this happened !
This was a miracle virgin firing . "
The following video was broadcast on The Daily Show on May 24 .
One of the biggest threats to happiness at work is having too many fixed expenses at home .
When you re completely dependent on bringing home a pay check ( or two ! ) every single month , you re vulnerable .
If work turns out to be unbearable you cant simply up and leave and take three months without income .
I ’ve chosen low - rent living for myself .
At first it was through accident rather than planning but now I would never live any other way .
Read on to see how it has made me happy at work – and in life .
Some years ago , my wonderful girlfriend Patricia and I were hunting for a new place to live in Copenhagen .
We were living in her small , 1 - bedroom apartment and we really longed for more space , more rooms and a bigger kitchen .
Homes are getting ludicrously expensive in all European capitals including Copenhagen , so we went through a process that is common to many people hunting for a new home :
We started looking at places within our budget that we could easily afford .
But those places were n’t really cool so we started looking at more and more expensive places
Untill we ’d reached our threshold of pain and were only considering the most expensive places we could conceivably afford
We actually submitted bids on two different ( expensive ) homes and narrowly lost out in each case to other bidders .
Back then we were devastated – we really had our minds set on those two places .
Today we ’re incredibly relieved that it never came through .
We ’re still living in Patricia ’s apartment which costs us next to nothing and looking back I can see how much of an advantage that has been for the both of us .
Obviously this applies not only to your mortgage or rent but to all fixed expenses .
Rent / mortgage just happens to be the largest fixed expense most of us have .
Leaving lots of breathing room in my economy has brought me some huge advantages :
1 : Freedom to leave a bad job
When a job does n’t make me happy , I can quit without worrying about the money .
I ’ve done it once , Patricia twice .
It ’s not that we ’ve quit at the fist sign of trouble – we have always tried to make it work .
But when we ’ve realized that a particular job was n’t going to make us happy , we ’ve had the freedom to say sayonara without first finding a new job .
2 : Freedom to take a chance
In the startup I ’ve been running the past three years I ’ve been able to take some chances and focus more on building a happy , sustainable business than on bringing home a big pay - check every month .
It has allowed the business to grow organically which has paid off immensely now that the business is up and running .
3 : Freedom to do what I enjoy
I can decide to do stuff that lets me learn , meet interesting people or plain have fun but may not make any money here and now .
This is a huge boon to me and my business in the long run because it means that I ’m constantly developing and learning .
4 : Freedom to do what ’s right
I can do what ’s right rather than what makes me more money .
I can decide to work for free for a company that really needs me , but ca n’t afford me .
I can give stuff away if I think people need it .
I can set a high ethical standard and not need to worry about having to compromise it for profit .
5 : Freedom to work less hours
There ’s no pressure on me to work 50 , 60 or 80 hours a week .
I can if I want to and sometimes I do and if I ’d rather work 20 hours one week I can do that .
I ’ve once and for all left The Cult of Overwork .
6 : Freedom to say no to some customers
Some customers just are n’t right for your business .
The chemistry is wrong , their needs dont ’ match your solutions or they ’re just too much trouble .
I have the freedom to say no to some customers and yes to the best customers .
All of the above really comes down to short - term vs. long - term planning .
Economic freedom let ’s you invest in your future by doing things now that make less money , but will eventually make you more .
7 : Peace of mind
I spend almost zero time and energy worrying about money – it ’s just not an issue .
I also do n’t need to worry whether the interest rates go up or down half a point .
Or whether there really is a housing bubble and house prices are about to start falling .
That ’s a huge relief and gives me more time and energy for business and life .
8 : Focus on what really matters
When I ’m not concerned with a bigger home , bigger car or bigger TV I focus on what really matters .
My girlfriend , family , friends , business , writing , networking , learning , reading , etc … I waste no time keeping up with the Joneses .
9 : Simple living
Living in a small appartment has taught us to own only the things we really need .
We ’ve been getting really good at throwing or giving away clothes , linens , kitchenware , furniture , knick - knacks etc. that we do n’t use regularly .
And this is a huge relief because you can form a huge attachment to the things you own and paring them down to only the things you really need teaches you to let go of that .
There ’s a mental relief and freedom that comes from that .
Less stuff in your home = less stuff on your mind .
10 : More money for fun stuff
When less money goes into the stuff I own , there ’s more money for the stuff I do .
Like snowboarding , conferences , travelling and more .
I want to make two things very clear :
1 : This is not about being unambitious at work or setting small business goals .
I can assure you that my aspirations are as big as the next person’s .
It ’s about realizing that economic wiggle room frees you to do things and take chances that lead to more happiness and therefore to great results in your work life and your private life .
2 : I ’m not knocking anybody else ’s lifestyle and financial decisions .
This is simply an observation of something that I discovered mostly by accident but which works incredibly well for me .
Maybe you would be terribly miserable living in a small appartment instead of a huge house .
But I know that many people feel trapped in jobs they do n’t like because their financial situation is precarious and leaves them no wiggle room .
If that ’s the case for you maybe you should consider trying the low - rent life and granting yourself some financial freedom .
It ’s a huge step towards more happiness at work and in life .

HE had not expected to spend his 60th birthday in a hospital cardiac unit .
R. J. Turner , a commercial real estate broker from Frederick County , Va. , had planned a robust celebration .
“ I was going to finish my 10th marathon , ” Mr. Turner said , “ which is n’t bad for a guy my age . ”
But near the start of the Marine Corps Marathon on Oct. 29 , Mr. Turner raised an arm to wave at bystanders , and “ everything went black . ”
Collapsing violently , he gashed his head , chipped a tooth and bit a deep hole in his bottom lip .
Mr. Turner , who had passed a stress test a year before , had just had a heart attack .
This has been an unusual season for the cardiac health of marathoners .
After years in which almost no deaths were attributed to heart attacks at this country ’s major marathons , at least six runners have died in 2006 .
Two police officers , one 53 , the other 60 , died of heart attacks at the Los Angeles Marathon in March .
The hearts of three runners in their early 40s gave out during marathons in Chicago in October , San Francisco in July and the Twin Cities in October .
And at the same marathon where Mr. Turner was felled , another man , 56 , crumpled near the 17th mile , never to recover .

He is known as the " hard man " of climate - change negotiation .
But after 12 exhausting days of trying to reach a worldwide agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , it was suddenly all too much for Yvo de Boer .
As the 200 - nation Bali conference wrangled over a minor procedural matter , the Dutch diplomat in charge of the talks burst into tears and had to be led away by colleagues .
Scroll down for more ...
Moments earlier , Mr de Boer had been warning delegates that failure to reach an agreement on global warming could " plunge the world into conflict " .
Officials from China , which feels Western countries should do more to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions , accused UN negotiators of ignoring conference protocol .
Mr de Boer , distinctively dressed in a floral shirt , stepped up to the microphone to defend his staff - only to find that the words would no longer come .
As his unfinished sentences trailed away , he broke down and walked off the platform to supportive applause .
" He was n't just wiping his eyes , he was in floods of tears , " said one observer .
" Three colleagues - one of them a woman - formed a protective group around him and escorted him out of the hall .
It was all very dramatic . "
Mr de Boer 's breakdown came after nearly a fortnight of squabbling over proposals to cut carbon emissions .
The European Union went to the conference demanding that industrialised nations commit to cuts in CO2 emissions of 25 - 40 per cent by 2020 , a stance which was strongly opposed by the US , Canada and Japan .
America 's representatives had also been jeered for insisting on firmer commitments from developing countries -- despite President Bush 's refusal to sign up to the previous targets laid down in the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 .
In the end , a compromise was reached with a text that did not mention specific targets but acknowledged that " deep cuts in global emissions will be required " .
A wave of relief swept the hall as US delegation chief Paula Dobriansky finally declared : " The United States is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
" With that , Mr Chairman , let me say to you we will go forward and join consensus . "
The resulting treaty , known as the " Bali road map " , sets in motion a two - year process of negotiations designed to replace the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
Under the deal , a new pact will be agreed at a meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 .
By then , members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - the organisation of which de Boer is executive secretary - should have agreed on a comprehensive plan involving wealthy and developing nations .
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn hailed the Bali deal as " an historic breakthrough " and a " huge step forward " in tackling climate change .
But Prime Minister Gordon Brown sounded a note of caution .
" The Bali road map agreed today is just the first step , " he said .
" Now begins the hardest work . "
The deal will come as a relief to Mr de Boer , who is known in the Netherlands for his passionate advocacy on the subject .
His reputation as an incisive -- and tireless - negotiator has earned him the " hard man " tag .
However , former colleagues said his behaviour in Bali was not entirely out of character .
Political adviser Matthijs Spits said : " We Dutch can become quite emotional -- surprisingly so for other nations who think we are cold . "

Conservative leaders no easy targets in push for NY medical marijuana legalization Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday September 26 , 2007

For conservatives , a little nuance is required For leaders of New York 's Conservative Party , a group whose membership has been the target of a media blitz this month from organizations promoting a bill that would allow medical marijuana use , a firm stance against a substance that could potentially help the severely ill can be a precarious line to hold .
" My aunt went through years of kidney dialysis , I was there ... her nausea was terrible , " said Shaun - Marie Levine , the Executive Director of the Conservative Party of New York , who does n't deny that components in marijuana could potentially ease a patient 's pain .
" I do n't want to see anyone suffer , but this is a terrible , terrible , terrible bill . "
One reason why , insists Levine , is evidence she says indicates pot is too dangerous to be used medically .
A 2007 legislative memo , supplied to RAW STORY by the Conservative Party relies heavily on an editorial in the UK Independent -- " a very progressive newspaper , " the memo points out -- entitled " Cannabis : An apology . "
The piece reverses the paper 's decade - old position favoring pot legalization due to new evidence it says indicates that new , stronger versions of the drug promote the incidence of psychosis .
" That study they did in England is eye - popping , " said Levine .
" The fact that they 're citing a newspaper article , and one that is n't dealing with medical use at all , is evidence of how completely bankrupt their argument is when you look at the actual science , " countered Bruce Mirken , a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project , one of the groups leading the push for medical use legislation in New York and elsewhere .
And it 's true that the Independent 's piece has taken a severe beating this year from detractors who say the paper cherry picked data claiming powerful forms of marijuana on the market today pose an increased risk for mental illness .
In fact , even the Independent itself piled on in a July article which stated that there was " no evidence that cannabis poses a greater threat to health today than it did 30 years ago . "
A July study in the British medical journal Lancet indicated that marijuana indeed posed a real increase in risk for psychosis among pot smokers , but the Marijuana Policy Project responds to that argument with a press release on its site arguing that the psychosis is so rare to begin with that a pot smoker 's ' increased risk is not necessarily that significant .
" There are plenty of drugs we use medically that have side effects , medications that are vastly more dangerous than marijuana " said Mirken .
" Should n't it be doctors that make that risk - benefit assessment ? "
But party leaders like Levine say they 're not trying to make decisions for medical professionals , but are trying , rather , to ensure that whatever medicinal benefits cannabis may possess come in the form of regulated , FDA - approved drug varieties .
" A lot of your pain relieving drugs are a derivative of opium , " said Levine , " but we do n't go around smoking opium do we ?
So why do we have to smoke pot ? "
She points to emerging drug options like Sativex , an oral medication for the relief of pain and other symptoms of multiple sclerosis , which counts components of marijuana such as THC as its active ingredients .
Available in Canada , the drug is n't yet approved in the United States .
" Should sick people go to jail because Sativex may be available in six years ? " asked Bruce Mirken .
" Sativex is to marijuana as a cup of coffee is to coffee beans . "
" It sounds like they 're only in favor of medicines you have to pay lots of money to drug companies for , " he said of the Conservative Party .
" That 's not a factor , " insists Levine .
" That 's the furthest thing from our minds .
The problem is that it is a mind - altering drug that would be readily available . "
A ' foot in the door '
Mind - altering or not , a laundry list of New York medical associations have signed off on a proposed legalization bill headed for the State Senate , including the Medical Society of the State of New York , the New York State Nurses Association and the New York State Association of County Health Officials .
" People have to be willing to recognize that this is a substance with real medical value for some people , " insists Mirken , who says that opposition to medical marijuana is predicated not only on medical objections , but also largely on cultural divides .
" It 's because marijuana , maybe more than any other drug , carries a lot of cultural baggage -- like the 60's and 70's , " he added .
" This stuff has been around for 5,000 years and some people claim its some new invention by the drug legalizers . "
But Michael Long , Chairman of New York 's Conservative Party , contends there are plenty of other pain - management options for patients .
" I believe we have drugs , legal drugs , that doctors can turn to that help , " Long said .
" No one wants to see people hurting , but marijuana is not the end - all , be -all .
We do n't get into feel - good legislation . "
" And God forbid a patient taking this stuff died , " he continued .
" Is someone going to take [ the unused marijuana ] and start selling it ? "
The party 's most serious objection to the legislation , though , is of the slippery slope variety -- conservatives are fearful the push for medical use is actually just a foot in the door for full - blown decriminalization of the drug .
" It 's step one to moving toward legalization , " Long said .
" Step two is people saying ' we 've lost control of it and it does n't do any harm , why not just let people have it ? "
Shaun - Marie Ellis says advocates ' calls for medical use , if answered , will evolve into calls for recreational use down the road .
" They get their nose in the tent , they get their foot in the tent , they get half of their body in the tent , " Ellis said of what she sees as an incremental move toward general legalization .
" And the next thing you know they 're standing next to you in the tent . "
" That 's the oldest story in the book , " said Vincent Marrone , a spokesman for New Yorkers for Compassionate Care , a partner group with the Marijuana Policy Project , in an email to Raw Story .
" Consider the facts : Cocaine and heroin ... can be ( and are ) prescribed by physicians for medical conditions .
Despite this fact , there is no movement to make them legal ; there are no bills in Albany to do so ... there are no individual legislators calling for it .
Zip . "
" The reason they cling to this argument is simple , " he added .
" It 's blind speculation , and impossible to refute . "
As for the future of the medical marijuana bill in the State Senate , Marrone said hopes are not as high as they once were .
" There was universal expectation that the legislature would convene a special session in September or October ; all those plans went out the window with ' Troopergate , " he said , referring to the ongoing scandal investigation within New York Governor Elliot Spitzer 's administration .
" The odds of a special session are greatly reduced , " he continued .
" We are still working under the assumption that one can occur , but the odds seem long at the moment . "
" We 're depending on support from principled conservatives -- less government , leave decisions to the individual , etc. , " said Mirken .
But pot 's bad rap is a difficult one for advocacy groups to help it shake -- and many just can't accept the drug as a legitimate addition to the medicine cabinet .
" Grandchildren , " as Michael Long explained , " do n't want to see Grandma and Grandpa using marijuana around the house . "

Despite the ominous stormclouds looming overhead , last Friday , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Angel , and Firefly creator Joss Whedon and an estimated 350-400 people , comprised of former Mutant Enemy Productions staffmembers , actors , and fans ( mobilized through Fans4 Writers , with some flying in from across the country and as far away as the United Kingdom and Australia ) , picketed in support of the ongoing WGA Strike in front of 20th Century Fox .
Mutant Enemy staffers at the rally included writers and producers Marti Noxon , David Fury , Tim Minear , Ben Edlund , Jane Espenson , and Drew Goddard , while the actors included Eliza Dushku ( who will be collaborating with Whedon on the forthcoming Dollhouse ) , Nicholas Brendon , J. August Richards , Amy Acker , Juliet Landau , Tom Lenk , Felicia Day , Nathan Fillion , Alan Tudyk , Ron Glass , Morena Baccarin , Summer Glau , Harry Groener , and Camden Toy .
Buffy's own Sarah Michelle Gellar , who is coincidentally this month 's Maxim covergirl , sent over several boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts in support of the strike , while an individual , in a passing Ryder van , expressed his / her disapproval by lobbing two water balloons at the picketers .

DETROIT , Oct. 15  United Automobile Workers leaders approved a new tentative agreement with Chrysler LLC today , clearing the way for a vote by about 45,000 Chrysler workers .
But the leaders of several union locals voted against the contract , which could spell difficulties for its ratification .
Several union leaders said they were concerned that the contract did not include specific promises by Chrysler for future work at their plants , beyond the vehicles they build now .
The meeting of the U.A.W. ’s Chrysler Council was held at Cobo Center in Detroit .
The U.A.W. reached a tentative agreement with Chrysler last Wednesday after a six - hour strike .
The contract is similar to a new agreement between the U.A.W. and General Motors .
Local leaders leaving today ’s meeting said that the contract had been approved by the council , but that the vote had not been unanimous , unlike a similar vote by leaders of G.M. ’s local unions .
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A
Dutch scuba diver became the surprise catch of the day for a 13 - year - old boy fishing in the Netherlands when his hook got caught in the man ’s lip .
“ I heard a sound on my head and immediately I felt a jerk on my lip , ” Wim van Huffelen , who had been swimming in the North Sea , was quoted as saying by Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf .
The daily ran a picture of the diver with the hook embedded in his lower lip .
The diver had been swimming close to the shore near the southern Dutch town of Zierikzee .
A doctor managed to free him from the hook .

Remember that amazing device from Back to the Future that converted garbage into fuel ?
Nowadays that is n’t as far - fetched as it once was .
Everything from liquor and saltwater to diapers to landfills are being used to generate alternative sources of power that run equipment , vehicles and buildings around the world !
Confiscated Booze Converted into Bus-Powering Biogas : nearly 200,000 gallons of smuggled alcohol is snagged by authorities on its way into Sweden each year .
Instead of simply pouring it down the drain , however , authorities have come up with an alternative use for all of the confiscated beverages .
The biogas created from the mixed cocktail of smuggled goods is used to power a variety of vehicles , including buses an a train .
In this win -win situation , customs is glad to be rid of the excess liquid and the country benefits from the fuel produced as a result of the process .
Dirty Diapers Turned into Viable Diesel : one company has a brilliant ( albeit offbeat ) idea for turning what would normally be landfill material into cost - effective , synthetic diesel fuel .
Approximately 30,000 tons of diapers will be annually transformed into over 10,000 tons of diesel fuel at jut 50 cents per liter .
Larger schemes to transform a variety of to - be - landfilled materials have come up short , due to “ some of the issues that come up [ in relationship to ] the consistency of the material you ’re putting through .
One of the beauties of the diaper is that it is going to be a very consistent input .
The other beauty of it is because this whole thing works in a closed system , there are no emissions . ”
Saltwater Burned into Hydrogen and Oxygen : Four years ago , inspiration struck in the middle of the night .
A researcher decided to try using radio waves to kill cancer cells .
Instead , John Kanzius discovered that his radio frequency generator could release the oxygen and hydrogen from saltwater and create an incredibly intense flame .
His wife Marianne heard the noise and found her husband inventing a radio frequency generator with her pie pans .
Experts say his invention could turn into “ a steam engine , a steam turbine .
That could become a car engine if you wanted it to be . ”
The following interview shows the process in action :
Methane Gas Siphoned from Garbage Dumps : decomposing waste gives off methane , which can be cleverly harvested rather than merely wasted .
The increased interest in salvaging this valuable fuel source is also due in part to the environmental impact of burning it off , which is the traditional method of preventing dangerous gas buildups .
Recently , researches have gone so far as to propose and implement methods of increasing methane production within a closed landfill system to get as much fuel as possible from the decomposition process .
More information on gas - from - trash available here and here .
Vehicles Powered by Vegetable Oil and Ammonia : on a smaller scale , industrious individuals have used some unlikely materials to power test vehicles , though their small - time successes could have a larger impact if more widely adopted .
One experimental truck has been converted to run on ammonia .
The result : cheaper fuel , lower emissions and better guess mileage .
Meanwhile , a lawyer in Massachusetts purchased a used ambulance , painted it green ( for a groan - worthy visual pun effect ) , rigged it to run on vegetable oil and now gets to travel over 300 miles for just $ 3 .
When asked about Merrill 's problems , Thain said he had " complete access to all their books and records . "
" I 've talked to them a lot about their exposure to the ... subprime market , " he added , " and they 've been as open as they could be . "
Thain also said Merrill " did a great job " in evaluating their subprime exposure but indicated further writedowns are possible .
Thain has a blue - chip Wall Street resume , with credentials sharpened by running NYSE and his time as a former co-president at Goldman Sachs .
Thain took over the NYSE in January 2004 after longtime CEO Richard Grasso was forced to resign over his $ 188 million pay package .
Thain sought to present a new image for the exchange and pushed through some major structural changes , including the move to electronic trading .
Thain had also been rumored to be a possible CEO candidate for Citigroup , whose chief executive Chuck Prince also stepped down following big subprime - related losses .
No replacement for Prince has been named .
Created Global Exchange
Thain , who is credited with remaking the NYSE into the world 's first truly global exchange , is no stranger to the investment world .
He started out on the bond desk at Goldman Sachs and left the firm as its chief operating officer .
Many say he's also exactly what Merrill Lynch needs after last month 's ouster of Stan O'Neal .
The former CEO was not well liked by Merrill 's army of some 16,000 brokers , and lost their confidence after the company recorded its biggest loss since being founded 93 years ago .
Merrill Lynch ratcheted up a $ 2.24 billion loss during the third quarter because of investments in subprime mortgages and other risky types of debt .
It joined dozens of other major financial institutions who are getting squeezed as investors steer away from riskier securities , causing credit markets to tighten significantly .
There is also speculation by a number of analysts that Merrill may take a $ 3 billion fourth - quarter writedown .
That would be besides the $ 7.9 billion charge taken last quarter .
Merrill originally said it would write down only $ 4.5 billion because of the credit crisis .
Faces Daunting Task
Thain faces a daunting task of cleaning up those investments , and reviving morale at a firm badly bruised during the past few months .
There has been speculation that a new CEO would be forced to turn around Merrill 's fixed income division , a department that he once ran for Goldman in the 1990s .
After being encased in Antarctic ice for 8 million years , ancient microbes thawed by a team of researchers revved up their metabolic engines again and began making proteins and replicating .
These are the oldest organisms ever brought back to life after a deep freeze .
The research team , a group primarily from Rutgers , looked at the microbial population in some of the oldest ice known on earth , obtained from Antarctica ’s Beacon Valley .
Using microscopy , the researchers could see that these samples had a variety of bacteria encased inside .
But microscopy can only tell you so much ; to learn more , the research team turned to DNA sequencing .
The standard way of identifying what you have in a mixed population of bacteria is to sequence the 16S ribosomal DNA - a gene encoding an important component of the protein - synthesizing machinery .
This gene is plays such an important functional role that it changes very slowly over evolutionary time , thus allowing scientists to easily compare DNA sequences among organisms that have diverged from each other for hundreds of millions of years .
The 16S rDNA sequences from these ice samples revealed nearly a dozen different types of bacteria in the 8 million - year - old ice ; that ’s not much compared to a fresh , modern sample of seawater , but that 's great for very old ice .
Some of these ancient bacteria were alive .
When the researchers melted the ice ( but keeping it still cold and dark - these are sensitive bacteria ) , they found that at least some of the bacteria were able start up their metabolism , which was measured using radioactive metabolites that the bacteria could ingest and incorporate into their protein or DNA .
16S rDNA can tell you what kinds of bacteria you have , but another intriguing question is Are most of their genes similar to those of today ’s known bacteria ?
After sequencing as much of the bacterial genomes as they could , the researchers found that a substantial 46 % of the genome sequence did not match any known genes .
This is not actually so surprising - in spite of all of the DNA sequence from thousands of organisms stored in GenBank , we know that we have sampled only a fraction of the different types of genomes on earth .
The genomes of multicellular organisms are relatively similar to each other , but that bacterial world represents a vast , poorly explored genetic resource .
We know most of the genes on our planet are in fact missing from our databases ; we best understand the biology of that small subset of bacterial and archaebacterial genes that was present in the ancestors of all eukaryotic organisms .
While scientists may not know much about most bacterial genes , Bacteria are remarkably generous with their genes ; they pass them on not only to their descendants , but to their neighbors as well .
This phenomenon of lateral gene transfer , or LGT , makes the evolutionary analysis of bacteria fiendishly difficult .
The authors of the ice microbes paper raise another fascinating ( or depressing , if you study bacterial evolution ) possibility : that ancient ice is a “ gene popsicle , ” facilitating gene transfer not only across species , but also .
With the onset of an ice age , microbes , harboring a given set of genes , get preserved for thousands or millions of years , until the ice melts .
That ’s when these ancient bacteria return to the local ecosystem , where they can pass on their ancient genes via LGT to modern bacterial species .
These modern species then , with luck , use these recently revived genes to better adapt to their environment .
As the authors of the paper put it : “ Our analysis suggests that melting of polar ice in the geological past may have provided a conduit for large - scale ...
LGT , potentially scrambling microbial phylogenies and accelerating the tempo of microbial evolution . ”
This is a mind - boggling prediction , which will be difficult to test without a lot more bacterial genome sequencing .
However , the idea again demonstrates the tremendous resources evolution has to work with .
As the biologist Leslie Orgel reportedly once said , “ Evolution is cleverer than you are . ”
May 's spike in the American death toll in Iraq is the result of the administration 's new approach in Iraq – as much as it is the enemy 's own " surge " of attacks against US forces .
In strategic terms , it 's called taking it to the enemy .
But analysts warn that if the number of US casualties continues at their current high level through the summer , that could raise questions about whether the strategy is actually working .
May has already been difficult – the third - deadliest month since the Iraq war began .
In a candid briefing Thursday , Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno , commander of Multinational Corps - Iraq , warned that the situation would be difficult in the months ahead .
But the rising number of Americans killed comes as a result not only of insurgent activity but also from US operations in places that forces have not been before .
Such operations by US and Iraqi forces have had their impact , Lieutenant General Odierno said .
Since January , 17,946 insurgents , terrorists , or other bad actors have been detained .
Of those , nearly 1,500 are considered " high value targets . "
US and Iraqi forces have also killed more than 3,180 enemy fighters ; another 1,016 have been wounded , he said .
Insurgents have reacted to the offensives and are now aggressively using improvised explosive devices as a defensive tactic .
" What we 're finding is , the insurgents and the extremists use [ improvised explosive devices ] as their own little security and support zones and they use large buried IEDs in areas [ where ] we have not been before , " Odierno said .
" And some of them have been somewhat effective , which has raised our death toll . "
Much of the violence is in and around Baghdad , where Odierno said the sectarian lines are blurry and where it can be difficult to allow political reconciliation to occur – and violence to decrease .
But as hard as it is to see the glass half full at times in Iraq , reconciliation , he said , is the real answer to a stable Iraq .
" I will not be too optimistic , I will wait and see ; I 've been here too long to be too optimistic about anything we 've moved forward with , but I do see this as an opportunity , " said Odierno .
" We 're all tired of Iraqis dying , we 're tired of Americans dying , and if we can reach out and conduct reconciliation and come across in a peaceful way , and move forward in Iraq , that is a much better way to do this . "
The number of American casualties tell the story of the toll of war .
As of Thursday , the Pentagon had confirmed 110 fatalities in May with as many as 12 more as yet unconfirmed .
The two deadliest months occurred in April and November 2004 , when major US offensives resulted in death tolls of 135 and 137 respectively .
Much of the recent violence is attributed to the new approach under Army Gen. David Petraeus , the top commander in Iraq .
Under his counterinsurgency strategy – " clear , hold , and build , " now with more emphasis on the hold and build aspects – US forces are more exposed than they were before , conducting more patrols and living in 58 decentralized bases around Baghdad called combat outposts and joint security stations .
The final elements of the surge of US forces announced in January are arriving in Iraq over the next week or so .
Odierno will provide his assessment of progress in Iraq come August .
In turn , General Petraeus , his boss , will provide an overall assessment to President Bush , Congress and the American public come September .
But Odierno cautioned that it 's likely that his assessment could well say that he needs more time to truly make a determination about progress in Iraq .
That sounds about right to T.X. Hammes , a retired Marine colonel and an expert on counterinsurgencies who said the violence was to be expected .
He sees the effort as a long - term one that even now wo n't offer up any overnight solutions .
" People should n't be looking for an answer by September , " he says .
" Counterinsurgencies are a decades - long progress . "
There are other factors that are driving up the violence in Iraq right now .
Al Qaeda is growing stronger , and extremist militias like the Mahdi Army , led by Moqtada al - Sadr , are retaliating , analysts say .
If those factors and others contribute to a sustained level of violence over the summer , one may have to question if the approach under Petraeus is working , says Michael O'Hanlon , a senior analyst at the Brookings Institution , a think tank in Washington .
" If that continues , what it means is that you 're not actually weakening them , but you 're just allowing them to regenerate , and they are capable of doing so , " says Mr. O'Hanlon .
" If the intensity continues ... then it looks like a strategy that is ultimately futile . "
Fatality rates are a dangerous metric to use to gauge success or failure in Iraq , anyway , he says , because there are so many other factors that could play into success or failure in Iraq .
On the other hand , they do say something .
" It is possible that you could have progress and not see US fatality rates go down for awhile , but I think it 's relatively hard to imagine that we would start losing 100 people a month for the summer and be able to term this strategy successful . "
One place that continues to be much more peaceful is Anbar Province , a Sunni enclave to the west of Baghdad .
There has been a nearly 50 percent drop in violence after tribal leaders turned against Sunni extremists and Al Qaeda , providing them with fewer safe havens than those groups had had there .
In May , there were 400 incidents of violence or other attacks in Anbar , down from more than 810 in May 2006 .
In the provincial capital of Ramadi , there were 254 attacks in May last year , and only 30 this month , Odierno said .
But he conceded that Anbar is not as diverse as Baghdad or other areas , making it easier to quiet the violence .
" The success we 've had in Anbar is tremendous , but that is actually one of the simpler places in Iraq , " he said .
" But it 's a good start and we have to build off that . "
Western Digital 's 1TB My Book World Edition external hard drive has been crippled by DRM for your safety .
A kindly Reg reader tipped us off that the remote - access HDD wo n't share media files over network connections .
Which is , as you can see here , the entire stinking point of it .
It 's a scary world full of potentially unlicensed media .
We 're fortunate there 's a hard drive vendor willing to step forward and do some indiscriminate policing for us .
From the WD site :
" Due to unverifiable media license authentication , the most common audio and video file types cannot be shared with different users using WD Anywhere Access . "
You have 20 seconds to comply
WD 's list of banned file types encompasses over 35 extensions .
This includes AAC , MP3 , AVI , DivX , WMV , and QuickTime files .
And - why not ? — Windows TMP files too .
The storage device is billed as a " surprisingly simple and secure way to access and share data and photos " using your home or office network .
And technically that 's true — namely , the " way " in question is not letting you do it .
Abstinence is simple and secure .
You 've got to hand it to Western Digital .
If you must have the drive , you could work around the crippled WD Anywhere Access client app .
Or be satisfied sharing your impressive collection of .doc files .
But this is — supposedly — a remote access hard drive .
So what 's the point if WD is going to use a shotgun feature killing technique and assume there is n't a legitimate and legal reason to share an AVI file ?

Pushing up against almond groves and dirt - bike trails , the row of homes on St. Salazar Circle marks the furthest advance of Modesto's housing boom – and the start of its scorched - earth retreat .
Brown , unwatered lawns of foreclosed homes compete with the green grass of neighbors still hanging on .
Some of the structures , although new , are missing outdoor equipment like air conditioners , taken by metal thieves .
One in 4 houses of the neighborhood stands empty , and mortgage defaults are certain to push even more residents , mostly Hispanic immigrants , out of their homes .
It 's a sign of the home - loan crisis ' uneven impact : light in some areas , heavy in others – often those populated by minorities or the lower - middle class .
The concern now is that the woes concentrated in these pockets of foreclosure will spread outward , causing home prices to spiral down rapidly and broadly .
How far could it spread ?
Much depends on how the overall economy performs .
Things like gas prices , job creation , and pay hikes will affect how many homeowners are driven into foreclosure .
The biggest danger may be the sinking housing market , with negative forces feeding off each other :
Falling home prices , reluctant buyers , distressed sellers , and tighter lending standards by banks .
In a worst case , economists say that a deep national recession is possible .
Home prices could fall as much as 25 percent – more in places like Modesto and less in many towns that saw less of a boom .
Bank woes could make credit dry up , while the declines in construction and housing wealth could hurt jobs and retail sales .
" Those risks are very large , " says housing analyst Celia Chen at Moody 's Economy.com .
" It 's very easy to paint a picture in which even corporations start to cave , " in terms of their willingness to invest and hire .
But most forecasters do n't see that happening .
Instead , many economists expect several quarters of barely perceptible growth – but no recession – followed by a gradual pickup beginning in the second half of next year .
Their reasoning : Jobs and incomes will generally keep growing , thanks in part to growing exports in a healthy global economy .
Policy efforts in Washington could also help to stem the pace of foreclosures .
Even without a recession , the baseline forecast of Ms. Chen and colleague Mark Zandi suggests that US home prices will eventually fall 15 percent from their peak .
And they predict that 2 million home loans – about one in every 25 in America – are slated to enter foreclosure by 2009 .
A crisis from the outskirts in
In the city made famous by the movie American Graffiti , the crisis is unfolding geographically .
On its fringes , new neighborhoods , like the one surrounding St. Salazar Circle , the home - loan crisis has hit the hardest .
Built during the height of the housing boom , they have the newest residents who paid the highest prices with the most exotic mortgages .
After seeing prices rise 10 to 20 percent each year , they 're now seeing prices slide downward .
" Right now , our dreams are being crushed , " says Marisol Ramirez , a wife and mother of three who bought a home on St. Salazar last year for $ 370,000 .
Now , it 's priced at $ 300,000 and the Ramirezes are likely to lose it .
Their troubles began when their home was robbed , something that grew common in the neighborhood with the lack of work and the empty homes .
That sent their insurance rates higher .
Then her husband lost his job in home construction :
No one is building these days .
They have n't made a mortgage payment in three months on their 40 - year , no - money - down loan .
Now they are weighing whether to rent around Modesto or just return to Mexico .
" I stay up at night with the fear that they 'll come and take me out of the house with my children , " Ms. Ramirez says .
Vacant homes surround her : the next - door neighbor , the house at the end of the block , three in a row behind her on St. Charlotte Ave .
Residents around St. Salazar worry about the effects of foreclosures on the area .
On San Ramos Ave. , thieves hauled off a heavy air conditioning system – a prelude to wholesale stripping , seen elsewhere in Modesto , of everything down to the copper wire yanked from the drywall .
That 's the problem with foreclosures concentrated in a neighborhood .
" Default begins to feed on itself , " says Stuart Gabriel , chairman of the real estate school at the University of California at Los Angeles .
The banks holding foreclosed properties try to unload them , sometimes at fire - sale prices , depressing the home values of neighbors .
If those neighbors ' finances are shaky and they hold an exotic loan , the loss of value could trigger another foreclosure , starting the cycle all over again .
In La Loma , neighbors do lawn care
Such problems , in full swing around St. Salazar , are popping up closer to Modesto 's center .
In the leafy La Loma area near downtown , Bill Graham is one of several residents looking after vacant properties .
" I come over here and mow this lawn – for the neighborhood , " he says .
" I hate to see people lose their homes to foreclosures , and I do n't want to see it happen to myself either . "
He 's in danger of losing his main residence and another house in town once the adjustable rates go up again .
He had planned to refinance to consolidate his investments , but that 's looking unlikely .
More than 5,700 homes in Modesto's Stanislaus County are actively under foreclosure or have already been turned back to the bank , according to RealtyTrac , based in Irvine , Calif .
– with a fresh wave expected after February 's reset on adjustable - rate mortgages .
Modesto has been trading honors with nearby Stockton and Merced for the dubious distinction of being the country 's foreclosure capital .
A third of buyers had been investors
In Modesto , investors made up roughly a third of buyers in recent years , says John Hillas , a local appraiser .
That 's bad news for the city , since investors are more likely to default than live - in owners , according to Mr. Gabriel .
The good news is that more established neighborhoods typically have a larger share of owners who have built up equity and did n't use exotic loans to finance their homes .
Risky interest - only and more unusual adjustable - rate mortgages are only a recent phenomenon – ballooning from 1 to 2 percent of loans in 2001 to more than 30 percent by 2006 nationally .
So even in newer Modesto neighborhoods built around 2003 , foreclosures have n't triggered the kind of unease evident in Ramirez 's neighborhood .
Many residents say they are not worried about losing their home because they have fixed - rate mortgages and can wait out the downturn .
" What we 're seeing in the data is that the earlier vintages – those loans originated in earlier quarters and years – are performing better than the more recent vintages , " says Gabriel .
Retail businesses related to housing – everything from appliances to carpet and furniture sales – have seen a downturn .
But local charities and churches see little spike in demand for services , and the city center shows few outward signs of trouble except at the courthouse .
There , underneath one of the staircase entrances , hundreds of pages are tacked up , each sheet noting a foreclosed home to be auctioned that month .
Hispanic names dominate .
Each day at the stroke of noon , Dean Roots arrives at the courthouse steps to read the 40 or so new homes put on the block .
Barely audible above the din of passing traffic and the blowing breeze , she reads the list of properties on offer like a long - memorized liturgy .
For months now , no more than a half - dozen onlookers have turned out for the ritual .
On most days , no one even bids .
" I try not to think about it because a lot of these people have brought it on themselves , " Ms. Roots says .
" You do n't know which ones are hardship cases . "
Back on St. Salazar , Samuel Mendoza checks out a vacant home for sale .
His older brother , Daniel , tags along with his own young child .
Daniel 's home is currently under foreclosure , so his family will be moving in with Samuel when he buys .
Samuel has many suddenly affordable options – an often unsung high note in the housing crisis .
Several homes have already been purchased on nearby San Ramos , a sign that the neighborhood may be starting to stabilize .
As Gabriel puts it , sometimes a " neighborhood has to convulse , it has to turn over . "
Samuel likes the home on St. Salazar , but he 's not about to make a rushed , ill - informed decision .
" We 're going to learn from my mistakes so he does n't go through the same thing , " says Daniel .

Terrorist Poetry : Thought Crime or Threat ?
Samina Malik was arrested and spent five months in jail for her violent prose .
Dec. 10 , 2007  --
If the pen is mightier than the sword , is violent poetry tantamount to terrorism ?
That was the judgment of British prosecutors after they read some of Samina Malik 's poems titled " How to Behead " and " The Living Martyrs . "
The 23 - year - old store cashier , who called herself a " lyrical terrorist , " became the first woman convicted under Britain 's tough terrorism legislation last month after writing the poems and downloading material off the Internet .
Her arrest and the time she spent in jail caused an uproar and is prompting a debate about the value of free speech versus national security , with some of her defenders saying that Malik was charged with a " thought crime , " a scenario straight out of George Orwell 's " 1984 . "
In its potential threat to freedom of speech , some supporters have even compared the case to the detention of Gillian Gibbons , the British teacher jailed in Sudan for naming a classroom teddy bear Muhammad .
Malik , who worked at a WH Smith store in London 's Heathrow Airport , jotted her poems down on the back of cash - register receipts with such memorable lines as " The desire within me increases every day to go for martyrdom . "
Among her crimes was visiting terrorism sites on the Internet .
Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp described Malik 's browsing in detail , telling the jury that she visited a Web site linked to jailed cleric Abu Hamza .
And on a social networking site , she listed as her favorite TV shows : " Watching videos by my Muslim brothers in Iraq , yep the beheading ones , watching video messages by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahri and other videos , which show massacres of the kaffirs [ heathens ] . "
Her friends set up Web sites and blogs condemning her arrest and deliberately tried to provoke authorities by downloading al Qaeda manuals and outlining methods to kill President Bush with depleted uranium bombs .
But after a teary - eyed Malik insisted that she was not a terrorist and only adopted the nickname because she thought it was " cool , " a judge sentenced her last week to the equivalent of house arrest and handed her a nine - month suspended sentence .
Although he said that Malik 's crime was on the " margins " of the offense , Section 58 of Britain 's Terrorism Act , and that she was of " good character , " the judge vigorously defended the legislation :
" The Terrorism Act and the restrictions it imposes on the personal freedom exist to protect this country , its interests here and abroad , its citizens , and those who visit here .
Its protection embraces us all . "
In a statement , prosecutors emphasized that " Samina Malik was not prosecuted for writing poetry .
Ms. Malik was convicted of collecting information , without reasonable excuse , of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism . "
Others felt that the law sets a dangerous precedent and indiscriminately targeted Muslims .
" People write god-awful poetry all the time , are we going to go after all of them ? "
Inayat Bunglawala , a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain , said to ABC News .
" It 's very troubling because many young people will download all types of material from the Internet , which may be nihilistic or disturbing .
Having odious views should not be a crime .
We really get into the area of thought crime . "
Bunglawala , who also condemned the Sudanese arrest of Gibbons , said that both arrests involved violations of free speech even though Malik 's words were violent and hateful .
" They 're convicting her [ Malik ] for her state of mind , as opposed to anything she 's done or planned . "
Malik 's family and neighbors did not return calls for comment .
FBI plans giant database of people 's physical characteristics Scans of irises , faces and palms to be kept in gigantic basement
The FBI is embarking on a $ 1 billion effort to build the world 's largest computer database of peoples ' physical characteristics , a project that would give the government unprecedented abilities to identify individuals in the United States and abroad .
Digital images of faces , fingerprints and palm patterns are already flowing into FBI systems in a climate - controlled , secure basement here .
Next month , the FBI intends to award a 10 - year contract that would significantly expand the amount and kinds of biometric information it receives .
And in the coming years , law enforcement authorities around the world will be able to rely on iris patterns , face - shape data , scars and perhaps even the unique ways people walk and talk , to solve crimes and identify criminals and terrorists .
The FBI will also retain , upon request by employers , the fingerprints of employees who have undergone criminal background checks so the employers can be notified if employees have brushes with the law .
" Bigger .
Faster .
Better .
That 's the bottom line , " said Thomas Bush , assistant director of the FBI 's Criminal Justice Information Services Division , which operates the database from its headquarters in the Appalachian foothills .
The increasing use of biometrics for identification is raising questions about the ability of Americans to avoid unwanted scrutiny .
It is drawing criticism from those who worry that people 's bodies will become de facto national identification cards .
Critics say that such government initiatives should not proceed without proof that the technology really can pick a criminal out of a crowd .
The use of biometric data is increasing throughout the government .
For the past two years , the Defense Department has been storing in a database images of fingerprints , irises and faces of more than 1.5 million Iraqi and Afghan detainees , Iraqi citizens and foreigners who need access to U.S. military bases .
The Pentagon also collects DNA samples from some Iraqi detainees , which are stored separately .
The Department of Homeland Security has been using iris scans at some airports to verify the identity of travelers who have passed background checks and who want to move through lines quickly .
The department is also looking to apply iris- and face - recognition techniques to other programs .
The DHS already has a database of millions of sets of fingerprints , which includes records collected from U.S. and foreign travelers stopped at borders for criminal violations , from U.S. citizens adopting children overseas , and from visa applicants abroad .
" It 's going to be an essential component of tracking , " said Barry Steinhardt , director of the Technology and Liberty Project of the American Civil Liberties Union .
" It 's enabling the Always On Surveillance Society . "
If successful , the system planned by the FBI , called Next Generation Identification , will collect a wide variety of biometric information in one place for identification and forensic purposes .
In an underground facility the size of two football fields , a request reaches an FBI server every second from somewhere in the United States or Canada , comparing a set of digital fingerprints against the FBI 's database of 55 million sets of electronic fingerprints .
A possible match is made - or ruled out - as many as 100,000 times a day .
Soon , the server at Criminal Justice Information Services headquarters will also compare palm prints and , eventually , iris images and face - shape data such as the shape of an earlobe .
If all goes as planned , a police officer making a traffic stop or a border agent at the airport could run a 10 - fingerprint check on a suspect and within seconds know if the person is on a database of the most wanted criminals and terrorists .
An analyst could take palm prints lifted from a crime scene and run them against the expanded database .
Intelligence agents could exchange biometric information worldwide .
More than 55 percent of the search requests now are made for background checks on civilians in sensitive positions in the federal government , and jobs that involve children and the elderly , Bush said .
Currently those prints are destroyed or returned when the checks are completed .
But the FBI is planning a " rap - back " service , under which employers could ask the FBI to keep employees ' fingerprints in the database , subject to state privacy laws , so that if that employees are ever arrested or charged with a crime , the employers would be notified .
Advocates say bringing together information from a wide variety of sources and making it available to multiple agencies increases the chances of catching criminals .
The Pentagon has already matched several Iraqi suspects against the FBI 's criminal fingerprint database .
The FBI intends to make both criminal and civilian data available to authorized users , officials said .
There are 900,000 federal , state and local law enforcement officers who can query the fingerprint database today , they said .
The FBI 's biometric database , which includes criminal history records , communicates with the Terrorist Screening Center 's database of suspects and the National Crime Information Center ( NCIC ) database , which is the FBI 's master criminal database of felons , fugitives and terrorism suspects .
The FBI is building its system according to standards shared by Britain , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
At the West Virginia University Center for Identification Technology Research or CITeR , 45 minutes north of the FBI 's biometric facility in Clarksburg , researchers are working on capturing images of people 's irises at distances of up to 15 feet , and of faces from as far away as 200 yards .
Soon , those researchers will do biometric research for the FBI .
Covert iris- and face - image capture is several years away , but it is of great interest to government agencies .
Think of a Navy ship approaching a foreign vessel , said Bojan Cukic , CITeR 's co-director .
" It would help to know before you go on board whether the people on that ship that you can image from a distance , whether they are foreign war fighters , and run them against a database of known or suspected terrorists , " he said .
Skeptics say that such projects are proceeding before there is evidence that they reliably match suspects against a huge database .
In the world 's first large - scale , scientific study on how well face recognition works in a crowd , the German government this year found that the technology , while promising , was not yet effective enough to allow its use by police .
The study was conducted from October 2006 through January at a train station in Mainz , Germany , which draws 23,000 passengers daily .
The study found that the technology was able to match travelers ' faces against a database of volunteers more than 60 percent of the time during the day , when the lighting was best .
But the rate fell to 10 to 20 percent at night .
Privacy advocates worry about the ability of people to correct false information .
" Unlike say , a credit card number , biometric data is forever , " said Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley technology forecaster .
He said he fears that the FBI , whose computer technology record has been marred by expensive failures , could not guarantee the data 's security .
" If someone steals and spoofs your iris image , you can't just get a new eyeball , " Saffo said .
Inform 7 : Natural - Language Programming Lives
June 18 , 2007 at 11:51 pm
When most programmers think of natural - language programming , they usually think of Applescript – an ambitious yet doomed - to - failure language with English - like syntax that Apple developed in order to automate OS scripting tasks .
Frankly , Applescript in its current incarnation is pretty dismal – any reasonably complex script is positively overflowing with end s and tell s , reminiscent of Ruby ’s slower , dumber cousin .
( Incidentally , 99 % of the pain of Applescript can be removed with Ruby or Python bridges . )
These painful memories , combined with other influential condemnations , will probably lead many programmers to shun Inform 7 and its mission to be “ built by writing natural English - language sentences . ”
However , if you will wait a moment , I will show you the masterful elegance with which Inform 7 mixes modern programming paradigms and the English language .
For those of you unfamiliar with Inform , it ’s a system for writing text adventures – well - known examples include Adventure , Zork , and the famously difficult adaptation of The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy .
Inform was created in 1993 ; in its first six versions , games were written in a procedural programming language with a syntax looking like a cross between Perl and Applescript .
Now , however , games are written entirely in English and then translated with the I7 compiler .
The following is not meant to be a full - fledged I7 tutorial ; the official site does that far better than I ever could .
This is simply a demonstration of how I7 manages to express complex programming concepts entirely in English .
Let ’s look at how we instantiate objects :
The hall is a room .
There , that ’s it .
Same thing as hall = Room.new ( ) or what have you .
Its name “ The hall ” will be displayed correctly when the player enters , leaves or observes it .
What about making new types of objects ?
A bathroom is a kind of room .
Ooh !
Subclassing !
Inheritance !
And it does it concisely and readably , and without using any terms such as “ public ” , “ class ” , or “ extends ” !
Rooms can be clean , dirty , or filthy .
Bathrooms are usually dirty .
Dynamic programming !
We can edit the properties of built - in objects , a lá Smalltalk and Ruby !
The oil drum is a thing .
The oil drum is enterable .
“ Enterable ” in this case is like a Ruby mixin – it allows the player to get in and out of the oil drum and provides it with all the attributes that entails .
Color is a kind of value .
The colors are blue , red and green .
Instead of touching the button : change the color of the button to red .
Note the definition of new enumerable types , subclassing methods ( in this case , ‘ touching ’ ) on existing objects , and changing attribute values .
These are complicated concepts and the fact that the Inform 7 designers have made them expressible in concise English is , frankly , astounding .
Go check it out ; write the Dramatic Lovecraftian Adventure you ’ve had brewing up in your mind for the past few years .
It ’ll be fun .

Entry filed under : code .
Washington DC , September 5 , 2007 - The National Security Archive today sued the White House seeking the recovery and preservation of more than 5 million White House e-mail messages that were apparently deleted from White House computers between March 2003 and October 2005 .
The lawsuit filed this morning in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia names as defendants the Executive Office of the President and its components that are subject to the Federal Records Act , including the White House Office of Administration ( OA ) , and the National Archives and Records Administration ( which is responsible for long - term preservation of federal and presidential records ) , under the records laws and the Administrative Procedure Act .
White House officials ranging from spokesperson Dana Perino to counsel Keith Roberts have acknowledged in press and Congressional briefings that e-mail is missing from the White House archive , and that the EOP in 2002 abandoned the electronic records management system put in place by the Clinton White House .
Whistleblowers cited in conjunction with a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) have alleged that more than 5 million e-mail messages are missing from the White House servers .
" The Bush White House broke the law and erased our history by deleting those e-mail messages , " said National Security Archive director Tom Blanton .
" The period of the missing email starts with the invasion of Iraq and runs through the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . "
Archive general counsel Meredith Fuchs said , " Without court oversight , there 's no guarantee the White House will ever recover the missing e-mails or install an effective archiving system . "
" The law is clear that e-mails count as government records , " said attorney Sheila Shadmand of the law firm Jones Day , which is representing the Archive .
" The White House admits e-mails are missing but we have no assurance they are fixing the problem . "
The National Security Archive , an independent non-governmental organization based at George Washington University , brought the original White House e-mail lawsuit ( which included a wide range of scholarly , library and public interest co-plaintiffs ) against Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush , and Bill Clinton .
That lawsuit produced landmark rulings in the early 1990s that e-mail had to be treated as government records .
Those rulings led to the preservation of more than 30 million White House e-mail messages from the 1980s and 1990s .

Tila Tequila has been Playboy ’s Cyber Girl of the Week .
She has self - published singles titled “ F--- Ya Man , ” and “ Playgirl Central , ” where she proclaims “ I do n't want no love , I just wanna get screwed ! "
She ’s got more “ friends ” than anyone in the history of MySpace .
She recently announced her bisexuality , and stars on a popular new MTV reality show .
Tila has become a sign of the times .
Tila Tequila and her career have prompted ruminations on the nature of celebrity in The New York Times , and she ’s been profiled in TIME magazine .
But more than anything , the Tila phenomenon highlights a pernicious trend in American culture : Celebrating young women only for their “ sexiness ” and their willingness to flaunt it -- rather than for character , intelligence , or talent .
On “ A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila , ” both straight men and lesbians vie for Tila ’s affections .
To do so , they engage in a variety of sexually explicit activities features lewd behavior among the contestants , encouraged and applauded by Tila herself , including group sleepovers and raunchy rounds of “ Truth or Dare . ”
It is the most popular show in its time period among people 18 - 34 , and no doubt has many younger viewers .
Certainly most young people understand that what they ’re watching is more than a little over the top .
But seeing the behavior also normalizes it – and allows women like Tila to set standards for young people all across the United States .
When the culture tells girls that sexual decision making comes down to nothing more than “ if it feels good , do it , ” they become pressured to conform to a sexy ideal that ’s as unwholesome as it is difficult to attain .
That ’s quite a contrast from the days when American society ( and media of all sorts ) reflected a consensus that took into account the dangers – not only physical , but also emotional , psychological and even spiritual – of giving too much too soon .
Now , girls have lost much of the social support that once buttressed decisions to abstain from sex , and parents and clergy are left trying to protect them from a culture that glamorizes sexual promiscuity and exhibitionism .
Because of the example set by “ celebrities ” ranging from Tila Tequila to Paris Hilton ( who came to prominence after the release of a sex tape ) , it seems more difficult to resist the advances of boys interested in nothing more than sex , appropriate to wear revealing clothes , and acceptable to behave in suggestive ways that would have been unthinkable even twenty years ago .
The results are devastating .
Giving too much , too soon can result in girls confronting emotions including regret , anxiety , guilt , shame , and lack of trust in males .
In fact , recent academic research has suggested that even modest sexual experimentation increases the risk of depression for girls , so it ’s worth asking :
Does the widespread sexual behavior celebrated by teen culture explain in part the CDC ’s latest report finding that suicide rates among preteen and young teen girls had spiked by a whopping 76 % ?
It ’s not easy to fight the pernicious messages being purveyed by the culture – but making the effort is important for the mental , physical and spiritual health of America ’s girls .
And as difficult as it may seem to bring about change , it is possible to create a more wholesome teen culture if people realize that their objections to the status quo are hardly idiosyncratic .
After all , concerted effort and dedication on the part of environmentalists have brought us to a point where retailers are beginning to package detergents in smaller , more “ earth - friendly ” bottles and businesses brag about how “ green ” they are .
Government involvement is unnecessary ( and , when it comes to free expression , unwise ) when Americans themselves are willing to confront the sexual saturation of the culture and demand something better .
It ’s high time for a change .
After all , a culture in which someone like Tila Tequila can be vaulted even to the outermost rings of the celebrity galaxy is n’t anywhere that America ’s girls belong .

Wii投票チャンネルのある日の投票結果。 見事に南北に分かれていて興味深かった。
どうして もJavaをマスターしたいというコメントをいただいた。
やはり向き不向きがあるのでしょうか。 一生懸命勉強しても頭に入っていかないのって、もう諦めるしかないのでしょうか…(
´ Д⊂ヽ
Java はほとんど書かないし、プログラマの端くれの端くれな僕が偉そうなことを言っても説得力はないんだけど、自分の経験上でこうしたことが良かったなと思うことを書いてみる。 一瞬、 「 プログラミングが上達するための○○の方法」とかいうタイトルにしようかと思った。ウソ。
プログラミングと適性について
スポーツでも人によって向き不向きがあるように、プログラミングでも人によって向き不向きはあると思ってる。 誰もが「スゴイプログラマ」になれる訳じゃない。
ただ、スポーツでも努力すれば誰でもある程度は上達するのと同じように、プログラミングもある程度は上達するとも思ってる。
さらに幸せなことに、スポーツで食べていける人は本当にわずかな人に限られるけど、プログラミングで食べていける人はそれよりもずっと多い。
食べていけるレベルまでなら、適性はそんなに気にしなくてもいいかもしれない。
誰もが一生プログラミングだけで食べていけるかというと微妙だけど…って、これは「ウェブ時代をゆく」のテーマか。
とにかく、積み重ねしかないんだけどね。
いい本とめぐり合 う
プログラミングの本はたくさん出版されていて、特にJavaは入門書も多い。 でも、（特に入門書ほど）質にバラつきもある。
プログラミングの書籍は単価も高いし、何冊も買うわけにはいかない。
僕は新しいことを覚えようと思ったら、まず本屋に行って「自分のお気に入りの一冊」を探すようにしている。 事前に Web で評判を調べることもあるけど、たいていはその場で立ち読みして比較することが多い。 これが結構楽しいんだよね 。
最初は自分に合う本を探すのが難しい（特に書評だけで決めると後悔することが多い）けど、自分が知りたいことが何かを考えて、それについて書いてある箇所だけを読み比べたりしている。
Cならポインタ、Javaならインタフェース…などなど。
ついでなので、思い出深い本を読んだ順にいくつか挙げてみる。
人によって好みはまちまちなので、特にお勧めする訳じゃない。

雑誌を毎号読 む
本がまとまった知識を一気に身につけるのなら、雑誌は幅広い知識をじっくり身につける。最初は書いてある意味が分からなくても、読んでいるうちに少しずつ分かるようになったりする。 昔は Network Magazine を毎号買って読んでたなぁ。
今なら WEB +DB PRESS や日経ソフトウエアなど（自分が読みやすいと思ったの）を読むといいと思う。
Blog を RSS リーダーで定期購読するのも一つ 。
プログラムを書 く
スポーツと同じで、知識を詰め込むだけじゃ身に付かない。
やっぱり少しずつでも書かないとダメ。 書く機会が少なかったころには、特に痛感していた。
今 は 「どう書く.org」があったりと、書くネタが増えていていい環境が整っている思う。
プログラムを読 む
僕は結構苦手。 意識するようになったのは最近かな。 まずは自分で書いてみて、その後に人が書いたものと比べると特に効果的。
他の言語や環境を試してみる
人によって得意な言語や苦手な言語は必ずあるので、仕事じゃなければ他の言語を試してみるのもあり。
JavaならRubyなどのLLに触れてみるとか。もちろんその逆も。
Linux で vi を使ったあとは、 Windows で Eclipse を使ってみるとか 。
アウトプットを公開する
ここ最近の OpenID についての日記もそうだけど、自分が調べたことを何かアウトプットするのもいいと思う。 別に完璧なことを書く必要はなくて 、
日記に書くことが動機付けになる（本末転倒？）
書くことで考えがまとまる。意外と自分が分かってないことに気が付くことも。
誰かがツッコミを入れてくれることも。
関連して id : amachang のいいエントリを紹介 。
いい人とめぐり合 う
困ったときに聞ける人がいるというのは大切。 ネットがある今は、前よりもたくさんの人に出会える可能性が高いし。
一流の人に触れ る
「 スゴイ人」が何を考えているかを知ることで刺激を受けたり。
反動でたまに落ち込むこともあるけど、私は元気です。
ITpro Challenge!の動画がお勧め。
プログラミング以外のことをやる
あまり根を詰めすぎても集中力が続かない。 何年かかけて少しずつ吸収していくつもりで、息切れしないように続けていくことを意識していたり。
最後に
結城さんが素晴らしい文章を書かれているので、最後にリンク。
こんこさんが、 「プログラミング楽しい」と思える日が来るといいなぁ。

Scott Horton relays a nugget of history I never knew .
Today is Guy Fawkes Day , when the British commemmorate the foiling of a religiously - inspired terrorist plot to blow up the House of Commons in 1605 .
Eventually , it became a holiday fused with anti-Catholic propaganda , and the way in which Fawkes was needlessly tortured , and the monarchy fanned fear of Catholic terrorism to entrench absolute power tarnished the meaning of the holiday .
So George Washington banned its celebration in the United States :
America was involved in a struggle for its liberty , and the commemoration of Guy Fawkes stood for the opposite : government by fear , oppression of a minority , a celebration of arbitrary power .
Guy Fawkes Day was the abnegation of the essential values of the Revolution .
So the original George W. put it in an order : no more Guy Fawkes Day .
Order in Quarters issued by General George Washington , November 5 , 1775 :
As the Commander in Chief has been apprized of a design form’d for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the Effigy of the pope 
He cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be Officers and Soldiers in this army so void of common sense , as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this Juncture ; at a Time when we are solliciting , and have really obtain’d , the friendship and alliance of the people of Canada , whom we ought to consider as Brethren embarked in the same Cause .
The defence of the general Liberty of America :
At such a juncture , and in such Circumstances , to be insulting their Religion , is so monstrous , as not to be suffered or excused ; indeed instead of offering the most remote insult , it is our duty to address public thanks to these our Brethren , as to them we are so much indebted for every late happy Success over the common Enemy in Canada .
America , it was settled , would mark the old Guy Fawkes Day with a new tradition : the exercise of the Democratic Franchise .
It was to be the day on which the rulers are held accountable to the people .
Patna , ( Bihar Times ) :
If the study done by an international agency , Overseas Development Institute ( ODI ) , London , is to be believed that Bihar annually earns more than 9,000 crore in the form of remittance from migrant workers living all over the country .
And if the figure of those living abroad is added than the amount may rise further as Bihar after Kerala and Andhra Pradesh is the third highest exporter of skilled and semi-skilled hands to the world , especially the Middle East , United States , Canada , Europe and Australia .
Pix : Manish Sinh Bihar Deputy Chief Minister , Sushil Kumar Modi while inaugurating the high level meeting on Migration organised by the ODI in Patna also disclosed a revealing fact that only last year 30,000 labours from Bihar have migrated to different countries of the world .
The ODI study conducted by Priya Deshingkar of ODI and Ajay Kumar of Bihar Times also says that the money orders sent by migrant labourers to their families amounts to approximately Rs 450 crore every year .
What is surprising is that this is only five per cent or so of the money which comes to Bihar .
The rest comes through co-villagers .
And at times the seasonal migrants bring money once they are finally back at the end of the season .
Besides , there are several private money order firms operating like internal Hawala flourishing in many parts of North India .
Most of the beneficiaries of these private money order companies  are Bihari migrants living outside the state .
Besides , labour class there are thousands of skilled and educated youths living outside the state who pump money through different ways : bank drafts , private couriers , friends and relatives .
The amount sent through postal money order was even higher about five years back it was as high as Rs 700 to 800 crore , but it declined because more and more people started relying on private money transfer firm .
This because the official money order charges more money .
Besides , sometimes postmen deliver the amount after much delay as they lend the amount to earn interest from these amount .
Bihari migrants of Delhi send maximum amount of money to be followed by those living in Punjab and West Bengal .
These migrants are not educated enough to have their bank accounts .
It is only the skilled and semi-skilled migrants living within the country and outside who rely on banks and Western Union to transfer money back home .
If that amount is added Bihar would certainly become the largest overall remittance earner in the country .
True there is very few industry in essentially agrarian Bihar , but its rich human resources have really brought about a big social and economic changes in the last two decades .
This has both positive and negative impacts .
While money is getting pumped into the state from different ways there is rise in social tension within the family , marital discords have increased and incident of rapes have also risen significantly .
According to the Census 2001 the number of permanent migrant labourers going out of the state stand at over 24 lakh .
The figure had got doubled between 1991 and 2001 .
This figure does not include seasonal migrant labourers estimated at around another 70 lakh and working almost everywhere across the country .
Comment T he news is very encouraging that biharis are remitting to their home land , this proves two things , one they are hard workers and that out side state or the country they are most law abiding too , but the question arises what the goverment is doing for those who come back home from form differnt state or out side the country , there is no programme at the government level to cater to the needs of the NRI 's from Bihar .
DR ANWER AHSAN
DAMMAM , KSA aa_drpedsurg@yahoo.com
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The remittances to our state can move number one among Indian states and this can help to development contribution a lot in all field
In fact state government have to take ( is taking but little ) proper and effective steps towards Biharee human resources for long term basis and this must be above the political party level , religious level , cast level , area level etc .
The perfect policies implementation to target our future generation destiny will sure boost us as " Harit Karanti " save millions of Indian from starvation .
We must concentrate to improve skilled labour force and for that few section of the state has to be high quality level to compete others not only to migrate inside India but to the world market of human resource .
1 ) We need to maintain law & order to provide safety , securities by physically and mentally .
2 ) Education is the best way to counter maximum problems and we need high quality Industrial , Mechanical , Bio medical , Management institutes , colleges to produce high class Degree and diploma holder work force .
3 ) We need financial education institutes to produce , Charter accountant , Finance Management diploma / degree for finance executives Finance Managements for Non Finance executives .
4 ) Good infrastructure is also an assurance to bring developments and we need our main cities road to be maintained properly and make sure to provide connectivity from villages to towns .
5 ) " Patna Air Port " is ignored since long and it should be facilitate to provide international flights landing facilities either in same place or move to some where near to Patna , Hajipur area .
6 ) There should be domestic airport in the simanchal area
7 ) Government should provide latest information and assistance to migrant or to be migrant work force in each districts headquarter .
I hope our government will work positively toward my suggestions and these points are concerned by maximum Biharee expatriates including overseas Biharee all around the world .

〜 第 38 回 笹田 耕一さんの巻 〜
今回のゲストは、東京大学大学院の笹田 耕一さんです。 笹田さんは今最も注目されているプログラミング言語
Ruby の処理系 YARV の開発をされています。 今回のインタビューでは、笹田さん と
Ruby の出会いから YARV を開発するまでの道のり、さらに YARV のコアな部分に関するお話まで頂きました。 Ruby 1.9 のリリース、楽しみですね！
尊敬する人 植松伸 夫
好きな言葉 「 人生思うがまま」（植松伸夫）
愛用のツール xyzzy 、IRC
現在のお仕事につい て
---最初に、今どういうお仕事をやっておられるか、お話していただけますか？
東京大学大学院の情報理工学系研究科創造情報学専攻で特任助教をしています。ここ、情報理工学系研究科秋葉原拠点は、創造情報学という最近できた専攻のラボになっているんですが、主にここに常駐しています。
そこで具体的に何をしているかといいますと、文科省の「先導的
IT スペシャリスト育成推進プログラム」というプロジェクトに従事しています。産業界から「きちんとわかる
IT 技術者が少ないので大学もなんとかしてくれ」という要請があったらしく、文科省の公募により、数拠点が選ばれました。
で、東大と東工大と NII （国立情報学研究所）の 3 つの研究機関が協力してそのうちのひとつ 「情報理工実践プログラム」を行っているんですが、私はそこに雇われている、というわけです。
この拠点では、実際にソフトウェアを作ることができる人材の育成を目的としています。例えば、東大ではソフトウェア開発案件を学生さんや教員によって提案してもらい、実際にチームを組んで開発してもらいます。このプロジェクトを通じて、ソフトウェア開発のプロセスを経て、スキルを身につけてもらおうというものです。その他、企業の方にエンジニアリングパートナー（EP）として適宜プロジェクトに助言を頂きご協力を頂いています。
---ソフトウェアはどういうものを作られてるんですか？
いくつかプロジェクトがあるんですが、例えば、Ruby に関連するプロジェクトですと「 Ruby の文法チェッカー」を作ってもらっています。Ruby は動的なプログラミング言語なので、コンパイル時にわかるエラーがとても少ないんですよね。ただ、「こういう時にはこういう警告出せるよね」など、人間が見たら明らかに間違いだと分かるけれど、処理系には分からないような間違いというのがあります。そういうのをがんばってチェックするツールです。Java では FindBugs なんかが有名だと思いますが、その Ruby 版を目指しています 。
で、そういうプロジェクトの傍ら、自分の研究として、Ruby 処理系の開発、そしてこれを使った研究を行っています。
Ruby との出会 い
--- Ruby との出会いは何だったんですか？
大学 4 年生の研究室配属のとき、何か新しいプログラミング言語をやってみようと思ったんです。そこで、評判が良さそうだということで
Ruby をやってみたら、なんとなく手に合ったんです。でも、最初は全然分かんなかったんですよ。 例えば繰り返し文 、3 回の繰り返しなんか は
Ruby では 3.times {...} って書きますけど、当時そういう感覚がわからなくて。times メソッドに辿りつくまでに 1 ヶ月くらいかかったんですよ。 リファレンスマニュアルやまつもとさんの 「 オブジェクト指向プログラミング言 語Ruby 」を読んで、だいぶ理解が進みました。
で、そんな中で Rava * 1 を作ってみて、 「 あぁなるほどこういうふうにやってくんだ」と、Ruby が使えるようになりました。
* 1JavaVM on Ruby - ジョークソフ ト
--- Rava を作るきっかけというのは？
日本ソフトウェア科学会っていう学会のイベントで、「ガーベジコレクション」を解説するチュートリアル、というのがあったんですよ。
そのゲストがすごい豪華で、湯淺太一先生と、まつもとさんと、前田敦司先生だったんですね。
このお三方がそれぞれ GC の偉い人な訳ですよ。これは行かねば、と思い行ったわけです。その時、前田さんが仰ってたのが、「ガーベジコレクションのある言語でガーベジコレクションのある言語を作るのはすごい簡単だ」と。まぁ、当然なんですけど。で、それを聞いてその気になった昔の自分が、「じゃあ、Java VM 作ってみると簡単かな」と思い、冗談で作りました。
大学の 3 年生のとき 、 「 半年かけてなんでもいいから何か作れ」という課題があったんですが、そのとき
C++ で JavaVM を作りました。なので 、JavaVM
がどういうものか、という知識があったので、Ruby で楽に書けました。ガーベジコレクションは勝手にやってくれるし、スレッドも勝手にやってくれるし。Rava を作ってみて、プログラミングのしやすさを実際に経験して「
Ruby はなんて便利なんだ」と思った次第です。
---チュートリアルではまつもとさんに声をかけました？
まつもとさん、きっと覚えてないんでしょうけど。
私、その講演で一番前の席に座っていたんですよ。で、隣が空いてたんですが、まつもとさんの講演が終わったら、そのまま私の隣に座ったんですね。「うぁ〜まつもとさんだぁ！」と思って、ドキドキしながら何もしゃべれないでいました。
---あはは(笑)
最後の最後に勇気を振り絞って 、「 Ruby はネイティブスレッド対応しないんですか？」って聞いたんですよ。 そしたら 「そんな事はとりあえず考えてない」と言われまして。
なんの因果なのか、自分が今ネイティブスレッドに対応させる仕事をしてるんですね。なんか面白いですね。
YARV * 2 〜もは や
Yet とは言えない次期 RubyVM 〜
* 2Yet Another Ruby VM
2003 年ごろ 、「 Ruby ソースコード完全解説 」っていう書籍の読書会に参加しました。「 Ruby の処理系がこんなにダメなんだ」という事が、よく分かる本なわけです。「こう直したら速くなるんじゃない」ってのは、
誰が見てもそう思うんですけども、まあ誰もやってなかったんでやってみた、という経緯で開発を始めました。博士後期課程の 1 年生のときから趣味でそれをやっていたら、それにかかりきりになってしまって、そんな時、運良く
IPA の未踏ユースに通ったんですよ。
---それが今の YARV のベースですか ？
そのものですね 。
---なるほど。今、処理系の開発をされていて、苦労されているところはありますか？
Ruby っていろいろ知らない機能がたくさんあって難しいんですよね。今でもいろいろ知らない機能があったりして。
例えば、いろんな場所にいろんなものが書けちゃうとか。例えば、こういう式が書けるんですね、オプショナル引数に指定する式に何でも書けるんですよ。メソッドの再定義を書いてみるとか。
---はい(笑)
他にも、クラスの継承するときには、こんな風に書くんですけど、実は継承元クラス指定の部分には、任意の
expression が書けるので、例えば、ここでクラス定義を書くとか。
あと、if 文でメソッド定義を囲めるので、コンパイル時にはそのメソッドが追加されるかわからない、とかがありますね。
こんな感じでいろんなところに書けちゃうんで、全部動的に処理しなければなりません。というわけで、コンパイル時に自動的に決まらないんです。そういう意味で最適化はすごくやり辛いんですよ。ただ、すごくやり辛いからやりがいがあるというか。私自身最適化が好きなので、凄く楽しんでます。
--- Ruby の VM って良く分かってないんですが、例えば 、Java のバイトコードにあるようなクラスの定義がそもそもないんでしょうか？
クラス定義をどういう意味でとらえるかってこともあるんですが、Java の感覚でいうと「ない」といったほうが正しいと思います。先ほど、メソッド定義式を if 文で囲むことができる、って話をしたんですが、そういうことをサポートするためには、クラス定義はクラス初期化プログラムとして提供しなくてはいけないんですね。
つまり、クラスを定義するっていう命令があるんですよ。
で、クラス定義時にはそれを実行します。具体的には、defineclass っていう VM
命令があって、それを実行すると、クラス定義プログラムを実行する、っていう、そんな実装になってます。
あと、嫌らしい点としては、よく evil eval って言われてるんですけど、 eval でどんな式でも書けちゃうんです。どんな式でも書けるって事は、現在のコンテキストに対していろんな破壊的な操作ができる、つまり、例えば、ここでクラス
C の定義をしている時に、クラ ス C のメソッド追加する事もできるんです。逆にメソッド取り除く事もできる。
そんなことを考え出すと、eval が出現した時点で、もう解析が不可能なんですよ。
Ruby の厳密な文法を守ろうとすると。 「 じゃあこの eval をちゃんと監視すればいいじゃない？」って 思うんですけれども、 「 じゃあこの eval がエイリアスで他の名前になってたらどうする？ 」とか。eval で eval の alias を定義されたりしたら、もう解析不能なんですよね 。
---ん〜面白いですね。C とか Java とかの最適化と、たぶん全然違うんですね？
そうですね。 「なんでこんな事ができないんだ」ということがよくありますね。例えば、ループ不変式の除去とか、そういうのがなかなか出来ない。
---ん〜なるほど。すごいですね…
とかなんとか、そういうのがあって、最適化とか「そんなのすぐやればできるじゃん」っていうのがなかなかできない言語ですね。
コンパイラの知識って、1950 年代から脈々と続いてきて、いろんな研究があるんですけど、
そういう研究の成果がなかなか活かせない言語になってると思います。
---それはやっぱり、なんでもかんでもダイナミックだからですか？
そうですね。表現力の高さを求めるか、性能を求めるかって事だと思うんですよね。もちろん、今までもそういう動的な言語はあって、研究もたくさん行われているので、そういう技術はいろいろ導入できると思います。というか、YARV
はそういう技術を出来る範囲で取り込んでいます。
ネイティブスレッド対 応
---今されているネイティブスレッド対応の話を聞かせて頂けますか？
YARV は、今リリースされてい る 1.8 の処理系の構造をガラッと変えちゃったので、
スレッド周りも大分変っちゃったんです。で、その際にネイティブスレッド対応させました。今年の 12 月に実際それが入ったものをリリースする予定です。多分。リリースするためのバグ出しを、今まさにやってるところですね。
---じゃあ 1.9 へのインテグレーションみたいなのが今回の未踏のテーマですか？
そうですね 。
あと、それにプラスして、まだやり残している最適化やドキュメンテーションをやっています。
---スレッド周りってなんでそのネイティブスレッドに変えられたんですか？
性能的な側面ですね 。
ちょっと、表を作りましょうか。 1.8 がユーザレベルスレッドで、 1.9 はネイティブスレッドです。 スレッドの切り替え時にスタックのコピーが発生するんですよ。
---はい
ここの性能に注目していて。
現行の Ruby 1.8 では、移植性を高めるためにマシンのスタックポインタを触らないようにしています。単に、マシンのスタックをコピーして入れ替えるという方式でユーザレベルスレッドを実装してる。で、ちょっとスタックが深くなるとコピーのオーバーヘッドが大きくなるんですね。 例えば、 1.8 でスレッドの切り替えをガンガン発生させるとすごく遅いんですよ。
で 、1.9 のネイティブスレッドだと、スレッドの切り替えってのは、おそらくネイティブスレッドによるマシンレジスタ（スタックポインタ）を切り替えるだけで済むのですごく速い。ネイティブスレッドの実装によりますけど。
--- 1.8 のスタックを全部コピーするような実装がちょっとイマイチって事ですか？
ええ。
---なるほど
で、それをやらないためにはいくつか手段があるんですよ。
ただ、ポータビリティを取るとやっぱりネイティブスレッドしかないということですね。
---ふんふん、なるほど
ほんとはユーザーレベルでいろいろやればいいんですけど、
環境が限定されているのであれば。
スレッドの生成などの操作はユーザレベルなので速いんですよね。ネイティブスレッドだと遅いんですよ、たいていはシステムコールが走るから。
Java なんかだ と 「 スレッド生成なんて最初にまとめてやるだけでしょ」って言ってもらえると思うんですが、これまで
Ruby スレッドの生成って軽かったので、 Ruby ユーザはみんなどんどん作ってるんですよね。今後は、そういうスタイルを避けないと性能が上がらないと思います。
---並列性っていう話だと？
並列性についてはどっちもダメですね。 デュアルコアでも速くならないです。
「 ネイティブスレッドにしたら勝手に並列化してくれるじゃん」って思うかもしれませんが、
勝手に並列に実行されると、世の中に大量にある拡張ライブラリが全然動かなくなっちゃうんですよ。
全然スレッドセーフに作られてないから。
---それは C のライブラリですか？
はい。
---もしかして、それを解決しているのが
Giant Interpreter Lock？
そうです。 拡張ライブラリを保護するためにやっぱりスレッドを一つしか走らせないようにするために、ロックを使っています。Python とかだと Giant Interpreter Lock って言っていて、私は Giant VM
Lock って呼んでいます 。
論文で 「それをなんとか並列化させましょう」という話は書いたんですけど、
完成度を上げるにはもっと時間が必要だと思います。
他の方法としては、例えば Ruby レベルで排他制御をかけてもらうようにする、という方針があります。つまり、排他制御の責任を
Ruby プログラマに任せてしまう、ということですね。処理系レベルでは、何もフォローしないという方針です。ただ、この方法では、Ruby プログラマが排他制御を怠るとセグメンテーションフォールトみたいな事が起こってしまうことになります。この方法の実現は楽、というか、実際は何もしないので、すぐにでも実現できますが、Ruby 処理系としては、出来る限りセグメンテーションフォールトが起こらないようにしないといけない、っていう方針があるので、簡単にこっちの方針を選ぶべきではないと思っています。もしかしたら、起動時のオプションなんかで選べるようになると嬉しいかもしれませんね。自分で全部責任をとれます、って人のために。
セグメンテーションフォールトのような、致命的なエラーを避けるためには、すべての拡張ライブラリなどに適切な排他制御をかけなければならないんですよね。で、組み込みクラス、たとえば
String や Array のコードを見てみると、それぞれ 5000 行とか、それくらい の C 言語のソースコードで構成されてます。これらのコードを全部、1 行 1 行見て、スレッドセーフにするっていうのは、ちょっとマンパワーがないと厳しいですよね。逆にマンパワーがあれば、なんとかなる話だとは思います。結局ボトルネックになるのって、文字列処理とか
Regexp の処理とかになっちゃうので、そこがうまく並列化されないと結局速くならないんですよ。
---将来的にはどうなんですか？
そうですね、なので、マンパワーがあれば明るい未来があるのかもしれません。たとえば、こういう並列化対応作業に、人をつけてくれるような企業なんかがあれば、実はすぐに並列化が実現するかもしれません。でも、ちょっと望み薄ですかねぇ。
もっと将来的な話をすると、本当にスレッドが並列に動いて嬉しいのかっていうのがあります。例えば今
Erlang がすごい流行ってるじゃないですか。あれって、軽量スレッドとか言ってるけど、副作用がないからできる話で。そんな感じで、今考えているのは
Ruby の VM を複数立ち上げるようにして、その VM 間でアイソレーションさせて、 そいつらが並列に走らせるような構成です。
--- MVM * 3 でしたっけ？
* 3Multitasking Virtual Machine
はい。実は今それを真面目にやろうとしています。
--- Erlang のような言語が注目されてるのは、結局、今のスレッドプログラミングモデルには、もうみんな耐え切れないということだと思っているのですが、笹田さんは、どう思われていますか?
実際、私もそれは使う側から見ても実装する側から見ても「共有スペースって嫌だよね」という気持ちはわかります。しかし、「じゃあ
Erlang でやりたいですか？」聞かれたら 、Erlang でプログラミングはあまりしたくないですね。あまり知らないので食わず嫌いですけど。やっぱり人間の頭ん中って副作用で考えるのは自然な処理っていうのはあると思うので、ではそこをどう折り合いを付けるのかなって事が重要な話なんだと思います。すごいありきたりな話で申し訳ないんですけど、副作用を認める部分とそうじゃない部分とで分けて、両者が自然と連携する形にするしかないのではないかと。Erlang みたいなところまでやっちゃうと、逆にやり辛いので、そこのバランスですよね。
Ruby って、領域は違いますけど、 例えば Lisp のいいところとか Smalltalk のいいところとか、いいとこどりしていて、なんとなくバランスよくまとめたっていうのがあるので、じゃあ並列に関してもそういうバランスがきっとあるので、そのうまいバランスを探っていければなぁとは思ってます。
---その辺はなにか考えられてるということですか？これから具体的にこういうふうにしたいとか？
とりあえず MVM 化すると、どんなふうにプログラムができるのか、どれくらい幸せになれるのか調べていきたいなと思っています。
プログラミング言語は自分に合ったものを
--- Ruby 以外の言語って、どんなものを使われますか？
C を高校の頃からやってて、 大学で C++ を真面目にやり出して、 その頃は C++ で「 STL すごい！」とか、 「テンプレート万歳」とか思ってたんですけど…今は
C++ 全然使えないですね。難しくて。
---すごい事になってますからね。
C++ をやるんだったら 「もう Ruby でいいじゃん」みたいな。
テンプレートの細かいところとか、デストラクタの細かいところとかは、もう覚えてないですね。
Java はなんだかんだで、使う機会というか読む機会はあるので、使うこともあるんですが。Windows 用 GUI アプリケーションだった ら C# を使います。スクリプト言語は 、Ruby 以外は Perl や Python 、PHP みたいなものは良く知らないので使えません
。Haskell とか ML とかも、入門書を読むレベルなので使いこなせていません。
---言語自体にそんなにこだわりはないんですか？
そうですね 。Ruby はいろんな意味で好きな言語なんですけど、人に言うときは「 絶対、
Ruby がいいですよ！ 」とは勧めないようにはしています。やっぱ自分に合ったものって違うじゃないですか。人や状況によって適してる言語って違うと思うので、「絶対
Ruby いいよ！ 」 とは言えないです 。
---そうですね。人だったり、状況だったり、いろいろありますからね。
ただ、学生や後輩などには、 「 かならず 1 個スクリプト言語を覚えて」という風には言うようにしています。なんでもいいからひとつ。やっぱり、何か簡単な作業をするために自分が使いこなせる言語があると便利ですから。ちょっとした集計プログラムを
C で組み始める人がときどき居たんですが、「 ほら、 Perl だとこんだけで出来るよ」みたいに教えてあげたりします。
---なぜこんなこと聞いたかっていうと、まつもとさんは
Ruby は好きなんだけど、すごく言語オタクというか、すごいいろんな言語が好きって感じじゃないですか。
あぁ、なるほど。私は他の言語は全然知らないです。まつもとさんほど。
Rubyist Magazine の「他言語探訪」っていう連載をまつもとさんに書いてもらってるんですけど、よくあんなに知ってるなぁとか思いながら、「なるほどこんなふうな、こんな言語があるんだ」と、私も楽しく読ませてもらってます。
---1996 年くらいですかね。たぶん
Ruby がまだ全然メジャーじゃない頃、私、 fj * 4 とかでまつもとさんや高木さんや久野さんがたくさんいろんな事を書いていて、「あぁ〜世の中にはすごい言語好きな人たちがたくさんいるんだなぁ」とずっと思ってたんですよ。
*4ネットニュースの１つ。様々なカテゴリで、議論が交わされている。
今、そういう場ってないですよね。この前 nifty の tty もクローズされちゃったって話あるし、fj も、もう 。
---たぶんもうダメですね fj も。
じゃあ今ほんとにそういう議論したい人がどこでやってるかっていうと、今ないですよね、たぶん。そういう濃い話ができる所がだんだんなくなってますよね。いや、私が知らないだけかもしれないんですけど。
環境的にはすごい豊かにはなっていて、手を伸ばせばいろんなものがあるようになっていると思います。だけど、ほんとにコアなものに、なかなか出合えないっていう状況な気がします。そういう意味で
Ruby の処理系開発させてもらってるってのは、すごく恵まれた環境にいると思っています。
オブジェクト指向へのこだわり
---オブジェクト指向ということにこだわりはあるんですか？お話を聞いていて、最初はそうだったのかもしれないですけど、今はそれほどこだわりないのかなぁと。
そうなんですよ。( 苦笑 ) 最初、オブジェクトの広場とか読んで勉強してたんですけど、さっぱりわかんなくて…。(苦笑)
だけど 、Ruby の処理系っ て C で書かれているけど、すごくオブジェクト指向を意識した形になってる…らしいです。 らしいですというのは、私は
「そうだ」と断言できないんですけど。そういうコードを読んでいくと、「オブジェクト指向とはこんな風に作っていくのかな」というのはなんとなく分かってきたんだと思います。ただ、「これがオブジェクト指向だ！」と言えるぐらいには全然なってなくて「じゃ、これ設計して」って言われたら「えっ？」っていう風になっちゃう感じですね。
例えば、最初から UML 書いて設計したりってのは、私全然できなくて、とりあえずコード書いてみて、それからクラスにまとめていって全体像とそれぞれの関連を考える感じで…。こんなこと、ここで言ってもいいんだろうか。
Rubyist Magazine - るびま 〜 Rubyist のRubyist による 、Rubyistとそうでない人のためのウェブ雑誌〜
--- Rubyist Magazine はなぜ始められたんですか？
日本 Ruby の会というのが数年前に出来まして、そこでなんか活動したいってことで、有志が集まって作り始めました。当時は、Rails ブームの前だったこともあってか、あまりまとまった情報がなかったので、そういう場を作ろうって。Ruby の言語それ自体よりは、たとえばライブラリの使い方とか、Ruby 関連アプリケーションの使い方とか、そういう補助的な情報を集めることに重きをおいています。
そういえば 、Rubyist Magazine でインタビューしてるのは、全くオージスさんの真似なんですよ。大学入った頃、一時期メーリングリスト等で情報を集めてる時があって、
その時オブジェクトの広場に興味を持って、メーリングリストを見て、「こんな人たち、あーこんな話があるんだ」って思ったんですね。で、Rubyist
Magazine を始めるにあたって、 「まぁとりあえずインタビューしときゃ見栄えがするだろ」と思っていました。
---はい
みんなも読みたいだろうし。 で、やってみたらやっぱりあんな風に綺麗に編集するのはエライ大変だという事を知りましたね。
---めちゃめちゃ大変ですよあれは。(笑)
我々の方はもうだらだらと普段通りの会話を続けているというのが売り、なんですけど。
---多分、スタイルの違いだと思うんですよ。るびまのインタビューの方は、その人の雰囲気とかを割と残したまま、続いていくっていう印象がありますよね。
そういって頂ければ 。
しかし、不思議な話ですよね。まさかここで、そんなふうに参考にさせて頂いた者がインタビューして頂けるなんて。
プライベー ト
---好きな本、音楽、映画ってどんなものがありますか？
映画は、話題作とかテレビでやってたら観る程度ですね。
マンガや小説も、読みます。特に好きな何かってわけじゃないんですけど、あれば読みますね。
最近読んだ本だと、西尾維新さんとかグインサーガとか。あと、ブログは定期的に読みます。
Ruby Hotlinks っていう Ruby 関係者のアンテナサイトがあって、その人たちのブログとか。
あとは 、SF ですかね。そういえば、るびまのインタビューとかしてると、みんな
SF 好きなんですよね 。
---濃い人多いですよね。 SF 好きっていうと 。
ええ、私全然ついていけないんですよ。「あれば読む」程度だったので。で、ある時そういう話を日本
Ruby の会の会長の高橋さんにしたら、あの人はもうむちゃくちゃ
SF の人で、 「じゃ、これ読め！」ってガンって本をたくさん渡されて。お借りして、まだ読み切れてないんですけど。(笑)
音楽だと、たとえばゲーム音楽のようなのが好きです。一番好きなのはファイナルファンタジーの曲なんですが。作曲者の植松伸夫さんの音楽が好きなのと、とかそういうのを知る、聞くのが好きですね。
尊敬する人は、そのファイナルファンタジーの曲の作曲者の植松伸夫さんで…いい年してファンクラブとか入ってるんですけど。
私が中学校の頃に、「人生思うがまま」というエッセイを氏が出したことがあって。そのタイトルが私の座右の銘ですね。人生は思ったとおりのものになる、という。思いどおりになるって意味ではなくて、思ったもの勝ちというか、そんな意味です。
---休日はどういうふうに過ごされてますか？
寝てます 。
---寝てます？(笑)
空いてれば寝てます。(笑) 「 土日というリソースはすごい有限である」ってのをよく聞くんですけど、土日って勉強会が多いじゃないですか。
---多いですね。
勉強会、イベントがいっぱいあって、月 4 回それに出ると、もう半分つぶれるんですよね。
---はい。
じゃ残りはどうするかっていうと、寝たりとか、プログラミングしたり、やりたいゲームがあったら、ゲームやったり。
---趣味が Ruby 関係で、それで休日も消費されている感じなんですかね？ 勉強会に出られたり、プログラミングされてたり。
そうですね。例えば、一日まるまる空いてたら、そこでなんかプログラミングして、ノッてるといつの間にか次の日になってるという感じですか。
愛用のツール 〜
Emacs よりも xyzzy 〜
---愛用のツールってありますか？
xyzzy ですかね 。
---おぉ〜。
Emacs は使えないんで私…。なんか細かいことやろうとすると、
Emacs って使い勝手がよくわからなくて 。
あと IRC はたくさん使います。今 twitter * 5 とか流行ってて 。
* 5 米国 の Obvious 社が提供しているオンラインサービスの一種
なんで流行ってるんだろうって不思議だったんですよ。
みなさん IRC を知らないからかなぁとか思ってるんですが。まぁ、インターフェースや根本的な思想とかが違うとは思うんですが。
そういえば 、Ruby の開発って IRC で行われることがけっこうあるんですよ 。
---そうなんですか？
バグレポートが来ると、まず IRC で議論が起こって、どう直すか話しますね。
「 こんなパッチでどうですかね」っていう人がいたり、「どういう風に解決しようか」とか、
そんな話を IRC でしてたりとかするので。そういう意味で、私にとって
IRC はすごく重要なツールですね 。
---やっぱり、リアルタイムに話せて、記録も残るからですかね？
そうですね 。
Ruby で nadoka っていうツールを作ったんですよ。 madoka という perl で書かれたソフトウェアが元々あったんですが、そ の
Ruby clone です 。IRC サーバがいて、プロキシ（nadoka）がいて、クライアントがいて、という構成。それを
Ruby で作って、 いろんな機能が追加できるようにしました。例えば、グーグルの検索が IRC の画面でできるとか 。
若手エンジニアへのアドバイス
---最後に、若手のエンジニアに対して何かアドバイスを頂けますか？
今、私も若手だというつもりなんですが…。(苦笑)
---いやいや、もっと若手に。(笑)
勉強会とか積極的に出るのがきっといいですよね。
例えば、学生で大学の中だけで閉じこもっちゃうと、そこに良いコミュニティがある場合はいいんですけど、
なかなかそういう機会ってないので、外に出ていろんな物を見るのが、いいんじゃないですかね。
すごくありきたりな話ですけど。
---重要だと思いますよ。企業にいてもやっぱり同じで。外に出ると、とてつもなくすごい人とかに出会って、自分の位置を感じたりできるのって、すごく大きいと思いますよ。
そうなんですよね。 今、なんだかんだいっ て Ruby でだいぶいろんな方と知り合いになれて大変よかったと思います。
ただ、逆にいうと、今ちょっと Ruby の中で閉じこもっちゃってる感じで 「 じゃそろそろ他のことでもやるか」というか、やらないといけないかなぁと思っています。いつまでも
Ruby だけじゃだめだよね、と 。
---なるほど。
何の因果か研究者をやっているので、職業柄、Ruby
以外のことも世界を広げていかないとまずいんですよね。今、模索中です。 同じ VM つながりで、最近バーチャルマシンモニタの
Xen とかを調べています。低レベルな話には興味がもともとあったので、今そういうのを勉強していて、なんか面白いこと出来ないかなと思ってます。
---本日はありがとうございました。
こちらこそありがとうございました。
I ’ve been running a team at Google for a while now , implementing capabilities in Javascript .
Fans of this blog will remember that long ago I did a thing called CaPerl .
The idea in CaPerl was to compile a slightly modified version of Perl into Perl , enforcing capability security in the process .
Caja follows a similar path , except rather than modify Javascript , we restrict it to a large subset .
This means that a Caja program will run without modification on a standard Javascript interpreter – though it wo n’t be secure , of course !
When it is compiled then , like CaPerl , the result is standard Javascript that enforces capability security .
What does this mean ?
It means that Web apps can embed untrusted third party code without concern that it might compromise either the application ’s or the user ’s security .
Caja will be open source , under the Apache License .
We ’re still debating whether we will drop our existing code for this as a starting point , or whether we want to take a different approach , but in any case , there ’s plenty to be done .
Although the site has been up for a while , I was reluctant to talk about it until there was some way for you to be involved .
Now there is – we have a public mailing list .
Come along , read the docs ( particularly the Halloween version of the spec ) and join in the discussions .
I ’m very excited about this project and the involvement of some world class capability experts , including Mark Miller ( of E fame ) who is a full - time member of the Caja development team .

Mice resistant to cancer have been created in a breakthrough that could lead to a human treatment free of side - effects .
A protein produced by the creatures may hold the key to a future therapy .
It attacks tumour cells , but does not harm healthy tissue in the body .
Scientists hope it can one day be adapted for use in humans - saving them the pain , nausea and hair loss usually associated with cancer treatments .
The breakthrough hinges on a mouse gene called Par - 4 , which produces the protein .
U.S. researchers genetically engineered a group of mice to have higher levels of the protein than normal .
These creatures were found to be immune to many forms of the disease , such as cancer of the liver and prostate , the journal Cancer Research reports .
Tests suggest the protein could also beat off breast , pancreatic and head and neck cancers .
Crucially , the animals did not suffer any visible side - effects , the U.S. scientists said .
In Britain , more than 280,000 of us are diagnosed with cancer each year - and 150,000 die .
Kentucky University researcher Dr Vivek Rangnekar said : " When a cancer patient goes into a clinic , they undergo chemotherapy or radiation and there are potential side - effects associated with those treatments .
" We got interested in looking for a molecule which will kill cancer cells and not kill normal cells , but also would not be toxic with regard to the entire organism .
" We are thinking this as a holistic approach that would not only get rid of the tumour , but also not harm the organism as a whole . "
In time , it may be possible to adapt the method to treat people , with the gene , or a similar gene , being introduced into the body through bone marrow transplants .
But such a treatment is at least ten years away .
Dr Rangnekar , whose work is inspired by a relative 's fight against cancer , said : " I look at the research from the standpoint of how it can be developed to benefit the cancer patient and that 's what really keeps us focused .
" If you look at the pain that cancer patients go through , not just from the disease , but also from the treatment - it 's excruciating .
" If you can not only treat the cancer but also not harm the patient , that 's a major breakthrough .
" That 's what 's happening with these animals and I think that 's wonderful . "
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Britain , affecting more than 44,000 women a year and claiming more than 1,000 lives a month .
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men , with nearly 32,000 new cases of the disease each year - and more than 10,000 deaths .
Liver cancer claims 2,800 lives a year , while cancers of the head and neck , including mouth , nose , throat and eye tumours , affect more than 7,000 Britons each year and kill 2,500 .
Bill O'Reilly compares former Bush Press Secretary Tony Snow 's cancer to ' insidious ' Press Corps
Former Fox News commentator turned White House Press Secretary Tony Snow sat down with Bill O'Reilly to discuss his battle with cancer and his career aspirations going forward .
O'Reilly asks " fat cat " Snow what his plan is , career - wise , since he left his job at the White House for " financial reasons . "
" You could make a lot of money bloviating , like I do , " says O'Reilly , " get the speeches - - You know , you could write a book -- I assume you 'll do that , right ? "
Snow plans on " a lot of speeches , " along with writing about how to deal not only with cancer , but with the unexpected .
" You can combine ' how I deal with cancer ' with ' how I deal with the White House Press Corps , ' " quips O'Reilly , " because they 're both insidious , invasive ... they both have to be wiped out . "
With the help of hand gestures , O'Reilly continues : " You see the theme that I 'm gettin ' at , here ? "
" We can turn it into a series , " a laughing Snow interjects .
" You put little microbes and David Gregory 's face on the cover - - it 's huge !
This is a high - concept deal I 'm giving you , man ! "
" I 'll let you have that one , " says Snow .
Snow and O'Reilly also discussed Snow 's recent appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman .
" Now , you were lucky , " says O'Reilly .
" He brutalized Paris Hilton out there .
You know Dave ! "
Snow does n't immediately plan on campaigning for any candidate for the 2008 election ; he may choose to focus on , as he puts it , " things I care about " in the meantime .
" The Republican Party 's fallen off the rails , " he continues .
" It 's forgotten about fiscal discipline , it 's forgotten about the importance of liberty - -"
O'Reilly interrupts : " Think back : I was the guy hammering you because of that .
Put yourself back six months ago .
That was me , Snow ! "
On being asked if he was considering returning to Fox News , Snow responds that he 's thinking of Radio and TV , but not anything definite .
" Anything could happen . "
" But you ca n't go over to CNN , " O'Reilly directs .
" It 's the devil over there ... You 're a religious guy .
You ca n't go into to the pagan throne over there . "
" I'm an open - minded man , " Snow responds .
O'Reilly continues : " If they put you at 8:00 up against me , Snow , it 's gonna get bloody .
You know what I 'm talkin ' about ? "
The video ends with a call to prayer for Tony Snow " and all cancer victims . "
The following video is from Fox 's O'Reilly Factor , broadcast on October 5 , 2007 .

The Republican CNN / YouTube debate looked more like an episode of Jerry Springer than a presidential debate .
Senator John McCain was asked a question about taxes and decided to go way off topic and attack Rep. Ron Paul for his stance on Iraq and wanting to bring the troops home .
McCain accused Paul of what he called the same sort of appeasement that allowed Hitler to take power and WWII to happen , and told him he'd just returned from Iraq and said he had a message for Ron from " the troops " -- and the audience let him have it .
Paul put it right back in his face by reminding him that he has received more donations from active duty military personnel than any other Republican candidate .
Oh , did anyone notice Chuck Norris in the audience ?
This stuff just writes itself ...
Bush : ' My opinion has n't changed ' towards Iran Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 4 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush said Tuesday that he just learned last week of a newly disclosed intelligence report showing Iran halted its nuclear weapons program has n't changed , and he reiterated that the new intelligence would not change his approach to the regime .
" Iran was dangerous , Iran is dangerous , and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " Bush said .
The president 's comments mark a departure from his previous rhetoric warning of " World War III " if Iran obtained nuclear weapons , but he pointedly refused to repudiate those remarks .
" My opinion has n't changed , " Bush said , regarding Iran 's threat to world peace .
The president was reacting to Monday 's disclosure of a National Intelligence Estimate that showed Iran stopped trying to develop a nuclear weapon in 2003 , although the administration estimate maintained that Iran still aims to re-start a covert nuclear weapons program .
" I still feel strongly that Iran 's a danger , " Bush said .
" Nothing 's changed in this NIE that we say , ' Well , let 's stop worrying about it . ' "
Bush said Iran could resume a covert nuclear program , and he warned that Iranian leaders could pass along knowledge on building a nuclear weapon to terrorist groups .
" Most of the world understands that Iran with a nuclear weapon could be a serious danger to peace , " Bush said , calling on US allies to maintain diplomatic pressure on Iran .
The United States needs to act immediately , he said , to dissuade Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon .
" Our policy remains the same , " Bush said .
" I see a danger , and much of the world sees the same danger . "
Bush also refused to rule - out the possibility of a military strike against Iran now that he knows the country 's nuclear weapons program has been dormant for four years .
" The best diplomacy  effective diplomacy  is one in which all options are on the table , " he said .
In fact , Europeans said the new information strengthens their argument for negotiations with Tehran , but they also said that sanctions are still an option to compel Iran to be fully transparent about its nuclear program , according to the Associated Press .
European officials insisted that the international community should not walk away from years of talks with an often defiant Tehran that is openly enriching uranium for uncertain ends .
The report said Iran could still build a nuclear bomb by 2010 - 2015 .

" CHECK MATE , " writes the Penthouse Media Group in a recent press release .
" Alexandra Kosteniuk is the current women ’s Chess vice - champion of the world and in the May issue of Penthouse , interviewer Dave Hollander finds out that this ' Anna Kournikova of chess ' brings more to the table than just her ethereal beauty .
A ruthless and competitive opponent , Alexandra has all the right moves and unlike Anna , she plays to win and not just look good while she ’s doing it . "
The introduction to the article reads : " Most women probably would n't mind being likened to former tennis beauty Anna Kournikova , but the gorgeous chess grandmaster Alexandra Kosteniuk can do without the comparison .
After all , Kournikova failed to win a singles WTA title during her career .
Kosteniuk , who started playing chess at age five , has plenty of victories .
She is the 2004 European champion , the 2005 Russian champion , and the current women 's vice - champion of the world ( sort of like being vice - president of the game ) .
Kosteniuk was named a woman grandmaster at age 14 .
In 2004 , she became the tenth woman in history to earn the title of grandmaster ( men ) , placing her in chess 's upper echelon . "
Here are some of the points Alexandra makes in the two - page interview :
I do think it 's possible for women to play as good as men .
They just need to work hard from a very early age .
To play chess well , you need to concentrate for a long time and not make a mistake .
For this , you need to be in good physical shape .
I consider chess a sport .
I consider myself an athlete because I know how much effort you need to play chess well .
Part of my preparation consists in physical training .
I run five kilometers every day .
During the winters , when in Moscow I ski .
When in Miami I swim .
My dream has always been to see chess as a part of the Olympic games , because I see the Olympics as an important way to measure the ideal in human performance .
I met Juan Antonio Samaranch , the former president of the International Olympic Committee .
I told him what I thought , and we got very close to putting chess into the Olympic games .
Unfortunately , Samaranch retired and the whole idea came to a sudden halt .
The most dangerous thing for chess is electronic performance enhancement – the use of chess computers .
Sometimes players cheat by using chess programs during a game .
That 's what we really have to be aware of .
To me , chess was and is the battle of two human beings .
What I love in chess is psychology – to play against an opponent who is not a computer .
A good chess player has to have chess intuition .
That does n't come from being a man or a woman – it comes from your chess experience .
[ In reply to the question " Since the queen is the most powerful piece , protecting a vulnerable king , why is n't chess seen as the ultimate feminist game ? " ]
In Russia , the queen is male .
We have a
different name for that piece .
It 's called feef [ Firzan ] .
It 's the " adviser of the king . "
I think we are the only country that does it that way .
I would like to play with Kasparov one day .
He 's retired from chess , but he 's still No. 1 in the world .
Penthouse is a men's magazine founded by Bob Guccione , combining urban lifestyle articles and soft - core pornographic pictorials .
In the 1990s it moved towards hardcore , and is currenly located somewhere in between Playboy and Hustler in terms of explicitness .
The most famous issue of Penthouse was September 1984 , which was the largest selling issue of any magazine in history ( it featured explicit photos of the current Miss America , Vanessa Williams , from early in her modeling career ) .
Penthouse made its founder Guccione one of the richest men in the United States .
Men and women view kissing differently
A State University of New York team quizzed over 1,000 students , finding women place a big emphasis on kissing .
They use kissing as a way of assessing the recipient as a potential partner , and later to maintain intimacy and to check the status of a relationship .
But men placed less importance on it , using it to increase the likelihood of sex , Evolutionary Psychology reported .
The questionnaires revealed men were less discriminating when it came to deciding who to kiss or who to have sex with .
While both sexes participate in the adaptive benefits of kissing , we found sex differences when considering the pursuit of short - versus long - term mating strategies
Dr Gordon Gallup , lead researcher
They were more willing to have sex with someone without kissing , to have sex with someone they are not attracted to and agree to have sex with someone they considered to be a bad kisser .
But kissing was more important as a bonding mechanism to women .
In long - term relationships females not only rate kissing as more important than men , but they indicated that kissing was important throughout a relationship .
Meanwhile , men placed less importance on kissing as the relationship progresses .
There was also a difference in the sort of kisses the two sexes preferred , with men liking wet , tongue kisses .
Lead researcher Dr Gordon Gallup said kissing had developed over time to become an essential part of the courtship process .
But he added : " While both sexes participate in the adaptive benefits of kissing , we found sex differences when considering the pursuit of short - versus long - term mating strategies . "
Dr Glenn Wilson , an expert in relationships at London 's Institute of Psychiatry , said : " Kissing is used by everyone as a bonding and testing mechanism .
" But the fact is women are more discriminatory than men .
Men can just go out and spread their seed , but women have to take more responsibility because of the consequences and so they are likely to want to test more . "
Abbreviations , acronyms , and memes fall in and out of fashion on the Internet all of the time .
Today 's " I can has cheeseburger ? " is often tomorrow 's " All your base are belong to us . "
Some stand the test of time , including phrases like " not safe for work " ( NSFW ) , which is used in forums , chatrooms , and blogs across the world to warn folks that something they 're about to see could give the boss fits .
Late last month , offbeat news site Fark.com filed for a trademark on the phrase with the US Patent and Trademark Office .
Fark is seeking exclusive rights over the phrase as it's currently used across the Internet .
Here 's what the trademark would cover , according to the application :
Entertainment Services namely providing a web site featuring photographic , audio , video and prose presentations featuring comedic captions regarding current events and online discussions and / or reviews of web materials of an adult nature ; Entertainment services , namely , providing a web site featuring musical performances , musical videos , related film clips , photographs , and other multimedia materials ; Entertainment services , namely , providing on - line reviews of photographs and / or web postings of an adult nature .
Given the wide use of the term , any trademark would likely be very difficult to enforce .
Trademork , which unearthed the application , points out that a number of sites use NSFW as part of their brand or to label adult content .

Porn gets a lot of credit for pushing technology forward .
You probably owe your DVD player and your video - on - demand service to dedicated porn fans with discretionary income .
But as web technology evolves to support true personalization and community – into Web 2.0 – porn is falling further behind the curve .
Like content was king in the 1990s , in the days of Web 2.0 , community is the kingdom .
Community is all about interactivity and personalization .
Given the interactive nature of sex and the personal nature of porn , you 'd think adult sites would be all over Web 2.0 .
But with a few notable exceptions , they 're not .
And I think this is going to bite them in the ass not too far into the future if they do n't catch up .
For the porn industry , which is at least as paranoid about piracy as the Recording Industry Association of America , allowing open data formats that let users to do with content what they will does not come naturally .
But Jason Tucker of No Rivals Media ( NSFW ) , which builds interactive sites for adult webmasters , makes a compelling business case for why adult webmasters should keep pace with the mainstream .
Tucker points to Google Images as an example .
" Different people name the same images , and the computer finds the word matches .
Those become tags , " he says .
" Think of how ( useful ) this is for porn . "
The more webmasters let us mash up content , the more they can discover what users are tagging , sharing and checking out on their sites .
Are those sections popular because of what they hold , or because of their position on the page ?
What are users saying on the boards , in the comments ?
Who is the most vocal ?
Webmasters can then better serve us by providing niche content and building communities around it .
They also can stop wasting resources on areas nobody visits .
In effect , they have a team of volunteer helpers guiding the evolution of the site – people who feel a part of things , and who will drive traffic that increases exponentially over time .
Traffic , of course , is money .
" The membership is constantly seeing what 's hot inside the site – which is not always the newest content , by the way , " says Tucker .
" And conversions ( from free tours to paid subscriptions ) and retentions ( extending subscriptions past the first billing cycle ) go up directly . "
To be fair , I understand why it 's hard for porn to keep pace with the changes .
Community may make a website sticky , but it also requires constant daily attention if it's not going to go down in flames or bloat up with spam .
It 's also a long - term investment .
After you install the tools and position the moderators you still have to figure out how to attract users in the first place , as well as give us enough reason to stick around and tell our social networks about it .
Word of mouth ( which we now call " viral marketing " ) takes time to grow ; there 's always a chance that even though you build it , we wo n't come .
Viral marketing is even harder for porn to generate than for mainstream content .
How often do we trade porn links and opinions compared to trading non-porn content ?
But for adult sites , the greatest challenges of Web 2.0 lie beyond the technology and the expense , in the realm of law .
User - generated content is the Big Thing in the mainstream .
YouTube , MySpace , Digg , Second Life – it's all about providing a platform and letting users loose on it .
Even newspapers are in on the game , handing out laptops and asking citizen journalists to file stories ; the amateur gets a small fee for any story the paper publishes .
But the moment you enable users to upload adult pictures or video , you risk running into trouble with U.S. record - keeping requirements .
The law continues to become stricter about who has to maintain records of what .
Imagine if every YouTube contributor had to maintain records on every piece of video , identifying everyone in the frame ; now imagine that YouTube needed to maintain another set of those records .
Imagine if both parties also had to make those records available in a physical location a certain number of hours a week , with a staff member on - site to assist government researchers at any time .
But look at how people are using the web today .
We expect to have a say in our entertainment .
If we are n't making it ourselves , we 're cutting it up and pasting it back together to suit our vision through feeds and widgets and dynamic pages .
We 're building environments to our specifications in virtual worlds , and we 're promoting content we like and voting against content we do n't .
For this audience , clicking a button to play a video does not count as interactive .
Then again , video is not the only way for the adult industry to catch up to Web 2.0 .
The time is ripe for another Danni Ashe to come forward and show the big brands how it 's done .
In fact , Ashe , once the " most downloaded woman on the internet , " is the precursor to porn 2.0 – what made her 1990s site more profitable than Playboy 's was not the content but the community .
Web 2.0 is nothing new .
It 's just come of age .
" What is the average 16 - year - old doing today ?
Going to school , texting like mad , chatting like mad , creating profiles , sharing information , music , news , sports – and they move together as a community , " says Tucker .
" When they become adult surfers wanting adult content , they are going to expect the same kind of functionality to be there .
Otherwise you 're too damn boring . "
See you next Friday ,

Stealing Code in Second Life Is Still Stealing
By Orla Ryan
Ghana
Giant trucks thunder out of Ghana 's tropical forests , loaded high with huge logs .
Raw logs cannot be exported under Ghanaian law
Chopped , sawn and milled , these logs bring in valuable foreign exchange revenue for the West African country .
Timber is one of its biggest foreign exchange earners .
But Ghana is losing its forests , as a result of gangs of unlicensed chainsaw operators that devastate the country 's forests , depriving the government of revenue in the process .
Ghana is currently negotiating a timber trade agreement with the European Union , its biggest export market for timber .
The hope is that the deal will reduce illegal logging , reverse the devastation of its forests and halt the slide in timber sales to Europe .
Let 's talk timber
The EU is in talks to establish bilateral timber trade agreements with a handful of countries , three of them in West Africa : Ghana , Liberia and Cameroon .
In 10 years ' time , they will lose their jobs because the trees are n't there
Chris Beeko
Ghanaian Forestry Commission
Agreement with Ghana is likely to be reached by early 2008 .
Once implemented , timber products covered by the agreement can only be sold in Europe with a license certifying their legality , says the Ghanaian Forestry Commission 's Chris Beeko .
But sceptics warn that high domestic demand for timber and a growth in non-European markets may limit the impact of the deal , which is called a voluntary partnership agreement or VPA .
Cautious buyers
Some European government buyers have already tightened timber procurement policies .
They only want to buy timber that is clearly certified .
" Any country that considers the EU to be a major trading partner has to take ( VPA ) seriously , " Mr Beeko says .
Ghanaian timber makes up just 6 % of European imports , though roughly half of all Ghanaian timber exports are destined for Europe .
In 2004 , some 60 % of Ghana 's timber exports went to Europe .
These days , European buyers take just 42 % due to both the growing wariness amongst European buyers and the growth in markets elsewhere in the world .
There is a danger that timber exporters will buy illegally - harvested timber and sell it to less closely - regulated markets , but Ghanaian law prohibits the export of raw logs , favoured by China , whose demand for commodities can shadow environmental and other concerns .
Reliance on timber
Ghana also wants to ensure only legally - harvested timber is sold locally .
Peter Adjei says the people of Ghana rely on the timber
In a country with chronic power cuts , trees provide far more than just shelter from a hot sun .
With a chainsaw balanced on his head , Peter Adjei steps out of a forest reserve in Ghana 's Ashanti region .
He has just cut dead trees for firewood .
" We use it for charcoal , for light , for roofing our houses , " he says .
While many communities see little or no benefit from the business of illegal operators - run by organised syndicates - the flood of timber , much of it illegal , on the domestic market means they benefit from cheap prices .
Reducing illegal timber harvesting is likely to force mills to close and lead to a shortage of timber for domestic demand .
But illegal chainsaw operators need to take the crackdown seriously .
" In 10 years ' time , they will lose their jobs because the trees are n't there , " says Mr Beeko .
Weak enforcement of current laws have made some activists sceptical that change can be made , but they stress change is needed .
" We have to stem the tide , " says Friends of the Earth Ghana 's Nana Darko Cobbina .
" The forest should be managed sustainably . "
February 6 , 2005 - The Knoxville News - Sentinel ( TN ) Tape Reveals Terrifying Campaign In War On Drugs They Launched The Attack With A Stunningly Simple Message By Jamie Satterfield , and Tom Chester Return to Drug War News : Do n't Miss Archive " It 's ( expletive ) over , son . "
For two hours , authorities say , that message would be pounded into Lester Eugene Siler 's head and body , reinforced with the barrel of a gun and echoed in threats of electrocution .
Handcuffed and surrounded , Siler was now a prisoner of the war on drugs in Campbell County .
Seven months later , five former Campbell County Sheriff 's Department lawmen are poised to plead guilty to federal charges they conspired to violate Siler 's civil rights by beating , threatening and torturing him .
Named in informations drafted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Atchley Jr. and filed last week in U.S. District Court are David Webber , 40 ; Samuel R. Franklin , 42 ; Joshua Monday , 24 ; Shayne Green , 35 ; and William Carroll , 26 .
In those documents , Atchley details a plot by the former lawmen to force Siler to put his signature on a form they could use in court as proof the convicted drug dealer agreed to let them search his home in the White Oak community in search of drugs and money .
Atchley lists in the documents disturbing examples of the lengths he alleges these former lawmen were willing to go : threats to electrocute Siler , drown him and break his fingers , beatings and gunplay .
But as shocking as those allegations are , they pale in comparison to the bone - chilling account of Siler 's ordeal captured on a secret recording and laid out in a 59 - page FBI transcript .
On these pages , it is the ex-officers ' own words that tell the tale of a drug war where the rules of engagement are written in Siler 's blood .
" We 're going to take every dime you have today and if we do n't walk out of here with every piece of dope you got and every dime you got , you 're ( expletive ) ass is not going to make it to the jail , " Webber warned in the transcript .
Waging The Drug War Waging war against the illegal drug trade is no mere cliche in Campbell County .
It is a mission trumpeted from the office of this county 's top lawman - Sheriff Ron McClellan - and carried out by his troops on an almost daily basis .
Hardly a week goes by without a press release from McClellan 's office detailing the latest raid , the fruits of the newest undercover operation or the next roundup of drug purveyors .
Since taking office , McClellan has invested both money and manpower in the fight .
Drug dealers would find no safe haven in this hilly , rural enclave , not even on its waterways .
McClellan once insisted on announcing the acquisition of a boat for use in the drug battle .
Couriers entering McClellan's war zone via Interstate 75 have landed in his jail cells , their drug stashes seized and their cash forfeited .
McClellan 's agency has been so successful at nabbing drug traffickers on the interstate that it has been featured on a nationally syndicated police reality show .
The agency boasts some of the largest cash seizures in the state and was once forced to borrow money - counting machines from local banks to tally up the take .
Webber was at the helm of the agency 's drug - fighting team .
He came to the agency in 1997 , bringing with him credentials from his work as a Florida lawman .
Franklin's role in the drug war focused less on supply and more on demand .
He was the agency 's D.A.R.E. officer , tasked with teaching children to resist drugs ' temptation .
Joining the department in 1987 , he had risen through the ranks to become one of the agency 's top detectives , specializing in sex crimes and child abuse cases .
Monday was a rookie still waiting for a slot at the state 's law enforcement training academy to open up so he could earn official certification .
Green was more accustomed to battling fires than crime .
He was chief of the Jacksboro Fire Department but worked part - time for the Sheriff 's Department as a process server .
Carroll worked full - time serving warrants and other legal documents .
He occasionally transported prisoners .
Like Monday , neither he nor Green was a state - certified deputy .
It was this team of five who showed up at Siler 's home on July 8 , 2004 .
They arrived in unmarked vehicles , dressed in plainclothes .
But they were cloaked with the authority to serve Siler with a warrant for his arrest .
Siler , the document alleged , had been breaking the rules set for him a year ago by a Campbell County judge .
No Stranger To The Law Siler , 42 , had run afoul of law enforcement in Campbell County before .
Illiterate , his trade was hawking drugs , mostly prescription painkillers like oxycodone .
His home was his pharmaceutical storefront .
In July 2003 , Siler admitted in a Campbell County courtroom that he sold drugs on 10 different occasions within 1,000 feet of a school .
He was judged guilty , sentenced and sent home , ordered to spend the next 11 years abiding by the law and the terms of his probation .
The FBI transcript also suggests Siler had cut a deal , promising to join the Campbell County Sheriff 's Department 's war on drugs as an informant .
Before long , though , Siler was back in hot water .
A probation officer contended Siler had skipped out on required visits to the probation office and was smoking marijuana .
In the FBI transcript , the deputies who showed up on his doorstep claimed neighbors were complaining that Siler was back in the drug business , a steady stream of customers trekking in and out of his home .
" You ain't done nothing but sold dope , " Webber tells Siler .
It 's not clear if these former lawmen were on official business .
Webber claims in the transcript that no one else in authority knew they were there .
It 's also not clear if their goal was a drug arrest or a shakedown of a drug dealer .
What is clear from the transcript is that these lawmen would stop at nothing to achieve it .
" We 'll have to call a ( expletive ) ambulance to haul your ass out of here , " Webber taunts in the transcript .
It is also apparent from the transcript that the former deputies were confident they could carry out a violent attack on Siler with no fear of reprisals .
After all , it would be his word against theirs .
They were Campbell County 's finest .
Siler was a drug dealer .
" Eugene , let me tell you how this is gonna work , OK ? "
Webber said in the transcript .
" We got here and guess what you did ?
You ran out the back door .
We chased you , OK ?
You fought with us , OK ?
We end up fighting with you .
You 'bout whupped all our asses , so we had to fight back , OK ? "
But neither Siler nor these deputies knew that Siler 's wife had a secret weapon that would produce evidence against the five lawmen so strong that McClellan would fire them , a state grand jury would indict four of them and the FBI would come after all of them .
Roll The Tape It begins with Jenny Siler 's sigh .
Her husband is in trouble again .
With lawmen at her door , Jenny Siler turns on a tape recorder in her kitchen and sighs as she heads to the door to greet them .
The recorder would continue to roll long after the lawmen send away Jenny Siler , 27 , and her 8 - year - old , leaving them alone with Eugene Siler .
It would produce a recording that spanned 40 to 45 minutes of what authorities contend was a two - hour ordeal .
The FBI transcript of the recording indicates that it not only captured what the officers said but what they did .
It is replete with references to sounds of Siler being slapped and struck .
It details Siler 's moans , his pleas , his piercing screams .
The lawmen indicate in the transcript that Siler had fled out the door when they arrived .
They 've caught him and handcuffed him .
He is brought into the house and placed in a chair , his hands cuffed behind his back .
He is already moaning .
Webber is heard first , telling Siler his " dope dealing 's over . "
Franklin chimes in , telling Siler the lawmen are shutting down his drug business .
Monday speaks next .
" It 's ( expletive ) over , son , " Monday says .
The beating begins then .
There is no way to tell from the transcript how long the first assault lasts .
At some point , Franklin instructs Carroll to hold off .
" Wait a minute , Will , before you start , " Franklin says .
" 10 - 4 , " Carroll responds .
Franklin then speaks to Siler , saying , " I tell you what we 're gonna do .
Let me tell you what we 're gonna do .
We 're gonna put them handcuffs in front of ya .
Cut you a little slack .
But if do n't start operating ( sic ) , we 're gonna put the ( expletive ) behind your back , and I 'm gonna take this slapjack , and I 'm gonna start working that head over , you understand ? "
The lawmen demand information from Siler , why he has n't been in touch with them , who supplies him drugs and where he has stashed his cash .
Webber reminds
Siler that he is alone and outnumbered .
" There 's nobody knows we 're ( expletive ) here , " Webber says .
" We 're doing this on our own . "
The transcript indicates that Webber produces a form that , once signed , will state that Siler gave his consent for the officers to search his home .
Siler apparently refuses to sign it .
The beating resumes .
Moaning , Siler apparently tries to say something to the lawmen , but Webber is not in the mood for conversation .
" You 're not ( expletive ) listening , " Webber says .
" You hear what I told you ?
I told you not to be talking .
?
This ( expletive ) right here , he loves seeing blood .
He loves it .
He loves seeing blood .
You 're talking too much . ?
He loves ( expletive ) seeing blood .
He 'll beat your ass and lick it off of you . "
Franklin orders another officer to remove Siler 's handcuffs so he can sign .
Siler , who cannot read or write , asks one of them to read it to him .
Monday refuses .
" Just sign it , " Monday orders Siler .
Siler refuses .
" Git ( sic ) up , " Monday responds .
" Git ( sic ) up .
I said get the ( expletive ) up . "
Beating sounds follow .
" Now git ( sic ) up , ( expletive ) it , " Monday says .
Siler responds , " Oh , alright . "
" No , git ( sic ) the ( expletive ) up , " Monday says again .
" Let me ask David ( Webber ) something first , " Siler pleads .
" Look , you sign this ( expletive ) or I 'm gonna hit you again , " Monday says .
" One. Two . "
Slaps and blows are again documented on the transcript , with Monday continuing to order Siler to sign .
By now , Siler is crying .
Threats come next .
The lawmen tell Siler they will jail his wife and have his children taken away from him .
The transcript details more beating sounds , more moaning from Siler , who repeatedly asks to talk to Webber .
" You ain't talking to nobody , " Green responds .
" You 're gonna sign this ( expletive ) paper . "
Siler screams .
More blows are heard .
The lawmen continue to order Siler to sign .
He responds with moans and more screams .
But there would be no reprieve .
" Eugene , it 's just beginning , buddy , " Webber says .
Siler is going to die , the officers tell him .
" I want to help you , " Siler says .
Webber responds , " No , I do n't want your help .
I want you to sign that form ' cause you 're the one we want and we got ' cha ( sic ) , and if you do n't sign it , you probably wo n't walk out of here . "
Siler is next threatened with electrocution .
Webber tells him that they could take a battery charger , hook some wires to it and attach it to Siler 's testicles .
The federal informations allege that the lawmen later rigged up such a device and used clamps to attach it to Siler 's body .
Monday is accused in the informations with pointing a gun at Siler , threatening to shoot him .
The transcript backs up the allegation .
" Shoot his ( expletive ) ass , " Green says .
Amid the threats , Siler is again beaten , but he still refuses to sign .
Siler pleads with the officers as Franklin threatens to burn him with a lighter after giving him a cigarette .
The transcript also reveals an obscure threat by Green .
" Let 's give him a haircut , " Green says .
At some point , one of the officers shows Siler a pellet gun apparently found in the house .
Siler tells the officers it belongs to his son .
Monday sees the find as another way to convince Siler his life is hanging in the balance .
" Eugene , you 're gonna sign this right here or I 'm gonna ( expletive ) put a bullet in your damn head , and we 're gonna ( expletive ) plant this BB gun , " Monday says .
Webber later adds , " Hey , Eugene , what loss do you think it 's gonna be to us if you die , buddy ?
It 's going to be no loss to us . "
By now , Siler is groaning and gasping for breath , claiming he is suffering a heart attack .
Webber demands
Siler tell him where he has hidden drugs or money .
" I want what you have right now , " Webber says .
Siler responds , " I do n't have nothing , sir . "
The FBI transcript details an unrelenting assault that authorities contend did not end when the tape recorder suddenly stopped .
The informations allege the attack on Siler included having his head forced underwater in both a fish tank and a toilet .
By day 's end , Siler would wind up not in a hospital but a Campbell County jail cell , charged with running from the officers and tossing drugs to avoid an arrest .
His wife , too , would be charged .
Wheels Of Justice
In a prior interview with the News Sentinel , McClellan recalled seeing Siler at the jail after the attack .
Siler complained to the sheriff that deputies had beaten him .
McClellan ordered a nurse to check Siler but put little stock in Siler 's claims .
" I did n't see any visible signs on him , and it looked like he was under the influence of something , " McClellan said in the interview .
Within three weeks , however , McClellan would announce that he had fired all five deputies - based on evidence that he refused to identify but described as damning .
Siler and his wife turned to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and two attorneys , Michael Farley and Kristie Anderson , for help .
The TBI interviewed the five lawmen , all of whom denied Siler 's claims .
Based on the TBI probe , District Attorney General Paul Phillips convened a grand jury .
The Silers testified as did their son .
McClellan and TBI agents also were summoned as witnesses .
Franklin and Carroll showed up uninvited and voluntarily gave testimony .
Exactly what the grand jury heard is unknown .
Grand jury proceedings are secret by law .
The panel would later return indictments against Webber , Franklin , Monday and Green , accusing the quartet of official oppression and perjury .
Carroll was cleared by the grand jury .
Within three months , officials confirmed that the FBI had launched its own investigation .
Last week , all five lawmen agreed to skip normal prosecution channels , including a federal grand jury review .
The informations filed last week will be assigned to a federal judge and , in the coming weeks , the men will be scheduled to appear in federal court .
But it 's not clear if the federal court case signals the end of the FBI 's probe .
The informations do n't answer all the lingering questions .
But one thing appears certain , these five men who once swore to uphold the law are now at its mercy .
CASUAL drinkers are unlikely to have raised their glass to the news last month that most people who suffer severe alcohol - induced liver disease are social drinkers not alcoholics .
Nor to the finding that moderate drinking might not , after all , help prevent heart disease .
There may , however , just be a solution to our drinking woes – one that will allow us to go to a bar and drink as much as we want ; get merry , not legless ; wake without a hangover ; and never have to worry that one of our favourite pastimes may be killing us .
It ’s a cocktail of drugs …
Well , it should be two strikes and you ’re out for the foam - at - the - mouth warmongers .
It should come as no surprise that the same people who ranted and raved for war with Iraq were also ranting and raving for war with Iran .
Their much - touted weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were nonexistent , and now it turns out that Iran ’s nuclear - weapons program , the latest subject of their rants , is nonexistent , according to a consensus of America ’s 16 intelligence agencies .
It also turns out that Mohamed ElBaradei , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , who bravely tried to tell the American people the truth , was right .
He was right about Iraq .
He is right about Iran .
Yet this faithful public servant was brutally maligned and attacked by the warmongers .
The Bush administration reportedly tapped his telephones and tried to prevent him from being re-elected to his post .
Fortunately , the Bushies failed .
I cannot think of lower , more despicable human beings than people who try to frighten their country into a war they are all too old to fight by printing and broadcasting false information fed to them by the worst political administration since Ulysses Grant .
They added to their sins by attacking honest people for speaking the truth .
These so - called foreign - policy experts are a contemptible lot .
If they were honorable people , they would confess their error and apologize to the people they tried to discredit , but of course they are not honorable people .
The worst of the lot are those who pose as journalists but who really are water - carriers for the administration , the Republican Party , the neoconservative clique or , in some cases , Israel .
They deserve to have their foreheads tattooed with the word " whore . "
Then when people see them on television pontificating , they will know that those journalists are a bought bunch .
A real journalist has loyalty to only one group  his readers or listeners .
He has an obligation to tell them the truth as best as he can determine it and not to pass on propaganda from someone behind the scenes .
The Founding Fathers wrote into the Constitution protection for the free press because they realized that only a well - informed public can govern themselves .
Misinforming the public is a direct attack on a free society .
It is a direct attempt to subvert the democratic process .
It is as much a crime against freedom as rigging an election .
The warmongers have blood on their hands .
They bear almost equal responsibility with the government for the dead and wounded of the Iraq War .
Thank God that this time the intelligence analysts stood firm against the administration ’s pressure to politicize the results of their work , or these miserable warmongers would have had even more blood on their hands .
And do n’t expect them to let up on trying to paint Iran as an imminent danger to the world .
The truth is that there are only two countries in the world that could threaten America or Europe .
Those are Russia and China .
When you are assessing threats , you have to look at capabilities , not at rhetoric or intentions .
Only China and Russia have the capability to attack the U.S .
Given this fact , you would think the administration would pay more attention to relations with these countries than to getting its drawers in a tizzy over Third World countries that lack the capability of harming us in any meaningful way .
The future grows dark for the United States .
We have a bad administration that is corrupt , secretive , incompetent and disdainful of liberty .
We have a press that for the most part cannot distinguish news from celebrity gossip .
We have an education system that is manufacturing functional illiterates .
We have a public that seemingly believes the only things worthwhile in life are entertainment and consumption .
The public debt is $ 9.1 trillion , and interest increases that debt by $ 1.4 billion per day .
That alone will do us in if we fail to confront it .
As for war , we ca n’t even afford the two we are in .
To most people born after 1920 , the existence of dinosaurs is a given .
Folks in our modern age do n’t even question the fact that 300 million or so years ago , huge reptile - like beasts roamed around in a world devoid of humans .
That Tyrannosaurus Rex and Brontosaurus once existed is as natural to us as the sun coming up , or rain falling from clouds .
Stop for a moment , though , and consider how downright bizarre the whole concept would have sounded to someone born in , say 1720 .
The only information most people at that time had about ancient animals came from the Bible or the works of classic Greek or Roman writers .
And all those sources mention lions , tigers , bears and many other types of animals still very much in existence .
It seemed logical to assume that if tigers existed in the time of the Old Testament , they ’d always existed .
If you could travel back to the 18th century and tell them that at one point , long in the past , gigantic , lizard - like creatures dozens of feet long roamed the earth , they ’d probably burn you at the stake for witchcraft … and I ca n’t say that I ’d blame them .
There was one thing that troubled people back then though , and that was the existence of fossils .
At the time , most of the fossils people were familiar with were of ancient sea creatures like fish or bivalves .
And what bothered the 18th century mind was why those fossils would turn up in the middle of the English countryside or high atop mountains deep in the heart of France .
Several schools of thought developed as “ gentlemen scientists ” investigated the matter further .
Those investigations continued quietly on for some time , but the entire world seemed to turn upside down in 1811 , when an uneducated young girl named Mary Anning found the remains of an ichthyosaur in Dorset , on the English coast .
But rather than clearly making the case for the existence of dinosaurs , Annin ’s fossil only made things even murkier .
Since the fossil resembled a gigantic crocodile , the question was n’t “ what was this prehistoric beast ? ” but rather “ what are the bones of a huge crocodile doing in England ? ”
It would take a humble country doctor from Sussex named Gideon Algernon Mantell to figure out that these fossils were n’t the bones of some mutated or out - of - place animal , but those of a truly ancient species .
Which is quite remarkable , if you think about it .
Many fossils do look like odd stones or strange sticks .
And even today it ’s pretty easy for an amateur to mistake the bones of a bear that died 100 years ago for a dinosaur that died 300 million years ago .
Mantell was a doctor who dedicated almost all of his spare time to tracking down and cataloging fossils .
By 1820 , he was finding huge bones , bones so big that he was inspired to write a book about them called The Fossils of South Downs .
Just before finishing the book , however , he made his “ great leap forward ” in thinking .
He had taken his wife with him on a house call , and Mrs. Mantell took a stroll down a nearby lane to pass the time while his husband attended to his patient .
She spotted some odd - looking rocks in a pile of rubble and , thinking they might be fossils , brought them back for Gideon .
He reckoned them to be teeth ( correct ) , and that they came from an herbivore reptile ( correct ) from the Cretaceous period ( correct ) that was dozens of feet long ( also correct ) .
This was a bold thing to say , mainly because it had never been said before .
And this is where Mantell ’s luck goes straight to hell .
Because his findings would be highly controversial , Mantell was advised to hold off on publishing a paper about it by fossil hunter and friend William Buckland .
Buckland advised Mantell to gather more evidence and shore up his conclusions before sending the paper to the Royal Society .
This gave Mantell time to send the teeth to famed French anatomist Georges Cuvier , who quickly pronounced the teeth as having come from a hippopotamus .
( Cuvier claimed to have said this after a long night of drinking ; he apologized the next day and then claimed the teeth were of “ unknown origin ” .
Unfortunately , news of Cuvier ’s retraction never made it to England , where Mantell was seen as a laughingstock . )
Things only got worse for Mantell .
It seems that the real reason that William Buckland had begged Mantell to use caution was n’t so that Mantell could gather more information , but to give Buckland time to publish his own paper in which he totally scooped Mantell by describing his own finding : the Megalosaurus .
So now , Mantell was n’t only a laughingstock , he was a laughingstock that had been beaten to the punch by a fellow researcher .
But things just kept getting worse for poor Gideon .
By this point he was so addicted to fossil hunting that he ’d neglected his medical practice and was rapidly running out of money .
Since his house was jammed full of fossils , he decided to turn it into a museum .
Sadly , he quickly learned that charging people admission to see the fossils would ruin his standing as both a “ gentleman ” and a scientist .
But since the museum was already set up , he opted to open the museum anyway and just not charge people .
This would preserve his social standing … but the dozens of visitors that came each day disrupted his home and took even more time away from his already neglected medical practice .
Mantell was soon broke , and had to sell off most of his precious fossils to pay the bills .
Although his wife loved him , she just could n’t take it any more , so shortly after the fossil sale she left him , taking the children with her .
Mantell ’s story would be sad enough if it ended here , but it does n’t .
Broke and alone , Mantell moved to London , where he encountered the wrath of Richard Owen .
Owen would go down in history as one of England ’s best biologists and her first paleontologist .
Owen did some remarkable work , but he was also known for being absolutely ruthless .
He was n’t above adding his name in authorship for other people ’s work , or even removing the names of authors he did n’t like .
He claimed to have held jobs that he had n’t , stole specimens from other researchers then claimed that he did n’t , and got into several arguments with high - profile scientists over work they did , but Owen claimed as his own .
Although a genius on many levels , Owen was highly unethical , and is the only person that Charles Darwin was said to hate .
And for some reason , he decided to take his wrath out on Gideon Mantell .
This was made easy by the next tragedy to befall Mantell : while crossing Clapham Common in a carriage , Mantell somehow fell off and became entangled in the reins .
He was dragged at full speed by the horses , which broke his spine in several places and left him permanently crippled .
With Mantell unable to fight back , Owen went to work on Mantell ’s reputation .
He used his influence with the Royal Society to make sure that Mantell ’s later work went unpublished .
He systematically went though Mantell ’s body of work and claimed credit for dozens of species that Mantell had discovered .
In short , Owen did everything he could to make it as though Mantell had never existed .
Poor Gideon just could n’t take it any more , and on November 10 , 1852 , he killed himself with an overdose of opium .
But Owen was n’t finished with him yet .
Almost everyone in the science community was convinced that Owen was the author of a lukewarm and condescending obituary of Mantell in local newspapers .
Not content with this little stunt , Owen had Mantell ’s deformed spine removed and sent to the Royal College of Surgeons … which he himself ran .
Owen ’s bad deeds eventually caught up with him .
He convinced the Royal Society ( of which he was the chairman ) to give him its highest honor , the Royal Medal .
He was either vain or stupid enough to choose for the honor some research originally done by a man named Chanling Pearce .
Pearce objected , a ruckus was raised , and although Owen was allowed to keep his medal , his reputation was shattered .
He was soon kicked out of the Zoological and Royal societies as well as the Royal College of Surgeons .
But Mantell would suffer one last indignity .
His spine , which had been on display for nearly 100 years at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons , was destroyed by a German bomb in World War II .
Today Mantell is celebrated for his genius … but thanks to Richard Owen and one Nazi bomb , he almost ceased to exist completely .

Nixon on tape : Fred Thompson is ' dumb as hell '
Thirty - year - old Oval Office recordings made of President Richard Nixon paint an unflattering portrait of GOP presidential hopeful Fred Thompson , then an upstart Watergate counsel the former president dismissed as " dumb as hell . "
" Fred Thompson has made much of his role 30 years ago as a young Senate lawyer helping to lead the investigation of Watergate and President Richard Nixon , " reported ABC News chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross on Good Morning America .
" But a much different , less valiant picture of Thompson emerges from listening to the White house audio tapes made at the time , as President Nixon plotted strategy with his aides in the Oval Office , " Ross continued .
At one point in the tapes , which ABC News spent months examining at the National Archives , Nixon is told that Thompson has been appointed by Tennessee Senator Howard Baker to head the Republican end of the Senate investigation into Watergate .
" Baker has appointed Fred Thompson as minority counsel , " says then Nixon aide HR Haledman .
" Oh shit , that kid , " the dismayed president responds .
Later in the tapes , Nixon fretted that Thompson would be outwitted by his opposition in the Senate investigation , Democratic counsel Sam Dash .
" Dash is too smart for that kid , " Nixon can be heard to say .
But the former president 's most damning words for Fred Thompson came during a May 1973 conversation with then chief of staff Alexander Haig about concerns that the future senator would n't stand up strongly enough to Democrats .
" Oh shit , he 's dumb as hell , " Nixon says at the mention of Thompson 's name .
" Who 's -- Who is he ?
He wo n't say anything . "
The tapes also reveal an apparently close association between Thompson and the White House .
" [ Thompson ] is willing to work with us , he is also now willing to work with us on shifting some focus to the Democrats , " White House counsel Fred Buzhardt told the president .
" He 's finally made up his mind he 's got to start looking at some of their stuff . "
" It was the equivalent of , you know , two prosecutors knowing about something and one of them going behind the scenes to tell the person being accused what the witnesses were saying about them , " former Senate Watergate Committee investigator Scott Armstrong told ABC News .
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on October 10 , 2007 .
Can I ask a quick little something , since it just came up on CNN yet again ?
Where on earth is this idea that Rudy Giuliani has " strong national security credentials " coming from ?
Rudy Giuliani has essentially no national security credentials to speak of .
He was mayor of New York before and during 9/11 , yes .
Before that day , he was responsible for two critical screwups that greatly hindered the city 's disaster response : the incompatibility of emergency responders ' radios , and the decision to place the city 's emergency response command center in the World Trade Center , one of the highest - profile targets in New York , and one already known to be a terrorist target .
During that day , his grand accomplishment was to walk around at the scene of the disaster , making sure he appeared before every television camera that presented itself .
And after 9/11 , he was placed as a member of the Iraq Study Group , where never attended even one meeting and left after two months in order to more freely pursue his presidential campaign .
So Mayor Rudy Giuliani's primary " national security credentials " would appear to be his capability for simple bipedal motion in televised news footage .
That seems a low bar -- although admittedly at the time it may have been more impressive , since when George W. Bush was told of the same attacks on camera , he did n't even leave the chair he was sitting in .
So where 's this idea coming from that Giuliani 's some sort of national security powerhouse ?
He 's proven in the past to be utterly uninterested in national security questions , instead filling his days with empty , sound - tough rhetoric with little connection to actual national security issues or diplomacy .
What 's his big national security plan ?
Is he going to go around with a television camera and videotape himself walking , in order to send stern messages to other countries ?
Is he really just going to haul off and launch wars against every other even - slightly - threatening nation on the planet , which seems to be the ever - so - thoughtful strategy of his expansively crazy advisor corps ?
I know most people in New York do n't buy his bunk , but " heroic mayor guy " seems one of those media narratives that 's just too darn pretty to not use ; it 's the sort of thing you can build stories around , whereas " muleheaded perpetual screwup eagerly adopting all the failed neoconservative advisors nobody else wants to be caught dead with " is n't considered as catchy .
So he 's a " hero " that does n't actually have any heroism to his name , a " strong national security " Republican who does n't know the first thing about national security , and post - 9/11 " credentialed " guy that could never be bothered to do the things he got credentials to do .
Before 9/11 , Rudy Giuliani was merely a controversial and frequently mocked figure .
That he , of all people , is now a leading Republican candidate for president should demonstrate rather colorfully how silly the Republican Party has gotten : just when you think George W. Bush was quite possibly the dumbest , least thoughtful , least motivated person to ever be nominated for president , they up the ante yet again .

Father Christmas gets all the publicity but it 's mothers who really keep the season together , a survey has revealed .
The maternal side of any family apparently makes twice as much effort to keep in touch as the male line .
Which is why there will be more of mother 's family - her parents and grandparents - round the table tomorrow lunchtime than father's .
Maternal family members are much more willing to travel further than paternal relatives to see their nearest and dearest , a study has discovered .
Scroll down for more ...
Family members related through their mothers matter more to each other than those related through their fathers , and not just at this time of year .
They are twice as likely to see their family every day or a few times a week .
The reason is thought to be based on human evolution because throughout history men could never be certain that they were the biological father .
So maternal grandparents were always more certain than paternal grandparents that a grandchild was related to them .
And maternal grandparents , especially maternal grandmothers , will go the extra mile to visit their family .
Thomas Pollet and colleagues at Newcastle University and a group of researchers at the University of Antwerp , Belgium , investigated how far maternal grandparents and paternal grandparents will go to maintain face - to - face contact with their grandchildren .
Mr Pollet said : " As the festive period approaches , many people will be making the effort to ensure they meet up - and we 've found that 's particularly important if family members are related through mothers .
" Even in families where there has been divorce , we found consistent differences - grandparents on your mother 's side make the extra effort .
" Throughout history , women are always related by maternity whereas men can never be wholly certain they are the biological father to their children . "
The study found that more than 30 per cent of maternal grandmothers who live with 19 miles of their grandchildren see them at least a few times every week .
About 25 per cent of maternal grandfathers kept up the same level of contact .
But only around 15 per cent of the paternal grandmothers and grandfathers saw their grandchildren daily or several times a week .
The research , which is published in the latest edition of the journal Evolutionary Psychology , was conducted on a sample of 800 grandparents .
• The average family will fall out by mid-morning on Christmas Day , according to a study .
Even before the turkey , the Queen 's Speech and a heated game of charades the typical British family will have its first argument at 10.13am .
The next will happen at 12.42 pm when children moaning about receiving the wrong presents will feel the wrath of stressed - out parents .
Eventually mother and father will argue between 1 pm and 3 pm because she 's overwrought from cooking and he's " merry " , according to a survey for Travelodge .
Giuliani pressed , dissembles on faulty 9/11 radios
In October , Brave New Films released a devastating six - minute clip about one of Rudy Giuliani ’s most serious 9/11 failures : his decision to ignore ( and lie about ) concerns over the FDNY ’s radio equipment , which ultimately cost so many lives on 9/11 .
( The issue is now under investigation by city officials . )
The video explains that Giuliani was told the firefighters did n’t have a functioning communications system after the original WTC attack in 1993 , but for seven years , Giuliani ignored the problem .
When he eventually ordered new radios , he gave Motorola a lucrative no -bid contract , and the company ended up providing untested radios that did n’t work .
On 9/11 , when the order went out to the FDNY to evacuate , the firefighters never heard the order , which is why so many perished .
( The NYPD , which had working radios , heard the order , vacated Ground Zero , and lost far fewer people when the towers fell . )
Giuliani later said he believes the firefighters ignored the evacuation order on purpose — a claim that disgusts the department and the families of those who died .
Giuliani has n’t been pressed on any of this by political reporters , so it was a pleasant surprise to see George Stephanopoulos broach the subject this morning .
According to a transcript from ABC News :
GIULIANI : I did everything I — I did everything I could think of doing in that situation to help .
I think I made mostly the right decisions .
Probably did n’t make all the right decisions , but I tried very hard to alleviate the problem as much as I could , and to lift the spirits of the city .
And in most cases , I think I made the right decisions .
In some cases I may not . [… ]
STEPHANOPOULOS :
They make two main charges .
Number one , that those firefighters in the north tower , many of them lost their lives because their radios did n’t work .
They also say you ended the recovery efforts too soon .
GIULIANI : Well , the radios that you ’re talking about were n’t put online for three , four , five years after .
So , it would have been impossible for me to have those radios ready … .
Even with the new equipment , it took another two or three years for those radios to be put online .
So it would have been impossible for us to have gotten them online before that , given the fact that it took so long afterwards .
“ Impossible ” ?
Hardly .
TP , which has a video clip of the interview , highlighted just how wrong this is .
As Stephanopoulos pointed out , the firefighters on 9/11 were forced to use old equipment that had malfunctioned eight years earlier , during the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center .
But it was n’t “ impossible ” to get new radios to these firefighters , as Giuliani tried to claim .
After the 1993 incident , Giuliani gave Motorola a $ 14 - million no -bid contract .
Despite this exorbitant sum , the radios were faulty and had to be taken out of service in March 2001 , after a “ distress call from a firefighter trapped in a burning house ” went unheard .
A New York City Council report on the fire department ’s radio procurement process concluded : “ Thus , despite its acknowledgment two years earlier that several manufacturers were developing technology that might meet FDNY ’s CAI specifications , and in apparent disregard of its pledge to evaluate new technologies and products , the FDNY appears to have elected to accept a radio representing an entirely new communications technology from Motorola rather than conduct a competitive review of products and prices . ”
I still do n’t know why this controversy has n’t caught on — to be fair , there have been other Giuliani scandals for the media to consider — so kudos to Stephanopoulos for at least asking the question .
As for Giuliani ’s response , the fact that he still has n’t come up with a coherent answer helps highlight just how problematic this is for his campaign .
Those among you who remember when it was all fields round here may also recall the famous January 1973 cover of National Lampoon which carried a pic of someone holding a gun to the head of a rather worried looking mutt and the headline " If You Don't Buy This Magazine , We 'll Kill This Dog " .
Well , a US " nonprofit national shelter outreach program " has decided to adopt the same no - nonsense approach to selling its wares - but in this case it 's for real .
Yes indeed , cue heartstring - tugging stuff down at dogsindanger.com , where visitors are greeted by a snap of some wretched canine and a reminder of just how long he or she has left before a last walk to the euthanisia room .
The group behind the hard sell is The Buddy Fund , which hopes that " highlighting the fact many unadopted dogs are euthanized by shelters with scarce space will spur people to take them in " .
The fund 's Alex Aliksanyan told Reuters : " This is happening ... in our country , in our back yard .
It 's been kept underneath a blanket of niceness and sweetness .
So we said , ' Let 's put the truth in front of the consumer - either do something about it , or at least realize you 're a partner . ' "
Aliksanyan stressed : " It 's not a happy site with puppies running around .
It 's not meant to be that .
We 're taking it the other way around .
We 're saying these pets are going to die .
Look at their faces . "
And in case the pleading eyes of the Death Row inmates do n't fully do the trick , dogsindanger.com throws in a continuously updated " As you are reading this x dogs have been killed " tally .
That 's a nationwide stat , of course , but we 're pleased to announce that The Buddy Fund 's animals who do suffer the " dead dawg walking " ordeal are at least afforded a suitable memorial . ®
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British man who reappeared five years after he was thought to have drowned in a canoeing accident has been arrested on suspicion of fraud , police confirmed Wednesday .
Darwin was arrested late Tuesday in the southern English county of Hampshire .
Police , who are trying to piece together the movements of John Darwin over the last five years , have made a public appeal for information over his whereabouts .
They are also investigating the authenticity of a photo published in British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror , which claims to show Darwin alongside his wife in an apartment in Panama City , Panama in July 2006 .
The 57 - year - old was presumed dead in 2002 after he went missing after going canoeing in the North Sea off the coastal town of Seaton Carew , in northeast England .
In an appeal for public help , Detective Superintendent of the Cleveland Police , Tony Hutchinson , said : " There will be people out there who know exactly where he has been , what he has been doing and where he has been living . "
Watch the police request for information on Darwin . »
Hutchinson said police reopened the investigation into the disappearance three months ago , when information about Darwin 's finances came to light .
" One side is that he has suffered amnesia , but the other side is that some criminal case has occurred , " he said .
Darwin , a prison officer and former teacher , was declared dead by a coroner in 2003 , 13 months after he went missing .
But on Saturday Darwin walked in to a police station in central London and told officers : " I think I am a missing person " , a spokeswoman for Cleveland Police , the local force investigating the case , told CNN .
Hutchinson said he appeared to be " in apparently good health -- tanned and well - nourished . "
According to widespread media reports , Darwin told police that he did not remember where he had been for the last five years .
He was later reunited with his two sons , Mark , 31 , and Anthony , 29 , who released a joint statement saying the reappearance of their father was " a huge shock . "
The statement said their mother , Darwin 's wife Anne , who is believed to have moved to Panama last month after selling the couple 's home in Seaton Carew , had also been informed of the news and " was delighted to hear it . "
" We have spoken with John and he appears to be in good health , however he currently has no memory of events since June 2000 , " his sons said in the statement .
Darwin was arrested late Tuesday by police in the southern English county of Hampshire where he had been staying since his reappearance , police told CNN .
He is to be taken from London to the northeast for questioning later Wednesday .
Inspector Andy Vickers , of Cleveland Police , the local force investigating the case , said : " A 57 - year - old man has been arrested by police in Hampshire at the request of Cleveland Police in relation to the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of John Darwin in 2002 . "
Darwin's 90 - year - old father Ron said the last time he saw his son was just a few days before he went missing , he told his local newspaper , the Hartlepool Mail .
" The people were in to put in a television and he was round for a chat , but the house was full .
He said ' tell you what dad , see you later , ' and I said ' cheerio ' and that was the last time I saw him , " the newspaper reported the father as saying .
His father said he was looking forward to seeing his son and giving him " a nice hug and kiss . "
E-mail to a friend
I ’ve been designing websites since 1996 , albeit them not being very pretty at the time , of course .
None were , actually , something you might or might not remember , depending on your age .
Most of my design during the 90s and early 00s were for my own benefit , projects I started .
At one time I had 37 gaming websites running ( in Swedish ) , which was madness of course …
Anyway , post - dotcom and I ’ve found myself doing a fair share of design work for clients .
This last year ’s been a good one for me , so I thought I ’d share my design process with you guys .
Maybe it ’ll help you organize your work a bit better .
Or not .
First , Consider the Problem
To me , every design is a problem .
That means I need to evaluate it , turn it around , and assess every possible kink in the design .
This could include making decisions that I know are easy to implement code - wise , especially if it ’s a time - crunched job .
This is also when I figure out what the design want to say to the visitor , and take the directions given by the client .
Second , Bring Out the Sketchbook
I do design sketches by hand , usually pretty rough ones these days , before I even fire up the workstation .
Doing the sketches by hand can usually make sure you wo n’t run into dead ends , forgetting about important elements and things like that .
It ’s a very visual way to see how things fit together .
When sketching by hand , I find that it helps drawing the various parts of the design as squares .
They ’re not necessarily squares in the final design , but it ’s a good way to see how well these element add up , and make sure there ’s balance in the design .
You do n’t want the one side be crammed with small stuff , and the other just have one big element – unless they fit , of course .
Sketching by hand helps , and actually saves time .
Still , I must confess that I fire up Photoshop right away more and more often , but that ’s due to the fact that I ’ve got a very clear idea of how the design should be .
Sketching by hand certainly helps unless you ’ve got a very clear image of what you ’re doing .
Third , Do that Mockup Thing
When you ’ve got a concept , it ’s time to start mocking up the design .
I never go straight to the code , but then again I rarely really finish the mockup either .
It kind of depends on the client .
Anyway , I mockup the design , more or less .
I use Photoshop for this , but some people prefer Illustrator .
There are a bunch of other pieces of software that you might prefer .
Fourth , Time to Code
I might not be the one doing the actual code all the time , but most blog designs are coded by me .
My editor of choice is Coda , thanks to the included FTP functionality mostly .
I get a version up and running in Firefox first , then I use VMware Fusion to bug test in the various versions of Internet Explorer , Opera and so on .
Finally , Deliver and I ’m Done
That ’s about it .
Delivery is usually a zip file with some instructions .
I rarely do implementation work myself , and if I do I make sure the pay for it is good since there ’s the possibility of things going wrong that might end up not being my fault , and I really hate that .
That ’s my process .
How do you go about when designing websites ?
It began as a misdelivered envelope and developed into the most extensive domestic terrorism investigation since the Oklahoma City bombing .
Last month , an east Texas man pleaded guilty to possession of a weapon of mass destruction .
Inside the home and storage facilities of William Krar , investigators found a sodium - cyanide bomb capable of killing thousands , more than a hundred explosives , half a million rounds of ammunition , dozens of illegal weapons , and a mound of white - supremacist and antigovernment literature .
" Without question , it ranks at the very top of all domestic terrorist arrests in the past 20 years in terms of the lethality of the arsenal , " says Daniel Levitas , author of " The Terrorist Next Door : The Militia Movement and the Radical Right . "
But outside Tyler , Texas , the case is almost unknown .
In the past nine months , there have been two government press releases and a handful of local stories , but no press conference and no coverage in the national newspapers .
Experts say the case highlights the increased cooperation and quicker response by US agencies since Sept. 11 .
But others say it points up just how political the terror war is .
" There is no value for the Bush administration to highlighting domestic terrorism right now , " says Robert Jensen , a journalism professor at the University of Texas in Austin .
" But there are significant political benefits to highlighting foreign terrorists , especially when trying to whip up support for war . "
Mr. Levitas goes even further : " The government has a severe case of tunnel vision when it comes to domestic terrorism .
I have no doubt whatsoever that had Krar and his compatriots been Arab - Americans or linked to some violent Islamic fundamentalist group , we would have heard from John Ashcroft himself . "
The case began in the fall of 2002 when a package bound for New Jersey was misdelivered to a New York address .
The family inadvertently opened the package and found fake identification badges , including Department of Defense and United Nations IDs .
The FBI eventually tracked the package back to Mr. Krar in Noonday , Texas .
The cache of weapons and bombs was found when the FBI served a search warrant in April of this year .
Krar and his common - law wife , Judith Bruey , and the receiver of the package , New Jersey Militia member Edward Feltus , were arrested .
All three have pleaded guilty to separate counts and are awaiting sentencing .
Brit Featherston , the assistant US attorney in charge of the case , says it was Krar and Ms. Bruey 's connections to white - supremacist groups that prompted further investigation .
" Any little town has worse criminals on paper than these two .
But because of their background , the red flags were flying all over the place - especially after Sept. 11 , " says Mr. Featherston , in the eastern district of Texas .
Before Sept. 11 , he says , the case most likely would have been worked as a false - ID case and ended there .
Instead , dozens of law - enforcement agencies were involved and hundreds of subpoenas were served .
" This case was very high priority , " says Featherston .
Still , investigators have been unable to answer questions such as :
Where was the sodium - cyanide bomb destined ?
And were the weapons being prepared for a group or sold individually ?
Featherston says the investigation is ongoing and wo n't end until these questions are answered .
Experts say the case is important not only because of what it says about increased government cooperation , but also because it shows how serious a threat the country faces from within .
" The lesson in the Krar case is that we have to always be concerned about domestic terrorism .
It would be a terrible mistake to believe that terrorism always comes from outside , " says Mark Potok at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Ala .
The fact is , the number of domestic terrorist acts in the past five years far outweighs the number of international acts , says Mark Pitcavage of the fact - finding department at the Anti-Defamation League .
" We do have home - grown hate in the United States , people who are just as ill - disposed to the American government as any international terrorist group , " he says .
Levitas estimates that there are approximately 25,000 right - wing extremist members and activists and some 250,000 sympathizers .
The Southern Poverty Law Center counted 708 hate groups in 2002 .
While Mr. Pitcavage was surprised the Krar case did not receive more attention , " It is a fact that a lot of stories involving domestic extremists get undercovered , " he says .
He points to a case he calls one of " the major terrorist plots of the 1990s " in which militia from around the country converged in central Texas allegedly to attack a military base .
They were arrested at a campground near Fort Hood on the morning of July 4 , 1997 , with a large collection of weapons and explosives .
" There was virtually no media coverage of that incident either , " says Pitcavage .
Featherston speculates that the Krar case got little attention because the arrests were made just after the war began in Iraq .
" Excuse me , a chemical weapon was found in the home state of George Bush , " says Levitas .
" I 'm not saying the Justice Department deliberately decided to downplay the story because they thought it might be embarrassing to the US government if weapons of mass destruction were found in America before they were found in Iraq .
But I am saying it was a mistake not to give this higher profile . "
For his part , Krar has remained silent .
He will most likely be sentenced sometime in February , and could receive up to life in prison .
His attorney , Tonda Curry , says the US government has no reason to be afraid of him .
" It looks a whole lot worse than it is .
He had a lot of things that most people would never have any desire to have , but much of what he had was perfectly legal . "
Jon Stewart is a member of the Writers Guild of America himself
His award - winning Daily
Show will return with new episodes on 7 January , but without its writing staff .
He joins fellow hosts Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel , who have all said they will resume work on 2 January with or without their writing teams .
Writers have been on strike since 5 November in a dispute over royalties .
The Daily Show 's spin - off series , The Colbert Report , will also resume on 7 January , with both shows airing on the Comedy Central TV network .
' Ambivalence '
As both Stewart and Colbert are members of the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) , they are barred from penning any material - even for themselves - that their staff writers would normally handle .
In a joint statement , the hosts said : " We would like to return to work with our writers .
If we cannot , we would like to express our ambivalence , but without our writers we are unable to express something as nuanced as ambivalence . "
The WGA reacted angrily to the announcement , saying : " Comedy Central forcing Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert back on the air will not give the viewers the quality shows they 've come to expect . "
Channel 4 said it had yet to decide when it would start screening new episodes of the Daily Show on its digital channel , More 4 .
Meanwhile , the WGA plans to meet with chat show host David Letterman 's production company in an attempt to reach an interim deal that could return his Late Show to the air , along with its writing staff .
The union also announced this week it would refuse to grant a special waiver to allow producers of the Oscars and the Golden Globes to hire union writers for their shows .
However , the WGA said its members would be allowed to work for the Spirit Awards , which honour independent film , in February .
The guild said in a statement its members could work because the show 's producers asked for permission before the strike began seven weeks ago .
Mexico 's relations with Venezuela and Cuba are regaining pace and the three countries plan to exchange ambassadors soon , Mexico 's foreign minister said Tuesday .
" All three governments value the importance of relaunching and formalizing diplomatic relations , something which could happen very soon , " Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa Cantellano said .
" We will soon receive Cuba 's and Venezuela 's ambassadors . "
" Mexico 's ambassadors will soon travel to these nations , where we will open a new stage of relations with them , " she said .
Mexico broke off diplomatic relations with both nations during the 2000 to 2006 government of President Vicente Fox due to contradictory positions on various issues .
Fox and his Venezuelan counterpart , Hugo Chavez , clashed over a dispute over the U.S. - promoted Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) .
Fox criticized Chavez for opposing the FTAA .
Fox also had been in rows with Cuban leader Fidel Castro , which led to the withdrawal of ambassadors in 2004 .
However , the three nations have been improving their relations in recent months .
" What I can say is that there is political will on all sides to have relationships at all levels and to develop respectful and constructive relations , " said the foreign minister .
Mexico has chosen its ambassadors to the two countries and will send them as early as next week .

It fell to $ 56.80 in extended trading after the earnings report , with more than 15.5 million shares changing hands .
“ I think the stock has been trading as a momentum stock .
What we ’re seeing here is a reversal of that momentum , ” said Jeff Mintz , vice president of research at Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc .
The shares had risen more than 200 percent this year .
The company ’s report reflected more seasonality than analysts had expected , but its actual performance did not justify the significant hit Crocs took in after - hours trade , Mintz said .
Crocs shares had also fallen last month on consumer complaints that the company ’s signature shoes , originally meant for boating or outdoors , are prone to catch on escalators and have caused injuries .
For the third quarter , Crocs reported net income of $ 56.5 million , or 66 cents a share , compared with $ 21.5 million , or 27 cents a share , a year ago .
Revenue more than doubled to $ 256.3 million .
The company said earnings per share were adjusted to reflect a 2 - for - 1 stock split in June 2007 .
Analysts on average had expected earnings of 63 cents a share , before items , on revenue of $ 259.76 million , according to Reuters Estimates .
Crocs expects 2008 revenue and net income per share to increase between 35 percent to 40 percent over the projected 2007 levels .

Promoters in Hollywood should have learned the lesson by now : Leonardo Di Caprio 's visit to Israel should have taught them that it is not a good idea to shirk the local media .
From David Lynch 's trip they should have learned that there is no way a celeb can avoid a meeting with President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , no matter how busy they might be .
When it was announced that Jerry Seinfeld is on his way to promote his animated " Bee Movie , " local public relations professionals knew they 'd better do their homework .
For weeks they explored every possible scenario .
Well , almost every scenario , as it is impossible to predict that elusive , unpredictable factor known as " Israelis . "
Much Ado Jerry Seinfeld in the Holy Land Keren Natanzon
The comedian who conquered the world with a show ' about nothing ' arrived in Israel Friday morning to promote his new movie .
Seinfeld will spend time vacationing and meeting Israeli leaders Jerry Seinfeld in the Holy Land
On his first day in Israel , Seinfeld met with President Shimon Peres , who knows nothing about animated films .
Seinfeld suggested Peres leave the residence every once in a while and go to the movie theater .
Peres retaliated by dragging Seinfeld on a boring tour of the archeological garden behind the official residence .
Before going on to meet with the prime minister , producers checked what the appropriate dress code was .
They were told that for such an occasion Seinfeld should wear a suit .
He did , yet , Olmert showed up in a black t- shirt .
Many politicians , including Benjamin Netanyahu , attended the premier .
Tourism Minister Isaac
Herzog tried to squeeze in close to the star but only managed to yell : " My wife and I are huge fans ; we memorized all of the episodes by heart . "
Producers wanted to do it " Hollywood style " so they called a press conference with a red carpet and paparazzi .
When Seinfeld walked in he was smiling .
As he left the smile was gone :
Even though reporters were asked to focus on the movie and not the TV show , the first question Seinfeld was asked was : " When will the movie be adapted into a TV series ? "
IDF Radio's reporter tried to outsmart the comedian and said that since we already know everything about him , he should ask her some questions .
He did n't .
Then , reporters tried to push Seinfeld into admitting there were references to the Holocaust in " Bee Movie " and when that failed , they asked if he made out at Yad Vashem and whether it was a film about nothing .
Seinfeld did n't see the humor and stepped out .

In the interests of efficiency , I have decided to distill every argument I have ever had with your average statist , so that I can hand it out to those who argue that government is voluntary , if I do n't like it I can leave , taxation is not violence , etc .
I thought this might also be of use to you , because life is short .
Me : Tell me , do you think that violence is wrong ?
Statist : Yes , violence is wrong ' except in self - defense .
Me : Agreed , except in self - defense .
So tell me , how do you think that problems should be solved , if we should not use violence ?
Statist :
Well , I think that people should become more active in government , and that governments should do ABC , X , Y and Z .
Me :
But how do you reconcile your objection to violence with your support of government programs , since government programs are paid for through taxation , which is coercive ?
Statist : Huh ?
What are you talking about ?
Taxation is not coercive .
Me : Taxation is coercive , since if you do not pay your taxes , you are kidnapped at gunpoint and thrown in jail ' where if you try to escape , you are shot .
Statist :
But this is a democracy , where we choose our own governments .
Me : Being offered a choice between two violent alternatives is not the same as being free to choose .
If a store owner gets to choose which Mafia gang he pays ' protection ' money to , can it be really argued that he is making a ' free ' choice ?
If a woman can choose between two potential husbands ' but will be forced to marry one of them ' can she said to be really ' choosing ' marriage ?
People can only freely choose governments , if they have the choice not to choose governments .
Statist :
Well there is a ' social contract , ' that binds people to their governments .
Me :
There is no such thing as a ' social contract . '
Unless they have been granted power of attorney , people cannot justly sign contracts on behalf of others .
If one man has the power to unilaterally impose his will on another and call it a ' contract , ' then logically a man can steal from a woman and call it ' charity . '
Statist : But I accept the social contract ' and so do you if you drive on the roads .
Me : First of all , your choice to honour a contract does not give you the right to force me to honour it .
You can choose to buy a house , but you cannot justly force me to pay for it .
If you forge my signature , I am not bound to honour the contract ' and I have never agreed to a ' social contract ' of any kind .
Secondly , it is true that I use government services , but that is irrelevant to the central moral question of coercion .
If a slave accepts a meal from his master , is he condoning slavery ?
Statist : I suppose not .
But still , you implicitly accept the social contract by continuing to live in a country , as Socrates argued .
Me : Can I justly create a ' social contract ' that allows me to rob anyone who lives in my neighborhood ' and say that if people continue to live in ' my ' neighborhood , they are expressly consenting to my new social contract ?
Statist : Well , no , but we are talking about governments , not individuals . . . .
Me : Is the government not composed of individuals ?
Is ' the government ' not just a label for a group of individuals who claim the moral right to initiate force against others ' a right they define as evil for those they use violence against ?
If you take away all the individuals who compose ' the government , ' do you still have a government ?
Statist : I suppose not .
But that is beside the point ' you say that taxation is coercive , but I have paid taxes my entire life , and I have never had a gun pointed at my head .
Me : Sure , and a prisoner is not shot if he does not try to escape .
If a slave conforms to his master 's wishes because of the threat of violence , the situation is utterly immoral .
Does the Mafia have to actually burn your shop down for the threat to be violent ?
Statist : No ' however , I do not accept the premise that the government uses force to extract taxation from citizens .
Me :
All right - is there anything that the government does that you disagree with ?
Do you agree , for instance , with the invasion of Iraq ?
[ Keep asking until you find some program the statist finds abhorrent . ]
Statist : Now , I think that the invasion of Iraq was morally wrong .
Me : Why ?
Statist : Because Iraq had done nothing to threaten the US .
Me : Right , so it is an initiation of force , not self - defense .
Now ' you do realize that the war in Iraq is only possible because you pay your taxes .
Statist :
To some degree , of course .
Me :
If the war in Iraq is morally wrong , but it is only possible because you pay your taxes ' and your taxes are not extracted from you through force ' then you are voluntarily funding and enabling that which you call evil .
Can you explain that to me ?
Statist : I pay my taxes because I 'm a citizen of this country .
If I disagree with the war , then I should run for office and try to stop it .
Me :
All right , if you were against child abuse , would you voluntarily fund a group dedicated to abusing children ?
Statist : Of course not !
Me :
And if you did claim to be against child abuse , and you voluntarily funded a group dedicated to abusing children , and I said that you should stop doing that , and you replied that you would not ' but that if someone did oppose this abusive group , they should try to infiltrate this group , take control of it , and somehow stop it from abusing children , would that make any sense at all ?
Statist : I guess not .
Me :
If you were against the war in Iraq , but volunteered for it ' and agreed to fight without a salary , and spent your own money to cover all your expenses , do you understand that your position would be utterly incomprehensible ?
You would claim to be against something ' and then expend enormous amounts of time , effort , money and resources supporting it ?
Statist : Yes , that would make little sense .
Me :
Thus do you see that your position that the war in Iraq is a moral evil , but that you are voluntarily funding it through your taxes , makes no sense at all ?
If the war in Iraq is a moral evil , but is only enabled through your voluntary funding , then continuing to fund it is to openly admit that it is not a moral evil .
If you are forced to fund the war in Iraq , you can maintain that it is a moral evil , because it is the initiation of the use of force .
However , the taxation that is also the initiation of the use of force against you must also be a moral evil , because you are forced to fund the initiation of force against others .
Thus either taxation is coercion , or you are the worst form of moral hypocrite , by voluntarily supporting that which you call evil .
Does that make sense ?
Statist : I can certainly see that position .
Me : Can you find any logical flaws in my position ?
Statist : No , but I still think that you are wrong .
Me : Well , I 'm certainly glad that you are reading this article , rather than debating me directly , because as I said at the beginning , life is far too short to waste time arguing with fools .

Have you ever wondered why Christians are n’t smarter ?
I mean , we have the only true religion , we have a Book which is responsible for all of Western Civilization , and we serve a God who can safely call Himself the supreme champion at every trivia contest .
So why are n’t we smarter ?
Well , the reasons are many , but the goal of changing that condition is the driving passion of my life .
Having taught college philosophy , my background is in equipping people to think better , and I used to think that talent was best used in the secular world .
Three years ago , however , I was persuaded by some good counsel to turn my attention toward the Body of Christ , and that ’s why I came to Phoenix to do my radio show weekdays from 5to 7 p.m. on AM 1360 KPXQ .
Not thinking well is a sin .
God commands us very simply : Love Him with all our heart , and with all our soul , and with all our mind .
Catch that last part … with all our mind .
This means thinking is not optional for the Christian .
Thinking , and thinking well , is a form of worship of God which is nothing short of obedience to His primary command .
Hence , if we do not “ use the brain God gave you , ” ( my mom ’s favorite rhetorical chastisement ) , we are sinning .
Not thinking well is a scandal .
The most pervasive myth about Christianity is that it is incompatible with intelligence .
This is what I believed before I became one , and it made me not want to be one .
I say it is a myth both because nothing demands more thinking capacity than being a faithful Christian and also because our history is rich with intellectual giants .
Nonetheless , Christianity has a reputation as a religion for fools , and this is at least partially our own fault .
By offering empty platitudes such as , “ Well , you have to have faith , ” when challenged with difficult questions , outsiders can be forgiven for forming the impression that what we really mean is , “ Well , you have to be stupid . ”
This puts people in the painful situation of feeling like they have to choose between their mind and God .
Also , it makes Christianity offensive to the smartest people in society , who tend to be culture ’s greatest influencers .
Thus , simply showing non-Christians that one can be both smart and faithful is a powerful form of evangelism .
Fishers not just fish - eaters .
“ If you give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
If you teach him how to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . ”
Simple .
Obvious .
But , all too often , it ’s not the guiding principle of Christian education .
Christians can be so concerned about having the right answers ( good doctrine ) , that we fail to teach people the thinking skills and patterns which would lead them to these and other true conclusions .
They may have the unreliable dogmatism which comes from mere repetition , but they lack the true confidence which comes from deep and honest examination of an idea .
Sadly , it also means they do not have the ability to discover new answers for themselves in novel situations .
On my radio show , I deliberately do not provide people many answers because I am more interested in helping people learn how to think than I am in telling them what to think .
My confidence is high that such ability will ultimately get them to the right place , and it will be a place of true security as well .
Disciples , not an audience .
Jesus mentored
His disciples .
He interacted with them .
He answered their questions .
He joked with them .
And He corrected them .
He did n’t lecture them .
He lectured the masses .
And I think the reason is simple .
A lecture is not the ideal form of education .
The reasons are many .
If a listener does n’t like what is being said , he can simply ignore it .
If he does n’t understand or if he disagrees , he cannot easily inquire of the speaker .
Because such questions go unanswered , other people miss out on having these questions answered .
When the teacher fields questions , he replaces his own assumptions about his audience with real knowledge and can more accurately tune his teaching to the real needs they have .
Finally , I believe in collaboration rather than solo performances .
Although I think I have many reliable insights worth saying , I ’d rather talk with people and work together toward truth instead of just trusting in my own ideas too much .
So my show is built around discussion rather than presentation .
I am working with my listeners to fashion a product together rather than simply distributing to them a prefabricated one .
Haggling , not purchasing .
In the Mediterranean culture of the Bible , haggling was a way of life — and such negotiations provide a great way of coming to know someone .
The process of haggling gains both friends and sharper minds .
We are often baffled by this when we travel to that part of the world because Americans are so transaction - oriented .
“ I agree , ” “ I disagree , ” “ I will buy , ” or “ I will not buy . ”
We are very comfortable with these types of shallow interactions .
In the Mediterranean , the sellers understand that the product is insignificant compared with the relationship its sale can create .
Retired FBI agent : Waterboarding produced ' crap ' information from detainee Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 18 , 2007

This FBI interrogators suspected CIA 's aim was to ' belittle ' detainee with harsh treatment Contradicting the assertions of President Bush and waterboarding advocates at the CIA , federal investigators say a suspected al Qaeda operative who was subjected to the simulated drowning technique produced increasingly unreliable information after his interrogators began treating him harshly .
Abu Zubaida was captured in 2002 and moved through the CIA 's secret prison system for much of that year .
Although the FBI says Zubaida was a fairly low - level associate of some al Qaeda players , the CIA was convinced that he actually was a high - level terrorist who simply was holding out on them .
They turned to waterboarding and other unknown harsh interrogation techniques in an attempt to break the suspect , but ended up producing little more than a stream of specious claims delivered under duress from a suspect who was having water forced into his lungs , according to a former investigator who reviewed his case file .
" I do n't have confidence in anything he says , because once you go down that road , everything you say is tainted , " retired FBI agent Daniel Coleman told the Washington Post , referring to the harsh measures .
" He was talking before they did that to him , but they did n't believe him .
The problem is they did n't realize he did n't know all that much . "
Zubaida 's interrogation and harsh treatment were recorded by the CIA , but the evidence of what , if any , actionable intelligence he delivered under conditions critics liken to torture disappeared in 2005 , when the agency destroyed hundreds of hours of videotapes depicting similar interrogations .
Captured at a suspected al Qaeda safe house in Pakistan on Mar. 28 , 2002 , Zubaida was soon identified and whisked off to the CIA 's network of secret prisons .
He had been named as a fellow plotter in a failed 1999 attempt to bomb the Los Angeles airport , and the 9/11 Commission said he was a " longtime ally of bin Laden " who helped run a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks .
In his first month of captivity , report the Post 's Dan Eggen and Walter Pincus , Zubaida handed over information that led to the capture of Jose Padilla and identified Khalid Sheik Mohammed as a 9/11 plotter .
That was all before the CIA turned to harsh techniques .
Instead of continuing what appeared to be working , though , the CIA was convinced Zubaida was holding out on them , and they decided to begin " not torturing " him by keeping him naked in his cell , subjecting him to extreme cold and playing loud rock music at all hours .
FBI agents had been pleased with Zubaida 's earlier disclosures but were dismayed by the harsh treatment he was then subjected to .
" They said , ' You 've got to be kidding me , ' " Coleman told Eggen and Pincus , recalling accounts from FBI employees who were there .
" ' This guy 's a Muslim .
That 's not going to win his confidence .
Are you trying to get information out of him or just belittle him ? ' "
Coleman helped lead the bureau 's efforts against Osama bin Laden for a decade , ending in 2004 .
The FBI team eventually had to drop out of the interrogation because they , unlike the CIA , were prohibited from participating in the harsh treatment .
" Whether harsh tactics were used on Abu Zubaida prior to official legal authorization by the Justice Department is unclear .
Officials at the CIA say all its tactics were lawful .
An Aug. 1 Justice document later known as the ' torture memo ' narrowly defined what constituted illegal abuse , " report Eggen and Pincus .
" It was accompanied by another memo that laid out a list of allowable tactics for the CIA , including waterboarding , according to numerous officials . "
For its part , the CIA says the harsh interrogation helped extract information from Abu Zubaida .
Retired CIA officer John Kiriakou claimed that waterboarding -- which he now considers torture -- probably saved lives .
Kirakou participated in Abu Zubaida 's capture and saw classified reports of the agency 's harsh interrogation .
Former CIA director George Tenet wrote in his memoirs that claims Abu Zubaida was over - valued were " baloney " and claimed the captured operative was " at the crossroads of many al Qaeda operations " and shared critical information .
Coleman told the Post that much of Abu Zubaida 's information on pending threats , which he provided under harsh interrogation , " was crap . "
Coleman and others in the FBI believed Abu Zubaida had mental problems and was little more than a lackey within al Qaeda who claimed to know more than he really did about the terror organization .
" They all knew he was crazy , and they knew he was always on the damn phone , " Coleman said , referring to al - Qaeda operatives .
" You think they 're going to tell him anything ? "
LONDON , ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Four 13th century copies of the Magna Carta , considered to be one of the most important documents in the history of democracy , go on public display next week for the first time in nearly 800 years .
A copy of the Magna Carta , issued in 1217 by the guardians of Henry III , is seen in this undated handout photo made available by the Bodleian Library in London December 6 , 2007 .
Four 13th century copies of the Magna Carta , considered to be one of the most important documents in the history of democracy , go on public display next week for the first time in nearly 800 years .
REUTERS / Bodleian Library / Handout
The four , three of which date from 1217 and one from 1225 , are held by Oxford University ’s Bodleian Library and represent nearly one quarter of the surviving 13th century Magna Carta manuscripts in the world .
“ These three 1217 charters are a unique historical collection , ” said librarian Sarah Thomas .
“ No other institution can boast such a concentration of Magna Cartae . ”
The Magna Carta was signed by England ’s King John at Runnymede near Windsor just to the west of London in 1215 under intense pressure from rebellious barons who had captured London in protest at his exercise of arbitrary power over them .
In return for the concessions granted in the charter which effectively assured the barons of their feudal rights , the barons pledged allegiance to the English throne .
While it contains few sweeping statements of principle , it did establish in writing for the first time that the power of the monarch did have limits .
As such it is considered to be one of the cornerstones of democracy despite the fact that in restating feudal laws it has little or nothing to do with either human or equal rights .
Only four copies of the original charter dated 1215 survive , of which two are held by the British Library .
But the document was reissued regularly by or on behalf of succeeding monarchs , and only 17 of those dating from the 13th century now survive .
Apart from the four held by the Bodleian Library -- which houses more than eight million books and many other manuscripts -- the others are held at nine locations in Britain , Australia and the United States .
The Bodleian ’s collection will go on public show for just six hours at Oxford ’s Divinity School on Tuesday December 11 .
ahead of a sale on December 18 by Sotheby ’s in New York of a copy of the Magna Carta owned by Ross Perot and priced at up to $ 30 million .
KHARTOUM , Sudan ( CNN ) -- A British teacher arrested in Sudan after allowing her class to name a teddy bear " Mohammed " has been charged by authorities with offending religion , British officials say .
An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons .
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , is being held by police in the capital Khartoum after she asked her class of seven - year - olds to come up with a name for the toy as part of a school project , Robert Boulos , the head of Unity High School told CNN .
It is expected that she will appear in court Thursday , Sudan state media reported .
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman said Gibbons had been charged under Article 125 of Sudan 's constitution , the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred .
The spokeswoman said the Sudanese ambassador had been summoned to the offices of the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to discuss the case .
Gibbons was arrested under the country 's Islamic Sharia law after parents of some of her students complained to police .
Hear about the charges against Gibbons »
Under country 's law , the offense is punishable with 40 lashes , a jail term of up to a year or a fine .
Khalid Mubarak , the media counselor at the Sudan embassy in London , said the judicial process was taking its course but added that even if Gibbons was found guilty " the question of punishment is a long way off . "
" This woman is being dealt with in the proper ways in accordance with the laws of our country , " he told CNN .
He said he was concerned about how the latest developments would affect Sudan 's relationship with Britain .
" This is a worry for us .
We have already received abusive phone calls to our offices in London , " he said .
Gibbons ' arrest was announced in Arabic on the state - run news agency 's Web site .
No -one from Sudan 's government has so far commented on the decision .
It is not known how long the court process will take or the type of court the hearing will take place in .
Although there is no ban in the Koran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed , likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims .
Gibbons had been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August , after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool this summer , said Boulos .
He said Gibbons had asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot , which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats .
Classmates took turns taking the teddy bear home with them , accompanied by a diary with the bear 's name written in the front of it , said Boulos , who heads the private school , which has been shut down since the controversy came to light .
" All this is a very sensitive area .
I asked her ( Gibbons ) why she had done it and she said she did n't chose the name , the children did , " he told CNN .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Tuesday he was " very sorry " about Gibbons ' arrest and that the British Embassy in Khartoum was " giving all appropriate consular assistance to her . "
Brown said all efforts were being taken to ensure her early release and that government officials were in touch with the teacher 's family in the northern British city of Liverpool .

All About Sudan
McMegan points to John Henke 's compendium of quotes by Paul Krugman which is supposed to illustrate Megan 's earlier contention that " Paul Krugman has predicted eight of the last none recessions under the Bush administration . "
If this is the best Henke 's got , then he really does n't have the goods .
Henke has nine quotations .
Three of them are recent enough that they seem to me to be predicting the economic slowdown that is now widely believed to be underway ( see , e.g. , Ben Bernanke and other Republicans who obviously are n't grinding anti-Bush axes ) .
Krugman 's May 2005 prediction that we were nearing the end of a speculative bubble in the housing market , similarly , looks really good in retrospect -- prices were about flat throughout 2006 , and are now headed downward .
Again , in April 2005 Krugman said " rising inflation in an economy still well short of full employment - has already arrived " and , indeed , it had ; the inflation rate was rising and the employment - population ration remained quite a bit lower than it had been in the late 1990s .
With five out of nine correct forecasts , this Krugman guy is looking pretty smart .
Similarly , Henke wants to mock the April 2004 observation that " An oil - driven recession does not look at all far - fetched " but it would be worth reading the actual column to see what Krugman 's talking about :
Could an oil shock actually lead to 1970 's - style stagflation — a combination of inflation and rising unemployment ?
Well , there are several comfort factors , reasons we 're less vulnerable now than a generation ago .
Despite the rise of the S.U.V. , the U.S. consumes only about half as much oil per dollar of real G.D.P. as it did in 1973 .
Also , in the 1970 's the economy was already primed for inflation : given the prevalence of cost - of - living adjustments in labor contracts and the experience of past inflation , oil price increases rapidly fed into a wage - price spiral .
That 's less likely to happen today .
Still , if there is a major supply disruption , the world will have to get by with less oil , and the only way that can happen in the short run is if there is a world economic slowdown .
An oil - driven recession does not look at all far - fetched .
In context , that 's a not - especially - alarmist warning that I think looks fine in retrospect .
The others look a bit better for Henke .
But Krugman 's track record looks pretty good , even in the context of a series of quotes cherry - picked to make him look bad .
I find the endless array of complaints people pretend to have with Krugman 's work fascinating .
Krugman is an effective and high - profile advocate for progressive politics .
Lots of people want progressive politics to fail .
Therefore , they do n't like Krugman 's columns .
That 's not so hard to say !
But nobody seems willing to say it .
Instead , you get a lot of bizarre tut - tutting as if I were to fret that Charles Krauthammer should really write more serious psychology columns or something .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

One hour of Iraq spending could treat 817,000 cases of malaria Roger Brigham
Published : Friday November 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Spending so far on Iraq would pay for 3.6 million four - year college educations President Bushs request to Congress in October for an additional $ 45.9 billion for the war in Iraq has brought the total federal outlay since the war began to $ 196.4 billion .
A Democratic report earlier this month estimated that the wars ' total costs could be much higher -- as much as $ 3.5 trillion -- if " hidden " costs like the rising price of oil , veterans ' healthcare and interest on borrowed money are included .
RAW STORY sat down with some figures and asked :
If the money for war on Iraq had been spent on other programs , such as education and health , what could the money have bought ?
Here 's what we came up with .

The College Board puts the average annual cost of a public college education at $ 13,589 .
Had that $ 196.4 billion been invested four years ago on education , assuming each student took four years of schooling , it could have fully funded 3.6 million college graduates during that period .
If the cost reaches $ 3.5 trillion , as Democrats contend , the money would fund 64 million grads -- some 256 million years of schooling .

In 2006 , the Senate asked for $ 230 million to buy three V - 22 Osprey tilt - rotor aircraft that critics said would never be combat effective .
That money could have provided health care coverage to the nearly 230,000 California children who do not have it , a cost that comes in at just under $ 1,200 per year per child according to the California HealthCare Foundation .

A far bigger killer than Saddam Hussein or al Qaeda over the past few decades has been malaria , which is on the rise in Brazil , large parts of Asia , and sub -Saharan Africa , where it is the biggest barrier to economic development .
While the Defense Department said in 2006 the war was costing $ 100,000 a minute , the World Health Organization was estimating malaria was killing two children every minute and more than a million people every year .
The annual cost in terms of lost productivity and treatment in tropical Africa alone is estimated at $ 1.8 billion  about one billion more than was being lost two decades ago .
At $ 7.34 per treatment , one hour 's worth of expenditures on Iraq could have treated 817,000 people in Africa .
The $ 196.4 billion spent on the war altogether could have provided doses for all 600 million people stricken globally every year ... for 44 years .
Experts from the U.S. Surgeon General to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger say obesity is epidemic in the United States , almost as perilous to American health as tobacco .
A six - week trip to a fat farm in the Catskills or Berkshires costs about $ 5,200 .
The estimated $ 51.8 billion spent on Iraq in 2006 could have sent the 9 million American kids aged 6 to 19 years old who need to shape up to camp for the entire summer  with car fare thrown in .

The National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies ( NACCRRA ) says daycare for babies and toddlers averages $ 8,150 per year and about $ 6,400 for preschoolers .
With about 22 percent of American kids under the age of 6 living in homes below the poverty level , picking up the tab would have cost the federal government $ 39 billion  less than the U.S. spends in 10 months in Iraq .
 According to PayScale , Arabic translators earn an average of $ 80,000 per year .
The total money allocated for Iraq so far could have paid 20,000 translators for 12 years .
 Several Arabic translators with military experience have been bounced out of the service under the Armed Forces ' " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy , many in the months since 9/11 .
The General Accounting Office estimated in 2005 the military had already spent $ 191 million to recruit and train replacements for gay service members it had discharged  almost twenty times the allocation of $ 10 million for hate crime enforcement that the Senate tacked onto a proposed $ 460 billion defense spending bill for 2008 .
 ProLiteracy Worldwide says last year 's $ 564 million in federal spending for adult literacy and English - as - a - second - language courses helped only one - tenth of the 30 million adults in the U.S. they need to reach .
The U.S. House Labor / HHS
Appropriations bill for 2008 would increase that by $ 25 million but would still leave 27 million adults without educational resources .
They could all be enrolled in adult classes with just the $ 5.3 billion the administration added to its request for Iraq in July .

The Centers for Disease Control estimates 40,000 people in the U.S. are infected with HIV every year , and AIDS activists have said federal spending to assist indigent HIV patients with meals , assisted living and legal aid under the Ryan White Care Act needs to be doubled .
The allocation has been frozen at $ 2.1 billion for the past few years , while the number of cities covered has increased , and as a result , programs in areas such as New York City , Los Angeles and San Francisco have been faced with budget cutbacks .
The $ 2.1 billion that New Jersey alone would have to contribute to just the administration 's request in October for an additional $ 45.9 billion would be enough to double the amount spent on the half million people eligible for the Ryan White programs .
Harvard University biologists have identified a molecular pathway active in neurons that interacts with RNA to regulate the formation of long - term memory in fruit flies .
The same pathway is also found at mammalian synapses , and could eventually present a target for new therapeutics to treat human memory loss .
The findings will be presented this week on the web site of the journal Cell .
Even for a fruit fly , learning and memory are important adaptive tools that facilitate survival in the environment .
A fly can learn to avoid what may do it harm , such as a flyswatter , or in the laboratory , an electric shock that happens when it smells a certain odor .
" It has been known for some time that learning and long - term memory require synthesis of new proteins , but exactly how protein synthesis activity relates to memory creation and storage has not been clear , " says Sam Kunes , professor of molecular and cellular biology in Harvard 's Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
" We have been able to monitor , for the first time , the synthesis of protein at the synapses between neurons as an animal learns , and we found a biochemical pathway that determines if and where this protein synthesis happens .
This pathway , called RISC , interacts with RNA at synapses to facilitate the protein synthesis associated with forming a stable memory .
In fruit flies , at least , this process makes the difference between remembering something for an hour and remembering it for a day or more . "
Together with lead author Shovon Ashraf , a postdoctoral researcher in Harvard 's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , and Harvard undergraduates Anna McLoon and Sarah Sclarsic , Kunes found that messenger RNA ( mRNA ) -- a genetic photocopy that conveys information from DNA to a cell 's translation machinery -- is transported to synapses as a memory begins to form .
This mRNA transport , and the protein synthesis that follows , are facilitated by components of the RISC pathway , which use very short RNA molecules called microRNAs to guide their activity .
One of these RISC proteins , called Armitage , appears to be a critical regulatory molecule in long - lasting memory formation , and has to be destroyed at particular synapses in order for protein synthesis to occur there .
By manipulating the RISC pathway , Kunes and colleagues were able to alter flies ' memory , changing their response to stimuli in subsequent behavioral tests .
Using a classical learning test that simultaneously exposes the insects to an odor and an electric shock , the researchers found that long - term memory could be greatly increased by adjusting the activity of the RISC pathway in the fruit flies .
" In essence , these flies had twice the memory of their normal counterparts , " Kunes says .
" When RISC was knocked out , so was long - term memory , and flies would remember to alter their behavior in the presence of the shock - linked odor for perhaps an hour ; that is , they only had short - term memory .
When the pathway was normally active , the flies remained averse to the odor for a day or more . "
Kunes says the various proteins that comprise the RISC pathway are also found at synapses in mice and humans , suggesting the pathway has been conserved by evolution and that it could be a target for new medications to boost human memory .

German police have expressed frustration about their inability to decipher the encryption used by Skype in order to tap into the VoIP calls of suspected terrorists .
Lawful interception ( or wiretapping ) of telephone calls has happened since before the time of rotary phones .
In many countries , telecos must promise to allow wiretapping to be granted a license .
VoIP services provided by software firms independent of ISPs complicate this picture .
" The encryption with Skype telephone software ... creates grave difficulties for us , " said Joerg Ziercke , president of Germany 's Federal Police Office ( BKA ) at an annual gathering of security and law enforcement officials .
" We can't decipher it .
That 's why we 're talking about source telecommunication surveillance - that is , getting to the source before encryption or after it 's been decrypted . "
Ziercke 's comments are an attempt to justify controversial German plans , yet to be legally approved , to develop " remote forensic software " ( AKA a law enforcement Trojan ) .
Proposals to give explicit permission for law enforcement officials to plant malware stem from a Federal Court ruling earlier this year declaring clandestine searches of suspects ' computers to be inadmissible as evidence , pending a law regulating the practice .
The idea of a law enforcement Trojan has sparked a fierce civil liberties debate , as well as objections from the IT security community .
German police are reportedly looking to hire two " specialists " to develop " white hat " malware .
Ziercke 's comments provide an insight into the sort of capabilities , such as capturing the raw output of microphones on compromised PCs , that these law enforcement Trojans ought to have .
Ziercke told reporters that it was not asking Skype to divulge its encryption keys or leave " back doors open " for law enforcement authorities , arguing that such requests would leave the eBay - owned VoIP firm at a competitive disadvantage to other services .
" There are no discussions with Skype .
I do n't think that would help .
I do n't think that any provider would go for that , " he said .

Computer Simulation by UCR Physicist Predicts Voyager 2 Spacecraft Will Reach Major Milestone in Space in Late 2007 or Early 2008
According to model , spacecraft will cross “ termination shock ” one more time , in mid-2008
NEWS MEDIA CONTACT
RIVERSIDE , Calif . —
Using a computer model simulation , Haruichi Washimi , a physicist at UC Riverside , has predicted when the interplanetary spacecraft Voyager 2 will cross the “ termination shock , ” the spherical shell around the solar system that marks where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speed .
According to Washimi ’s simulations , the spacecraft is set to cross the termination shock in late 2007 - early 2008 .
To make this forecast , Washimi and his colleagues used data from Voyager 2 and performed a global “ magneto - hydrodynamic simulation ” — a method that allows for precise and quantitative predictions of geomagnetic disturbances caused by solar activities .
Because Voyager 2 ’s crossing of the shock is expected to be an abrupt and relatively brief event , scientists are working to ensure that the most is made of the opportunity .
With an idea of when the spacecraft will cross the shock , they are better able to maximize coverage of the crossing .
Study results appear in the Dec. 1 issue of “ Washimi ’s model has predicted the location of a boundary that is approximately 90 times farther from the sun than is the Earth , to within a few percent , ” said Gary Zank , the director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics and one of the coauthors of the research paper .
“ This is truly remarkable given the enormous complexity of the physics involved , the temporal and spatial scales involved , and the variability of the solar wind conditions .
” The solar wind — a stream of charged particles ejected by the sun in all directions — travels at supersonic speeds when it leaves the sun , until it eventually encounters the interstellar medium made up of plasma , neutral gas and dust .
At the termination shock , located at 7 - 8.5 billion miles from the sun , the solar wind is decelerated to less than the speed of sound .
The boundary of the termination shock is not fixed , however , but wobbly , fluctuating in both time and distance from the sun , depending on solar activity .
“ This is the first time the termination - shock position has been forecast in this way , ” said Washimi , the lead author of the research paper and a scientist at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics .
“ After it crosses this boundary , Voyager 2 will be in the outer heliosphere beyond which lies the interstellar medium and galactic space .
Our simulations also show that the spacecraft will cross the termination shock again in the middle of 2008 .
This will happen because of the back and forth movement of the termination - shock boundary .
This means Voyager 2 will experience multiple crossings of the termination shock .
These crossings will come to an end after the spacecraft escapes into galactic space .
” Voyager 2 was launched Aug. 20 , 1977 .
It visited four planets and their moons in the course of its journey into space .
Its sister spacecraft Voyager 1 , which was launched Sept. 5 , 1977 , crossed the termination shock in December 2004 — earlier than Voyager 2 because of a shorter trajectory .
Both spacecraft are currently operational , but power sources have degraded and some of the instrumentation no longer works optimally .
In the future , the spacecraft will encounter their next milestone in space : the heliopause , which is the boundary where the interstellar medium brings the solar wind to a halt .
Washimi and Zank were joined in the research by UCR ’s Qiang Hu ; Takashi Tanaka of Kyushu University , Japan ; and Kazuoki Munakata of Shinshu University , Japan .
The research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
The University of California , Riverside ( www.ucr.edu) is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .

- It used to be dogma that the brain was shut away from the actions of the immune system , shielded from the outside forces of nature .
But that 's not how it is at all .
In fact , thanks to the scientific detective work of Kevin Tracey , MD , it turns out that the brain talks directly to the immune system , sending commands that control the body 's inflammatory response to infection and autoimmune diseases .
Understanding the intimate relationship is leading to a novel way to treat diseases triggered by a dangerous inflammatory response .
Dr. Tracey , director and chief executive of The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research , will be giving the 2007 Stetten Lecture on Wednesday , Oct. 24 , at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , MD .
His talk - Physiology and Immunology of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway - will highlight the discoveries made in his laboratory and the clinical trials underway to test the theory that stimulation of the vagus nerve could block a rogue inflammatory response and treat a number of diseases , including life - threatening sepsis .
With this new understanding of the vagus nerve 's role in regulating inflammation , scientists believe that they can tap into the body 's natural healing defenses and calm the sepsis storm before it wipes out its victims .
Each year , 750,000 people in the United States develop severe sepsis , and 215,000 will die no matter how hard doctors fight to save them .
Sepsis is triggered by the body 's own overpowering immune response to a systemic infection , and hospitals are the battlegrounds for these potentially lethal conditions .
The vagus nerve is located in the brainstem and snakes down from the brain to the heart and on through to the abdomen .
Dr. Tracey and others are now studying ways of altering the brain 's response or targeting the immune system itself as a way to control diseases .
Dr. Tracey is a neurosurgeon who came into research through the back door of the operating room .
More than two decades ago , he was treating a young girl whose body had been accidentally scorched by boiling water and she was fighting for her life to overcome sepsis .
She did n't make it .
Dr. Tracey headed into the laboratory to figure out why the body makes its own cells that can do fatal damage .
Dr. Tracey discovered that the vagus nerve speaks directly to the immune system through a neurochemical called acetylcholine .
And stimulating the vagus nerve sent commands to the immune system to stop pumping out toxic inflammatory markers .
" This was so surprising to us , " said Dr. Tracey , who immediately saw the potential to use vagus stimulation as a way to shut off abnormal immune system responses .
He calls this network " the inflammatory reflex . "
Research is now underway to see whether tweaking the brain 's acetylcholine system could be a natural way to control the inflammatory response .
Inflammation is key to many diseases - from autoimmune conditions like Crohn 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis to Alzheimer 's , where scientists have identified a strong inflammatory component .
Dr. Tracey has presented his work to the Dalai Lama , who has shown a great interest in the neurosciences and the mind - body connection .
He has also written a book called " Fatal Sequence , " about the double - edge sword of the immune system .

Interest rate ' freeze ' - the real story is fraud MORTGAGE MELTDOWN Bankers pay lip service to families while scurrying to avert suits , prison
Mortgage Meltdown .
The Denver Post Graphic Mortgage Meltdown .
The Denver Post Graphic Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Interest rate ' freeze ' - the real story is fraud 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
New proposals to ease our great mortgage meltdown keep rolling in .
First the Treasury Department urged the creation of a new fund that would buy risky mortgage bonds as a tactic to hide what those bonds were really worth .
( Not much . )
Then the idea was to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy the risky loans , even if it was clear that U.S. taxpayers would eventually be stuck with the bill .
But that plan went south after Fannie suffered a new accounting scandal , and Freddie 's existing loan losses shot up more than expected .
Now , just unveiled Thursday , comes the " freeze , " the brainchild of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
It sounds good :
For five years , mortgage lenders will freeze interest rates on a limited number of " teaser " subprime loans .
Other homeowners facing foreclosure will be offered assistance from the Federal Housing Administration .
But unfortunately , the " freeze " is just another fraud - and like the other bailout proposals , it has nothing to do with U.S. house prices , with " working families , " keeping people in their homes or any of that nonsense .
The sole goal of the freeze is to prevent owners of mortgage - backed securities , many of them foreigners , from suing U.S. banks and forcing them to buy back worthless mortgage securities at face value - right now almost 10 times their market worth .
The ticking time bomb in the U.S. banking system is not resetting subprime mortgage rates .
The real problem is the contractual ability of investors in mortgage bonds to require banks to buy back the loans at face value if there was fraud in the origination process .
And , to be sure , fraud is everywhere .
It 's in the loan application documents , and it's in the appraisals .
There are e-mails and memos floating around showing that many people in banks , investment banks and appraisal companies - all the way up to senior management - knew about it .
I can hear the hum of shredders working overtime , and maybe that is the new " hot " industry to invest in .
There are lots of people who would like to muzzle subpoena - happy New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to buy time and make this all go away .
Cuomo is just inches from getting what he needs to start putting a lot of people in prison .
I bet some people are trying right now to make him an offer " he can't refuse . "
Despite Thursday 's ballyhooed new deal with mortgage lenders , does anyone really think that it can ultimately stop fraud lawsuits by mortgage bond investors , many of them spread out across the globe ?
The catastrophic consequences of bond investors forcing originators to buy back loans at face value are beyond the current media discussion .
The loans at issue dwarf the capital available at the largest U.S. banks combined , and investor lawsuits would raise stunning liability sufficient to cause even the largest U.S. banks to fail , resulting in massive taxpayer - funded bailouts of Fannie and Freddie , and even FDIC .
The problem is n't just subprime loans .
It is the entire mortgage market .
As home prices fall , defaults will rise sharply - period .
And so will the patience of mortgage bondholders .
Different classes of mortgage bonds from various risk pools are owned by different central banks , funds , pensions and investors all over the world .
Even your pension or 401 ( k ) might have some of these bonds in it .
Perhaps some U.S. government department can make veiled threats to foreign countries to suggest they will suffer unpleasant consequences if their largest holders ( central banks and investment funds ) do n't go along with the plan , but how could it be possible to strong - arm everyone ?
What would be prudent and logical is for the banks that sold this toxic waste to buy it back and for a lot of people to go to prison .
If they knew about the fraud , they should have to buy the bonds back .
The time to look into this is before the shredders have worked their magic - not five years from now .
Those selling the " freeze " have suggested that mortgage - backed securities investors will benefit because they lose more with rising foreclosures .
But with fast - depreciating collateral , the last thing investors in mortgage bonds ought to do is put off foreclosures .
Rate freezes are at best a tool for delaying the inevitable foreclosures when even the most optimistic forecasters expect home prices to fall .
In October , Goldman Sachs issued a report forecasting an incredible 35 to 40 percent drop in California home prices in the coming few years .
To minimize losses , a mortgage bondholder would obviously be better off foreclosing on a home before prices plunge .
The goal of the freeze may be to delay bond investors from suing by putting off the big foreclosure wave for several years .
But it may also be to stop bond investors from suing .
If the investors agreed to loan modifications with the " real " wage and asset information from refinancing borrowers , mortgage originators and bundlers would have an excuse once the foreclosure occurred .
They could say , " Fraud ?
What fraud ?!
You knew the borrower 's real income and asset information later when he refinanced ! "
The key is to refinance borrowers whose current loans involved fraud in the origination process .
And I assure you it was a minority of borrowers whose loans did n't involve fraud .
The government is trying to accomplish wide - scale refinancing by tricking bond investors , or by tricking U.S. taxpayers .
Guess who will foot the bill now that the FHA is entering the fray ?
Ultimately , the people in these secret Paulson meetings were probably less worried about saving the mortgage market than with saving themselves .
Some might be looking at prison time .
As chief of Goldman Sachs , Paulson was involved , to degrees as yet unrevealed , in the mortgage securitization process during the halcyon days of mortgage fraud from 2004 to 2006 .
Paulson became the U.S. Treasury secretary on July 10 , 2006 , after the extent of the debacle was coming into focus for those in the know .
Goldman Sachs achieved recent accolades in the markets for having bet heavily against the housing market , while Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , Bear Sterns , Merrill Lynch and others got hammered for failing to time the end of the credit bubble .
Goldman Sachs is the only major investment bank in the United States that has emerged as yet unscathed from this debacle .
The success of its strategy must have resulted from fairly substantial bets against housing , mortgage banking and related industries , which also means that Goldman Sachs saw this coming at the same time they were bundling and selling these loans .
If a mortgage bond investor sues Goldman Sachs to force the institution to buy back loans , could Paulson be forced to testify as to whether Goldman Sachs knew or had reason to know about fraud in the origination process of the loans it was bundling ?
It is truly amazing that right now everyone in the country is deferring to Paulson and the heads of Countrywide , JPMorgan , Bank of America and others as the best group to work out a solution to this problem .
No one is talking about the fact that these people created the problem and profited to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars from it .
I suspect that such a group first sat down and tried to figure out how to protect their financial interests and avoid criminal liability .
And then when they agreed on the plan , they decided to sell it as " helping working families stay in their homes . "
That 's why these meetings were secret , and reporters and the public were n't invited .
The next time that Paulson is before the Senate Finance Committee , instead of asking , " How much money do you think we should give your banking buddies ? "
I 'd like to see New York Sen .
Chuck Schumer ask him what he knew about this staggering fraud at the time he was chief of Goldman Sachs .
The Goldman report in October suggests that rampant investor demand is to blame for origination fraud - even though these investors were misled by high credit ratings from bond rating agencies being paid billions by the U.S. investment banks , like Goldman , that were selling the bundled mortgages .
This logic is like saying shoppers seeking bargain - priced soup encourage the grocery store owner to steal it .
I mean , we 're talking about criminal fraud here .
We are on the cusp of a mammoth financial crisis , and the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
Treasury are trying to limit the liability of their banking friends under the guise of trying to help borrowers .
At stake is nothing short of the continued existence of the U.S. banking system .
My thanks to the kind reader who sent me the programme from this year 's Christmas carol service at the Old Royal Naval College chapel in Greenwich .
It was written by the Rev Jules Gomes , chaplain of the college , and of Trinity College of Music , and also of the University of Greenwich .
Here is the good chaplain 's Christmas message : " More Christians have been martyred for their faith in the last century than in any other period of church history .
Yesterday 's Herod is today 's Richard Dawkins and Polly Toynbee , seeking the total extermination of all forms of Christianity .
The great irony is that the greatest opposition to Christ comes from so - called broad - minded people who seek to ban Christmas so that people of other faiths are not offended . "
Yes , it is that time of year when secularists , atheists and humanists become the Grinches who stole Christmas .
As an honorary associate of the National Secular Society and president of the British Humanist Association , here is my cue to offer you all a rattling good Christmas " Bah , humbug ! " .
Except , of course , it 's all utter nonsense .
No one is out to ban Christmas or Christianity - not atheists nor other faiths .
Yet every year the same urban myths are repeated about the banning of Christmas by some pantomime villain local authority suffering from " political correctness gone mad " .
King Rat Christmas wreckers are unearthed , and every year these turn out to be garbage stories , but they are stored in the attic for another airing next December .
I had at least five calls from broadcasters this year inviting me to say it would be a jolly good thing if Christmas were rebranded Winterval .
That myth began years ago when Birmingham city council tried to spread the festive season across the long winter - though it never replaced Christmas , which came with official celebrations in the middle of it .
But the Winterval myth lives on .
This year it was joined by this : " God rest ye merry people all , Let nothing go to waste , So let us all this Decemberval , Recycle now with haste . "
Although written by a vicar for Warrington 's Christmas recycling campaign , watch Decemberval enter anti-Christmas demonology .
Christmas opinion polls stir the same pot .
Theos , the religious thinktank , found a quarter of adults and over a third of 18 - to 24 - year - olds could n't say where Jesus was born .
Over half did n't know John the Baptist was Jesus 's cousin ; over a quarter did n't know who told Mary she was pregnant ; and 78 % had no idea where Mary and Joseph fled to escape Herod .
Even the faithful were ignorant : only 36 % of regular churchgoers got all four answers right .
I regard this as awful .
The loss of classical mythology has made much poetry , art and literature incomprehensible to most people .
The loss of Christian mythology would make most European history and painting impenetrable .
Secularists do not welcome ignorance as a substitute for declining faith .
Pursuing their annual " atheists are stealing Christmas " riff , a Sunday Telegraph survey of 100 schools found only one in five had a traditional nativity play this year , which is odd considering over a third of primaries are Christian .
The sad truth is that some did no play , but others did Scrooge , Arabian Nights , Hansel and Gretel , or the Snow Queen , all also cultural treasures .
British Christians yearn to be martyrs , but frankly atheists are a pretty toothless substitute for lions .
In a daft parliamentary debate this month on something called Christianophobia , Mark Pritchard MP accused the politically correct of banning religion from Christmas cards and advent calendars : " Many shoppers find it increasingly difficult to purchase greetings cards that refer to Jesus . "
Alas , market forces are probably rather stronger than humanist plots : with only 7 % of people in church of a Sunday these days , Santa and the Snowman trump the nativity .
Evangelicals started a new myth this year that postage stamps with the Madonna and child are only sold under the counter : you have to ask for them , for fear of offending Muslims and Jews .
Stuff and nonsense , retorted the Post Office .
But you can bet this one will run and run - along with last year 's myth that 70 % of offices banned Christmas decorations for multicultural reasons .
Another year it was the Red Cross banning cribs .
All this would just be seasonal silliness if it were not cover for a more sinister drumbeat .
The right has taken to flying the " Christian " flag in ways that suggest none too subtly that foreigners - Muslims - are stealing our culture and traditions .
" They " are stopping " us " celebrating Christmas and teaching Christian stories to our children .
When Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , appeared on GMTV this week , although as usual he denied any atheist plot against Christmas , the theme in about 3,000 emails afterwards was : " We are not Muslims , our culture must not be silenced to avoid offending them . "
The BNP has been quick to cash in .
In the Christianophobia debate in parliament , the reported case of a BNP Christmas card was raised , " which portrays the holy family on the cover and inside are the words ' Heritage , Tradition and Culture ' " .
Pritchard warned television firms : " The fear of violence from a particular faith group should not be grounds for hand - selecting or targeting other faith groups who may choose to protest peacefully . "
Fear of Muslim violence is killing off peaceful Christianity , he implies .
But blaming mythical secular political correctness is usually a cover for more sinister suggestions that " our way of life " is under threat from foreigners .
Hastening to defend themselves against the charge , Trevor Phillips , chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission , assembled imams , rabbis , Sikh and Hindu leaders to protest that they had no objection to Christmas , asserting that they sent Christmas cards , they liked cribs , and " it 's a great holiday for everyone " .
Leave Christmas alone was the message , addressed again to the hypothetical politically correct secularists .
But we are innocent .
It is the Christians who are stirring this dangerous pot , inventing non-stories , yearning for martyrdom - and worse , fermenting an outraged sense among the mainly secular population that they had better call themselves Christian because , as the BNP says , British " Heritage , Tradition and Culture " ( read Kultur ) are under threat from Muslims .
While pretending to attack us , covertly these Christians stir resentment against immigrants .
As more faith trouble brews , it becomes ever more important not to ban religions , but to keep religion out of all functions of the state .
It needs to be taught in schools , acted out in nativity plays , too , if they want - but without dangerously segregating children by their faith in sectarian religious institutions .
And at last we have at least one political party leader brave enough to admit , like most people , that he does n't believe in God .
As for secularists and humanists at Christmas , Dawkins himself told a disappointed BBC interviewer that he loves singing carols .
And so do I .
Not just Away in a Manger or Oh Little Town nostalgic childhood tunes , but all the enjoyably rich and strange theology of " Lo !
He abhors not the Virgin 's womb ... Veiled in flesh the Godhead see , Hail the incarnate Deity " , and other such quaint delights .
Is it hypocritical to sing songs with words whose literal truth you do not believe ?
Any such sad edict would leave most great love songs , hymns and arias unsung .
If the royal family can trill , with solemn faces and gladsome minds , " What can I give him , poor as I am ? " then anyone can .

We ’ve seen a growing body of evidence of late that far - right social conservatives really are prepared to break with the Republican Party if Rudy Giuliani is the GOP ’s presidential nominee .
An LAT / Bloomberg poll released last week , for example , found that Giuliani is still the frontrunner for the nomination , but “ about one - third of GOP voters said they would consider supporting a third - party candidate in the general election if the party nominee supported abortion and gay rights . ”
A new survey conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found even more striking results .
[ A ] solid majority of Republican white evangelicals ( 55 % ) say they would at least consider voting for a conservative third - party candidate if the general election is between Giuliani and Clinton .
Overall , 44 % of Republicans and Republican - leaning voters say they would consider backing a third - party candidate who holds more conservative positions than Giuliani on social issues like abortion and gay marriage .
So , more than half of white evangelical Republicans are prepared to withhold support from the GOP next year — and according to the data , these evangelicals comprise more than a third of the party .
No wonder Giuliani is trying to reposition himself as pro-life .
Post Script :
And speaking of Giuliani , be sure to check out today 's Krugman : " Giuliani has a habit of saying things , on issues that range from health care to national security , that are demonstrably untrue .
And the American people have a right to know that . "
In game A , a player tosses a single loaded coin and bets on each throw .
The probability of winning is less than half .
In game B , there are two coins and the rules are more complicated .
The player tosses either Coin 1 , loaded to lose almost all the time or Coin 2 loaded to win more than half the time .
He plays Coin 1 if his money is a multiple of a particular whole number , like three .
If his money cannot be divided evenly by that number , he plays Coin 2 .
In this setup , the second coin will be played more often than the first .
'' Sure enough , '' Dr. Abbott said , when a person plays either game A or game B 100 times , all money taken to the gambling table is lost .
But when the games are alternated -- playing A twice and B twice for 100 times -- money is not lost .
It accumulates into big winnings .
Even more surprising , he said , when game A and B are played randomly , with no order in the alternating sequence , winnings also go up and up .
Because these results seem so surprising , the outcome is paradoxical -- Parrando 's paradox .
Switching between the two games seemed to create a ratchet - like effect .
With its saw - tooth shape , a ratchet allows movement in one direction and blocks it in the other .
'' You see ratchets everywhere in life , '' Dr. Abbott said .
'' Any child knows that when you shake a bag of mixed nuts , the Brazil nuts rise to the top .
This is because smaller nuts block downward movement of larger nuts . ''
This trapping of heavier objects -- moving them upward when one would expect them to fall down -- is the essence of a ratchet .
The same is true for particles that tend to move randomly within cells but can be captured , or ratcheted , into performing useful work .
This is how many proteins and enzymes are designed , Dr. Abbott said .
Can you think of something more universal and handy than Velcro ?
If you look around your house and your closet , I am sure you can find hundreds of items that use it .
Well , soon those items may be replaced by something better .
As much as I appreciate the old hook - and - loop Velcro , invented in 1941 by Georges de Mestral , I am glad to find out that a better Velcro has finally been created .
This new and improved Velcro still has the same goal in mind - to bind two items together , but it does n't have all the shortcomings of the original Velcro : noisy when it 's pulled apart , absorbs moisture , wears out quickly , catches on to hair and fabrics , etc .
Leonard Duffy , a 66 year old architect , is the inventor of this reinvented Velcro .
What he invented is 8 times stronger and much more durable than the original .
Best of all , it is much quieter too .
Anyone trying to open something with Velcro quietly knows how impossible that is .
Mr. Duffy calls his innovation " sliding engaging fastener " .
His invention has " ‘islands ' with undercut edges that self - align then slide into interlocked positions , resisting shear and uplift . "
So instead of a hook and a loop to connect to each other , there are shapes with special cut edges that slide and hold each other in place .
For more details on how it actually works , you can see his U.S. Patent 5983467 at freepatentsonline .
It took Leonard Duffy 8 years and $ 40,000 to develop the new kind of Velcro and has already thought of great ways to use it .
With the new Velcro , he has won the grand prize in the " Create the Future " design for creating the Unity Wrap .
The Unity Wrap is a breathable , waterproof cast inspired by his sister - in - law who had to wear a removable cast with straps made of Velcro which pulled at her clothes and because of moisture absorption eventually smelled bad .
He listened to her complaints and now a prosthetic company and product designers are interested in his Velcro cast innovation .
You can read more about it at the 2007 PopSci Invention Awards .

Two weeks ago , the Democratic response to President Bush ’s weekly radio address was delivered by a 12 - year - old , Graeme Frost .
Graeme , who along with his sister received severe brain injuries in a 2004 car crash and continues to need physical therapy , is a beneficiary of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
Mr. Bush has vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have expanded that program to cover millions of children who would otherwise have been uninsured .
What followed should serve as a teaching moment .
First , some background .
The Frosts and their four children are exactly the kind of people S - chip was intended to help : working Americans who ca n’t afford private health insurance .
The parents have a combined income of about $ 45,000 , and do n’t receive health insurance from employers .
When they looked into buying insurance on their own before the accident , they found that it would cost $ 1,200 a month — a prohibitive sum given their income .
After the accident , when their children needed expensive care , they could n’t get insurance at any price .
Fortunately , they received help from Maryland ’s S - chip program .
The state has relatively restrictive rules for eligibility : children must come from a family with an income under 200 percent of the poverty line .
For families with four children that ’s $ 55,220 , so the Frosts clearly qualified .
Is this the face you want to wake up to every morning ?
Well , according to Drudge ( I know , I know , consider the source ) , MSNBC is strongly considering Michael Smerconish as the replacement for Don Imus .
What is it with these suits ?
Do they think we need another conservative talking head on TV ?
Do we need another fact - challenged pundit that goes out of his way to smear liberals ?
Have they not internalized the results of the last election ?
Why are they ignoring the fact that the show on MSNBC with the rising ratings in the money demographic is Countdown , a show thankfully devoid of conservative punditry in lieu of news ?
Why on earth would they want to go after FOX 's audience , especially since their ratings breakdowns show that their viewers are far from the coveted 21 - 54 bracket ?
So here 's an idea , Mr. Bill Wolff , VP of MSNBC and Dan Abrams , General Manager : how about trying out media people who will bring in that sought after demographic ?
People like Sam Seder , The Young Turks , my buddy Cliff Schecter ( who has appeared on MSNBC numerous times ) , or even better , how about MSNBC counter - programming to the egregious FNC's " It 's Out There " and create " Crooks and Liars TV " where we connect the dots on cable news the way it has n't before ?
Please , unless you really want another apologist for the Republican party on the air , let the management of MSNBC know who you 'd rather see get Imus 's slot .
Remember , nasty - grams are easy to dismiss and ignore .
Being polite and reminding them of the advertising potential of the demographic they should n't be ignoring will get you much further .

Number of Americans who believe Saddam - 9/11 tie rises to 41 percent
Josh Catone
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
A new Newsweek poll out this weekend exposed " gaps " in America 's knowledge of history and current events .
Perhaps most alarmingly , 41 % of Americans answered ' Yes ' to the question " Do you think Saddam Husseins regime in Iraq was directly involved in planning , financing , or carrying out the terrorist attacks of September 11th , 2001 ? "
That total is actually up 5 points since September 2004 .
Further , a majority of people could n't identify Saudia Arabia as the country of origin of most of the 9/11 hijackers , even given the question in multiple choice format .
20 % answered Iraq , while 14 % believed the hijackers came from Iran .
A majority ( 52 % ) believe the US is losing the war against al Qaeda , however Newsweek disagrees .
In the magazine 's reporting of the poll , they made judgment that the US is in fact not " losing the fight against al - Qaeda or radical Islamic terrorism . "
Closer to home , 89 % of Americans are unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ( John Roberts ) , though a majority of those polled were able to name Nancy Pelosi as the current Speaker of the House .
A large majority of people said they did n't know or did n't care who the winner of this year 's American Idol competition was ( or at least were n't willing to admit it ) .
The full results of the Newsweek poll are available here .
The husband , who like others in this article was reached through his lawyer , said the decision to invade his wife ’s privacy was not an easy one .
“ If I were to tell you I have a pure ethical conscience over what I did , I ’d be lying , ” he said .
But he also pointed to companies that have Internet policies giving them the right to read employee e-mail messages .
“ When you ’re in a relationship like a marriage , which is emotional as well as , candidly , a business , I think you can look at it in the same way , ” he said .
When considering invading their spouse ’s privacy , husbands and wives cite an overriding desire to find out some secret .
One woman described sensing last year that her husband , a Manhattan surgeon , was distant and overly obsessed with his BlackBerry .
She drew him a bubble bath on his birthday and then pounced on the device while he was in the tub .
In his e-mail messages , she found evidence of an affair with a medical resident , including plans for them to meet that night .

A few weeks later , after the couple had tried to reconcile , the woman gained access to her husband ’s America Online account ( he had shared his password with her ) and found messages from a mortgage company .
It turned out he had purchased a $ 3 million Manhattan condominium , where he intended to continue his liaison .
“ Every single time I looked at his e-mail I felt nervous , ” the woman said .
“ But I did anyway because I wanted to know the truth . ”
Being on the receiving end of electronic spying can be particularly disturbing .
Jolene Barten - Bolender , a 45 - year - old mother of three who lives in Dix Hills , N.Y. , said that she was recently informed by AOL and Google , on the same day , that the passwords had been changed on two e-mail accounts she was using , suggesting that someone had gained access and was reading her messages .
Last year , she discovered a Global Positioning System , or G.P.S. , tracking device in a wheel well of the family car .

GOP presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee have opposing weaknesses .
Rudy has no morals , but plenty of cash and Huckabee is a former Baptist minister whose campaign is low on funds .
In other words , they could do a lot of good for each other and there appear to be some subtle , yet telling signs that the two may be working with each other behind the scenes to tackle the most potent common enemy between them -- Mitt Romney .
Last Sunday during an interview on ABC's This Week , the Huckster defended Rudy when asked about Trystgate :
Mr. Huckabee could easily have piled on , either overtly or with subtlety , but instead he offered a rather rousing defense of Mr. Giuliani , framing the story as the product of overzealous , context - ignorant reporting .
" I thought it was a cheap - shot at Rudy , " Mr. Huckabee declared .
" There 's no point in trying to dig through what his security detail did , unless they can specifically say that he personally ordered something .
Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Giuliani are ostensibly political opponents , but each is faced with the same immediate imperative in the Republican presidential race : to prevent Mitt Romney from running the table in the early primary and caucus states and running away with the nomination .
And there 's this --
An organization called Common Sense Groups , claiming to support Huckabee , hit Iowa voters with robo-calls attacking his opponents recently .
Upon further review , it turns out that the mastermind behind CSG just happens to be a Giuliani donor .
OUR MORAL UNIVERSE , AND THEIRS
S ullivan is a bloated bag of wind begging to be punctured , and his delusions about Israeli benevolence certainly have been pricked by the news that the 60 or so Israelis being held by the US since 9/11 are what Fox News calls " part of a long - running effort to spy on American government officials . "
And that 's not all : while " there is no indication the Israelis were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks , " we are told , " investigators suspect that they may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance and not shared it . "
If the Israelis had foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks , and failed to inform us , then just what moral universe are they living in ?
Surely one many light - years from our own .
YOU READ IT HERE FIRST
W hen the news first broke that not only Arabs are being held in the wake of 9/11 , to my knowledge I was the only columnist to deal with the subject of the mysterious Israelis in custody : " Israel and 9/11  Feds holding 60 Israelis in connection with 9/11 
Why ? "
While the Washington Post assured us that the Israeli detainees were only " observing a time - honored tradition in their country  touring the world after their mandatory service in the Israeli military , " I was more than a little skeptical :
" Something tells me these guys are no ordinary tourists , but since the US Government is keeping mum about everything connected with this investigation , we just do n't know . "
THE PLOT SICKENS
A h , but now some government officials are talking , and we know a lot more .
We know that some of the detainees have been identified as Israeli military or intelligence agents , and that some failed polygraph tests when asked whether they had engaged in covert operations " against and in the United States . "
We also know , courtesy of Fox News , that as many as 140 Israeli agents may have been rounded up in the US before 9/11 : the extent of Israel 's covert action operation is described as " sprawling . "
A GOOD GUESS
W hat were they doing here ?
Besides infiltrating a whole laundry list of government agencies , including the DEA , the FBI , military bases , and even targeting the private homes of government officials , they were also conducting surveillance on a group of Arab immigrants in California that authorities believe have connections to the 9/11 plot .
I 'll admit that the following was sheer speculation on my part , but it looks like I was dead right .
As I wrote in November :
" In rounding up untold hundreds of mostly Arab Muslim men , and interviewing thousands more , the Ashcroft Sweep is clearly designed to gather information that might lead them to the remaining conspirators .
It could be that the Israelis , or at least some of them , fall into this category : while not being directly involved , maybe they know something . "
RETALIATION PLUS
W hat did they know , and when did they know it ?
That is the question that must now be answered , and pronto .
For remember what the President said : " You are either with us , or you are with the terrorists . "
If the Israelis had advance notice of 9/11  via their spy network in the US , which kept the hijackers and their associates under surveillance  then this is " harboring " terrorists , by any definition of the term .
Look what happened to the Taliban when they harbored bin Laden .
If Israel did indeed betray us , and let 3,500 people die at the World Trade Center , then they deserve what the Afghanis got  plus a little bit more .
WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE …
A t least Mullah Omar and the Taliban never made any bones about the depth of their contempt for the US .
Israel , on the other hand , pretends to be our staunchest ally , more royalist than the king when it comes to confronting the declared enemies of the West .
Yet an undeclared enemy , posing as a friend , is in many ways a greater potential threat  as , perhaps , we are beginning to learn .
CLASSIFIED AND CONFIRMED
W hen asked for details about the detention of the Israelis , a highly placed investigator huffed that " Evidence linking these Israelis to 9 - 11 is classified , I can not tell you about evidence that has been gathered .
It is classified information . "
Aside from affirming that such evidence exists , this same source admitted to the Los Angeles Times that there were certain " tie-ins " with 9/11 .
Some patriotic law enforcement officials seem to have leaked just enough information to practically confirm our worst suspicions .
As Brit Hume put it in his lead - in to the first of Carl Cameron 's four - part investigative report , top US law enforcement officials now believe the Israelis " may have known things they did n't tell us before September 11 . "
THE UNFORGIVEN
A fter funneling over $ 90 billion into the Israeli settler state , making enemies of the entire Arab world , and sticking by Israel through thick and thin , is this our reward  a stab in the back ?
If true , this story is a devastating blow to the Israel First crowd in the US , one from which it may never recover .
Americans quickly forgot the sinking of the USS Liberty , and those who remembered were for the most part willing to forgive .
The average person has probably never heard of Jonathan Pollard , the CIA agent who spied for Israel .
Pollard severely compromised US intelligence sources and methods , which eventually wound up in Soviet hands  and yet our alliance with Israel survived .
But this  the withholding of information that could have prevented the 9/11 mass murder  is well nigh unforgivable .
A McCAIN MOMENT
T his story is also a devastating blow to the War Party and its plans for an all - out attack on Iraq .
To understand why , we have only to listen to Senator John McCain  the most belligerent and tireless of the warmongers  going up against a skeptical Chris Matthews , who wanted to know if the Senator thought we should conquer Iraq and set up a military occupation .
McCain looked pained , and replied : " I do n't pretend to prescribe the exact strategy . "
Scott McConnell captured this McCain Moment well in a column for Antiwar.com :
" Then he fell back to what he believed to be his Maginot Line , the argument that trumps all arguments .
My nightmare 
I have several nightmares about Saddam Hussein , but one of them is the that SCUD missile which he has .
. . that 's in the view of most , aimed at Israel .
Aimed at Israel . "
Well then , said Matthews , why does n't Israel take them out ?
McCain , stunned , hemmed and hawed for a moment , and finally said :
" Because I 'm not sure we should ask the Israelis to do  to take care of a threat to the United States of America . "
Matthews : " But you just said it was a threat to Israel . "
McCain : " Well to world peace , I think . "
Matthews : " No you said it was a threat to Israel .
Why should the United States deal with a threat to Israel ?
Why do n't we let Israel  we 've been giving them $ 3 billion a year to defend themselves .
Why do n't we say , ‘ Defend yourselves .
You 've got a clear fight .
Go take Saddam out ' ? "
McCain : " Because I think it 's our job .
I think we 're the world 's leader and I . . . "
Matthews : " Our job is to defend Israel ? "
Equating our " national interest " with the defense of Israel , McCain 's answer was , essentially , yes .
But no one said this was a mutual defense pact .
Israel wants us to defend them : yet who , pray tell , will defend us from the Israelis ?
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
I t was Pat Buchanan , during the first Gulf war , who dared speak truth to power , and was smeared for it : the war on Iraq , he said , serves the interests of the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the US , while the US has nothing to gain .
We are glad to see that Chris Matthews has finally caught on .
NOW I GET IT !
B ack in November I made note of a rather curious news report about the arrest of five Israelis who were caught videotaping the World Trade Center as it burned , all the while laughing and joking uproariously .
This odd group was turned in by suspicious neighbors , and all five were jailed for two months , then deported back to Israel .
This story , when first reported , was baffling : what , I wondered , were they laughing about ?
Today , the likely answer seems all too horrifically clear .
TURNABOUT
I f and when it comes out that the Israelis stood by and watched as the terrorists took down the twin towers and the Pentagon , they are finished as our principal ally in the Middle East .
As Americans begin to realize the enormity of the Israeli betrayal , and more details of the " sprawling " Israeli spy operation are revealed , the Israeli lobby will be in roughly the same position as the Arab - American community in the wake of 9/11 .
The backlash will be a tidal wave of anger , and it could get ugly .
The same bullies who turned on their fellow Americans of Arab descent could just as easily turn on Jewish Americans , collectively condemning them as a " fifth column " in classic anti-Semitic style  and a grave injustice will be compounded .
PASSIONATE ATTACHMENTS
F rom all this , Americans will relearn an important lesson , one originally taught to us by George Washington in his " Farewell Address " and long since forgotten , especially where Israel is concerned :
" A passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils .
Sympathy for the favorite nation , facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists , and infusing into one the enmities of the other , betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification .
It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions ; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained , and by exciting jealousy , ill - will , and a disposition to retaliate , in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld . "
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU
S ince this is one of those " do n't say I did n't warn you " columns , I want to note that on the same day [ December 11 ] the report on the Israeli spy operation came out , we also heard the news of Irv Rubin 's arrest in a plot to blow up a large Los Angeles mosque and the office of Congressman Darrel Issa .
Rubin is the self - styled " international chairman " of the Jewish Defense League ( JDL ) , a group of violent nutballs responsible for several bombings over the years .
The JDL was founded by the infamous racist and fascist Meir Kahane , whose Kach movement is outlawed as a violent hate group in Israel .
Kahane held that the Arabs are subhuman , and therefore it 's okay to expel them from the territory of a Greater Israel : indeed , for Kahane and his followers , ethnic cleansing amounts to a religious duty .
When Rubin , who has been arrested more than 40 times , was touted by the Libertarian Party as its latest recruit , and a big spread boasting of this glorious achievement was featured on the front page of the Libertarian Party News , I wrote a column partially devoted to warning of the possible consequences : " This guy is a walking time bomb , " I opined , " just waiting to go off . "
Do n't say I did n't warn you  and , remember , you read it here first … .

Note :
If you came here via Reddit or Buzzflash , you 'll want to read the update , which continues to explore this thesis .
Go here .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s office has avoided fully disclosing payments of $ 1.7 million in nonprofit funds for private jets , hotel suites and support staff for his trips overseas , according to state documents and interviews .
Record - keeping for many of the governor ’s luxury - class jaunts has been by word of mouth .
Asked how the staff tracks the costs , subject to public disclosure laws , Schwarzenegger attorney Daniel Maguire said : “ Orally . ”
In late 2004 , the multimillionaire governor stopped reporting the travel expenses on state disclosure forms that itemize gifts to elected officials .
Instead , Schwarzenegger ’s top aides recorded some of the costs -- and made only general references to others -- in memos they wrote to themselves and filed away in the governor ’s legal affairs office .
Several of the memos did not include dollar amounts , even though regulations under the state Political Reform
Act require that such figures be disclosed in a written public record within 30 days of payment .
After The Times asked for those amounts -- some missing since 2004 -- the governor ’s office took more than two months to produce them .
Schwarzenegger has frequently called for more transparency -- what he calls the “ antiseptic of sunshine ” -- in state government .
But nonprofit watchdogs and open - government advocates called his aides ’ handling of the travel costs deceptive , a way to thwart scrutiny of the lavish spending by the tax - exempt charity that foots the bill .
“ They ’re trying to not have written records , ” said Bob Stern , president of the Center for Governmental Studies .
“ I would call it creative accounting -- creative oral accounting . ”
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said the governor ’s office did nothing wrong .
“ We ’ve been following the law all along , ” he said .
The expenses include leased Gulfstream jets costing up to $ 10,000 per hour and suites going for thousands of dollars a night .
They are paid for by the California State Protocol Foundation , a Chamber of Commerce - aligned nonprofit whose usually secret contributors receive the same tax deductions as donors to food banks and universities .
Unlike campaign contributors , the foundation ’s supporters can donate unlimited amounts without revealing their names in most cases .
The financial information in the gift memos created by the governor ’s aides came from conversations with officials , said Maguire , Schwarzenegger ’s deputy legal affairs secretary .
“ We hear it , ” he said .
“ It ’s a phone call . ”
Stern scoffed at such a procedure for large and specific dollar figures .
“ Oh , sure , ” he said with a laugh .
Maguire insisted that the memos are public records that satisfy disclosure rules .
Several costs , among them $ 353,000 for a single round - trip to China on a private jet in 2005 , did not initially appear in the memos .
They were added after The Times filed state Public Records
Act requests for them .
Maguire said the governor ’s office did not keep any copies of invoices that it submitted for payment to the Protocol Foundation , which also has paid for some ground transportation and commercial flights on the trips .
Trent Stamp , president of Charity Navigator , an online rating service for nonprofits , said the lax disclosure was “ beyond the pale . ”
Aaron Dorfman , executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy , said the actions by Schwarzenegger and the foundation are “ highly irregular , ” and “ a clear example of philanthropy being abused . ”
Not true , said Larry Dicke , treasurer of the foundation and chief financial officer of the chamber .
He said the gifts benefited all Californians by promoting investment in the state .
“ I do n’t think they ’re trying to hide anything , ” Dicke said of the governor ’s office .
Schwarzenegger ’s representatives say he did not have to report the travel costs on the standard disclosure form because the payments for the jets and suites were gifts to his office , not to him .
That marks a reversal of the governor ’s previous practice , which was to report the payments on his annual Statement of Economic Interests , a form whose contents are routinely reviewed by the news media .
The Reform
Act requires officials to include on the statements any gifts they receive as individuals .
“ We have since determined they are gifts to the office , ” McLear said of the travel expenses , adding that the governor must fly on private aircraft for security reasons .
But Dorfman and others said it was obvious that the jets and hotel suites were intended for Schwarzenegger ’s personal comfort and enjoyment .
And two people with ties to Schwarzenegger said that he cherishes the jets as a lifestyle perk , and that his staff decided that reporting the costs on the disclosure forms would become embarrassing .
The two said they believe that his aides looked for a less visible way to meet the public records requirement .
“ They are super - sensitive about the jet , ” said one of the people , who , like the other , asked not to be named for fear of angering Schwarzenegger .
The second source said Schwarzenegger ’s staff thought it was “ covered ” legally after the Protocol Foundation solicited an advice letter from the staff of the state Fair Political Practices Commission on whether the payments were gifts to the governor as an individual or to his office .
The letter said , in part , that the expenses need not be reported by Schwarzenegger personally if they are for official business and the governor ’s office determines which individuals get use of them .
But it was unclear whether the foundation had spelled out to the commission that the bulk of the payments often go to Schwarzenegger ’s Gulfstream and his hotel suites .
If the commission had been aware of that , Stern said , it might have advised the foundation that the payments were for the governor -- not the office -- and should be disclosed on his Statement of Economic Interests .
When The Times asked the commission about Schwarzenegger ’s travel expenses , Chairman Ross Johnson issued a prepared statement suggesting that the rules should be tightened .
“ Reform by its very nature is an ongoing process , and it may well be time for the commission to revisit our gift regulations , ” said Johnson , a Schwarzenegger appointee .
The Protocol Foundation is a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit , occupying the highest rung of tax - exempt groups as a public charity .
It has paid for the governor ’s travels to Japan , Europe , Canada and Mexico , in addition to China .
Schwarzenegger touts the trips as trade missions ; critics have belittled them as junkets and an opportunity for wealthy donors to curry favor with the governor .
By far the largest expense has been the jets , whose per-passenger leasing costs can be many times the price of first - class tickets for a commercial flight .
“ This kind of spending is out of line with what any prudent 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) would approve , ” Dorfman said .
Last month , Schwarzenegger hosted a fund - raiser for the Protocol Foundation that collected $ 435,000 from a variety of business interests .
Stamp said the governor ’s role in the fund - raiser was inappropriate , since he is its principal beneficiary .
“ When you ’re a charity mostly serving one individual and that individual is of great wealth and privilege , it ’s perverse , ” Stamp said .
On Thursday , the governor ’s office released the names of the donors who had attended the fund - raiser .
Under disclosure rules , the office was required to do so because the governor helped solicit the donations .
It was the first time a list of foundation donors had been made public .

To us , this is the most amazing section of the whole Mitchell Report .
Essentially , Dr. Robert Millman , the medical director of MLB , told a doctor who had criticized Mark McGwire 's use of andro that " everyone in baseball is irritated with you " and " if you do n't shut up , they 're going to sue you .
And that 's not all .
Another great section :
Bill Stoneman , who retired in 2007 as the general manager of the Los Angeles Angels , had a similar recollection of a presentation by Drs. Millman and Solomon .
He remembered wondering at the time why Major League Baseball had permitted the presentation , which to his recollection included the assertion that there was no evidence that anabolic steroids were bad for you .
He said that the baseball executives in attendance were universally frustrated with the message of leniency that was being conveyed .

That 's pretty amazing .
Apple has made a huge mistake by offering the fourth episode of the popular science fiction TV - show " Stargate Atlantis " instead of the season premiere via its iTunes store .
Soon after the episode leaked it spread to BitTorrent and other P2P networks .
The mistake was has not been made public by Apple but caused quite a bit of uproar among hardcore fans of the show .
In an attempt to set things straight , Apple offered the actual season premiere and $ 2 iTunes credit to all the Stargate Atlantis fans who accidentally downloaded episode 4 .
The mistake was apparently caused by a mix up between the production number and the broadcast number of the episodes .
Stargate Atlantis is not shot in a chronological order and the fourth episode , named “ Doppelganger ” , was the first episode that was shot for the fourth season , it therefore carried 401 as production number .
The iTunes store mistakingly thought that this was the broadcast number and offered it as the season premiere .
The wrong episode was available in the iTunes store for 24 hours before it was replaced by the real season premiere episode “ Adrift ”
Not surprisingly , the leaked episode – which is scheduled to air two weeks from now – is already widely available on BitTorrent and other filesharing networks .
It ’s not known if Apple will be compensating MGM , the production company of Stargate Atlantis , but we are sure they will be more careful next time .
a pig goes oink .
but oink goes croak .
( first rule of oink : do n’t talk about oink . )
More than anything else this year , music & software file - sharing site Oink changed the way I thought about the music industry & BitTorrent technology .
I ’d heard rumors of Oink for years but had n’t seen the members - only site until early ’07 .
Oink was anal , Oink was comprehensive .
The site administrators were fierce about quality — only high - quality files from original CD / vinyl rips could be posted .
Many releases were even posted as FLAC ( lossless ) files .
Oink allowed only entire releases , with complete tracklist information ( uploading an incomplete album or a poorly labeled MP3 could get you kicked off ) .
No bootlegs or concert recordings or unfinished pre-release mixes were permitted .
In many cases , I believe that downloading an album from Oink would be both faster ( more on this in a bit ) and give you more information about the CD than sites like iTunes .
Think about that … a free website , which gives fast downloads of music at equivalent or higher quality than the paid music sites .
And this free site has an incredibly deep collection of both new and old releases , usually in a variety of file formats and bit-rates .
It ’s overwhelming !
First thought : wow , Oink is an amazing library .
Second thought : wow , I really need to start selling DJ Rupture t- shirts , CD sales will only continue to drop & I gotta make money somehow !
My library metaphor for Oink makes more sense than economic analogies : for digital music & data , there ’s lots of demand but no scarcity at all , which either requires that we rebuild an economic model not based on supply & demand , or start embracing commons analogies .
I like living from my music but I also like libraries , the ideas behind libraries …
For fans , consideration of the music comes before questions of money and ownership – this is how it should be .
Any system that does n’t take that into account as a central fact is going to generate a lot of friction .
When I say ‘ system ’ , I mean everything from Sony to iTunes to white - label 12 ″ s that cost 8 - pounds ( $ 16.38 ! ) in London shops and only have 2 songs on them .
( I bought a bunch of these last week , and it hurt ) .
Oink did n’t offer solutions ; it highlighted the problems of over - priced , over - controlled music elsewhere .
Oink was an online paradise for music fans .
The only people who could truly be mad at it were the ones directly profiting from the sale of digital or physical music .
( Like myself ! F%5k !)
Oink had everything by certain artists .
Literally , everything .
I searched for ‘ DJ Rupture ’ and found every release I ’d ever done , from an obscure 7 ″ on a Swedish label to 320 kpbs rips of my first 12 ″ , self - released back in 1999 .
It was shocking .
And reassuring .
The big labels want music to equal money , but as much as anything else , music is memory , as priceless and worthless as memory …
About a week after I shipped out orders of the first live CD-r Andy Moor & I did , it appeared on Oink .
Someone who had purchased it directly from me turned around and posted it online , for free .
I was n’t mad , I was just more stunned by the reach … and usefulness of the site .
If sharing copywritten music without paying for it were legal , than Oink was the best music website in the world .
Like many BitTorrent sites ,
Oink enforced share ratios .
In a nutshell , share ratios mean that each user must upload a certain amount of data in relation to what they download .
This feature encourages sharing .
For example , a minimum share ratio of 0.20 ( was that Oink ’s ? ca n’t remember ) means that if you download 5 albums , then you must upload around 1 album ’s worth of music , data equaling one - fifth the amount you nabbed from Oink users .
If you only take ( selfish leech ) and do not give , or if you share , but not enough , then you eventually get kicked off .
With BitTorrent , most folks downloading the same files also upload the bits they grab , so everybody gets fast DL speeds ( compare with popular files hosted on one server — incredibly slow speeds , or even server crash ) .
Thus , a popular album ( or legal linux distribution ) can be grabbed in minutes with a decent internet connection .
( uTorrent is a good BitTorrent client for Windows )
Watching Oink work helped me to understand the structural intelligence of BitTorrent architecture .
Oink , like BitTorrent itself , became stronger & faster the more people used it – scalability writ large .
Folks wanted to share – to maintain high share ratios .
New releases were highly valued .
But users kept older releases available as well ( you never know when someone will want your Norwegian proto - deathmetal collection , so you keep your bandwidth open ) .
Whether you call it distributed tape - sharing ( to use an 80s term ) or distributed piracy ( to use a 90s industry term ) , Oink ’s use of BitTorrent & careful quality control did it elegantly .
Aside : If Radiohead ( the British rock band who achieved worldwide success via a long - term mutually - beneficial relationship with a major record label ) were truly radical , they would have posted their new album as a BitTorrent file with a PayPal & bank account link for the fans who felt like paying .
Not hosting it on some weird website with an awkward interface & requiring credit card info …
Aside :
One thing I do n’t understand is how Oink got taken down while Soulseek continues as it has for years …
Slsk has always struck me as the least moral of the p2 p systems .
If you pay Soulseek $ 5 a month , you get ‘ privileged download access ‘ to files stored on Slsk users hard drives .
Soulseek earns money by controlling access to the files stored on its users ’ drives , users who never see any of this money .
And if they do n’t like the fact that paying people get special access to their data , there ’s nothing they can do about it .
Correction : with Slsk you have lots of control over who can access your shared files .
Oink was not “ extremely lucrative ” as the BBC boldfacedly claims .
If I remember correctly , a one - time donation of 5 pounds would do something - or - other , but it was a far cry from Soulseek ’s monthly privilege fees .
Nor , for the record , did Oink “ lead to early mixes and unfinished versions of artists ’ recordings circulating on the internet months ahead of the release . ” – this is strangely ironic , since Oink would strip user privileges if they were caught circulating unfinished or unofficial album versions .
This was a site run by audiophiles and music obsessives !
But Pandora ’s Box has been opened .
Remember when Napster croaked ?
Piracy file - sharing is so much easier now .
The anal - retentive British site admins kept Oink organized .
Bittorent architecture kept Oink efficient .
Oink ’s alleged 180,000 users wo n’t forget how useful it was .
The next Oink will be sturdier & more multiple .
The overall movement is towards more ways to share music & ideas with like - minded individuals on the internet .
The way I see it , this can only be a good thing for music fans .
And what musician is not first a music fan ?
On Wednesday , Jamie Leigh Jones told a House Judiciary Committee her now - famous story about having been allegedly drugged and gang - raped two years ago by several coworkers shortly after arriving in Iraq as a contractor for KBR , an engineering and construction firm contracted with the military to provide logistical support to the troops .
Jones ’ story has prompted widespread outrage , partly because the Justice Department and the military failed to prosecute her attackers , but also because it appears that Jones ca n’t sue KBR for placing her in harm ’s way .
When Jones went to work for KBR in Texas , and later for its subsidiary , Overseas Administrative Services , she signed contracts containing mandatory binding arbitration clauses , which required her to give up her right to sue the companies and any right to a jury trial .
Instead , the contracts forced Jones to press her case through private arbitration , which she did in 2006 .
In that forum , the company that allegedly wronged her pays the arbitrator who is hearing the case .
For that she can thank Dick Cheney .
At the time of the alleged attack on Jones , KBR was a subsidiary of Halliburton , the behemoth military - contracting and oil - technology firm .
( KBR was sold off earlier this year . )
So Jones is covered by the Halliburton dispute - resolution program , which was implemented when Cheney was Halliburton ’s CEO .
The system bears the markings of Cheney ’s obsession with secrecy and executive power .
On his watch , Halliburton , in late 1997 , made it more difficult for its employees to sue the company for discrimination , sexual harassment , and other workplace - related issues .
One day , Halliburton sent all its employees a brochure explaining that the company was implementing a new dispute resolution system .
The company sold the new program as an employee perk that would create an “ open door ” policy for bringing grievances to management and as a forum for resolving disputes without expensive and lengthy litigation .
In practice , it meant that anyone who had a legitimate civil - rights or personal - injury claim signed away his or her constitutional right to a jury trial .
Anyone who showed up for work after getting the brochure was considered to have agreed to give up his or her rights , regardless of whether the employees had actually read it .
In 2001 , the conservative and pro-business Texas Supreme Court overturned two lower courts to declare that this move was legal .
Dallas lawyer John Wall has something of a franchise suing Halliburton on behalf of employees in civil - rights and other workplace cases .
He says there has n’t been a year since 1986 that he has n’t had at least one case against Halliburton .
He ’s represented dozens of the company ’s employees and won numerous settlements and jury trials in civil lawsuits against the company .
The reason , he says , is that Halliburton targets “ the old , the injured , and the ill ” when it makes layoff decisions , and it has a history of firing people for making workers compensation claims .
Under the arbitration process , he says , Halliburton has fared much better , winning many more cases .
When it loses , he says , the company pays significantly lower damages , which he says rarely exceed $ 50,000 .
The dispute - resolution program had been in place at one Halliburton subsidiary for a few years before Cheney arrived .
But Wall contends that Halliburton adopted it for the rest of the company to head off lawsuits that would invariably have resulted from Cheney ’s ill - fated decision to merge Halliburton with Dresser Industries , a troubled company that had once employed both George H.W. Bush and his father , Prescott Bush .
Indeed , court documents show that Halliburton sent out its arbitration brochure just months before the merger .
Afterward , Halliburton closed several Dresser plants in Texas , firing 10,000 people .
Federal law requires companies to give 60 days notice before closing a manufacturing plant .
Failing to follow the law can leave a company liable for back pay and benefits to laid - off employees .
Rather than announce the plant closings ,
Wall says , Halliburton moved the Dresser employees from the targeted plants onto the Halliburton payroll , even though in many cases there were no jobs for them .
Then , once they were on Halliburton ’s books and bound by the binding arbitration clause , they were let go .
Among those laid off in 1999 was a longtime Halliburton employee named Lonnie Pennington .
Pennington had sued Halliburton once before , back in the 1980s , for retaliating against him for filing a workers compensation claim concerning a back injury .
That case resulted in a jury verdict of almost $ 200,000 in 1989 .
Halliburton continued to fight the verdict for another three years , and refused to reinstate Pennington until1992 .
When he was fired again in 1999 , Pennington made a formal complaint to the Texas Commission on Human Rights , alleging that the layoff was not only a form of retaliation for his complaints about discrimination on the job but also violated the Americans With Disabilities Act and the 1967 federal law barring age discrimination in the workplace .
As part of its investigation , the commission sent repeated requests to Halliburton for the layoff documentation , but the company refused to respond .
Finally , the commission sent a letter to Cheney ’s office with a gentle reminder that the law required Halliburton to respond .
Wall says that Cheney reportedly called the commission and basically told them to fuck off .
So the commission contacted the sheriff and had him serve Cheney with a subpoena for the documents .
Rather than turn over the documents , however , Halliburton shredded them .
( Wall eventually deposed the woman who did the shredding , . )
In a traditional civil lawsuit , judges have wide latitude to impose sanctions against a defendant for destroying evidence .
They can tell a jury to assume that the information was extremely damaging to the defense .
They can impose fines .
They can find for the plaintiff and toss out the rest of the case to punish the other side , regardless of how strong the case was .
But when Pennington later went before the Halliburton arbitrator , the arbitrator dismissed his case , saying he had failed to produce sufficient evidence to support his claims , which , of course , was difficult to do after Halliburton had shredded part of his personnel file .
The arbitrator made no mention of the evidence destruction .
Wall protested the evidence destruction to the Texas Attorney General , Republican John Cornyn , who is now a U.S. senator , but Wall says Cornyn ’s office never investigated and no one was ever held accountable for it .
By May of this year , when her lawyer sued in federal court to try to get her case before a jury , Jaime Leigh Jones had been in arbitration with KBR for 15 months .
L. Todd Kelly , her lawyer , recently called arbitration a “ star chamber , ” and argued that it was a way of keeping her case out of the public eye .
In court , both Halliburton and KBR have responded to the suit by arguing that Jones knew what she was doing when she signed her employment contract and that she should have to abide by the arbitration agreement .
In response to the media flurry triggered by Jones ’ public allegations , KBR and Halliburton have also claimed that private arbitration is not secretive .
Halliburton ’s history suggests otherwise .
In 2002 , the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe into accounting irregularities at Halliburton that came in the aftermath of its merger with Dresser Industries .
The merger had resulted in a huge drop in Halliburton ’s stock value due to enormous unsettled asbestos liabilities that Cheney had failed to disclose to shareholders when he won their approval for the merger .
As the inquiry heated up , reporters started looking at Cheney ’s tenure as CEO .
One of them called Wall , who told the journalist about the shredding incident .
A few days later , Wall received a “ cease and desist ” order from the arbitrator who had handled the Pennington case , telling him that he could not disclose anything about the document shredding .
It was a sign that secrecy is one of the reasons that Halliburton prefers arbitration .
If its employees could sue the company in a regular court , reporters would have access to all the complaints and most of the documents in the cases .
They could locate the plaintiffs and interview them .
In effect , there would be some sunshine on Halliburton and KBR ’s corporate behavior .
Instead , complaints made through private arbitration are virtually impossible to find and examine in any systematic way .
This week , I asked the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) , which handles many of Halliburton ’s arbitrations , if I could review all the complaints filed against the company by its employees in arbitration over the past three years — complaints that would be public if they had been filed in a courthouse .
I received the following response :
“ The AAA adheres to strict Standards of Ethics and Business Conduct , guided by our core values of Integrity , Conflict Management , and Service .
As part of these ethical standards , we avoid any conflicts of interest that may jeopardize our impartiality .
The AAA ’s rules protect the confidentiality of the arbitration process by restricting the disclosure of information related to cases filed with the AAA by AAA employees and arbitrators . ”
When I protested , noting that simply releasing the complaints would not affect anyone ’s impartiality , an AAA spokesperson sent me to Richard Naimark , a senior vice president at the company .
He explained that while arbitrations are n’t necessarily confidential — though many are — they are technically owned by the two parties , who can release the information if they want to , but AAA cannot .
Naimark insisted that employees like the confidential nature of arbitration .
“ Americans value their privacy , ” he said .
Rather than privacy , employment lawyers routinely say that most employees they represent crave a jury trial .
Texas lawyer Barbara Gardner challenged the way Halliburton forced arbitration on its employees , but , after losing the case in 2001 before the Texas Supreme Court , she has taken a dim view of mandatory arbitration in employment contracts .
“ Employees do n’t fare very well in arbitration , ” she says “ It ’s not a level playing field .
It ’s all set up to make sure the employer wins . ”
Her firm will no longer handle employment cases forced into private arbitration because they are considered so hopeless .
While it ’s impossible to get all the complaints filed by Halliburton ’s employees , it is , thanks to a California state law requiring arbitration companies to disclose some bare - bones data , possible to examine Halliburton ’s track record in those cases .
Employment lawyer Cathy Ventrell - Monsees testified before Congress in October that AAA data show that between January 2003 and March 31 , 2007 , of the 39 Halliburton cases that went all the way to a decision , Halliburton won 32 , a win rate of 82 percent .
Plaintiffs in employment litigation face a high bar in court trials as well , but even so , that figure is very high .
Employers win about 64 percent of all employment cases at trial in federal court and about half in state court , according to data from the Justice Department ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) .
The AAA data is a bit inscrutable , but a quick review of its most recent public report suggests , too , that the employee “ winners ” in Halliburton arbitrations are n’t winning much money .
Out of 119 cases disposed of between April 2003 and March 2007 , I could only find three in which the arbitrator actually awarded any money .
The largest was for $ 82,000 , and the smallest was a little over $ 7,000 .
In state courts , according to the BJS , 43 percent of the awards in employment - discrimination trials were more than $ 250,000 , and 16 percent were above a million dollars .
The median award in state court for a discrimination case was $ 218,000 in 2001 , the most recent year for which data is available .
It ’s not too hard to see why Halliburton and KBR want to keep Jaime Leigh Jones in arbitration .
If the allegations she has made are true , and her lawyers can prove it , her case could be worth many millions of dollars in a jury trial .
It could also be both expensive and embarrassing , two things that Cheney clearly wanted to avoid a decade ago when he stacked the deck against his company ’s employees .

Michael Moore slams CNN , Wolf Blitzer on live TV David Edwards and Josh Catone

Before a live interview with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore , CNN aired a segment entitled " Sicko Reality Check " in which Dr. Sanjay Gupta , the network 's chief medical correspondent , aimed to keep Moore " honest " and fact check his new film , Sicko .
The 4 - minute piece concluded that Moore " did fudge the facts , " and implied that Sicko was misleading in portraying health care systems in other countries , such as France , the UK , and Canada , as better than the one in the US .
When given a chance to speak , Moore immediately put host Wolf Blitzer on the defensive .
" That report was so biased , I can't imagine what pharmaceutical company 's ads are coming up right after our break here , " said Moore .
" Why do n't you tell the truth to the American people ?
I wish that CNN and the other mainstream media would just for once tell the truth about what 's going on in this country . "
Moore argued that CNN has such a lousy track record of reporting the truth about the war in Iraq and asking tough questions , that Americans should be skeptical of their reporting on health care .
" You 're the ones who are fudging the facts , " said Moore .
" You 've fudged the facts to the American people now for I do n't know how long about this issue , about the war , and I 'm just curious , when are you going to just stand there and apologize to the American people for not bringing the truth to them that is n't sponsored by some major corporation ? "
Blizter grew defensive and backed up his fellow CNN employee , saying that he would stand behind correspondent Sanjay Gupta 's record on medical issues .
Moore , in response , vowed to post a rebuttal to his website , MichaelMoore.com , showing that Gupta 's facts were n't accurate .
" I 'm going to put the real facts up there on my website , " said Moore , " so that people can see what he just said was absolutely wrong . "
Turning to the war in Iraq , Moore accused Gupta , who spent time embedded with US troops in Iraq , and the mainstream media at large of refusing " to ask our leaders the hard questions , and demand the honest answers . "
Moore laid the blame for the continued US involvement in the war in Iraq at the feet of the media , arguing that they failed to do their jobs and question the Bush war policy .
Blitzer refused to argue with Moore about Iraq , and instead steered the conversation back to the topic of health care .
Moore was asked which of the US presidential candidates he thought would best fix America 's health care system .
Moore did not name a specific candidate , but said that the Democratic candidates as a whole need to be more specific about how they plan to achieve their goal of universal health care .
" Our own government admits that because of the 47 million who are n't insured , we now have about 18,000 people a year that die in this country , simply because they do n't have health insurance .
That 's six 9/11s every single year , " concluded Moore .
We need " universal health care that 's free for everyone who lives in this country , it 'll cost us less than what we 're spending now lining the pockets of these private health insurance companies , or these pharmaceutical companies . "
After the interview , Blitzer found sympathy from fellow CNN hosts Lou Dobbs and Jack Cafferty .
" After watching that Michael Moore interview , " said Cafferty , " I 've decided whatever CNN 's paying it ain't enough . "
The following video is from CNN's The Situation Room , broadcast on July 9 .
It could be the weirdest and most embarrassing prediction in the history of cosmology , if not science .
If true , it would mean that you yourself reading this article are more likely to be some momentary fluctuation in a field of matter and energy out in space than a person with a real past born through billions of years of evolution in an orderly star - spangled cosmos .
Your memories and the world you think you see around you are illusions .
This bizarre picture is the outcome of a recent series of calculations that take some of the bedrock theories and discoveries of modern cosmology to the limit .
Nobody in the field believes that this is the way things really work , however .
And so in the last couple of years there has been a growing stream of debate and dueling papers , replete with references to such esoteric subjects as reincarnation , multiple universes and even the death of spacetime , as cosmologists try to square the predictions of their cherished theories with their convictions that we and the universe are real .
The basic problem is that across the eons of time , the standard theories suggest , the universe can recur over and over again in an endless cycle of big bangs , but it ’s hard for nature to make a whole universe .
It ’s much easier to make fragments of one , like planets , yourself maybe in a spacesuit or even  in the most absurd and troubling example  a naked brain floating in space .
Nature tends to do what is easiest , from the standpoint of energy and probability .
And so these fragments  in particular the brains  would appear far more frequently than real full - fledged universes , or than us .
Or they might be us .
Alan Guth , a cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who agrees this overabundance is absurd , pointed out that some calculations result in an infinite number of free - floating brains for every normal brain , making it “ infinitely unlikely for us to be normal brains . ”
Welcome to what physicists call the Boltzmann brain problem , named after the 19th - century Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann , who suggested the mechanism by which such fluctuations could happen in a gas or in the universe .
Cosmologists also refer to them as “ freaky observers , ” in contrast to regular or “ ordered ” observers of the cosmos like ourselves .
Cosmologists are desperate to eliminate these freaks from their theories , but so far they ca n’t even agree on how or even on whether they are making any progress .
LONDON  Walking at the Brixton market among the parrotfish , doctorfish and butterfish , Effa Edusie is surrounded by pieces of her childhood in Ghana .
Caught the day before far off the coast of West Africa , they have been airfreighted to London for dinner .
Ms. Edusie ’s relatives used to be fishermen .
But no more .
These fish are no longer caught by Africans .
On the underside of the waterlogged brown cardboard box that holds the snapper is the improbable red logo of the China National Fisheries Corporation , one of the largest suppliers of West African fish to Europe .
Europe ’s dinner tables are increasingly supplied by global fishing fleets , which are depleting the world ’s oceans to feed the ravenous consumers who have become the most effective predators of fish .
Fish is now the most traded animal commodity on the planet , with about 100 million tons of wild and farmed fish sold each year .
Europe has suddenly become the world ’s largest market for fish , worth more than 14 billion euros , or about $ 20.6 billion a year .
Europe ’s appetite has grown as its native fish stocks have shrunk so that Europe now needs to import 60 percent of fish sold in the region , according to the European Union .
ONE month after Sir Nicholas Stern published his review of the economics of climate change , his peers have had time to say what they think of his work .
And the answer , it seems , is : not a lot .
Sir Nicholas , the head of the British government 's economic service , concluded that the potential costs of climate change were so large , and the costs of shifting away from fossil fuels so relatively modest , that the world should take urgent action .
Those who disagree with that analysis and prescription fall into three main camps .
The first group says that he lacks political realism ―a charge made by Robert Samuelson , in the Washington Post , when he called the report “ a masterpiece of misleading public relations . ”
Policies that might curb greenhouse gases , Mr Samuelson said , would “ require politicians and the public to act in exceptionally ‘ enlightened ' ( read : ‘ unrealistic ' ) ways . ”
They would have to impose and bear costs that would not deliver returns until after they were dead .
This may be true , but it is unfair as a criticism of the Stern review , which took this problem as a starting point .
A second camp has accused the report of selection bias .
One eminent climate - change economist , Richard Tol , complains that , “ For water , agriculture , health and insurance , the Stern review consistently selects the most pessimistic study in the literature . ”
There is something in this , though Sir Nicholas would claim that he chose his studies according to the robustness of their methodology .
EPA
Spend now or stew later , maybe
A third line of criticism , made by William Nordhaus , a father of climate - change economics , has emerged as the most forceful .
It turns on fairness , and how we place a value today on benefits in the future .
When economists do a cost - benefit analysis , they try to place a present - day value on benefits assumed to be enjoyed in the future .
To do this they discount the future value by an annual percentage rate , a discount rate , which is typically set at around 3 - 5 % .
But such calculations are typically done for benefits expected to come in 20 , 30 or , at most , 50 years ' time .
Climate - change economics requires a time horizon of centuries .
A typical discount rate would assign almost no current value to benefits accruing in , say , the 23rd century .
So why spend money today on something with no apparent value today ?
Sir Nicholas argues that , in this case , we are wrong to use a typical discount rate .
How can we say that our great - great - great - grandchildren are worth less than we are worth ourselves ?
He argues for a discount rate of 0.1 % .
That places a much higher present - day value on benefits accruing centuries into the future , and thus makes a stronger case for spending money now .
Mr Nordhaus retorts that there are other ways to look at the ethics of inter-generational investment .
One option would be to take into account the expected wealth of future generations .
Global per capita consumption is increasing by 1.3 % a year in real terms .
At that rate today 's average income per head , of $ 7,600 , would rise to $ 94,000 by 2200 .
If climate change were to reduce global income by 13.8 % over the same period ( a figure derived from Stern ) , the average income per head would rise to $ 81,000 rather than $ 94,000 .
On that basis , says Mr Nordhaus , it would be fairer to constrain the income of future and richer generations , than to impose additional costs on a poorer generation today .
Mr Nordhaus does not contend that the world should do nothing about greenhouse - gas emissions .
But he questions the confidence with which the Stern report concludes that lots of things should be done , and fast .
The “ central questions ” about any policy response to global warming , says Mr Nordhaus , “ how much , how fast , and how costly ―remain open ” .
As far as he and like - minded critics are concerned , the Stern report has informed the debate about climate change , but has not come anywhere near resolving it .
TheGardenLady has been writing about a hardinessTemperature Zone Map for use when planning and planting your gardens .
For those readers who wonder what TheGardenLady is writing about , let me explain .
There are a number of factors / needs that are involved in growing plants .
For example , each plant has its special water needs , special soil needs or special fertilizer needs , etc. to allow it to grow to its optimum best .
One of the important factors in raising plants outdoors is the temperature plants need to allow them to metabolize properly .
Plants grow best within a range of temperatures ; for some plants the temperature range will be narrow and for others the range can be wider .
Plants also differ in their ability to survive frost .
How does a gardener know what temperature range they live in to best grow the plants they want ?
There is something called a plant Hardiness Zone Map .
Most places in the world have this information .
Plant Hardiness
Zone maps for around the world can be found here .
The Plant Hardiness Zone Map most commonly used in the US can be found here .
This map was created in 1990 based on the lowest and highest temperatures recorded from 1971 to 1984 in the US , Mexico and Canada .
A newer map just recently posted by the Arborday Society uses newer temperature figures based on the changes in weather from 1990 to 2006 .
The older US map is still useful but climate changes are having an effect of warming in these zones – to enable plants from warmer climates to grow or not grow in your area .
As shown on the Arborday Temperature Zone Map now certain areas can try to grow plants that originally grew only in warmer zones .
At Triple Oaks Nursery in central New Jersey , for example , they are trying to “ push the envelope ” and have an outdoor all year show garden where they grow more exotic plants , plants that had never survived the winter before in their area .
How many zones are there ?
The USDA plant hardiness map divides North America into 11 hardiness zones .
Zone 1 is the coldest ; zone 11 is the warmest , a tropical area found only in Hawaii and southernmost Florida .
In between , the zones follow a fairly predictable pattern across the continent , though a closer look will reveal scattered patterns of variations .
Generally , the colder zones are found at higher latitudes and higher elevations .
To read the map , you find your Zone and then when you look at plant information , the material will tell you which zone / s the plant is hardy to ( to endure winters ) .
Most information will indicate a range of zones where the plant will grow but will not tolerate the colder and warmer extremes outside them .
Sunset Zones versus USDA Zones
Gardeners in the western United States may be confused when confronted with the 11 Hardiness Zones created by the USDA ( United States Department of Agriculture ) , because they are used to a 24 - zone climate system created approximately 40 years ago by Sunset Magazine .
The Sunset zone maps , which cover 13 Western states , are much more precise than the USDA ’s , since they factor in not only winter minimum temperatures , but also summer highs , lengths of growing seasons , humidity , and rainfall patterns to provide a more accurate picture of what will grow there .
If you live in the western U.S. , you ’ll find that gardeners in your area usually refer to the Sunset climate zones rather than the USDA plant hardiness zones .
In fact , the Sunset zones and maps are what are listed for each plant in Sunset ’s Western Garden Book and Western Garden CD - ROM , which are considered the standard gardening references in the West .
However , the USDA zones are still of importance to western gardeners , since the USDA zones are used in the rest of the country .
Of course , I reiterate that other factors determine whether plants will survive to grow in your garden .
Soil types , rainfall , daytime temperatures , day length , wind , humidity , microclimates and heat also play their roles .
But consider the plant hardiness zone map an important beginning when checking out new plants that you want to get for your garden .
If you live outside North America and can’t find your temperature zone but know the lowest temperature and highest temperature in their area , you can attempt to do some conversions with the US Hardiness Temp Zone Map .
You can roughly translate the USDA hardiness zones by finding out how low your area ’s temperatures can reach , and then use the chart below to find your corresponding zone .
Zone 1 : below - 46 C ( below - 50 F )
Zone 2 : - 46 to - 40 C ( - 50 to - 40 F )
Zone 3 : - 40 to - 34 C ( - 40 to - 30 F )
Zone 4 : - 34 to - 29 C ( - 30 to - 20 F )
Zone 5 : - 29 to - 23 C ( - 20 to - 10 F )
Zone 6 : - 23 to - 18 C ( - 10 to 0 F )
Zone 7 : - 18 to - 12 C ( 0 to 10 F )
Zone 8 : - 12 to - 7 C ( 10 to 20 F )
Zone 9 : - 7 to - 1 C ( 20 to 30 F )
Zone 10 : - 1 to 4 C ( 30 to 40 F )
Zone 11 : above 4 C ( above 40 F )

Sandia non-lethal weaponry researchers Willy Morse and James Pacheco test the small - size Active Denial System in the field . *
Photo : Randy Montoya * Burglars break into an apartment , hoping to pick up some expensive electronics or jewelry .
But they 're out again , empty - handed , within seconds , howling with pain and surprise .
They 've been driven back by waves of intolerable heat : Entering the apartment is like stepping into a furnace .
It 's the Active Denial System , or ADS , at work , the ultimate in home protection ... among other uses .
Also known as the " pain beam , " ADS is a revolutionary non-lethal weapon that uses microwaves to cause burning pain without injury .
The 95 - GHz waves only penetrate a fraction of an inch , heating the outer surface of the target 's skin .
According to the Air Force , nobody can tolerate the beam for more than five seconds , and improvised protection such as wrapping yourself in wet towels or tin foil is useless .
There have been repeated calls for ADS to be deployed in Iraq , but the military is bogged down in reviews of the technology .
However , now that ADS exists , the pain beam 's manufacturer is exploring domestic U.S. uses , like industrial - and home - security systems .
The Department of Energy is looking at employing the technology to protect America 's nuclear stockpile .
Meanwhile , some U.S. law enforcement officials are eager to get their hands on the pain weapon , and the Department of Justice is funding a multimillion - dollar research project to give it to them .
" We seem to have no qualms about dropping bombs on people , but are afraid of being embarrassed if we accidentally hurt someone while trying to save their lives , " says Charles " Sid " Heal , a commander at the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department " Those restrictions do not apply to the Department of Justice and we are zealously looking for ways of resolving confrontations without having to kill or seriously hurt our adversary . "
A former Marine , Heal has tested Active Denial and believes it could be invaluable in situations like jail riots , where the searing pain could cow rebellious prisoners .
His biggest problems are the system 's size and price tag ; it 's currently mounted on a Hummer and costs millions of dollars , putting it far beyond the reach of police departments .
That 's where the U.S. Justice Department comes in .
The National Institute of Justice , the department 's R&D branch , believes police need a cheaper , lightweight Active Denial system with shorter range .
NIJ tested a prototype of such a system earlier this year , but the results of testing have not yet been revealed .
A working device is expected to be delivered towards the end of 2008 .
" NIJ is working with the developer of the ADS system , Raytheon , to modify its underlying technology for law enforcement and corrections application in a man-portable configuration with a desired range of a hundred feet , " says Department of Justice spokeswoman Sheila Jerusalem .
Mike Booen , Raytheon 's vice president of directed energy weapons , says the handheld version could progress rapidly if the demand is there .
So far funding has only amounted to $ 2.5 million ( compared to $ 100 million on the military version ) , and more money would speed the process of getting it into the field .
Such a device might be a separate unit or might be mounted under a rifle .
Booen says the smaller system may fire short pulses rather than a continuous beam due to power limitations .
Beam diameter will be much smaller than the Hummer - mounted version – just a few inches , instead of six feet .
But in tests , even one square inch of exposure produced the " repel effect , " forcing the subject to get out of the way as quickly as possible .
A handheld ADS would deliver an intermediate level of force , between verbal commands and more drastic means such as pepper spray or Tasers .
But some have concerns that it could be used to punish or torture suspects rather than control them .
Pepper spray and Tasers have caused plenty of debate , and any police use of " pain compliance " methods invites controversy .
A device that causes intense pain but leaves no physical or chemical traces could easily be abused .
The police are not the only ones planning to use Active Denial in the United States .
Sandia National Laboratorieshave been working on a version for defending America 's nuclear stockpiles since 2005 .
It would replace the Department of Energy 's current non-lethal nuclear security option , a sticky foam system .
Sandia planned to have ADS in service by 2008 , but a representative told Wired News that the technology " does not appear " to be on track for deployment next year .
Active Denial will probably defend more than just nuclear facilities .
Last year , Raytheon was granted a patent for an " area protection system and method " that uses mounted pain beams to protect outdoor and indoor areas from intruders .
In one implementation , beam projectors are " located on the ceiling , at an angle , behind wall panels , " and a series of metallic reflectors , also concealed , ensure that the beam covers the whole room .
" In some embodiments , the energy may be directed to protect an item at one or more particular locations , " the patent reads .
" In these embodiments , systems may be used to guard a valuable item such as jewelry , weapons , or works or art . "
The system would have a variable power level to " cause mild pain or severe pain , " with the mild pain being used as " a warning device to indicate that an area should not be entered . "
According to the patent , the fully integrated system would use a low - power beam as an intruder detector .
It can track intruders and vary the beam power :
The patent suggests using high power if intruders advance , reducing as they flee .
Applications include military - perimeter defense , and commercial and industrial security .
It could even be extended to home protection : Imagine an anti-burglar system that drives intruders out , rather than just making a noise .
It could also be used for border security , a prospect that some find alarming .
" The tracking devices already built in could be automated so that these weapons require no human intervention at borders , " says Steve Wright of the Praxis Center , which studies non-lethal weapons .
" We wo n't get harmless weapons , we will get mass pain - delivery systems to seal off future refugees . "
Wright also believes that the pain beam could be the perfect tool for oppressive regimes .
But others see it as a golden opportunity for better law enforcement .
" We believe this to be a major breakthrough in the development of non-lethal options that are both safe and effective , " says Heal .
" We can dissuade people committing violent acts without hurting them and without being hurt . "
It seems likely , though , that ADS will have its first U.S. deployment in less controversial tasks , like defending nuclear stockpiles and military installations .
From there , the technology will become more established .
As with Tasers , the debate will be less about whether the pain beam is acceptable in a democracy and more about where it is acceptable .

' Brain ' In A Dish Acts As
Autopilot , Living Computer University of Florida researcher Thomas DeMarse holds a glass dish on October 12 , 2004 , containing a “ brain ” -- a living network of 25,000 rat brain cells connected to an array of 60 electrodes that can interact with a computer to fly a simulated F - 22 fighter plane .
During this interaction , scientists can observe how the neurons communicate as a network , and send and respond to signals from the computer and each other , in an effort to understand and model the computational power of the brain .
( University of Florida / Ray Carson )
The " brain " -- a collection of 25,000 living neurons , or nerve cells , taken from a rat 's brain and cultured inside a glass dish -- gives scientists a unique real - time window into the brain at the cellular level .
By watching the brain cells interact , scientists hope to understand what causes neural disorders such as epilepsy and to determine noninvasive ways to intervene .
As living computers , they may someday be used to fly small unmanned airplanes or handle tasks that are dangerous for humans , such as search - and - rescue missions or bomb damage assessments .
" We 're interested in studying how brains compute , " said Thomas DeMarse , the UF professor of biomedical engineering who designed the study .
" If you think about your brain , and learning and the memory process , I can ask you questions about when you were 5 years old and you can retrieve information .
That 's a tremendous capacity for memory .
In fact , you perform fairly simple tasks that you would think a computer would easily be able to accomplish , but in fact it can't . "
While computers are very fast at processing some kinds of information , they can't approach the flexibility of the human brain , DeMarse said .
In particular , brains can easily make certain kinds of computations – such as recognizing an unfamiliar piece of furniture as a table or a lamp – that are very difficult to program into today 's computers .
" If we can extract the rules of how these neural networks are doing computations like pattern recognition , we can apply that to create novel computing systems , " he said .
DeMarse experimental " brain " interacts with an F - 22 fighter jet flight simulator through a specially designed plate called a multi-electrode array and a common desktop computer .
" It 's essentially a dish with 60 electrodes arranged in a grid at the bottom , " DeMarse said .
" Over that we put the living cortical neurons from rats , which rapidly begin to reconnect themselves , forming a living neural network – a brain . "
The brain and the simulator establish a two - way connection , similar to how neurons receive and interpret signals from each other to control our bodies .
By observing how the nerve cells interact with the simulator , scientists can decode how a neural network establishes connections and begins to compute , DeMarse said .
When DeMarse first puts the neurons in the dish , they look like little more than grains of sand sprinkled in water .
However , individual neurons soon begin to extend microscopic lines toward each other , making connections that represent neural processes .
" You see one extend a process , pull it back , extend it out – and it may do that a couple of times , just sampling who 's next to it , until over time the connectivity starts to establish itself , " he said .
" ( The brain is ) getting its network to the point where it's a live computation device . "
To control the simulated aircraft , the neurons first receive information from the computer about flight conditions : whether the plane is flying straight and level or is tilted to the left or to the right .
The neurons then analyze the data and respond by sending signals to the plane 's controls .
Those signals alter the flight path and new information is sent to the neurons , creating a feedback system .
" Initially when we hook up this brain to a flight simulator , it does n't know how to control the aircraft , " DeMarse said .
" So you hook it up and the aircraft simply drifts randomly .
And as the data comes in , it slowly modifies the ( neural ) network so over time , the network gradually learns to fly the aircraft . "
Although the brain currently is able to control the pitch and roll of the simulated aircraft in weather conditions ranging from blue skies to stormy , hurricane - force winds , the underlying goal is a more fundamental understanding of how neurons interact as a network , DeMarse said .
" There 's a lot of data out there that will tell you that the computation that 's going on here is n't based on just one neuron .
The computational property is actually an emergent property of hundreds or thousands of neurons cooperating to produce the amazing processing power of the brain . "
With Jose Principe , a UF distinguished professor of electrical engineering and director of UF 's Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory , DeMarse has a $ 500,000 National Science Foundation grant to create a mathematical model that reproduces how the neurons compute .
These living neural networks are being used to pursue a variety of engineering and neurobiology research goals , said Steven Potter , an assistant professor in the Georgia Tech / Emory Department of Biomedical Engineering who uses cultured brain cells to study learning and memory .
DeMarse was a postdoctoral researcher in Potter 's laboratory at Georgia Tech before he arrived at UF .
" A lot of people have been interested in what changes in the brains of animals and people when they are learning things , " Potter said .
" We 're interested in getting down into the network and cellular mechanisms , which is hard to do in living animals .
And the engineering goal would be to get ideas from this system about how brains compute and process information . "
Though the " brain " can successfully control a flight simulation program , more elaborate applications are a long way off , DeMarse said .
" We 're just starting out .
But using this model will help us understand the crucial bit of information between inputs and the stuff that comes out , " he said .
" And you can imagine the more you learn about that , the more you can harness the computation of these neurons into a wide range of applications . "
It was in Chicago , that city made notorious by gangster Al Capone , where President Bush at an impromptu news conference in 2004 said if somebody in his crime family broke the law , " that person will be taken care of . "
( Ha ha .
Actually , Bush said " Administration , " not " crime family . " )
Even so , truer words were never spoken .
Bush " took care " of White House consigliere I. Lewis ( " Scooter " ) Libby by commuting his sentence after Libby 's conviction for lying to a grand jury , did n't he ?
And if former White House press secretary Scott McClellan is right that Bush was behind Libby 's bid to discredit former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , we 've got a criminal don- in - chief that can keep his accomplices out of the slammer .
When Capone ran Chicago , owners of 20,000 speakeasies poured his beer , and thousands of cops got paid to help him roll out the barrels .
Chicago was so lawless New York Mafioso Lucky Luciano called it " a real goddamn crazy place !
Nobody 's safe in the streets ! "
What might Luciano have said upon visiting don Bush 's Baghdad ?
Bush 's power far exceeds anything Al Capone wielded .
Bush reached half way around the world to execute enemy Saddam Hussein for his alleged role in 9/11 .
At least , when mobster Joe ( " Joe Cargo " ) Valachi made a mistake he confessed , " You can imagine my embarrassment when I killed the wrong guy . "
Bush thinks no apology is due for invading Iraq and lynching a fellow wiseguy .
Despite his crimes , Bush may never make the deserved journey from the White House to the Big House .
The cowardly Congress allows him and his consiglieres to remain at large .
They live well and dine well .
When goodfellow Senator John McCain , an ardent Iraq war backer , spotted the dubious fare spread out for him at one campaign stop , he said , " I 'd love some spaghetti . "
McCain can eat for the many that are going hungry in Iraq tonight , thanks to his votes .
Apparently , spaghetti sauce does n't remind McCain of you - know - what .
Unlike Capone , don Bush does not break laws to defy the government .
He is the government .
Bush has even more right than Capone to declare , " My rackets are run along strictly American lines . "
He 's Capone gone global .
Like Capone , Bush solemnly observes the Fourth of July and , also like Capone , he has earned the right to celebrate St. Valentine 's Day .
Capone wiped out seven associates of " Bugs " Moran in that infamous 1929 Chicago massacre .
As of this November 23 , according to Information Clearing House , Bush has eliminated 1,118,625 residents of Iraq .
Capone would have been awed .
The thorn in Bush 's set - up is that , unlike traditional Mafia " made " men , his soldiers can quit .
They 're jumping ship as his ratings plunge faster than a corpse chained to a block of cement tossed into the Chicago River .
So he hires new loyalists .
There 's Michael Mukasey , the nation 's second Jewish Attorney General , who will be a regular menace if he's as ignorant of the commandment God gave Moses not to kill as he is of how the White House mob justifies torture .
As Joey ( " Crazy Joey " ) Gallo of New York 's Profaci Crime Family once said , " You like Federal judges ?
I " ll buy you one for Christmas . "
This holiday season , Mukasey may be the consigliere that helps eXterminator Bush put the X back in X -mas .
Those who regard don Bush as a failure just do n't get it .
He 's pulled off the most sensational heist in the history of crime : his Iraq war has pushed global oil prices sky high .
This just happened to improve the value of ExxonMobil and Chevron 's oil reserves by $ 666 billion and $ 250 billion , respectively , Greg Palast wrote in " Armed Madhouse " ( Plume Books ) .
The other oilglopolies are also bathing in boodle .
Every motorist in America today is paying twice as much for gas ( $ 3.09 ) as when don Bush took office ( $ 1.52 ) .
As Jay Leno cracked on the " The Tonight Show : " " The Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to three people --- the CEOs of Exxon , Texaco , and Shell for figuring out how to quadruple the price of oil over a seven - year period without an actual shortage . "
And to think " Godfather 's " fictional don Vito Corleone dabbled in olive oil .
If don Bush seeks a new career , he could give Hollywood a spaghetti western hero in the remake of " For a Few Dollars More . "
It 's what wiseguy government is all about .

Police abandoned security posts before Bhutto assassination Nick Juliano

No autopsy performed on body ; docs say bullet wounds not found Police abandoned their security posts shortly before Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto 's assassination Thursday , according to a journalist present at the time , and unanswerable questions remain about the cause of her death , because an autopsy was never performed .
Pakistan 's Interior Minister on Friday said that Bhutto was not killed by gunshots , as had been widely reported , and doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital , where she died , say there were no bullet marks on the former prime minister 's body , according to India 's IBNLive.com .
Furthermore , according to the news agency , there was no formal autopsy performed on Bhutto 's body before she was buried Friday .
CNN is now reporting that it was n't gunshots or shrapnel that killed Bhutto , but that she died from hitting the sunroof of the car she was riding in .
The network said sources in Pakistan 's Interior Ministry said nothing entered her skull , no bullets or shrapnel .
Apparently there was some kind of lever on the sunroof she was standing through , and she hit her head on that CNN reported Friday morning .
Earlier in the day Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz told a Pakistani news channel ,  The report says she had head injuries  an irregular patch  and the X - ray doesnt show any bullet in the head .
So it was probably the shrapnel or any other thing has struck her in her said .
That damaged her brain , causing it to ooze and her death .
The report categorically says theres no wound other than that , " according to IBNLive .
Perhaps more shockingly , an attendee at the rally where Bhutto was killed says police charged with protecting her " abandoned their posts , " leaving just a handful of Bhutto's own bodyguards protecting her .
" Police officers had frisked the 3,000 to 4,000 people attending Thursday 's rally when they entered the park , but as the speakers from Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party droned on , the police abandoned many of their posts , " wrote Saeed Shah in an essay published by McClatchy News Service .
" As she drove out through the gate , her main protection appeared to be her own bodyguards , who wore their usual white T - shirts inscribed : ' Willing to die for Benazir . ' "
While some intelligence officials , especially within the US , were quick to finger al Qaeda militants as responsible for Bhutto 's death , it remains unclear precisely who was responsible and some speculation has centered on Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , its military or even forces loyal to the current president Pervez Musharraf .
Rawalpindi , where Bhutto was killed , is the garrison city that houses the Pakistani military 's headquarters .
" GHQ ( general headquarters of the army ) killed her , " Sardar Saleem , a former member of parliament , told Shah at the hospital .
Whatever the case , Bhutto's precise cause of death may never be known because of the failure to administer an autopsy .
The procedure was not carried out because police and local authorities in Rawalpindi did not request one , according to IBNLive , but the government plans a formal investigation why this was the case .
Musharraf initially blamed her death on unnamed Islamic militants , but Interior Minister Hamid Nawaz told The Associated Press on Friday that " we have the evidence that al - Qaida and the Taliban were behind the suicide attack on Benazir Bhutto . "
He said investigators had resolved the " whole mystery " behind the opposition leader 's killing and would give details at press conference later Friday .
DEVELOPING ...
( Fortune ) -- Warren Buffett put $ 2 billion of Berkshire Hathaway 's cash to work at the end of last week when the company purchased high - yielding bonds issued by Dallas - based power producer TXU Corp. , according to a person familiar with the deal .
TXU was bought earlier this year in a landmark $ 45 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts .
As with many LBOs carried out in buoyant markets , banks agreed to make large so - called bridge loans to help finance the deal , but they got stuck with those loans when demand dried up for LBO - related debt .
TXU can now use the proceeds from the bond sale , whose total size was $ 3.9 billion , to help pay down the bridge loans .
The bonds were issued through a subsidiary .
Buffett 's purchase will be welcomed by the banks that made the bridge loans because , since the credit crunch started in the summer , they 've had to take large writedowns on LBO debt on their balance sheet .
Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Credit Suisse , Goldman Sachs ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , JP Morgan Chase ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Lehman Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) all participated in the debt financing of the TXU buyout , which originally included $ 11.25 billion of bridge loans .
Berkshire ( Charts ) bought into two issues by TXU .
It purchased $ 1.1 billion of 10.25 % bonds at 95 cents on the dollar to give Buffett an effective yield of 11.2 % .
And Berkshire bought $ 1 billion of 10.5 % PIK - toggle bonds ( bonds whose interest can be paid out in cash or more bonds ) for 93 cents on the dollar , producing an effective yield of 11.8 % .
Buffett has done well from investing in utilities .
In fact , Berkshire purchased stock in TXU in 2002 , when it appeared close to bankruptcy , and then sold out at a large profit in 2004 .
According to a person familiar with the deal , Buffett was a prime mover behind last week 's deal and the banks were happy to play ball because they wanted to reduce exposure to bridge loans .
The pace of new home sales fell to the lowest level since April 1995 , leaving the market with a record glut of completed new homes on the market .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Sales of new homes have plunged even more than expected to their lowest level in more than 12 years , leaving the market glutted with unsold homes and pointing to more trouble ahead for the battered housing market .
New home sales tumbled 9 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 647,000 , according to a Census Bureau report Friday .
That was the worst showing since April 1995 , when the pace of sales was 621,000 , and is much worse than the 715,000 sales pace forecast by economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The sales pace is down more than a third from year - ago levels .
Furthermore , the decline is widespread nationwide , ranging from a 28 percent drop in the Northeast to a 38 percent plunge in the Midwest .
The weak sales pace still probably overstates demand for new homes since it counts a home as sold when a contract is signed , even though in many cases a contract is cancelled before a sale is closed .
In fact , most major builders have reported sharp increases in cancelled orders in recent months because buyers have struggled to arrange financing or sell their existing homes .
While the median sales price of $ 239,100 in November represented a 4.2 % jump from October , that previous reading was the lowest in more than two years .
The new price reading is still off 0.4 percent from year - earlier levels and off 8.9 percent from the record high price of $ 262,600 hit in March before the full impact of the meltdown in subprime mortgages was felt .
Michael Larson , a real estate analyst with independent research firm Weiss Research , said the report understates price weaknesses because it does not account for the incentives like picking up buyers ' closing costs builders are using to spur sales .
" You see the builders are still struggling to get the business right , " said Larson .
" They 're cut back on production ; now they 've got to get that pricing right to get the buyers to move . "
The glut of new homes on the market rose to a 9.3 - month supply , as the number of completed homes for sale reached a record 193,000 at the end of the reporting period .
Builders now typically have to wait 6.2 months to sell a completed home , the longest wait since July 1993 .
While new home sales make up only a fraction of the overall real estate market , this report is closely watched as a more leading indicator of market strength than the report on existing home sales , which is due out Monday from the National Association of Realtors .
The existing home sales report tracks existing home sales when they are closed , typically a month or two after a sales contract is signed .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com forecast that existing home sales edged up to a 5 million annual sales rate in November from October 's 4.97 million , which was the weakest sales reading of existing homes on record despite the largest drop in prices .
The downturn in new home sales has hammered the results of the nation 's leading home builders .
Many of them have been forced to take large charges to writedown the value of their holdings .
A month ago Lennar ( LEN , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 1 home builder by revenue , reported that it was selling 11,000 properties to the real estate arm of Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) for only 40 percent of their previously stated value .
The charges taken by many builders have caused many builders to report larger - than - expected losses .
D.R. Horton ( DHI , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 3 builder , reported a smaller - than - expected loss in late November , but that followed a quarter with a loss that was much wider than forecast .
Hovnanian Enterprises ( HOV , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 6 builder by revenue , posted a full - year loss this month and said the market remains very challenging , prompting credit rating agency Moody 's to say it was reviewing whether to downgrade its debt further into junk - bond status .
In October , Moody 's downgraded the debt of Lennar , No. 2 builder Centex ( CTX , Fortune 500 ) and No. 4 Pulte Homes ( PHM , Fortune 500 ) to junk bond status .
Earlier this month , luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( TOL , Fortune 500 ) posted its first loss in 22 years as a public company .
Russert draws staunch defense of Clinton 's Iraq record David Edwards and Katie Baker
Published : Sunday January 13 , 2008

Print This Email This Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her record on the Iraq war to Tim Russert on NBC's " Meet The Press " this Sunday and insisted that she will begin to pull out troops within 60 days of taking office .
" From my perspective , part of the reason that the Iraqis are doing anything is because time is running out , " she said .
" They see this election happening , and they know that they dont have much time , that the blank check George Bush gave them is about to be torn up . "
Tension escalated between Clinton and Russert when the two discussed Clinton 's 2002 vote for the Iraq war .
Russert asked Clinton repeatedly whether Barack Obama had made a better decision six years ago ; Clinton reasserted throughout the interview that it was " unfair " to say her vote was a vote for war .
" Judgement is not a single snapshot , " she said .
" We can have this Jesuitical argument about what exactly was meant .
But when Chuck Hagel , who helped to draft the resolution said , ' It was not a vote for war , ' what I was told directly by the White House in response to my question , ' If you are given this authority , will you put the inspectors in and permit them to finish their job , ' I was told that 's exactly what we intended to do .
" Clinton emphatically emphasized that although Obama made an anti-Iraq intervention speech in 2002 , it was down from his Web site in 2003 and by 2004 he was saying he really didnt disagree with how George Bush was conducting the war . "
When Russert reminded Clinton that she voted similarily , Clinton said she differed from Obama in that she was not pretending to be something she was not .
" Im not premising my campaign on something different .
Im not here saying anything different from that , " she said .
" We can sit here and argue about 2002 , or we can say what has happened since and what needs to happen going forward in the future . "

What exactly do religious people want when they demand “ religious tolerance ” ?
What are we , the anti-religious , asked to tolerate ?
It ca n’t be the existence of religion or the fact that the religious have beliefs .
After all , we no longer kill each other for our beliefs , or discriminate against each other .
It is generally agreed that we have the freedom to believe whatever we want .
No , when we examine each case where “ religious tolerance ” is invoked , we invariably find that a religious person is trying to silence criticism of his religion , or condemning attacks against it .
We find that “ religious tolerance ” is in fact a defense of organized religion , in the name of the principle that “ all religions must be respected . ”
Poppycock !
What they want us to do is shut up and stop complaining about their actions when said actions are claimed to be based on religion ( even when they are n’t actually based on religion ) .
They want us to simply shut up and accept the infiltration of religious dogma in the social context .
They want us to reject reality and to “ accept ” that their religious dogma is on the same footing as science and moral integrity .
What they want us to do is to “ accept ” that we , the unbelievers and anti-religious , are second - class citizens .
They want us to shut up while they propagate authoritarianism , absolutism and evil .
To accept such things would be tantamount to rejecting what we are fighting for : the marginalization of organized religion ( and all other forms of authority ) within the social context .
Therefore we must reject “ religious tolerance ” as a principle .
We must pride ourselves in being “ intolerant of organized religion , ” while being tolerant of those individual believers who do not support or sanction organized religion .
This is not to say that we should jump on the “ militant atheism ” bandwagon .
While certainly Dawkins and Hitchens , by far the two most prominent figures , have a lot of good things to say , they are both new guard leftists who praise democracy and nation - building : they are fundamentally against freedom , regardless of how much they vilify religious authoritarianism .
Most atheists are leftists , who simply want to replace the god of Christianity with the god of the State , and religious control with government planning .
But why is atheism important in the first place ?
If you ask any atheist , he will tell you that atheism is an issue because many people who are religious are also a bad influence on society , and that this comes from the deleterious effect of religious dogma .
Whether you agree or disagree with this proposition , it clearly shows that atheism is a position of social ethics , not of epistemology or ontology as is generally claimed .
It is not the fact that one does not believe in a god ( whatever that could possibly mean ) that is important , but rather the fact that some people claim to believe , and that because of that belief they do bad things .
Unlike “ militant atheists , ” however , we can identify the principle underlying this problem : the authoritarianism and collectivism of organized religion , which demands that people abandon their individual values and fight for a “ higher cause . ”
This is the same fanaticism that animates the State ’s soldiers and policemen , the same attitude that defines patriotism and nationalism , the same devotion that creates the ultimate results of statism , which are criminality and murder on a grand scale .
“ Militant atheism ” is very much like the peace movement .
Both have a noble goal , but both fail to understand the roots of the problem they fight against , and thus cannot promote any practical solution .
Thus they fall back on resorting to political means , and as we know political means can achieve nothing but the growth of political means .
Political means have never , and will never , bring about more freedom .
If , as Anarchists , we are necessarily against organized religion , then we must not tolerate religious tactics .
We must exhort religious people to follow the precepts of their own minds , and to abandon churches and dogmas .
But we must always keep in mind that our ultimate goal is not the replacement of one authority for another , but rather the end of authoritarianism .
All our efforts must be directed towards that single all - encompassing goal .
Exclusive Orb is expected to announce that it 's supporting Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch in the next few days .
Orb provides access to your playlists and songs on your home PC ( as well as photos , videos and TV ) from anywhere .
It 's Sling without the hardware , with many users simply using it to access their home music collections at work .
On the iPhone and Touch , Orb is accessed through the browser .
It was n't as straightforward as that , however , since Apple stealthily blocks applications that use RTSP , the standard mobile streaming protocol .
It will deliver your streams in MP4 instead .
And this is what it looks like .
Orb : playing a tune
And here 's the iPhone / Touch accessing the latest , Orb-powered version WinAmp .
This version , which has n't really been trumpeted , turns your home media player into a very limited kind of on - demand radio station for friends .
Orb on the iPhone : into WinAmp
With the iPhone , you can send a link to friends in an SMS chat session , which is how you play a song you just bought - but do n't have on you - to a friend :
Orb streaming links embedded into an SMS chat
There 's also a YouTube video here .
Why is this stealthy software company so significant ?
Well , for starters , it provides the kind of obvious - in - hindsight service that IP protocols are all about .
Can you imagine a telco waking up one morning , thinking : " I know , let 's give subscribers access to their home music collections - and charge nothing for it ! "
" Place - shifting " offers an interesting contrast to the two great hypes du jour : User Generated Content with its mantra of " the user is in control " , and " Software as a Service " ( SaaS ) .
Both have a grain of truth about them , but supporters to tend to miss the barn door by a mile .
There is NO media revolution from videos of cats falling down stairs : we do expect greater control of , and access to media we 've already bought , however .
Similarly , SaaS is ( again ) being touted as the biggest revolution since Edison , but it's hard to envisage cheap local processing power disappearing when we have so much digital media to manipulate and juggle .
What some SaaS services share with placeshifting services like Orb is that where the media resides just matters a lot less .
As long as you can get to your spreadsheet / playlist , you worry less about carrying it with you .
But you knew all that already . ®
In the July / August issue of The Atlantic ( subscription required ) , there is another excellent article "
Snow Fall :
Attacking cocaine at its source was meant to drive up prices , yet U.S. street dealers are selling it for less than ever . "
It opens like this :
" If the four - year slog in Iraq seems endless , consider this : The “ War on Drugs , ” begun by Richard Nixon , escalated under Ronald Reagan , and continued by every president since , is now in its 37 th year . "
Here are some facts about the War on Drugs :
Number of U.S. presidents presiding over the War on Drugs : 7 ( Nixon , Ford , Carter , Reagan , Bush , Clinton , Bush )
Largest Recent Drug Busts : 20 tons of cocaine in March near Panama , followed shortly by a 15 ton seizure in April in Colombia .
That 's 70,000 pounds of pure cocaine , or 32 million grams , just about enough for 1 gram of pure cocaine for every resident of California , or the country of Canada .
When cut to typical street level quality , it might end up eventually as 100 million grams , enough for one gram for every resident of CA , TX , NY , and FL .
Amount spent on the War on Drugs since 1981 : $ 600 - 800 billion , about the same amount spent on the Vietnam War , another failed effort .
Number 2 destination for cocaine : Brazil ( U.S. is # 1 )
Price of a gram of pure cocaine in Bogota : $ 2
Cost of " Plan Colombia " since 2000 for aerial coca eradication in an area of Colombia equal to Delaware and Rhode Island : Almost $ 5 billion , about the same as Ireland has spent on its entire military budget during that period
Lowest price of a gram of cocaine in various U.S. cities in 2005 ( see graph above , click to enlarge ) : $ 20 in NY and Miami , $ 30 in L.A. and Seattle , $ 50 in Detroit and Dallas , $ 75 in Chicago , $ 80 in Atlanta .
Average price of a gram of cocaine in the U.S. ( nine cities in graph ) in 1999 : $ 70
Average price of a gram of cocaine in U.S. in 2005 : $ 50
About example code
Have you ever found it tedious to mix SQL and other languages , or been reluctant to write the same four lines of code again to do a simple database query ?
This article can help you eliminate the drudgery involved in database access , and make your programming time more efficient , by wrapping simple transactions in friendly native Python syntax .
By making the database emulate regular Python objects , you can remove a source of friction and frustration from your development process .
Your time spent programming will be more efficient and productive when you can focus on the task at hand , without being constantly sidetracked by unimportant details like where the cursor object is , or whether you need to escape - protect the data in the next query .
Another benefit of using native syntax is better portability .
This approach makes it easy for you to change databases without having to rewrite any of your application code .
Simply modify a few lines in the database wrapper , and you can support an entirely new database .
Though this article focuses on MySQL , the code should work easily with PostgreSQL or even SQLite with only minor modifications .
The approach described here is useful any time you want to write a quick program to access a database .
You may find it convenient if you want to generate a handful of new reports quickly , or perform basic modifications to your data .
Selecting Rows example code
Applications frequently need to do things such as " retrieve record 87 " , or " print results 30 - 40 . "
This calls for an array or list structure , which is easy to do in Python .
Normally , to show record 87 , you would need to execute something such as the following : c = db.cursor ( ) c.execute ( " select * from book limit 87,1 " ) row = c.fetchone ( ) display ( row )
Four lines is needlessly long for what is essentially an array lookup .
It barely begins to utilize the full power of SQL , yet this type of thing is quite common .
So , what if you could use simpler syntax to do the same thing ?
The following would be much easier : display ( books [ 87 ] )
That sort of easy syntax is supported in Python , using its __getitem__ ( ) .
class Table : def __init__ ( self , db , name ) : self.db = db self.name = name self.dbc = self.db.cursor ( ) def __getitem__( self , item ) : self.dbc.execute(" select * from %s limit %s , 1 " \ % ( self.name , item ) ) return self.dbc.fetchone ( )
Using this class , you can easily access a database table as if it were a native import MySQLdb db = MySQLdb.connect ( user=" user " , passwd = " passwd " , db=" library " ) books = Table ( db , " book " ) for i in xrange ( 80 , 100 ) : # ( xrange type ) print " Book %s : %s " % ( i , books [ i ] )
Condensing the database lookup into a single short expression greatly increases its expressive power .
When you must write code to keep track of a cursor , execute queries , and fetch rows from the result , the operation just does n't fit into as many places .
Using a word or two for the same concept allows you to incorporate such condensed operations into other ideas more clearly and easily .
To begin , you 'll want to convert the most frequently - used operations .
The most basic operation is reading or selecting data , so I will focus on that first .
Applications frequently need to do things such as " retrieve record 87 " , or " print results 30 - 40 . "
This calls for an array or list structure , which is easy to do in Python .
Normally , to show record 87 , you would need to execute something such as the following : Four lines is needlessly long for what is essentially an array lookup .
It barely begins to utilize the full power of SQL , yet this type of thing is quite common .
So , what if you could use simpler syntax to do the same thing ?
The following would be much easier : That sort of easy syntax is supported in Python , using its special class methods .
Any object can emulate an array by implementing special functions .
In this case , you want to create a Table class with a method called Using this class , you can easily access a database table as if it were a native Python list .
It merely provides read - only access to single rows , but it 's a good start .
The following short program demonstrates its use : Condensing the database lookup into a single short expression greatly increases its expressive power .
When you must write code to keep track of a cursor , execute queries , and fetch rows from the result , the operation just does n't fit into as many places .
Using a word or two for the same concept allows you to incorporate such condensed operations into other ideas more clearly and easily .
Determining Data Length example code much data needs to be processed .
Most search programs return this with the results , such as " results 80 to 100 of 487 . "
That 487 is important to many search engine users .
Luckily , the length operator in Python is easy to implement .
Simply add the following to the Table class : def __len__( self ) : self.dbc.execute(" select count (*) from %s " % ( self.name ) ) r = int(self.dbc.fetchone ( ) [ 0 ] ) return r
This will make the function len( books ) return the number of items in the table , so you can loop over the entire data set or at least tell the user how much data exists : for i in xrange ( len ( books ) ) : print books [ i ]
Something important was missing from the code mentioned so far .
Many programs want to know howdata needs to be processed .
Most search programs return this with the results , such as " results 80 to 100 of 487 . "
That 487 is important to many search engine users .
Luckily , theoperator in Python is easy to implement .
Simply add the following to the Table class :
This will make the functionreturn the number of items in the table , so you can loop over the entire data set or at least tell the user how much data exists : Iterating Through Rows example code iterators , which would have been a little easier .
It should be possible to process every item in a table with syntax such as : for book in books : print book
This is simple to do , but first it would be a good idea to refactor a little .
The Table class will be doing a lot of database queries , and pumping all those queries through one function will help make debugging easier .
First , add a self .
debug = 1 line to the Table 's __init__ ( ) function , and then add a method for queries : def _query ( self , q ) : if self .
debug : print " Query : %s " % ( q ) self.dbc.execute(q )
To add iteration , simply add two methods to the Table class : __iter__ ( ) and next ( ) .
The class does not need to be derived from a built - in iterator type , it merely needs to implement the same policies .
This " def __iter__ ( self ) : " " " creates a data set , and returns an iterator ( self ) " " " q = " select * from %s " % ( self.name ) self._query ( q ) # an Iterator is an object with a next ( ) method return self def next ( self ) : " " " returns the next item in the data set , or tells Python to stop " " " r = self.dbc.fetchone( ) if not r : raise StopIteration return r
By adding this code , the Table class now acts like an iterator , allowing you to use the easy syntax at the beginning of this section .
Putting the concepts of an idea , such as database access , into simpler terms enables still more and better innovations .
For example , a car engine is a very complicated device with countless parts and design considerations .
It takes a lot of work to fully describe an engine , and to attach it to wheels to make a car .
But once you fully understand the concept of an engine , you no longer need to describe it in detail .
It becomes sufficient to say " an engine with wheels . "
Then , after building such a car , you can easily create new concepts by reusing the same old engine ideas .
Perhaps after the car , you decide to attach a blade and build a lawn mower .
And then , attach wings and a propeller to make a plane .
Creating these new things would be vastly more difficult if you had to re-create the concept of an engine each time .
Or , in this case , if you had to keep writing the same code over and over , each time you needed to perform an operation you 've done before .
The loop in the previous example was better , but it could have been simpler still .
Python supports , which would have been a little easier .
It should be possible to process every item in a table with syntax such as : This is simple to do , but first it would be a good idea to refactor a little .

First , add aline to the Table ' sfunction , and then add a method for queries :
To add iteration , simply add two methods to the Table class : and .
The class does not need to be derived from a built - in iterator type , it merely needs to implement the same policies .
This " Duck Typing " technique is part of the " policy over mechanism " theme common in Python .
It provides most of the same benefits as more strict languages , without losing flexibility .
Adding the following code turns the Table class into an iterable object :
By adding this code , the Table class now acts like an iterator , allowing you to use the easy syntax at the beginning of this section .

Using Data " Slices " example code
The previous examples executed one database query for each row accessed in the table .
Pulling tens or hundreds of records at a time would be more efficient though .
The following demonstrates the syntax for taking a slice of a list , or a list - like object : # create a list of all items to go on the third page page3 = books [ 20:30 ] # or , pull ten records into a list , and loop over them for book in books [ 20:30 ] : print book To implement slice support in the Table class , modify the __getitem__ ( ) method .
Both individual lookups and slice lookups are implemented with this method , and determining which type of result to return is simply a matter of checking whether the parameter is an integer or a slice .
The isinstance ( ) function , along with the def __getitem__ ( self , item ) : q = " select * from %s " % ( self.name ) # isinstance ( ) is recommended over direct type ( a ) == type ( b ) # comparisons , to accomodate derived classes .
# TODO : However , duck typing would be even better .
if isinstance ( item , types .
SliceType ) : q = q + " limit %s , %s " \ % ( item.start , item.stop - item.start ) self._query ( q ) return self.dbc.fetchall( ) elif isinstance ( item , types .
IntType ) : q = q + " limit %s , 1 " % ( item ) self._query ( q ) return self.dbc.fetchone( ) else : raise IndexError , " unsupported index type " The Slice object contains three useful attributes : start , stop , and step .
The step part will probably not be useful , because SQL databases do n't generally support step sizes other than one .
However , start and stop are useful , and translate easily into arguments to MySQL's LIMIT parameter .
The start attribute is used directly as the first parameter .
Subtracting start from stop produces the second parameter -- length .
Different databases use different syntax for selecting data slices , which can become confusing if you work with more than one .
It can be difficult to remember if the LIMIT clause takes first , last as arguments , or if it uses first , length , or if it expects something else .
This tends to cause silent errors in programs because the syntax is still correct -- accidentally getting too many records , or too few , or even none at all .
Hopefully , using the easy slice syntax will help you avoid that type of error .
Databases tend to be large , and accessing an entire data set can be very slow .
If you have 50,000 records in a table , and only need twenty of them right now , grabbing the whole set would be very inefficient .
However , taking only one record at a time is also inefficient .
To solve this , use slices .
Python provides slicing for list - like objects , which can select a range of records quickly and easily .
The previous examples executed one database query for each row accessed in the table .
Pulling tens or hundreds of records at a time would be more efficient though .
The following demonstrates the syntax for taking a slice of a list , or a list - like object : To implement slice support in the Table class , modify themethod .
Both individual lookups and slice lookups are implemented with this method , and determining which type of result to return is simply a matter of checking whether the parameter is an integer or a slice .
The built - in function , along with the types module can help you decide what to do .

Searching and Sorting example code contacts .search ( " firstname= 'bob ' " ) contacts.sort ( " lastname " ) for c in contacts : print " %s %s : %s " % ( c[ FNAME ] , c[ LNAME ] , c[ PHONE ] )
The output would print a list of " Bob " names and phone numbers , sorted by last name : Bob Barker : 123-4567
Bob Dobbs : 234-5678
Bob Monroe : 345-6789
Bob Zemeckis : 456-7890
Python does not provide operators for searching or sorting , so a class method must suffice .
These methods are very simple , because SQL implements them as parameters to SELECT instead of allocating separate commands for them .
The only work the search and sort methods need to do is save data for later use : def search ( self , method ) : self ._search = " " if method : self .
_search = " where %s " % ( method ) def sort ( self , method ) : self ._sort = " " if method : self .
_sort = " order by %s " % ( method )
Making these functions actually do something requires modifying the other class methods .
The self .
_search and self .
_sort attributes must be defined , and inserted into queries where appropriate .
The following methods should be modified : Table.__init__( ) :
Set self ._search = " " and self .
_sort = " " to avoid accessing them before they are defined .
: Set and to avoid accessing them before they are defined .
Table.__len__( ) :
Change the query to : self ._query ( " select count (* ) from %s %s " % ( self.name , self._search ) )
: Change the query to : Table.__iter__( ) :
Change the query to : q = " select * from %s %s %s " % ( self.name , self .
_search , self ._sort )
: Change the query to : q = " select * from %s %s %s " % ( self.name , self._search , self._sort ) Table.__getitem__( ) :
Change the first line to : q = " select * from %s %s %s " % ( self.name , self .
_search , self ._sort )
Now , at this point , you may have noticed that some SQL slipped into the interface for the Table class .
The parameters for Table.search ( ) and Table.sort ( ) are exactly what you would write in a WHERE or ORDER BY clause in a normal query .
The table 's name is also placed directly into the query .
This affords some interesting opportunities , or tricks .
Some simple tricks include sorting by several columns , or searching with more than one condition .
A more complicated trick is to turn the Table into something like a view , by connecting it to more than one database table .
The following code demonstrates all three techniques : books = Table ( db , " book , series " ) books .
search ( " book.series=series.id AND book.publish_year>1995 " ) books.sort ( " series.name , book.publish_year " )
SERIES_NAME , BOOK_TITLE , BOOK_YEAR = 6 , 1 , 2 for b in books : print " %s : %s ( % s ) " % ( b[ SERIES_NAME ] , b[ BOOK_TITLE ] , b[ BOOK_YEAR ] )
The preceding code tells Python to get rows from two tables , book and series .
The search method then adds two additional instructions �join the tables by using the series ID , and ignore anything from 1995 or earlier .
Then sort the results first by the name of the series , and then by the year each book was published .
This has the effect of grouping related items together and showing them in chronological order .
The code then chooses three interesting columns from the data , and prints the information in a human - readable form .
So far , this article has ignored two of the most important aspects of databases .
Searching and sorting , or finding and arranging data , let you narrow and organize results automatically .
If you were writing an address book application , the user would often ask questions such as " Who do I know named ' Bob ' ? " and expect to get a sorted list .
The following code is a simple and feasible way to implement such a query :
The output would print a list of " Bob " names and phone numbers , sorted by last name : Python does not provide operators for searching or sorting , so a class method must suffice .
These methods are very simple , because SQL implements them as parameters toinstead of allocating separate commands for them .
The only work the search and sort methods need to do is save data for later use : Making these functions actually do something requires modifying the other class methods .
Theandattributes must be defined , and inserted into queries where appropriate .
The following methods should be modified : Now , at this point , you may have noticed that some SQL slipped into the interface for the Table class .
The parameters forandare exactly what you would write in aorclause in a normal query .
The table 's name is also placed directly into the query .
This affords some interesting opportunities , or tricks .
Some simple tricks include sorting by several columns , or searching with more than one condition .
A more complicated trick is to turn the Table into something like a view , by connecting it to more than one database table .
The following code demonstrates all three techniques :
The preceding code tells Python to get rows from two tables , and The search method then adds two additional instructions �join the tables by using the series ID , and ignore anything from 1995 or earlier .
Then sort the results first by the name of the series , and then by the year each book was published .

The code then chooses three interesting columns from the data , and prints the information in a human - readable form .
Inserting Rows example code contacts.insert ('' , " Stanley " , " Spudowski " , " 1965-01-01 " )
This is similar to a direct SQL query , but even simpler .
And , because of the way the execute ( ) function .
If you ever plan to insert data supplied by a user , it is a good idea to use that protection , because it will prevent possible exploits in your program .
Doing this requires a minor modification to the Table._query ( ) method : def _query ( self , q , data=None ) : if self .
debug : print " Query : %s ( %s ) " % ( q , data ) self.dbc.execute(q , data )
With that modification in place , you can now write an insert function .
All it needs to do is pass the data to your database in a format compatible with the DB API spec .
However , because it needs to support tables of any size and shape , the format string should be created dynamically .
The following creates a format string such as " %s , %s , %s , %s " according to the length of the row it is given , and then executes the query .
def insert ( self , * row ) : fmt = ( " %s , " * len( row ) ) [ : - 1 ] # repeat ; remove final comma q = " insert into %s values ( % s ) " % ( self.name , fmt ) self._query ( q , row )
As an additional usability feature , it avoids the need to pass a tuple object , by collecting all the function 's arguments into a tuple automatically .
The *row syntax does this .
Its effect , basically , is to remove one set of parenthesis , allowing you to run insert ( a , b , c ) instead of insert ( ( a , b , c ) ) .
Reading data is useful , especially if you need to build reports or otherwise sort through data .
But you probably will want to write to the database too .
The simplest way to write is to insert new rows , which you can achieve with the following syntax :
This is similar to a direct SQL query , but even simpler .
And , because of the way the Python database spec works , you wo n't even have to worry about escaping data to make it safe .
The spec requires automatic escaping for anything in the second parameter of the cursor 'sfunction .
If you ever plan to insert data supplied by a user , it is a good idea to use that protection , because it will prevent possible exploits in your program .
Doing this requires a minor modification to themethod :
With that modification in place , you can now write anfunction .
All it needs to do is pass the data to your database in a format compatible with the DB API spec .

Thesyntax does this .
Its effect , basically , is to remove one set of parenthesis , allowing you to runinstead of Deleting Rows example code DELETE FROM movies WHERE title= ' Harvey ' AND year = ' 1950 ' AND genre=37 ; .
The problem with this approach is that you might have two rows with identical data .
In that case , you would accidentally delete both rows instead of just one .
A less error - prone approach is to use row IDs .
Row IDs are supported by most databases , though the implementation differs .
In MySQL , the query would look more like this : DELETE FROM movies WHERE _rowid=58 ; .
That query will remove one and only one row , regardless of the content of the table .
Even if every row is identical , each one will have a unique row ID .
As an added bonus , the query is smaller , simpler , and quite similar to the array - like syntax Python uses to delete list items : del movies [ 58 ]
To make your Table class respond to the del command , add the following method to it : def __delitem__ ( self , item ) : q = " select %s from %s %s %s limit %s , 1 " % \ ( " _rowid " , self .name , self .
_search , self ._sort , item ) self._query ( q ) rid = self.dbc.fetchone ( ) [ 0 ] q = " delete from %s where % s= %s " % ( self.name , " _rowid " , rid ) self._query (q )
This function performs two queries .
First , it is necessary to obtain the row ID .
Then it deletes the row identified by that ID .
You can eliminate the need for the first query by always including the row ID in your query results , but for the sake of brevity , that is not demonstrated here .
The provided example code includes row IDs , though , along with several other enhancements .
Removing rows is also likely to be useful .
And , in most SQL databases , it is not as simple as just telling the DB to remove row number 87 .
The difficulty is a matter of telling the database to identify which row to remove .
One approach is to identify the row by specifying every value in its cells .
For example , .

By adding a few special functions , you can turn Python into a richer , more appropriate language for whatever you need .

While the approach described here demonstrates some of the things you can do with Python 's syntax overloading , you may want to look into established tools for real database use .
The The data - access approach described above should help you use your time more efficiently and help you write data - processing scripts more quickly .
You could extend and refine the approach into a much more sophisticated library , and make it more appropriate for larger applications .
For example , you could modify the code to use dict - style cursors , instead of tuples .
Or , you could add a Row class , with methods to modify individual cells .
Another useful extension would be to formally support joined tables instead of using the somewhat tricky method described earlier .
Many other enhancements could be added too , such as speeding up iteration by fetching and caching many rows , or making deletion more powerful or efficient .

Definitions Duck Typing Pythonic programming style that determines an object 's type by inspection of its method or attribute signature rather than by explicit relationship to some type object ( " If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it must be a duck . " )
By emphasizing interfaces rather than specific types , well - designed code improves its flexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution .
Duck - typing avoids tests using type ( ) or isinstance ( ) .
Instead , it typically employs hasattr ( ) tests or EAFP programming .
EAFP Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission .
This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false .
This clean and fast style is characterized by the presence of many try and except statements .
The technique contrasts with the LBYL style that is common in many other languages such as C .

Bret Stephens argued in a Wall Street Journal piece yesterday that the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that several of the techniques used by the Bush administration in interrogating prisoners do not amount to " torture " .
Let us leave aside the exquisite irony that the Wall Street Journal is now invoking not American law ( because they cannot ) to redefine torture , nor even English law ( ditto ) , but one ruling on appeal of the much - detested European Court to decide what U.S. law is and should be .
The case is much , much less than Stephens made it out to be - and the result maintained the clear illegality of some of the mildest techniques adopted by the US to torture prisoners suspected of terrorism .
All the British legal authorities and the British government and the European Court and the European commission found that the five techniques cited were illegal under British and European law - separately or in combination .
The British government 's own inquiry found the following :
We have received both written and oral representations from many legal bodies and individual lawyers from both England and Northern Ireland .
There has been no dissent from the view that the procedures are illegal alike by the law of England and the law of Northern Ireland .
... ( d) This being so , no Army Directive and no Minister could lawfully or validly have authorized the use of the procedures .
Only Parliament can alter the law .
The procedures were and are illegal .
We know that the WSJ believes that the president has the authority to ignore and suspend the rule of law indefinitely .
The Brits and all other Western democracies did n't .
The British government moreover immediately banned the suspect techniques after they were used against 14 prisoners .
It is worth noting that none died during the torture , whereas we have at least two dozen cases in the US under Bush in which the government itself concedes that prisoners were tortured to death ; and well over a hundred have died during interrogation under suspicious circumstances .
The five techniques in question were as follows :
" (a ) Wall - standing : Forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a ' stress position , ' described by those who underwent it as being 'spreadeagled against the wall , with their fingers put high above the head against the wall , the legs spread apart and the feet back , causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers . '
" ( b ) Hooding : Putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees ' heads and , at least initially , keeping it there all the time except during interrogation .
" ( c ) Subjection to noise : Pending their interrogations , holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise .
" (d ) Deprivation of sleep : pending their interrogations , depriving the detainees of sleep .
" (e ) Deprivation of food and drink : subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogations . "
Notice that the stress position used here , though clearly torture under U.S. law , is far milder than the manacled stress positions used at Gitmo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram , Cropper and elsewhere .
Notice also that hooding was viewed as highly controversial , and subsequently banned by the Brits .
It is openly used by the US throughout the theater of war , and no one even objects .
The noise is mild compared to the Bush - Cheney methods .
And the sleep deprivation is nothing like the months of sleeplessness used against some at Gitmo ( and pioneered by Stalin ) .
Nonetheless , even these milder techniques were subsequently reviewed by the European Commission on Human Rights which
considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture , on the grounds that ( 1 ) the intensity of the stress caused by techniques creating sensory deprivation " directly affects the personality physically and mentally " ; and ( 2 ) " the systematic application of the techniques for the purpose of inducing a person to give information shows a clear resemblance to those methods of systematic torture which have been known over the ages ... a modern system of torture falling into the same category as those systems .
applied in previous times as a means of obtaining information and confessions .
Stephens is correct that on appeal , the European Court eventually ruled that although the techniques were illegal under EU law , and amounted to " inhuman and degrading " treatment , they did not quite meet the standard for the word " torture . "
Nonetheless , the British government reiterated its disavowal of all such techniques .
So Stephens is arguing that the American standard should be far lower than the British standard ; and that techniques that the European Court ruled were illegal should be adopted by the US ; and , of course , that this narrow semantic ruling whould now be used to justify far worse methods used by the Bush - Cheney administration : water - boarding , repeated beatings , chained stress positions , permanent hooding , total isolation for months on end , dietary manipulation , hypothermia , extreme heat , and sleep - deprivation for weeks on end .
Stephens , I 'm sorry to say , is clutching at straws .
The honest argument for those who support torture is to propose legalizing it , to define explicitly what is now allowed , and to get the Congress to revoke the current laws on torture and to leave the Geneva Conventions .
If Stephens really believes we need to do this , he and his editorial board should have the decency , if that is an appropriate word , to propose it .

FBI Polygraph Statement of Captain Christopher J. Stein
On October 3 , 2002 , I arrived at the Denver FBI office for a pre-employment polygraph for a Special Agent position .
After two days of interrogation , I was informed that I had failed my polygraph for reasons of " national security . "
I was accused of being a spy .
I was a Military Intelligence Officer in the United States Army , honorably discharged at the end of my service obligation , decorated with many awards .
I had an impeccable service record , constantly holding positions above my rank and granted with responsibilities reserved for those senior in time served .
I held a Top Secret Security Clearance from 4/17/1997 to 4/16/2002 , all of those years with Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI ) access .
Never once was my integrity and dedication to my nation questioned , and never once was my clearance in jeopardy .
It is for these reasons that I was a top candidate for the position of Special Agent .
After graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1997 , I began my service in the Army with the Military Intelligence Officer Basic Course at the US Army Intelligence Center , Fort Huachuca , Arizona .
Upon completion , I was assigned to the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Carson , Colorado .
My years in the Army were spent as a Tactical Intelligence Officer , or S2 , of combat units .
As a Lieutenant , I served as the Senior Intelligence Officer ( S2 ) of 3rd Squadron , 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment ( 3/3 ACR ) .
We trained and deployed to serve as part of Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) 7 in Bosnia - Herzegovina .
My area of responsibility included towns such as Tuzla , Zvornik , and even the infamous Srebrenica .
Upon returning from Bosnia and still a Lieutenant , I became the S2 for 4/3 ACR ( Aviation ) .
I was promoted to Captain , continuing the success of my earlier years .
After witnessing the events of 9/11 , I was sure how I wanted to move on in life .
Even though my service obligation to the Army was ending , my desire to serve my country had not .
I filled out and sent in my initial application for a Special Agent position with the FBI .
After months of tests , applications , and a structured interview in Kansas City , MO , I had received a conditional letter of employment .
I was ecstatic , knowing that only a paperwork drill stood between me and a class date at Quantico .
I was scheduled for my pre-employment polygraph in early October , 2002 .
Before I went in for my pre-employment polygraph , I sat down with a Special Agent named Chris ( his first name ) to review my application , which I had sent in nearly 6 months prior .
He went over every question , making sure that I had not made any mistakes .
There were a few minor errors and a few corrections to be made ; however , things were going smoothly .
But then Special Agent Chris stopped at the question about contact with foreign governments .
He looked very surprised , saying to me , " How could you have gone to Bosnia and not had contact with foreign governments ? "
I told him that I did , of course , have extensive contact with foreign governments .
He asked me why I had n't listed them , because the question said I needed to list all of my foreign contacts .
I felt humiliated for having made such a huge mistake on such an important application and then listed for him the 30 - 35 countries whose representatives I had had contact with .
Special Agent Bill Irwin was the polygrapher doing my examination that day .
He told me that Special Agent Chris told him , prior to my arrival , that I had made a mistake on my application regarding my foreign contacts .
After a few hours of testing , Special Agent Irwin sat down in front of me and told me that I was having problems with " unauthorized contact with foreign nationals . "
He said he was going to " fax my results off to DC " and see what they thought about my test results .
After sitting for half an hour , he came back in and said that my test was inconclusive .
He told me to get a good night 's sleep and return the next day to retake the test .
I came back the next day ready to pass .
I sat in the chair and we started the test .
I answered every question with 100 % honesty .
After running through the questions a few times , Special Agent Irwin sat in front of me and said , " Well , today your results are conclusive : a conclusive failure .
You react very strongly to ' having unauthorized contact with persons you knew were spies ' and ' giving classified information to persons you knew were spies . ' "
I was in shock .
Then he started interrogating me .
He left the room to " fax my results to DC " again .
This time , he returned with Special Agent Chris .
Together , they continued the interrogation .
They made all kinds of accusations against me .
They even threatened a criminal espionage investigation .
I , of course , welcomed it as an opportunity to clear this situation up .
They informed me that if I did n't have anything to tell them , we would be done and that I would fail .
I said I would have to lie to give them the kind of information they were looking for .
Then they escorted me out of the Denver FBI office like a common criminal .
I was crushed .
I had decided to put all of this behind me , chalking one up to governmental bureaucracy .
Knowing the Bureau 's position regarding the pre-employment polygraph , I knew that my chance of making it to Quantico was gone .
But I could not forget that I had made such a huge error on my application regarding foreign contacts , possibly the root of my polygraph failure .
I decided I ought to re-read the question that I had answered " incorrectly . "
To my surprise , the question concludes with the clause " for other than government business . "
I made no mistake .
All of my foreign contacts were within government business , and as far as the application is concerned , they did not have to be listed .
Of course , I was very forthcoming with disclosing my contacts , but the fact is that I did not err on my application .
When Special Agent Chris told Special Agent Irwin that I had omitted my information about foreign contacts from my application , the initial indication of deception regarding my foreign contacts could have been generated there .
I was most likely doomed to fail my polygraph for reasons of national security before I even sat down in the chair , because the polygrapher was already under the assumption that I had something to hide regarding my foreign contacts .
I understand the tactics employed by Special Agent Irwin during my interrogation .
His threats and accusations might have caused a guilty party great duress , possibly enough to convince them to uncover their secrets .
But for someone innocent of such accusations , the tactics were demeaning and humiliating .
Never in my life have I felt as terrible as that day .
I am a proud American , one who gave an oath to my country and served with pride and dignity .
To be accused of such atrocities as " sleeping with Bosnian women and giving them classified information " is as degrading as it is ridiculous .
The fact that I have failed an FBI polygraph will become public record .
I left the military to pursue a career in the FBI .
This failed polygraph has taken that career opportunity away from me , and subsequently , many more .
With a failed polygraph on my record , the ability for me to regain my security clearance will be severely hindered .
Only a background investigation can nullify this negative report from the FBI .
I know this because one of my responsibilities as a Military Intelligence Officer was to process soldiers for security clearances .
I know what a negative report from the FBI generated by a National Agency Check can do a person 's career .
Since I am forced now to look for civilian career opportunities , my Intelligence background drives me toward government and defense contract jobs , most of which require security clearances .
My chances of getting one of these jobs , because of this failed polygraph , is seriously diminished .
Only 3 days after I failed my polygraph , my friend ( who will remain nameless ) , whom I met during the FBI application process , went to the Denver FBI office for his polygraph .
I called him and told him I failed , but I left out the details regarding my failure .
He was an infantryman in the Army , a dedicated soldier , and a graduate of the Army Ranger School and Drill Instructor School .
His military resume reads like a TV commercial for the Army , full of action and special missions .
His career in the infantry crossed him with Military Intelligence , as he served in a Long Range Surveillance Detachment ( LRS - D ) .
For a job like that , he gained a Top Secret clearance .
I did n't want my national security failure to bother him .
My friend was very honest .
While stationed in Germany , he took some performance enhancing supplements that his friend gave him during their workouts .
He later found out from his friend that the supplements were over - the - counter steroids purchased on the German economy .
My friend wanted to be sure the supplements were legal and safe , as German laws regarding these pills differ from those in the States .
He took them to the US doctor on his post , who checked them and cleared them as legal .
He admitted to all of this on his application , pre-polygraph interview , and during his polygraph .
He was failed as being " deceptive " regarding drug usage on his polygraph .
Again , Special Agent Irwin , the same polygrapher that I had , made wild accusations , telling my friend " well , if you were willing to take those pills , you 're willing to take anything . "
Accusations included taking methamphetamines and marijuana , which Special Agent Irwin insisted were proven by the polygraph .
Ironically , less than a year before , my friend had taken and passed a polygraph for a local police department , a polygraph that included the same questions and admissions regarding drugs and supplements .
Luckily for my friend , he was already pursuing a career as a Special Agent with US Customs .
They do n't care about the FBI or their polygraph .
My friend told me I ought to pursue a career with them .
After speaking with the Applicant Coordinator for US Customs Service in Denver , I was sent the initial computerized application .
The Coordinator did n't care that I failed a bogus polygraph , and said he thought it would have no impact on my career with Customs .
While filling out the application , I noticed a problem .
Section IV , Question # 19 asks if I was " ever denied employment by any Federal law enforcement agency . "
It goes on to define denial of employment as " issued an offer of employment that was rescinded by the issuing agency due to failure of the medical examination , drug test , background investigation or polygraph examination . "
For my friend , none of this applied , as he had filled this computer application out prior to his polygraph .
For me , this question lumps me , an honest man falsely accused of espionage , in with the medical rejects , druggies , and criminals .
Clearing my name will be a very difficult process .
I have already appealed the polygraph findings with the FBI , but I have received no response .
I 'm sure that I will eventually get a form letter denying my appeal , since the accusations against me were of the most unforgivable in nature .
My only hope is that the FBI understands that the basis of the accusation was due to a bureau clerical error and not based in fact .
But I have little faith that an organization that believes in such methods of screening applicants will have enough faith in me to help me clear my name .
I wish I had seen this website ( AntiPolygraph.org ) before I had gone for my polygraph .
After reading all of the information on the site , I feel duped .
There was no polygraph examination going on in that office that day , there was only elaborate mind games .
If I wanted to have someone poorly read my mind , I 'd call Ms. Cleo .
This way I know what I 'm getting myself into , and I can hang up when I 'm done .
But I was naïve -- I thought that I could sit in the chair , tell the truth , and all would be well .
After reading The Lie Behind the Lie Detector , I was amazed to see how many tactics were employed on me during this " test . "
But overall , my responses were all truthful , so I do n't know where their false accusations of espionage could have come from besides the pre-polygraph clerical error by Special Agent Chris .
In a game of voodoo science , the assumption by Special Agent Chris that I had omitted my foreign contacts was the only piece of hard evidence the polygrapher had to go on .
If he 's basing his polygraph findings on poor information gathered by someone else , how much faith does he have in his skills as an interrogator ?
And how much faith does he have in his machine ?
Probably as much as we all do .

Johns Hopkins scientists have by chance discovered that a widely used means of illuminating cancer cells could undermine studies of the potential value of experimental anti-cancer drugs because the natural “ pump ” that cells use to clear out the chemical light source alters their chemistry .
“ Researchers who use markers involving luciferase may want to double - check their findings , ” says Martin Pomper , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of radiology , oncology , and pharmacology and molecular sciences at Johns Hopkins .
Scientists have increased their use of “ glowing ” markers to track cellular activity in rats and mice , in part , because the tactic is non-invasive and more humane for the animals .
To make the cells glow , scientists use a gene encoding luciferase , an enzyme that causes a chemical reaction responsible for the tiny glow in fireflies .
Researchers transfer the luciferase gene into the genetic machinery of cancer cells , which then are injected into an animal , and the enzyme ’s glow signals the response of a cell to an anticancer drug .
But in a chance discovery , Pomper , collaborating with John Laterra , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of neurology , neuroscience and oncology at Johns Hopkins and the Kennedy Krieger Institute , found that a cellular “ pump ” that automatically rids cancer cells of its glowing contents over time , can distort test results .
They stumbled on the saboteur pump during experiments with a bioluminescent marker in mice that is designed to test the effect of an experimental drug on a cancer - causing gene pathway , called hedgehog .
Pomper ’s work focused on an anti-hedgehog compound called HhAntag - 691 that his team hoped would turn off the pathway with a single dose .
The way the study was designed , his team first bioilluminated the cancer cells with the luciferase gene , then introduced HhAntag - 691 into the animals .
If it worked , researchers would see no glow in the cancer cells because the hedgehog pathway would be switched off , failing to activate other components in the hedgehog pathway that turn on luciferase .

“ But when we added the anti-hedgehog compound , the cells glowed brighter rather than getting dimmer , ” says Pomper , whose team from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology observed a threefold increase in glow output .
The glow is measured by means of a photograph taken through the animal ’s skin with a camera that detects bioluminescent wavelengths .
“ We thought this was bizarre and repeated the experiment many times . ”
In an effort to figure out their problem , the researchers repeated the experiment in a cell extract , a replica of the cell environment without the intact cell itself .
In this test , the glow dipped threefold .
“ This suggested that natural pumps on the surfaces of intact cancer cells pump out luciferin , which reacts with intracellular luciferase to cause the cells to glow , ” said Pomper , whose report on the subject appeared in the October 1 issue of Cancer Research .
Pomper ’s team identified the chemical pump , called ABCG2 / BCRP , which is one of nearly 50 of its type .
And they warn drug developers to be wary of it .
“ If you want to use bioluminescence to test a drug ’s action , make sure the cells do n’t have this pump , ” says Pomper .
The trouble is that many cancers express this pump , and shutting it off would complicate the test , according to Pomper .
Still , the discovery has tipped off the researchers to a new target and a test to find inhibitors of it .
“ We ’re now looking for inhibitors of the pump , which when coupled with standard chemotherapy , could lead to less drug resistance than currently seen for most tumors , ” says Pomper .
Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Dana Foundation .
Other participants in the research are Yimao Zhang , Joseph P. Bressler , Jeff Neal , Bachchu Lal , and Hyo - Eun C. Bhang of Johns Hopkins .
In a departure from normal practice on this site , this post is a commentary on a piece of out - and - out fiction ( unlike most of the other posts which deal with a more subtle kind ) .
Michael Crichton ’s new novel “ State of Fear ” is about a self - important NGO hyping the science of the global warming to further the ends of evil eco-terrorists .
The inevitable conclusion of the book is that global warming is a non-problem .
A lesson for our times maybe ?
Unfortunately , I think not .
Like the recent movie “ The Day After Tomorrow ” , the novel addresses real scientific issues and controversies , but is similarly selective ( and occasionally mistaken ) about the basic science .
I will discuss a selection of the global warming - related issues that are raised in between the car chases , shoot - outs , cannibalistic rites and assorted derring - do .
The champion of Crichton ’s scientific view is a MIT academic - turned - undercover operative who clearly runs intellectual rings around other characters .
The issues are raised as conversations and Q and A sessions between him ( and other ‘ good guys ’ ) and two characters ; an actor ( not a very clever chap ) and a lawyer ( a previously duped innocent ) , neither of whom know much about the science .
So for actors and lawyers everywhere , I will try and help out .
The issues Crichton raises are familiar to those of us in the field , and come up often in discussions .
Some are real and well appreciated while some are red herrings and are used to confuse rather than enlighten .
The first set of comments relate to the attribution of the recent warming trend to increasing CO 2 .
One character suggests that “ if CO 2 did n’t cause the global cooling between 1940 and 1970 , how can you be sure it is responsible for the recent warming ? ” ( paraphrased from p86 ) .
Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures do appear to have cooled over that period , and that contrasts with a continuing increase in CO 2 , which if all else had been equal , should have led to warming .
But were all things equal ?
Actually no .
In the real world , there is both internal variability and other factors that affect climate ( i.e. other than CO 2 ) .
Some of those other forcings ( sulphate and nitrate aerosols , land use changes , solar irradiance , volcanic aerosols , for instance ) can cause cooling .
Matching up the real world with what we might expect to have happened depends on including ALL of the forcings ( as best as we can ) .
Even then any discrepancy might be due to internal variability ( related principally to the ocean on multi- decadal time scales ) .
Our current ‘ best guess ’ is that the global mean changes in temperature ( including the 1940 - 1970 cooling ) are actually quite closely related to the forcings .
Regional patterns of change appear to be linked more closely to internal variability ( particularly the 1930 ’s warming in the North Atlantic ) .
However , in no case has anyone managed to show that the recent warming can be matched without the increases in CO 2 ( and other GHGs like CH 4 ) .
Secondly , through the copious use of station weather data , a number of single station records with long term cooling trends are shown .
In particular , the characters visit Punta Arenas ( at the tip of South America ) , where ( very pleasingly to my host institution ) they have the GISTEMP station record posted on the wall which shows a long - term cooling trend ( although slight warming since the 1970’s ) .
“ There ’s your global warming ” one of the good guys declares .
I have to disagree .
Global warming is defined by the global mean surface temperature .
It does not imply that the whole globe is warming uniformly ( which of course it is n’t ) .
( But that does n’t stop one character later on ( p381 ) declaring that “.. it ’s effect is presumably the same everywhere in the world .
That ’s why it ’s called global warming ” ) .
Had the characters visited the nearby station of Santa Barbara Cruz Aeropuerto , the poster on the wall would have shown a positive trend .
Would that have been proof of global warming ?
No .
Only by amalgamating all of the records we have ( after correcting for known problems , such as discussed below ) can we have an idea what the regional , hemispheric or global means are doing .
That is what is meant by global warming .
Crichton next raises the apparently unrecognised ( by the lawyer character at least ) fact that the interior of Antarctica is cooling ( p196 ) , an issue discussed in another post ( Antarctica cooling , global warming ? ) .
This is more or less correct ( given the obvious uncertainties in long term data from the continental interior ) , but analogously to the example above , local cooling does not contradict global warming .
Next , and slightly more troubling , we have some rather misleading and selective recollection regarding Jim Hansen ’s testimony to congress in 1988 .
“ Dr. Hansen overestimated [ global warming ] by 300 percent ” ( p247 ) .
Hansen ’s testimony did indeed lead to a big increase in awareness of global warming as a issue , but not because he exaggerated the problem by 300 % .
In a paper published soon after that testimony , Hansen et al , 1988 presented three model simulations for different scenarios for the growth in trace gases and other forcings ( see figure ) .
Scenario
A had exponentially increasing CO 2 , Scenario B had a more modest Business - as - usual assumption , and Scenario C had no further increases in CO 2 after the year 2000 .
Both scenarios B and C assumed a large volcanic eruption in 1995 .
Rightly , the authors did not assume that they knew what path the carbon dioxide emissions would take , and so presented a spectrum of results .
The scenario that ended up being closest to the real path of forcings growth was scenario B , with the difference that Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991 , not 1995 .
The temperature change for the decade under this scenario was very close to the actual 0.11 C / decade observed ( as can be seen in the figure ) .
So given a good estimate of the forcings , the model did a reasonable job .
In fact in his testimony , Hansen ONLY showed results from scenario B , and stated clearly that it was the most probable scenario .
The ‘ 300 percent ’ error claim comes from noted climate skeptic Patrick Michaels who in testimony in congress in 1998 deleted the bottom two curves in order to give the impression that the models were unreliable .
Dr Hansen is further quoted ( a little out - of - context ) saying : “ The forcings that drive long term climate change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change ” .
Given the discussion above it is clear that without good estimates of the actual forcings , the differences in the model projections can be large .
It is widely accepted that exact prediction of what will happen to climate in 50 or 100 years is impossible .
Much of the future is of course unknowable .
A new energy source could replace fossil fuels , governments could control emissions , or maybe a series of huge volcanoes will erupt .
Therefore it is much more sensible to ask , what would climate be like if you doubled CO 2 ?
or if this or that scenario occurred .
These are much better defined questions .
Hansen ’s quote is often taken to imply that models are so unreliable they are useless in helping assess the issue .
In fact it is the opposite – Hansen is actually claiming that the uncertainty in models ( for instance , in the climate sensitivity ) is now less than the uncertainty in the emissions scenarios ( i.e. it is the uncertainty in the forcings , that drives the uncertainty in the projections ) .
Continuing to p315 , it is claimed that “ in the 1970 ’s all the climate scientists believed an ice age was coming ” ( and , as described on p563 , the MIT academic apparently still thinks so ) .
However , this is not an accurate statement and William Connolley ’s pages on the subject are an illuminating read for those wanting more details .
Another issue that often comes up in discussion about the surface temperature record is the impact of the Urban Heat Island Effect ( UHIE ) , and here it appears on p370 .
It is undisputed that the centres of cities such as New York are significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside .
This issue has been extensively studied and is corrected for in all analyses of the global temperature trends .
To see whether there might still be a residual effect in the corrected data , a recent paper ( Parker , Nature , 2004 ) looked at the differences in the trends if you looked separately at windy and not - so - windy conditions .
Wind is known to diminish the impact of urban heating , and so the trends on windy days should be less than trends on still days if this was important .
The trends actually end up almost exactly the same .
Other validating data for the corrected surface temperature record comes from the oceans , which have also been warming in recent decades .
Even Richard Lindzen , normally an arch - skeptic on these issues , stated that “ ocean temperature increases present some support for the surface temperature record ” Lindzen ( 2002 ) .
Another demonstration that the corrections are sufficient is that over the continental US , where many cities have a clear urban heating signal , the mean of the corrected data is actually rather flat ( p88 ) – i.e. none of the strong urban biases in the US has made it into the regional or indeed global mean .
A central issue in the book concerns sea - level rise .
Vanuatu is singled out for special attention since the islanders there are understandably concerned about their low - lying islands eventually being swamped .
Sea level however is a surprisingly difficult thing to measure .
Tide gauges are very noisy , and are usually located on the continental coast .
Global trends in sea level from these gauges are between 1.7 to 2.4 mm / yr .
Sea level though is not rising everywhere .
In Scandinavia the continents are still rebounding from the ice age and local sea level is receding .
Satellite data ( TOPEX / POSEIDON and JASON ) can give a global picture , and indicate that although the global mean rise over recent years ( 2.8 mm / yr ) is significantly larger than the longer term trend estimated from tide gauges , sea level change is actually very dynamic .
There are many patterns of behaviour particularly in the Pacific , associated with El Nino variability – possibly related to Vanuatu ’s lack of actual sea level rise over the last 40 years .
Curiously , Crichton cites the higher satellite derived number to claim that the rate of sea level rise has not increased recently ( “ [ Sea level is ] rising faster , Satellites prove it ” , ” Actually they do n’t ” ) , p424 .
There are clearly some problems in comparing tide gauge and satellite data , and of course , satellites can have their problems ( cf. MSU data ) , but the quoted numbers do n’t support the actual statement at all – though it would be fairer to say that the satellites are consistent with a recent rise in the rate , rather than a proof that it is occurring .
There are only a few out - and - out errors , but to be generous , they probably just slipped through the editing process .
For instance , on p187 “ higher temperature means more water vapor in the air and therefore fewer clouds ” – Presumably , he meant that if the temperature is higher , the relatively humidity could be lower ( and so there might be less clouds ) .
On p368 .
“ Croplands are warmer than forested lands ” .
This is probably a confusion with the urban heating issue , but the actual impact is the opposite – croplands have a higher albedo than forests , reflect more solar radiation , and are thus cooler .
In fact , while this is not yet fully quantified , it appears to have been a significant cooling term in the global budget over the last 150 years .
On p461 “ … Greenland shows that , in the last hundred thousand years , there have been four abrupt climate change events ”
More like 40 .
And that is probably an undercount given that Greenland may not record events in the tropics .
At the end of the book , Crichton gives us an author ’s message .
In it , he re-iterates the main points of his thesis , that there are some who go too far to drum up support ( and I have some sympathy with this ) , and that because we do n’t know everything , we actually know nothing ( here , I beg to differ ) .
He also gives us his estimate , ~0.8 C for the global warming that will occur over the next century and claims that , since models differ by 400 % in their estimates , his guess is as good as theirs .
This is not true .
The current batch of models have a mean climate sensitivity of about 3 C to doubled CO 2 ( and range between 2.5 and 4.0 degrees ) ( Paris meeting of IPCC , July 2004 ) , i.e an uncertainty of about 30 % .
As discussed above , the biggest uncertainties about the future are the economics , technology and rate of development going forward .
The main cause of the spread in the widely quoted 1.5 to 5.8 C range of temperature projections for 2100 in IPCC is actually the different scenarios used .
For lack of better information , if we ( incorrectly ) assume all the scenarios are equally probable , the error around the mean of 3.6 degrees is about 60 % , not 400 % .
Crichton also suggests that most of his 0.8 C warming will be due to land use changes .
That is actually extremely unlikely since land use change globally is a cooling effect ( as discussed above ) .
Physically - based simulations are actually better than just guessing .
Finally , in an appendix , Crichton uses a rather curious train of logic to compare global warming to the 19th Century eugenics movement .
He argues , that since eugenics was studied in prestigious universities and supported by charitable foundations , and now , so is global warming , they must somehow be related .
Presumably , the author does n’t actually believe that foundation - supported academic research ipso facto is evil and mis-guided , but that is an impression that is left .
In summary , I am a little disappointed , not least because while researching this book , Crichton actually visited our lab and discussed some of these issues with me and a few of my colleagues .
I guess we did n’t do a very good job .
Judging from his reading list , the rather dry prose of the IPCC reports did not match up to the some of the racier contrarian texts .
Had RealClimate been up and running a few years back , maybe it would ’ve all worked out differently …
Update : Due to popular demand here is an updated version of the figure that was originally made in 1998 .

Iran has some of the world 's highest execution rates
Stoning to death is a " horrific practice , designed to increase the suffering " of those condemned , the UK - based rights group says in a report .
Three people are said to have been stoned for adultery , a crime in Iran , since 2002 , despite a moratorium .
The majority sentenced to death by stoning are women , Amnesty says .
Campaigners against the death penalty say execution by stoning is particularly harsh - Iran 's penal code stipulates the stones used must be large enough to cause the condemned pain , but not sufficient to kill immediately .
Execution by stoning is a grotesque and unacceptable penalty which the Iranian authorities should abolish immediately
Kate Allen ,
Amnesty director
Amnesty 's statement highlights the case of condemned woman Mokarrameh Ebrahimi .
The father of her children , both of whom were born outside wedlock , was stoned to death in July 2007 .
Jafar Kiani was executed despite , five years earlier , the head of Iran 's judiciary reportedly issuing a moratorium on executions by stoning .
Amnesty says Ms Ebrahimi and eight other women and two men face a similar fate to Mr Kiani .
' Unfair trials '
The majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women , who suffer disproportionately from such punishment , Amnesty says .
It says they are not treated equally before the law and are particularly vulnerable to unfair trials because they are more likely to be illiterate and therefore sign confessions to crimes they did not commit .
One of the eight women currently facing execution was allegedly forced into prostitution by an abusive husband who was a heroin addict , Amnesty says .
She was sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment for being an accomplice to the murder of her husband - by one of her clients - and to death by stoning for adultery .
" Execution by stoning is a grotesque and unacceptable penalty which the Iranian authorities should abolish immediately , " Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said .
She also urged an end to the practice of executing anyone for committing adultery .
Amnesty says anti-stoning campaigners in Iran have managed to save some potential victims but they face harassment by the police and arrest for public order and security offences .
According to the law , men are buried up to their waists and women up to their breasts before being pelted with stones until they die .
Iran applies a strict interpretation of Islamic law .
Although stoning is not prescribed in the Koran , some scholars say it is in the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad .
Dec. 21 , 2017 11:28 A.M. EDT ( 16:28 UTC ) , marks the solstice — the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere
by Ann - Marie Imbornoni
In astronomy , the solstice is either of the two times a year when the Sun is at its greatest distance from the celestial equator , the great circle on the celestial sphere that is on the same plane as the earth 's equator .
In the Northern Hemisphere , the winter solstice occurs either December 21 or 22 , when the sun shines directly over the tropic of Capricorn ; the summer solstice occurs either June 20 or 21 , when the sun shines directly over the tropic of Cancer .
In the Southern Hemisphere , the winter and summer solstices are reversed .
Reason for the Seasons
The reason for the different seasons at opposite times of the year in the two hemispheres is that while the earth rotates about the sun , it also spins on its axis , which is tilted some 23.5 degrees towards the plane of its rotation .
Because of this tilt , the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight ( creating winter ) while the Southern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight ( creating summer ) .
As the Earth continues its orbit the hemisphere that is angled closest to the sun changes and the seasons are reversed .
Longest Night of the Year
The winter solstice marks the shortest day and the longest night of the year .
The sun appears at its lowest point in the sky , and its noontime elevation appears to be the same for several days before and after the solstice .
Hence the origin of the word solstice , which comes from Latin solstitium , from sol , " sun " and - stitium , " a stoppage . "
Following the winter solstice , the days begin to grow longer and the nights shorter .

In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre , many Americans have been campaigning for permission to carry guns in more places , even churches and schools .
Suzanna 's parents were killed by a gunman in a US diner in 1991
" Imagine you are in a restaurant and a mad man is walking around from table to table , pointing a gun , taking aim and pulling the trigger , going to the next person , taking aim , pulling the trigger and so on , " says Suzanna Hupp .
" Even if you have chosen not to have a gun with you - do n't you hope the guy behind you has one ?
Just imagine that . "
But Suzanna
Hupp does not have to imagine .
It was October 1991 when a gunman entered the diner where Suzanna , a Texan chiropractor , was having lunch with her parents .
The man methodically executed 23 people including Suzanna 's parents .
Suzanna had a gun .
But since Texan state law at the time banned people from carrying guns in public places , she had left it in her car .
Nobody could have stopped the first couple of murders but it sure would n't have been a body bag of 32
Suzanna Hupp
" I was angry at my legislators because they had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family . "
The massacre was , until Virginia Tech , the largest mass shooting by a single gunman in the US .
Now , in the wake of that tragedy , Suzanna is one of a growing body of Americans campaigning for the availability of more , rather than fewer , guns .
" Nobody could have stopped that guy from the first couple of murders but it sure would n't have been a body bag total of 32 , " she says .
Gun sales
Saxet Gun
Show is one of Austin 's largest gun conventions
At a huge convention centre in the southern suburbs of Austin , Judith Baker of A Texas Girl 's Guns firearm sales company was talking a young woman through the safety features on her new handgun .
" Gun sales have gone up since Virginia Tech .
Not just my own sales but many dealers and distributors have also increased their gun sales , " she says .
" And we are not just talking men here but I am seeing a lot more women wanting to get their concealed handgun licence .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Nothing will stop the killing until America changes its attitude to the gun
John , Manchester
Send us your comments
Some 48 states in the US issue licences to allow the carrying of concealed weapons to those who pass a background check .
But states vary in their restrictions .
Thirty eight states , including Virginia , ban weapons at schools .
In Texas , certain places like churches , courthouses and schools , are designated " gun-free zones " .
It is an exception that Texas governor Rick Perry recently challenged with the wholehearted endorsement of campaigners like Suzanna Hupp .
" It is my fervent belief that when legislators create a list of places where people can't carry guns , what they have actually done is create a shopping list for a mad man , " he said .
Guns in classes
Andrew Sugg is a student of aviation science at Baylor University at Waco and a member of the newly formed national body Students for Concealed Carry on Campus .
He is spearheading a campaign for students to be allowed to carry concealed firearms into the classroom .
PROGRAMME INFORMATION BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents was broadcast on Thursday , 5 July at 1102 BST
Listen to the programme
" Now , when I walk into my own class , I have to think : ' Where do I want to sit so I can make a quick getaway ? '
" I look at my book bag and think : ' What can I throw at someone who comes through the door ?
What could I do to stall him and let everybody get away or what can I do to stop him from doing this ? '. "
It is a mindset that is of considerable worry to the campus police force .
Lethal combination ?
Baylor University has a dedicated force of 24 police officers who are trained and drilled to respond to a firearms attack such as that at Virginia Tech .
Its chief , James Doak , said that the potential for strife is considerable among its 14,000 18 - to - 22 years - olds - whether it is stress of exams , girlfriend problems or simply hot tempers .
Add guns to the equation and the combination could be lethal .
" We can not rely on students who have not been drilled in these situations to respond properly .
Would they freeze up ?
Would they have a sense of terror in their hearts so they respond inappropriately ? " he says .
" Our officers have a level of life experience which students can't possibly have at the age of 21 or 22 . "
But like many other Americans , Mr Sugg points to the Second Amendment , the right to keep and bear arms , as a fundamental justification for his position .
" Guns are to me a freedom , that is what won us our freedom during the revolutionary war and we 've had them ever since , " he says .

Turbines in the Thames UK to Expand Offshore Wind Power
Britain 's business secretary announced Monday that the United Kingdom is poised to make a major investment in offshore wind farms .
Hundreds of new turbines would generate over 30 megawatts of clean electricity annually -- enough to light every home in Britain .
A radio antenna made of electrified gas could lead to stealthy , jamming - resistant transmitters , research now reveals .
Electrified gas , or plasma , makes up stars and lightning and is what sheds light in fluorescent bulbs .
Sealed glass , ceramic or even flexible plastic tubes of plasma can behave just like conventional metal antennas .
Scientists are now developing remarkably simple and rugged plasma antenna prototypes that could soon find use in the military or telecommunications .
These antennas only work when energized , effectively vanishing when turned off , with the plasma reverting back to normal gas .
This is key for stealth on the battlefield — metal antennas can scatter incoming radar signals , giving away their presence .
In addition , to counteract jamming attempts , plasma antennas can rapidly adjust which frequencies they broadcast and pick up by changing how much energy the plasma is given .
This way , they avoid interference from enemy signals .
Metal antennas , on the other hand , are each forced to receive and transmit only a given range of frequencies , making them vulnerable to jamming .
The fact that plasma antennas can get reconfigured to broadcast and receive a wide range of frequencies also means " you can create a kind of ' all - in - one ' antenna , with one plasma antenna performing the jobs of several metal antennas , " researcher Theodore Anderson , CEO of plasma antenna company Haleakala R&D in Brookfield , Mass . , told LiveScience .
" We 're pursuing telecommunications as well as military applications . "
These plasma antennas use inert noble gases such as neon , and do not get very hot when turned on .
Anderson and his colleagues are currently experimenting with plasma in glass tubes , but to make them more rugged , they plan in the future to use ceramic tubes encased in heat - resistant synthetic foam " almost as hard as steel , " he said .
The scientists are currently developing a " smart " plasma antenna that can steer a beam of radio waves 360 degrees to scan a region and then find and lock onto transmitting antennas .
A comparable radio array using metal antennas would be much larger and heavier , Anderson said .
The scientists plan to complete their commercial prototype by the end of November 2008 .
The researchers detailed their findings Nov. 12 at the American Physical Society 's plasma physics division meeting in Orlando .
Budget bills contain $ 20 billion in pork
It looks like Congress wo n’t even come close to giving up those irresistible earmarks .
Citizens Against Government Waste , which closely monitors federal spending , is putting the finishing touches on its tally of pork projects in the pending spending bills — and the picture is n’t pretty .
The group estimates that there will be at least 8,000 earmarks this year , costing U.S. taxpayers , $ 18 billion to $ 20 billion .
Democrats and Republicans alike had promised to curtail the practice of directing money to specific projects .
They have , but not nearly as dramatically as their campaign rhetoric had suggested .
In the last fiscal year , when Republicans controlled Congress , there were $ 29 billion in total earmarks .
So Democrats can rightly claim they are reducing the practice , perhaps by as much as 33 percent , as Congress Daily ’s Keith Koffler reported this afternoon .
Republicans will rightly claim they have put intense pressure on the Democratic Congress to eliminate many earmarks .
Of course , the GOP argument is undercut by the explosion of earmarking when they ruled Congress .
Koffler , who got an early look at the figures , reported that Defense bill was a huge magnet for earmarks .
It included 2,074 projects , totally $ 6.6 billion .
Citizens Against Government Waste is basing its overall projections on a detailed examination of three spending bills , and applying the trend to the remaining appropriations bills .

Trotskyism or Leninism
By Harpal Brar
Preface
One of the myths perpetrated by Trotskyites , with not inconsiderable help from the imperialist bourgeoisie , is that Leninism and Trotskyism are synonymous ; that Trotsky was , after Lenin , the most brilliant and greatest Bolshevik ( some even implying that Lenin was a great Trotskyist ) ; that Trotsky was the true inheritor of Leninism , and a worthy successor to Lenin , but was , alas , deprived of his rightful place by the cunning manoeuvres of a third - class mediocrity and oriental despot to boot , i.e. , Joseph Stalin .
This anti-communist myth , repeated ad nauseam decade after decade in truly Goebbels fashion , not only in Trotskyite publications but also in classrooms by petty - bourgeois professors and teachers of history and sociology , not to mention the imperialist press and electronic media , this myth has acquired the force of a public prejudice .
This prejudice is the product of deliberate distortion and falsification by Trotskyism and its bourgeois allies , of Marxism - Leninism , of deliberate inventions , deceptions , innuendoes , omissions and their tendentious interpretations of the history of the Great October Revolution and the revolutionary practice and role of the USSR , on the one hand , and the ignorance of those on whom these deceptions , distortions and downright falsifications are practised , on the other hand .
Anyone who has made some study , let alone a deep study , of the subject cannot but be aware of the total falsity of this myth .
It is the aim of this book to expose this myth and lay bare the truly reactionary , counter - revolutionary , essence of the petty - bourgeois ideology of Trotskyism , which is as irreconcilably hostile to Marxism - Leninism as is the bourgeoisie to the proletariat – notwithstanding its pseudo - Marxist , ultra - ' left ' and ultra -' revolutionary ' terminology .
The task I set myself in this book is to show that Leninism and Trotskyism are mutually exclusive ; that Trotskyism is irreconcilably opposed to Leninism ; that those claiming to be Marxist - Leninists are duty bound , in the interests of the proletariat , to wage a ruthless and uncompromising struggle against Trotskyism ; that they have to bury Trotskyism , as an ideological trend in the working - class movement .
Further , I seek to demonstrate that after the death of Lenin in January 1924 , as Leninism was upheld by the Bolshevik Party , now under the leadership of Stalin , Trotskyism continued its ceaseless onslaught on Leninism , with some tactical adjustments to the form of its attack .
It now attacked Leninism and the Party 's Leninist policy under the guise of attacking ' Stalinism ' in the name of Leninism .
For all that , Trotskyism continued its counter - revolutionary struggle against revolutionary Leninism , albeit without overtly and specifically naming Lenin as its target .
Be it - said to the honour of the Bolshevik Party and to its leader , Stalin , Trotskyism was dealt blows equally as shattering as those delivered against it during Lenin 's lifetime , causing it to suffer ignominious defeat .
In particular I seek to emphasise three specific features of Trotskyism – features which bring it into irreconcilable contradiction with Leninism .
Three specific features of Trotskyism
1. ' Permanent revolution '
Trotskyism stands for the theory of ' permanent ' revolution , failing to take into account the vast mass of the poor peasantry as a revolutionary force and reliable ally of the proletariat .
As Lenin rightly pointed out , Trotsky 's ' Permanent ' revolution is tantamount to ' skipping ' the peasant movement and " playing at the seizure of power . "
Any attempt at such a revolution as was advocated by Trotsky would have ended in certain failure , for it would have denied the Russian proletariat the support of its most dependable ally , the poor peasantry .
Only this explains Leninism 's unrelenting struggle against Trotskyism from 1905 onwards .
For its part Trotskyism regarded Leninism as a theory possessing " antirevolutionary features " for no better reason that at the proper time Leninism correctly advocated and upheld the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry .
Going far beyond this indignant opinion , Trotskyism asserts :
" The entire edifice of Leninism at the present time is built on lies and falsification and bears within itself the poisonous elements of its own decay . "
( Trotsky 's letter to Chkeidze , 1913 ) .
Leninism , on the other hand , asserts :
" Trotsky has never yet held a firm opinion on any important question of Marxism .
He always contrives to worm his way into the cracks of any given difference of opinion , and desert one side for the other .
At the present moment he is in the company of the Bundists and the liquidators .
And these gentlemen do not stand on ceremony where the Party is concerned " ( Lenin , Collected Works , Vol. 20 p. 448 , 1914 ) .
2. Distrust of Leninism in matters of organisation
Trotskyism stands for the distrust of Leninism , of Bolshevism , in matters of organisation .
Whereas Bolshevism stands for the principle of a revolutionary proletarian party of a new type , a disciplined and monolithic Party , hostile to opportunist elements , Trotskyism stands for the co-existence of revolutionaries and opportunists and for the formation of groups , factions and coteries within a single Party .
Anyone who is at all aware of the history of Trotsky 's notorious August Bloc , in which the Martovites and Otzovists , ( 1 ) the Liquidators ( 2 ) and Trotskyites happily co-operated in their struggle against Bolshevism , cannot have failed to notice this liquidationist feature of Trotskyism .
Thus , during this crucial historical period , whereas Leninism regarded the destruction of the August Bloc as a precondition for the development of the proletarian party , Trotskyism regarded the liquidationist August Bloc as the basis for building a ' real ' party .
Throughout this entire period – from 1903 to 1917 – Lenin again and again denounced Trotsky for his " careerism " , " Menshevism " , " conciliationism " and " liquidationism . "
Here are a few samples chosen at random from scores of Lenin 's writings in the same vein :
In a letter to Zinoviev dated 24 August 1909 , Lenin writes : Trotsky behaves like a despicable careerist and factionalist of the Ryazanov - and - co type .
Either equality on the editorial board , subordination to the central committee and no one 's transfer to Paris except Trotsky 's ( the scoundrel , he wants to ' fix up ' the whole rascally crew of ' Pravda ' at our expense ! ) – or a break with this swindler and an exposure of him in the CO .
He pays lip - service to the Party and behaves worse than any other of the factionalists . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 34 , p. 400 ) .
When Lenin was waging a life and death struggle to purge the Party of liquidators and otzovists , Trotsky , assuming the role of a conciliator , tried his worst to reconcile the Party with these two bourgeois trends .
This caused Lenin to denounce Trotsky in these terms :
" In the very first words of his resolution Trotsky expressed the full spirit of the worst kind of conciliation , ' conciliation ' in inverted commas , of a sectarian and philistine conciliation , which deals with ' given persons ' and not the given line of policy , the given spirit the given ideological and political content of Party work .
" It is in this that the enormous difference lies between real partyism ; which consists in purging the Party of liquidationism and otzovism , and the ' conciliation ' of Trotsky and Co. , which actually RENDERS THE MOST FAITHFUL SERVICE TO THE LIQUIDATORS AND OTZOVISTS , AND IS THEREFORE AN EVIL THAT IS ALL THE MORE DANGEROUS TO THE PARTY THE MORE CUNNINGLY , ARTFULLY AND RHETORICALLY IT CLOAKS ITSELF WITH PROFESSEDLY PRO - PARTY , PROFESSEDLY ANTI-FACTIONAL DECLAMATIONS .

In November 1910 , accusing Trotsky of following " in the wake of the Mensheviks , taking cover behind particularly ; sonorous phrases , " of " putting before the German comrades liberal views with a Marxist coating . " of being a master of " resonant but empty phrases , " of failing to understand and ignoring the " economic content of the Russian revolution , " and thereby depriving himself " of the possibility of understanding the historical meaning of the inner - Party struggle in Russia , " Lenin goes on to state :
" The struggle between Bolshevism and Menshevism is ... a struggle over the question whether to support the liberals or to overthrow the hegemony of the liberals over the peasantry .
Therefore to attribute [ as did Trotsky ] our splits to the influence of the intelligentsia , to the immaturity of the proletariat , etc , is a childishly naive repetition of liberal fairy - tales . "
Adding : " Trotsky distorts Bolshevism , because he has never been able to form any definite views on the role of the proletariat in the Russian bourgeois revolution . "
Countering Trotsky 's lies and falsifications in the German Social - Democratic press and accusing Trotsky of following a policy of " advertisement " of " shamelessness in belittling the Party and exalting himself before the Germans , " Lenin concludes :
" Therefore , when Trotsky tells the German comrades that he represents the ' general Party tendency " I am obliged to declare that Trotsky represents only his own faction and enjoys a certain amount of confidence exclusively among the otzovists and the liquidators . "
( The Historical Meaning of the Inner - Party Struggle in Russia , Collected Works , Vol. 16 pp. 374-392 ) .
When Trotsky 's Vienna Club , stepping up its activities , passed a resolution in November 1910 to organise a ' general Party fund for the purpose of preparing and convening a conference of the RSDLP " , Lenin characterised this as a " direct step towards a split ... a clear violation of Party legality and the start of an adventure in which Trotsky will come to grief . "
Continues Lenin :
" It is an adventure in the ideological sense .
Trotsky groups all the enemies of Marxism , he unites Potresov and Maximov , who detest the ' Lenin - Plekhanov ' bloc , as they like to call it .
TROTSKY UNITES ALL THOSE TO WHOM IDEOLOGICAL DECAY IS DEAR ; ALL WHO ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DEFENCE OF MARXISM , all philistines who do not understand the reasons for the struggle and who do not wish to learn , think and discover the ideological roots of the divergence of views .
At this time of confusion , disintegration , and wavering it is easy for Trotsky to become the ' hero of the hour ' and gather all the shabby elements around himself .
The more openly this attempt is made , the more spectacular will be the defeat . "
( Emphasis added ) .
Lenin ends this letter by calling , inter alia , for " struggle against the splitting tactics and the unprincipled adventurism of Trotsky . "
( Letter to the Russian Collegium of the Central Committee of the RSDLP , Collected Works , Vol. 17 , pp. 17 - 22 – December 1910 ) .
In December 1911 , being sick and tired of Trotsky 's dirty work as an attorney and diplomat for the liquidators and otzovists , Lenin , exposing Trotsky 's factionalism , wrote :
" It is impossible to argue with Trotsky on the merits of the issue , because Trotsky holds no views whatever .
We can and should argue with confirmed liquidators and otzovists , but it is no use arguing with a man whose game is to hide the errors of both these trends ; in his case the thing to do is to expose him as a diplomat of the smallest calibre . "
( Trotsky 's Diplomacy and a Certain Party Platform , Collected Works , Vol. 17 pp. 360362 ) .
In July 1912 , in a letter to the editor of Pravda , the daily legal Bolshevik paper printed in Petersburg from 5 May 1912 , Lenin advises the editor not to reply to Trotsky 's " disruptive and slanderous letters , " adding :
" Trotsky 's dirty campaign against Pravda is one mass of lies and slander ...
This intriguer and liquidator goes on lying right and left . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 35 , pp. 40 - 41 ) .
In The Break - up of the ' August ' Bloc ( March 1914 ) , Lenin writes :
" Trotsky , however , has never had any ' physiognomy ' at all ; the only thing he does have is a habit of changing sides , of skipping from the liberals to the Marxists and back again , of mouthing scraps of catchwords and bombastic parrot phrases . "
And : " Actually under the cover of high - sounding , empty and obscure phrases that confuse the non-class - conscious workers , Trotsky is defending the liquidators by passing over in silence the question of the ' underground ' by asserting that there is no liberal labour policy in Russia , and the like .
" ... Unity means rallying the majority of the workers in Russia about decisions which have long been known , and which condemn liquidationism ...
" But the liquidators and Trotsky , ... who tore up their own August bloc , who flouted all the decisions of the Party and dissociated themselves from the ' underground ' as well as from the organised workers , are the worst splitters .
Fortunately , the workers have already realised this , and all class - conscious workers are creating their own real unity against the liquidator disrupters of unity . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 20 pp. 158-161 ) .
In his article Disruption of unity under cover of outcries for unity , written in June 1914 , Lenin denounces Trotsky for his factionalism and liquidationism and exposes the utter falsity of the charge of splittism hurled by Trotsky and the liquidators at the Bolsheviks .
Writing in his allegedly nonfactional journal , Borba , Trotsky , having accused the Bolsheviks of splittism for the sole reason that they exposed and opposed liquidationism , goes on to admit that the Bolshevik " splittist tactics are winning one suicidal victory after another . "
This said , Trotsky adds :
" Numerous advanced workers , in a state of utter political bewilderment themselves often become active agents of a split . "
Here is Lenin 's retort to this accusation and ' explanation ' :
" Needless to say , this explanation is highly flattering , to Trotsky ... and to the liquidators …
Trotsky is very fond of using with the learned air of the expert pompous and high - sounding phrases to explain historical phenomena in a way that is flattering to Trotsky .
Since ' numerous advanced workers ' become ' active agents ' of apolitical and Party line [ Bolshevik Party line ] which does not conform to Trotsky 's line , Trotsky settles the question unhesitatingly , out of hand these advanced workers are ' in a state of utter political bewilderment ' , whereas he , Trotsky , is evidently ' in a state ' of political firmness and clarity , and keeps to the right line !...
And this very same Trotsky , beating his breast , fulminates against factionalism parochialism , and the efforts of the intellectuals to impose their will on the workers !
" Reading things like these , one cannot help asking oneself .
– is it from a lunatic asylum that such voices come ? "
( Collected Works , Vol. 20 pp. 327-347 ) .
Continues Lenin : " The reason why Trotsky avoids facts and concrete references is because they relentlessly refute all his angry outcries and pompous phrases .
It is very easy , of course , to strike an attitude and say : ' a crude and sectarian travesty . '
Or to add a still more stinging and pompous catchphrase , such as ' emancipation from conservative factionalism . '
" But is this not very cheap ?
Is not this weapon borrowed from the arsenal of the period when Trotsky posed in all his splendour before audiences of high - school boys ? " ( ibid . )
Lenin concludes his article with a brilliant description of Trotsky 's wavering and vacillation between the Party and the liquidators , calling him a " Tushino turncoat " appearing before the Party with incredibly pretentious claims , unwilling absolutely to reckon with either the Party decisions , which since 1908 have defined and established our attitude towards liquidationism , or with the experience of the present - day movement in Russia , which has actually brought about the unity of the majority on the basis of full recognition of the aforesaid decisions . " ( ibid . )
This brilliant description appears in the main body of this work and is , therefore , excluded from the preface .
About the same time – early 1914 – Trotsky , writing in issue no .
2 of his journal Borba falsely attributed to the " Polish Marxists " – not just Rosa Luxemburg – the position according to which the right to national self - determination " is entirely devoid of political content and should be deleted from the programme . "
This falsehood drew from Lenin the following observation :
" The obliging Trotsky is more dangerous than an enemy !
Trotsky could produce no proof except ' private conversations ' ( i.e. , simply gossip , on which Trotsky always subsists ) , classifying the ' Polish Marxists ' in general as supporters of every article by Rosa Luxemburg ...
" Trotsky has never yet held a firm opinion on any important question of Marxism .
He always contrives to worm his way into the cracks of any given difference of opinion , and desert one side for the other .
At the present moment he is in the company of the Bundists and the liquidators .
And thee gentlemen do not stand on ceremony where the Party is concerned . "
( The Right of Nations to Self - Determination , Collected Works , Vol. 20 p. 447-8 ) .
In his letter to Henriette Roland - Hoist , dated 8 March 1916 , Lenin asks :
" What are our differences with Trotsky ? "
To this question he gives the following answer :
" In brief – he is a Kautskyite , that is , he stands for unity with the Kautskyites in the International and with Chkheidze 's parliamentary group in Russia .
We are absolutely against such unity ... " ( Collected Works , Vol. 43 , pp. 515-516 ) .
Writing to Alexandra Kollontai on 17 February , 1917 , Lenin says :
" ... What a swine this Trotsky is – Left , phrases , and a bloc with the Right against the Zimmerwald Left !!
He ought to be exposed ( by you ) if only in a brief letter to Sotsial - Demokrat ! "
( Collected Works , Vol. 35 , p. 285 ) .
Finally , in this letter of 19 Feb , 1917 , to Inessa Armand , Lenin writes , inter alia :
" There is also a letter from Kollontai who ... has returned to Norway from America .
N. Iv. and Pavlov ... had won Novy Mir , she says , ... but ...
Trotsky arrived , and this scoundrel at once ganged up with the Right wing of Novy Mir against the Left Zimmerwaldists !!
That 's it !!
That 's Trotsky for you !!
Always true to himself , twists , swindles , poses as a Left , helps the Right , so long as he can ...
" ( Collected Works , Vol. 35 , p. 288 ) .
In the light of the foregoing historic evidence , of the most impeccable and irrefutable kind , it can safely be asserted that Trotsky was during this long period – between 1903 and 1917 – a Menshevik and a liquidator who waged a most dirty and factional campaign against the Bolsheviks ' attempts to build a revolutionary Party of the proletariat .
Although people with knowledge about the history of the Bolshevik Party know only too well that from 1903 to August 1917 Trotsky was a Menshevik and a liquidator , Trotskyites generally maintain a studied silence over this question or , worse still , they try and excuse him on this account .
It is , therefore , very refreshing to discover some ardent Trotskyites who condemn Trotsky 's Menshevism , centrism , conciliationism and factionalism .
In this category fall the Trotskyites of the International Communist League ( ICL ) of the so - called Fourth International ( the official Fourth International , of course , since each of the milliard Trotskyist organisations claims to be the official Fourth International and describes every other Trotskyist organisation as a fake – a hilarious phenomenon reminiscent of the Life of Brian ) .
The ICL publish the theoretical journal Spartacist .
The occasion for their frank admission and condemnation of Trotsky 's Menshevism was the review , in Spartacist numbers 45 and 46 , Winter 1990 - 91 , English edition , by a certain ICL member , Daniel Dauget , of a biography of Leon Trotsky published in 1988 by Pierre Broué .
Pierre Broué was a Professor at the Institute of Political Studies of Grenoble University who had been for 40 years a member of " the ostensibly Trotskyist Lambertist tendency in France " ( ICL 's description in the said review ) , i.e. , of the Parti Communiste Internationale ( PCI ) .
Broué praises Trotsky for being a " freelancer " – praise winch rouses the ICL to indignation and downright outrage .
So as not to lose the full force of ICL 's fluent prose , the full burning anger and shame , and the thrust of their argument , and so as not to be accused of quoting them out of context , we reproduce here almost the entire section of the review that was concerned with Trotsky 's factionalism and Menshevism between 1903 and 1917
Trotsky as " Freelancer "
" Broué 's treatment of Trotsky 's political activity between the decisive 1903 Bolshevik - Menshevik split and the October Revolution is at the core of his interpretation ; because it is here that he deals with the debates within Russian Social Democracy over the nature , form and structure a revolutionary party must have if it is to take state power , as well as with the role of political and programmatic debate in forging such a party .
After the 1903 split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks , Trotsky became a sort of freelancer in the party .
" Broué praises Trotsky for this , seeing in it the cause for Trotsky 's leading role in the 1905 Revolution as chairman of the St Petersburg Soviet and his brilliant propagandist use of his trial following the 1905 defeat :
" ' In fact , effectively fired from any factional obligations , at a good distance from the up and downs of the conflicts between the two main factions , satisfied in this respect with his unitary ' position whose victory seemed to him assured in the future , Trotsky had his hands completely free to devote his attention and activity to the events that were unfolding in Russia ...' – Broué , p. 97 .
" To read this , one would conclude that Lenin 's factional struggle against Menshevism was irrelevant – if not outright counterposed – to intervening in and leading the revolutionary struggle .
Indeed , Broué views Trotsky 's role as the leading ' conciliator ' between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks as exemplary .
" Earlier , as Broué notes , ' Trotsky , partisan of centralization and of the authority of the Central Committee ever since he bad been deported to Siberia , was seen in the émigré circles as Lenin 's ' hatchet man ' , '
At the 1903 Congress Trotsky began a programmatic struggle against Lenin on the question of the party .
For example Trotsky opposed the sovereignty of the party congress : ' The Congress is a register , a controller , but not a creator ' ( Report of the Siberian Delegation , 1903 ) Although the programmatic implications were far from clear at the time , the 1903 split was a fundamental spilt on the party question Trotsky 's federalist position on this question was also reflected in ' Report of the Siberian Delegation ' with his rejection of the Bolshevik definition of a party member that required ' personal participation in one of the Party bodies . '
In practical terms Trotsky was in favour of the Menshevik definition of a party member as one who gave Personal assistance ' to the party – he wished to allow all the broad ' workers organisations ' which existed alongside the party committees in many major Russian cities , to act in the name of the party regardless of their adherence to the statutes or decisions of party congresses .
" At the same time that Broué enthuses over Trotsky 's independence , he mentions in passing that Trotsky was wrong on the party question during this entire period .
But what he says pales in comparison with Trotsky 's own judgement :
" ' The deep differences that divided me from Bolshevism for a whole number of years and in many cases placed me in sharp and hostile opposition to Bolshevism , Were expressed most graphically in relation to the Menshevik faction .
I began with the radically wrong perspective that the course of the revolution and the pressure of the proletarian masses would ultimately force both factions to follow the same road .
Therefore I considered a split to be an unnecessary " disruption of the revolutionary forces .
But because the active role in the split by with the Bolsheviks – since it was only by ruthless demarcation , not only ideological but organizational as well , that it was possible , in Lenin 's opinion , to assure the revolutionary character of the proletarian party ( and the entire subsequent history has fully confirmed the correctness of those policies ) – my ' conciliationism ' led me at many sharp turns in the road into hostile clashes with Bolshevism . '
– Trotsky , ' Our Differences ' ( Nov. 1924 ) .
" The traditional ' center ' and right wing of the Social Democracy were only too happy to use Trotsky 's name and journalistic brilliance as a left cover for their own positions and as a weapon against Lenin .
Thus Broué reports that ' Trotsky was on good terms with Kautsky and the 'center of the German Social Democracy until at least 1912 ...
It was Kautsky during this period who , to Lenin 's great anger , opened the pages of ' Die Neue Zeit ' and ' Vorwarts ' to Trotsky , Broué also details Trotsky 's warm relations with the Austro - Marxists of Vienna , noting that he rapidly became ' the uncontested head of the Social Democratic colony in Vienna ' from 1909 to 1912 .
He passes rapidly over the fact that during the same period Rosa Luxemburg viewed Trotsky with ' systematic suspicion ' and as a ' dubious individual ' , no doubt due to his ties to her right - wing opponents in the German Social Democracy .
" Broué 's attitude toward Trotsky during these years is exemplified by his treatment of the infamous August bloc .
The Vienna ' Pravda ' edited by Trotsky attempted to ' conciliate ' the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions - – Broué approvingly quotes the professional anti-communist Leonard Schapiro 's praise of the Vienna ' Pravda ' for not being as polemical as the Bolshevik press .
A 1910 agreement between the factions provided for Bolshevik financial support to the Vienna ' Pravda ' , with Kamenev ( who was close to Lenin and was Trotsky 's brother - in - law ) responsible for administering the Bolshevik funds
The agreement stipulated that the Mensheviks would get rid of their right wing , and the Bolsheviks of their left wing .
While the Bolsheviks respected the agreement , the Mensheviks did not , and in the subsequent polemics , Trotsky sided with the Mensheviks and got rid of Kamenev .
Trotsky 's articles , aimed at militants inside Russia who were unfamiliar with the details of the dispute , denounced the Bolsheviks as a ' conspiracy of the émigré clique . '
Kautsky solicited and published several articles by Trotsky attacking the Bolsheviks , which provoked angry rejoinders not just from Lenin , but also from Plekhanov and Rosa Luxemburg .
When the Bolshevik Prague Congress in 1912 proclaimed that it represented the party as a whole , Trotsky organised a unity ' counter - conference in Vienna in August .
" In Trotsky 's mind [ the conference ] was to have been the general unification , the reunification of the party .
In fact , the Bolsheviks ' rejection of it reduced the participants to a bloc against them , which they baptized the ' August bloc ' .
The Polish Social Democrats and Plekhanov also chose not to appear ...
In fact , Trotsky 's return to the factional arena proved particularly unfortunate .
Independent of his intentions , and even of his precautions , the positions he took after the Prague conference and his role in forming the August bloc made him appear , despite himself , as the soul of a general coalition against the Bolsheviks and an indirect supporter of the ' liquidators ' . '
– Broué , pp. 139-140 .
" Every qualifier in Broué 's description of Trotsky 's role in the August bloc is wrong or misleading .
As is clear from Trotsky 's denunciation of the Bolsheviks as an ' émigré clique ' , he was well aware that what Broué so delicately terms ' general unification ' , was a polemical cudgel with which to attack Lenin .
Trotsky did not just ' appear ' to be the soul of the anti-Bolshevik coalition , he was in fact that soul in that he was the most left - wing , most respected force outside the Bolsheviks .
Trotsky 's actions were not misconstrued ' despite himself , ' but were an accurate reflection of the role he played vis-à - vis the Bolsheviks in the entire period from 1903 to at least 1915 . "
" The outbreak of WWI and the betrayal by the parties of the Second International most of whose leaders supported their own ' governments in the bloody inter- imperialist war , shifted the grounds of dispute within the world socialist movement , forcing realignments and regroupments .
Lenin and Trotsky both fought against the imperialist war , and both attended the gathering of antiwar socialists held in Zimmerwald Switzerland in September 1915 . " ( pp. 33 -34 ) .
Be it noted in passing that the last sentence is either born out of dishonesty or simple ignorance – most likely the former – for everyone with the least knowledge about this matter knows that the Bolshevik slogan of working for the defeat of one 's own government in the imperialist war then raging was countered by Trotsky with his chauvinist slogan demanding ' Neither victory nor defeat ' .
Further , we have provided , quotations above from Lenin to the effect that during this period Trotsky was a Kautskyite and fought against the Zimmerwald left headed by Lenin 's Bolsheviks .
But that does not concern us here .
ICL continue :
" Broué argues that after Zimmerwald despite ' real disagreements ' between Lenin and Trotsky , there was 'a reasonable prospect for a gradual rapprochement between the two men who in reality were divided only [ sic ] by the 1903 split , which had long since been outdated . '
What Broué slides over is the fact that Lenin never repudiated the 1903 split – instead he generalized from it to a fully - formed theoretical position on the necessity for revolutionary cadres to organize a vanguard party , separate from reformist and centrist tendencies .
Trotsky was ultimately won to Lenin 's side on this question in 1917 .
" There is something anachronistic and evocative of the worst aspects of French political traditions in Broué 's repeated presentation of Trotsky as a simple star , freelancer , too busy being ' a leader of men ' and giving brilliant speeches before and after the Revolution to have been a ' party man ' or to have had the time to familiarize himself with [ the ] faction fights in the corridors ' .
Trotsky was a factionalist before 1917 – on the wrong side .
But his program of conciliationism could never have built the sort of hard faction that could win leadership in the party , nor the kind of Party that could take state power . " ( p. 34 ) .
Well said , Messrs the Trotskyites of the ICL !
We think any comment on ibis would be superfluous !
All this does not , however , prevent the Trotskyites of the ICL from asserting , without as much as a blush , that Trotsky , after the death of Lenin , was best placed " to carry forward the authentic Bolshevik programme against Stalin 's usurpers . "
Very strange logic indeed , according to which Trotsky , the Menshevik liquidator , who , spent two decades in a mortal struggle against every aspect of Leninism , was better suited to , carrying out the ' authentic '
Bolshevik programme than someone like Stalin who , had spent two and a half decades faithfully supporting and actually carrying out the Bolshevik programme .
Here is how ICL put it :
" In his admiration for Trotsky the left - Menshevik , Broué also never considers the potential authority that Trotsky would have gained and retained among stalwart Bolsheviks had he come over to Lenin 's side as a hard party man in 1903 – an authority that would have served him well in the subsequent period when he fought to carry forward the authentic Bolshevik programme against Stalin 's usurpers . "
( Ibid. p. 35 ) .
Pigs might fly !
The above statement of ICL amounts , if it amounts to anything at all , to a meaningless tautology , namely , had Trotsky been a staunch supporter of Leninism in the period 1903 - 17 , he would have been well placed to carry out the authentic Bolshevik programme after Lenin 's death .
The problem , however , is that he was not during this long period , nor was he in the subsequent period , a staunch supporter of Leninism .
The one who was a staunch Leninist , namely Joseph Stalin , was quite correctly chosen by the Bolshevik Party to lead it in carrying forward the authentic Bolshevik programme against the would - be usurper , to wit , Trotsky .
There is method in ICL 's madness .
They admit Trotsky 's pre-1917 Menshevism in order to present gullible , readers with a sanitised version of Trotsky who , it is claimed , suddenly saw the light and after 1917 became a better Bolshevik than anyone else .
" The fact is , " write the ICI , " that Broué ... agrees with Trotsky 's conciliationism before 1917 , and much prefers Trotsky the anti-Leninist to Trotsky the Bolshevik . "
Unlike Broué , in a vain attempt to gain credibility for Trotskyism , the ICL would rather make a clean admission of Trotsky 's pre-1917 Menshevism and anti-Leninism in order to be able all the more zealously to fasten the label of staunch Leninist on Trotsky 's lapel .
This trick will not work , however , for apart from the short period during October when he hid his anti-Leninist stock - in - trade in the cupboard , Trotsky continued to practise his anti-Leninism , his anti-Bolshevism , with a zeal worthy of a better cause .
It is not only the case that Broué , as is justly claimed by the ICI , " subtly puts Lenin under the gun " in order to gain the appreciation of the " anti- Leninist Soviet intelligentsia " ( these words were written in the winter of 1990 - 91 ) , but also the fact that the Trotskyites of the ICI , in common with all other Trotskyites , are attempting to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism , albeit by denouncing pre-1917 Trotskyism .
No subterfuges , no tricks , no artful dodging , no deception , can detract from this fact – not even the pretence of praising Leninism .
3. Distrust of Bolshevik leadership
Trotsky stands for the distrust of the leaders of Bolshevism , for discrediting and defaming them .
As Stalin correctly observed :
" I do not know of a single trend in the party that could compare with Trotskyism in the matter of discrediting the leaders of Leninism or the central institutions of the Party . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 6 , p. 366 ) .
In Trotsky 's letter to Chkeidze , already cited , Trotsky described Lenin as " a professional exploiter of every kind of backwardness in the Russian working - class movement . "
If Trotsky could express such ill - mannered views about Leninism , is there anything surprising in the fact that he showered , after Lenin 's death , even more vile abuse on Lenin 's most faithful pupil , Stalin .
How could Trotsky end up in Bolshevik ranks ?
How was it that Trotsky , having such an impeccably anti-Bolshevik and anti-Leninist record , found himself in the Bolshevik ranks in the period of the October revolution ?
Stalin , in a speech on 19 November 1924 , asked and answered this question :
" How could it happen that Trotsky , who carried such a nasty stock - in - trade on his back ; found himself , after all , in the rank of the Bolsheviks during the October movement ?
It happened because at that time Trotsky abandoned ( actually did abandon ) that stock - in - trade ; he hid it in the cupboard .
Had he not performed that ' operation ' , real co-operation with him would have been impossible .
The theory of the August bloc , i.e. , the theory of unity with the Mensheviks , had already been shattered and thrown overboard by the revolution , for how could there be any talk about unity when an armed struggle was raging between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks ?
Trotsky had no alternative but to admit that this theory was useless .
" The same misadventure ' happened ' to the theory of permanent revolution , for not a single Bolshevik contemplated the immediate seizure of power on the morrow of the February Revolution , and Trotsky could not help knowing that the Bolsheviks would not allow him , in the words of Lenin , ' to play at the seizure of power . '
Trotsky had no alternative but recognise the Bolsheviks ' policy of fighting for influence in the Soviets , of fighting to win over the peasantry
As regards the third specific feature of Trotskyism ( distrust of ( he Bolshevik leaders ) , it had naturally to retire into the background owing to the obvious failure of the first two features .
" Under the circumstances , could Trotsky do anything else but hide his stock - in - trade in the cupboard and follow the Bolshevik ; considering that he had no group of his own of any significance , and that he came to the Bolsheviks as a political individual without an army ?
Of course , he could not !
" What is the lesson to be learnt from this ?
Only one : that prolonged collaboration between the Leninists and Trotsky is possible only if the latter completely abandons his old stock - in - trade , only if he completely accepts Leninism .
Trotsky writes about the lessons of October , but he forgets ... the one I have just mentioned , which prime importance for Trotskyism .
Trotskyism ought to learn that lesson of October too . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 6 , pp. 366-367 ) .
Trotskyism , however , failed to learn this lesson , and its old stock - in - trade , hidden in the cupboard in the period of the October movement , was dragged into daylight once more , especially after the death of Lenin , through Trotskyist literary pronouncements aimed at undermining the Bolshevik Party principle , belittling and discrediting Lenin ( albeit under the guise of praising and exalting Lenin ) and asserting the correctness of the much - discredited theory of permanent revolution , which was shattered by the experience of the three Russian revolutions – ie , that of 1905 and those of February and October 1917 .
On arriving in Petrograd in 1917 , Trotsky affiliated to the Mezhrayontsi ( inter - regional ) , a group that vacillated between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks .
In August 1917 , declaring that they had no differences with the Bolsheviks , the Mezhrayontsi joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( Bolsheviks ) .
Trotsky joined the Bolsheviks with them .
On joining the Bolshevik Party , quite a number of Mezhrayontsi broke with opportunism ; but , as subsequent events were to reveal , for Trotsky and some of his followers , joining the Bolsheviks was only a ruse .
They continued to propound their harmful and reactionary views , flout discipline and undermine the Party 's organisational and ideological unity .
As Trotskyism , Ear from abandoning its old nasty stock - in - trade , on the contrary dragged it out into the light of day , it was bound , owing to its entire inner content , to become the centre and rallying point not only of the non-proletarian elements in the USSR who were then ( in the 1920s and 1930s ) striving to disintegrate the proletarian dictatorship , but also of the imperialist bourgeoisie seeking by a thousand means to overthrow the proletarian regime that had been ushered in by the mighty October revolution .
At every crucial stage in the development of the Russian revolution and the existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the USSR , Trotskyism continued to maintain its reactionary anti-Bolshevik , anti-Leninist stance in matters of theory as well as organisation , cloaking it under thick layers of ' revolutionary ' rhetoric .
Brest - Litovsk
In 1918 the young Soviet Republic , bereft of any army with the will and ability to fight , was fighting for its very survival through signing the Brest - Litovsk Peace Treaty with German imperialism , thus gaining a much - needed respite for the exhausted population .
At a crucial moment in these negotiations , Trotsky , as the head of the Soviet delegation to the peace talks , in violation of the instructions of the Party central committee and the Soviet government , declared the unilateral withdrawal of the Soviet Republic from the war , demobilisation of the Russian Army , and he then left Brest - Litovsk on the spurious ground that " we can only be saved in the true meaning of the word by a European Revolution " ( Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the RCP ( B ) ) .
This gave the German Command the pretext it needed for ending the armistice , mounting an offensive and obliging the Soviet government to sign " a much more humiliating peace , and the blame for this rests on those who refused to accept the former peace . "
( Lenin , Political Report of the CC to the Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the RCP ( B ) , 7 March 1918 , Collected Works , Vol. 27 ) .
Apropos the failure of the European revolution to come to maturity thus leaving the Bolshevik Revolution to solve its problems on its own , and forcing the Bolsheviks to face reality as it was rather than as they would wish it to be , Lenin admonished Trotsky and his ilk in the Party in the following terms :
" If you are unable to adapt yourself , if you are not inclined to crawl on your belly in the mud you are not a revolutionary but a chatterbox ; and I propose this , not because I like it , but because we have no other road , because history has not been kind enough to bring the revolution to maturity everywhere simultaneously . "
( Ibid . )
Thus the young Soviet Republic paid a very heavy price for Trotsky 's adventurism and phrase - mongering defeatism , which is the chief characteristic of his rotten theory of permanent revolution , according to which nothing good can ever come of any revolution unless it is accompanied by a world revolution .
Trade union debate
With the victorious conclusion of the Civil War of 1918 - 1920 , as the Soviet Republic under Lenin 's guidance , switched from war communism to the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) and embarked on a programme of economic revival and rejuvenation – of restoration of industry through an upsurge in agriculture and by drawing the workers and trade unions into active socialist construction through planned organisation and persuasion ( and not coercion ) , Trotsky and his supporters forced on the Party a discussion on the question of trade unions ( a luxury and a diversion from the work of economic construction , from the fight against famine and economic dislocation that the Party could ill afford at the time ) .
Trotsky , the patriarch of bureaucrats , as Stalin rightly called him insisted on " tightening up the screws " and " shaking up " the trade unions , and turning the latter into state agencies , and on replacing persuasion by coercion .
The Party discussion on the trade unions resulted in the total rout of Trotsky and his supporters .
When the Central Committee of the Party rejected Trotsky 's Prussian sergeant 's proposal , Trotsky went outside and gathered a group of his supporters with the aim of fighting against the Central Committee .
So alarmed was Lenin by Trotsky 's factionalism and flouting of Party discipline that he caused the 10th Party Congress ( March 1921 ) to pass a resolution forbidding the formation of factions and disbanding existing factions forthwith .
It was further stated that the " non-fulfilment of this decision of the Congress shall be followed by unconditional and immediate expulsion from the Party . "
Trotsky 's return to fully - fledged factionalism
This resolution was to arouse Trotsky 's bitter hatred and opposition , for whenever he could not get his own way on any question , he rushed to form a Trotskyist faction within the Party , even if that meant threatening a split .
During 1921 Lenin 's health began to decline .
Cerebral arteriosclerosis was already blocking his blood circulation and taking its toll , with the result that this man of inexhaustible energy and drive was tiring easily , and spent most of the summer resting in the village of Gorki , not far from Moscow .
The 11th Party Congress , meeting at the end of March 1922 , created the new office of General Secretary , to which , one day after the conclusion of that Congress ( i.e. , on 3 April 1922 ) , on Lenin 's initiation and sponsorship , Stalin was appointed .
On 26 May 1922 , while resting in Gorki , Lenin suffered a severe stroke , which caused a partial paralysis of the right side of his body and loss of speech .
He recovered from this stroke remarkably quickly and was back at his desk in early October 1922 .
After two further minor strokes on December 13 and 16 , 1922 , he suffered on March 10 , 1923 , a massive stroke , from which he never recovered and after which he took no further part in politics .
Following the latest stroke suffered by Lenin , Trotsky , with an eye on the leadership , stepped up his factional activity and intensified his vile and slanderous attacks on the Party leadership , its central institutions and its policy .
On 8 October 1923 he sent a letter to the Central Committee , in which he asserted that the country was being inexorably led by the Party leadership to a catastrophe , to prevent which he demanded greater inner-Party democracy .
Stripped of its Trotskyite verbiage , this meant the right to form factional groupings .
A group of 46 followers of Trotsky also issued a manifesto – known as the Statement of 46 – to the same effect .
Trotsky 's letter and the Statement of 46 were discussed and condemned at a joint plenary meeting of the CC and the CCC with representatives of ten of the largest Party organisations in October 1923 .
Trotsky followed his letter with a pamphlet entitled New Course , in which in addition to the demand for more Party democracy , he accused the old Bolsheviks – the Party leadership – of degeneration .
He counterposed young people , especially students , to veteran Bolsheviks , declaring the former to be the barometer of the Party .
In talking about the degeneration of the ' old guard ' , Trotsky had used the expression " we , the old Bolsheviks , " which provoked Stalin to make this observation , full of biting sarcasm :
" First , I must dispel a possible misunderstanding .
As is evident ... , Trotsky includes himself among the Bolshevik old guard , thereby showing readiness to take upon himself the charges that may be hurled at the old guard if it does indeed take the path of degeneration .
It must be admitted that his readiness for self - sacrifice is undoubtedly a noble trait .
But I must protect Trotsky from Trotsky , because , for obvious reasons , he cannot and should not bear responsibility for the possible degeneration of the principal cadres of the Bolshevik old guard ... "
With more than a covert reference to Trotsky 's long Menshevik past , Stalin , while admitting the possibility of degeneration of the Bolshevik old guard , goes on to add :
" Nevertheless , there are a number of elements within our Party who are capable of giving rise to a real danger of degeneration of certain ranks of our Party .
I have in mind that section of the Mensheviks who joined our Party unwillingly and who have not yet got rid of their opportunist habits . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 5 p. 395 ) .
The Thirteenth Conference of the RCP( B ) , held on 16 - 18 January 1924 , strongly condemned the factionalism of Trotsky and his followers , stating that " the present opposition is not only an attempt to revise Bolshevism not only a flagrant departure from Leninism but patently a petty - bourgeois deviation .
There is no doubt whatever that this opposition mirrors the pressure of the petty - bourgeoisie on the position of the proletarian party and its policy . "
( Resolution
On the Results of the Discussion and on the Petty - Bourgeois Deviation in the Party – CPSU in Resolutions , etc. Vol. 2 ) .
Lenin's death and Trotsky 's attempt to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism
Lenin , after a further stroke on the morning of 21 January , 1924 , died in the evening .
Trotsky , although a newcomer to the Party , had convinced himself that he had a better claim to succeed Lenin than old , trusted and tried Bolsheviks such as Stalin .
So in October 1924 Trotsky published an introduction to his collected works entitled Lessons of October , which purported to deal with the reasons for the Bolshevik victory in the October Revolution .
Having made general ritual references in it to the necessity of a revolutionary party for the success of a revolution , Trotsky went on to belittle the role of the Bolshevik Party , extol his , own part in the revolution , hinting that Lenin had suddenly changed his previous position for that of Trotsky , to which fact alone was to be attributed the success of the October Revolution .
He also dragged out of the cupboard his old and much - discredited theory of ' permanent revolution ! , arguing that hostile collisions between the proletarian vanguard and the broad masses of the peasantry were inevitable .
One gets the impression from reading his Lessons of October that it was Trotsky who organised the October victory .
In other words , the man who had fought against Bolshevism and Leninism for 14 long years , who had sided with the Mensheviks and liquidators to oppose the building by Lenin 's Bolsheviks of the proletarian revolutionary party capable of leading the proletariat and the broad masses in seizing political power , who had spent his life opposing Lenin 's theory of proletarian revolution with his absurd theory of ' permanent revolution ' , who had opposed the Bolshevik slogan of defeat of one 's own government in the imperialist war ( the first world war ) with his chauvinistic slogan demanding Neither victory nor defeat , suddenly and providentially descended on the scene in Petersburg to rescue the revolution from the frightened and useless lot that constituted the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party , the majority of whom , according to this fairy tale worthy of the Arabian Nights , were opposed to the October uprising !!
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Trotsky 's special role in October originated with John Reed , the author of Ten Days that Shook the World , who , being remote from the Bolshevik Party , had no knowledge of the secret meeting of its central committee on 23 October , 1917 , and was therefore taken in by the gossip spread by people such as Sukhanov .
These fairy tales about Trotsky 's special role in October were later passed round and repeated in several pamphlets written by Trotskyites , including Syrkin 's pamphlet on October .
After Lenin 's death Trotsky strongly supported these rumours in his literary pronouncements .
Since a systematic attempt was being made by Trotskyites to re- write the history of October and bring up Soviet youth on such legends , Stalin , in a speech delivered at the Plenum of the Communist Group of the AUCCTU , ( 3 ) refuted – by reference to hard facts – these Arabian Nights fairy tales in his characteristically devastating manner .
Citing the minutes of the meeting of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party on 23 October 1917 , he proved that the resolution on the uprising was adopted by a majority of 10 against 2 ; that the same meeting elected a political centre , called the Political Bureau , to direct the uprising , the members of the Centre being Lenin , Zinoviev , Stalin , Kamenev , Trotsky , Sokolnikov and Bubnov .
Thus the Centre included even Zinoviev and Kamenev who were the only two to vote against the resolution on the uprising .
This was possible in spite of the political disagreements between them because there was at that time a unity of views between these two ( Zinoviev and Kamenev ) and the rest of the Central Committee on such fundamental questions " as the character of the Russian revolution , the driving forces of the revolution , the role of the peasantry , the principles of Party leadership , and so forth . "
( Stalin , Collected Works , Vol. 6 , p. 341 ) .
Thus the decision on the uprising was taken by the Central Committee and the Central Committee alone .
Hence the political direction of the uprising was firmly in the hands of the Central Committee .
As to the legend that Trotsky played a ' special ' role in that he ' inspired ' , and was the ' sole leader ' of the October uprising – this legend was spread by Lentsner , and Stalin dealt with it as follows :
" The Trotskyites are vigorously spreading rumours that Trotsky inspired and was the sole leader of the October uprising .
These rumours are being spread with exceptional zeal by the so- called editor of Trotsky 's works , Lentsner .
Trotsky himself , by consistently avoiding mention of the Party , the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the Party , by saying nothing about the leading role of these organisations in the uprising and vigorously pushing himself forward as the central figure in the October uprising , voluntarily or involuntarily helps to spread the rumours about the special role he is supposed to have played in the uprising , I am far from denying Trotsky 's undoubtedly important role in the uprising .
I must say , however , that Trotsky did not play any special role in the October uprising , nor could he do so ; being chairman of the Petrograd Soviet he merely carried out the will of the appropriate Party bodies , which directed every step that Trotsky took .
To philistines like Sukhanov , all this may seem strange , but the facts , the true facts , wholly and fully confirm what I say . "
( Ibid , pp. 341- 342 ) .
Stalin then passes on to an examination of the minutes of the next Central Committee meeting held on 29 October , 1917 .
Apart from the members of the Central Committee , there were present at this meeting representatives of the Petrograd Committee as well as representatives of military organisations , factory committees , trade unions and the railwaymen .
At this meeting Lenin 's resolution on the uprising was adopted by a majority of 20 against 2 , with three abstentions .
At this meeting too a practical centre was elected for the organisational leadership of the uprising .
To this practical centre were elected the following five : Sverdlov , Stalin , Dzerzhinksy , Bubnov and Uritsky .
Let Stalin speak :
" The functions of the practical centre : to direct all the practical organs of the uprising in conformity with the directives of the Central Committee .
Thus , as you see , something terrible happened at this meeting of the Central Committee , i.e. , ' strange to relate ' , the Inspirer , the ' chief figure ' , the ' sole leader ' of the uprising , Trotsky , was not elected to the practical centre , which was called upon to direct the uprising .
How is this to be reconciled with the current opinion about Trotsky 's special role ?
Is not all this somewhat ' strange ' , as Sukhanov , or the Trotskyites , would say ?
And yet strictly speaking there is nothing strange about it for neither in the Party , nor in the October uprising did Trotsky play any special role , nor could he do so , for he was a relatively new man in our Party in the period of October .
He , like all the responsible workers , merely carried out the will of the Central Committee and of its organs .
Who -ever is familiar with the mechanics of Bolshevik Party leadership will have no difficulty in understanding that it could not be otherwise ; it would have been enough for Trotsky to go against the will of the Central Committee to have been deprived of all influence on the course of events .
This talk about Trotsky 's special role is a legend that is being spread by obliging ' Party ' gossips .
( 4 )
" This , of course , does not mean that the October uprising did not have its inspirer .
it did have its inspirer and leader , but this was Lenin , and none other than Lenin , that same Lenin whose resolution the Central Committee adopted when deciding the question of the uprising , that same Lenin who , in spite of what Trotsky says , was not prevented by being in hiding from being the actual inspirer of the uprising .
It is foolish and ridiculous to attempt now , by gossip about Lenin having been in hiding to obscure the indubitable fact that the inspirer of the uprising was the leader of the Party , V.I. Lenin .
" Such are the facts . " ( Collected Works , Vol. 6 , pp 342-344 . )
Continues Stalin :
" Granted , we are told but it cannot be denied that Trotsky fought well in the period of October .
Yes , that is true , Trotsky did , indeed , fight well in October , but Trotsky was not the only one who fought well in the period of October .
Even people like the Left Socialist - Revolutionaries , who then stood side by side with the Bolsheviks , also fought well , In general I " must say that in the period of a victorious uprising when the enemy is isolated and the uprising is growing ; it is not difficult to fight well .
At such moments even backward people become heroes .
" The proletarian struggle is not however , an uninterrupted advance , an unbroken chain of victories .
The proletarian struggle also has its trials , its defeats .
The genuine revolutionary is not one who displays courage in the period of a victorious uprising ; but one who , while fighting well during the victorious advance of the revolution , also displays courage when the revolution is in retreat when the proletariat suffers defeat , who does not lose his head and does not funk when the revolution suffers reverses , when the enemy " achieves success ; who does not become panic - stricken or give way to despair when the revolution is in a period of retreat The Left Socialist - Revolutionaries did not fight badly in the period of October , and they supported the Bolsheviks .
But who does not know that those ' brave ' fighters became panic - stricken in the period of Brest when the advance of German imperialism drove them to despair and hysteria .
It is a very sad but indubitable fact that Trotsky , who fought well in the period of October , did not in the period of Brest in the period when the revolution suffered temporary reverses , possess the courage to display sufficient staunchness at that difficult moment and to refrain from following in the footsteps of the Left Socialist - Revolutionaries .
Beyond question ; that moment was a difficult one ; one had to display exceptional courage and imperturbable coolness not to be dismayed , to retreat in good time , to accept peace in good time , to withdraw the proletarian army out of range of the blows of German imperialism ; to preserve the peasant reserves and , after obtaining a respite in this way , to strike at the enemy with renewed force .
Unfortunately , Trotsky was found to lack this courage and revolutionary staunchness at that difficult moment .
" In Trotsky 's opinion , the principal lesson of the proletarian revolution is ' not to funk ' during October .
That is wrong ; for Trotsky 's assertion contains only a particle of the truth about the lessons of the revolution .
The whole truth about the lessons of the proletarian revolution is not to funk , not only when the revolution is advancing but also when it is retreat when the enemy is gaining the upper hand and the revolution is suffering reverses .
The revolution did not end with October .
October was only the beginning of the proletarian revolution .
It is bad to funk when the tide of insurrection is rising but it is worse to funk when the revolution is passing through severe trials after power has been captured .
To retain power on the morrow of the revolution is no less important that to capture power . "
( Ibid. pp. 344-345 ) .
Stalin asked the question : " For what purpose did Trotsky need all these legends about October and the preparation for October , about Lenin and the Party of Lenin ?
What is the purpose of Trotsky 's new literary pronouncements against the Party ?... " ( Ibid . p.363 )
By way of an answer , Stalin continues :
" Trotsky asserts that all this is needed for the purpose of ' studying ' October .
But is it not possible to study October without giving another kick at the Party and its leader Lenin ?
What sort of a ' history ' of October is it that begins and ends with attempts to discredit the chief leader of the October uprising to discredit the Party , which organised and carried through the uprising ?...
That is not the way to study October .
That is not the way to write the history of October .
Obviously , there is a different ' design ' here , and everything goes to show that this ' design ' is that Trotsky by his literary pronouncements is making another ( yet another ! ) attempt to create the conditions for substituting Trotskyism for Leninism .
Trotsky needs ' desperately ' to discredit the Party , and its cadres who carried through the uprising in order , after discrediting the Party , to proceed to discredit Leninism .
And it is necessary for him to discredit Leninism in order to drag in Trotskyism as the ' sole ' ' proletarian ' ( do n't laugh ! ) ideology .
All this , of course ( oh , of course ! ) under the flag of Leninism , so that the dragging operation may be performed ' as painlessly as possible ' .
" That is the essence of Trotsky 's latest literary pronouncements . " ( Ibid. pp. 363-364 ) .
Trotskyism – a rallying point for counter - revolution
Stalin went on to conclude that the danger was " ... that Trotskyism , owing to its entire inner content stands every chance of becoming the centre and rallying point of the non-proletarian elements who are striving to weaken to disintegrate the proletarian dictatorship , " in view of which it was " the duty of the Party to bury Trotskyism as an ideological trend . "
( Ibid. p. 373 ) .
In later years Trotsky himself was obliged to admit that " in the wake of this vanguard [ i.e. , the Trotskyist opposition ] there dragged the tail end of all sorts of dissatisfied , ill - equipped and even chagrined careerists , " adding , however , that the opposition had managed to free itself from " its accidental and uninvited fellow wayfarers . "
On the contrary , as the contents of the pages that follow reveal , it is precisely the non-proletarian elements , with their irreconcilable hostility to the proletarian dictatorship , their striving for the disintegration of the proletarian dictatorship , who supported the Trotskyist opposition in the USSR and who continued to support him abroad after his expulsion from the Soviet Union .
It is precisely the same type of person who has since those times rallied around Trotskyism , driven by an innate hatred of Marxism - Leninism and of the dictatorship of the proletariat .
Even the Trotskyite Deutscher is compelled to say .
' Outside the party , formless revolutionary frustration mingled with distinctly counter - revolutionary trends
Since the ruling group had singled out Trotsky as a target for attack he automatically attracted the spurious sympathy of many who had hitherto hated him .
As he made his appearance in the streets of Moscow [ in .
the spring of 19241 , he was spontaneously applauded by crowds in which idealist communists rubbed shoulders with Mensheviks Social Revolutionaries ; and the new bourgeoisie of the NEP , by all those indeed who , for diverse reasons hoped for a change [ i.e. , for the disintegration of the proletarian dictatorship through the weakening and disintegration of the Bolshevik Party ] " ( Isaac Deutscher , Stalin , Pelican , 1966 , p. 279 ) .
At its plenary meeting held on 17 - 20 January , 1925 , the Central Committee of the RCP ( B ) characterised Trotskyism as a variety of Menshevism " and Trotsky 's ceaseless attacks on Bolshevism as an attempt to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism .
This meeting resolved to remove Trotsky from the office of Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR , and he was " warned in the most emphatic term that membership of the Bolshevik Party demands real , not verbal subordination to Party discipline and total and unconditional renunciation of any attacks on the ideals of Leninism "
Emergence of the New Opposition
After the above meeting pronounced against Trotsky and warned that his splittist activity and anti Leninist propaganda was incompatible with Party membership , Trotsky retreated for a while , awaiting his chance
This chance came when Zinoviev and Kamenev – two old Bolsheviks – frightened by difficulties and overcome by defeatism , went into opposition after the 14th Party Conference ( April 1925 ) affirmed the possibility of building socialism , in the USSR .
Being incorrigible defeatists and sceptics , Zinoviev and Kamenev denied the possibility of building socialism in the Soviet Union , and in this way found common ground with pessimism , scepticism and defeatism personified , namely , Trotsky , the author of the theory of ' permanent revolution ' , the epitome of hopelessness .
The New Opposition ( as it was called ) , led by Zinoviev and Kamenev , launched ' vicious attacks on the Party 's Leninist line ( on the possibility of building socialism ) at the 14th Congress of the Party , winch opened in December 1925 .
After suffering a crushing defeat at that Congress , the New Opposition , headed by Zinoviev and Kamenev ( who had until only recently been - seeking to remove Trotsky from the leadership and whom Trotsky , in turn , had been seeking to eliminate from the leadership of the Party ) openly embraced Trotskyism .
Thus emerged an anti-Party opposition bloc , to which flocked the remnants of the various opposition groups previously squashed by the Party – all motivated by their hatred of , and opposition to , the Party 's policy of strengthening the proletarian dictatorship and building socialism in the USSR .
The leaders of this opposition , Trotsky , Zinoviev and Kamenev , " granting each other mutual amnesty , " as Stalin put it , and using as an occasion and a pretext the collapse of the British General Strike ( that they blamed on the leadership of the Bolshevik Party for having allegedly failed to give leadership and guidance to the British workers ) , produced their platform , written by Trotsky , which was presented in part to the Plenum of the Central Committee on 6 - 9 April 1926 , and in full to the meeting of July 14 - 23 1926 .
In flagrant breach of Party discipline , the opposition organised demonstrations in factories , demanding full discussion of their platform .
The communist workers vehemently denounced the opposition leaders and made them leave these meetings .
Faced with this humiliating defeat , the opposition leaders beat a retreat and sent a statement , on 16 October 1926 , in which they confessed their errors and promised to desist in future from their factional activity against the Party .
In the words of Ian Grey :
" Appalled by their own temerity and recklessness , the six leaders – Trotsky , Zinoviev , Kamenev , Pyatakov , Sokolnikov and Evdakimov – confessed their guilt in a public declaration and swore not to pursue factional activity in future .
They also denounced their own left - wing supporters in the Comintern and the Workers ' Opposition group . "
( Ian Grey , Stalin – Man of History , Abacus , 1982 , pp. 213-214 ) .
Formation of an illegal party
The opposition 's statement of October , 1926 , turned out to be totally insincere and thoroughly hypocritical .
As a matter of fact the opposition had formed an illegal party of its own , with a separate system of membership , district committees , and a centre .
The illegal party , with a secret illegal printing press , held secret meetings at which the opposition 's factional platform , and the tactics to be adopted against the Bolshevik Party , were discussed – all this in violation of the decisions of the 10th Party Congress banning the formation and continuation of separate factions within the Party .
In October 1926 , the Plenum of the Central Committee , sitting jointly with the Central Control Commission , issued a severe warning to the leaders of the opposition , removing Trotsky from the Politburo and Kamenev from his candidate membership of this body .
Zinoviev was removed from the Comintern .
The Fifteenth All - Union Party Conference ( Oct - Nov 1926 ) characterised the Trotsky - Zinoviev opposition as a Menshevik deviation in the Party , issuing the warning that further development in the direction of Menshevism would lead to the opposition 's expulsion from the Party .
At the beginning of 1927 the opposition renewed its attack on the policy of the Comintern vis-à - vis the Chinese revolution , blaming the Comintern and the CPSU for the reverses of the Chinese revolution .
Taking advantage of the internal difficulties , as well as of the deterioration in the international position of the USSR , the opposition yet again came out with the so - called ' platform of 83 ' .
Renewing their slander against the Party , the opposition claimed in this platform that the Soviet government was intending to abolish the monopoly of foreign trade and grant political fights to the kulaks .
Such slanders could not but encourage the kulaks and imperialism alike in putting pressure on the Soviet government in an attempt to wrest precisely such concessions from the Soviet government .
In addition , the opposition demagogically demanded greater freedom in the Party , which it understood to mean the freedom to form factions and to " indulge in unparalleled abuse and impermissible vilification of the Central Committee , CPSU ( B ) and the ECCI .
They complain of the ' regime ' within the Comintern and the CPSU ( B ) .
Essentially , what they want is freedom to disorganise the Comintern and the CPSU ( B ) ... "
( Stalin , Collected Works , Vol. 9 , p. 317 ) .
Trotskyism 's struggle against ' Stalinism ' – a continuation of the struggle against Leninism
What the Trotskyite opposition was fighting against was the regime established by the 10th congress under the guidance of Lenin – a regime designed to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat through unity and iron discipline within the Bolshevik Party by outlawing factionalism .
The underlying principles of the regime established by the 10th Congress were that " while inner-Party democracy is operated and businesslike criticism of the Party 's defects and mistakes is permitted no factionalism whatsoever is permitted , and all factionalism must be abandoned on pain of expulsion from the party . , " ( Stalin , The Political Completion of the Russian Opposition , Collected Works , Vol. 10 , p. 166 ) .
" I assert " , said Stalin , " that the Trotskyites had already started their fight against the Leninist regime in the Party in Lenin 's time , and that the fight the Trotskyites are now [ i.e. , September 19271 waging is a continuation of the fight against the regime in the Party which they were already waging in Lenin 's time . "
( Ibid . )
As the opposition 's platform drew no support from the workers , it retreated again and handed another declaration to the Central Committee , on 8 August 1927 , in which they promised yet again to cease their factional activity , only to violate it a month later .
As the preparations got under way in September 1927 for the Fifteenth Party Congress , the opposition drew up the third statement of its aims and policies .
An end had to be put to the opposition 's factionalism , its disorganising activity and the charade of repeated violations of its hypocritical declaration of admission of guilt and promises to cease factional activity .
So , at the end of October 1927 , the Central Committee in a joint meeting with the Central Control Commission , expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev from the Central Committee , deciding further to submit all the documents relating to the factional activity of the Trotskyite opposition to the Fifteenth Congress for consideration by the latter .
It is worth recalling that during the Party discussion preceding the Fifteenth Party Congress , 724,000 members voted for the Leninist policy of the Central Committee , while a derisory 4,000 votes were cast for the platform of the Trotskyite - Zinovievite opposition bloc , that is , half of one per cent of the membership that took part in this debate .
Why did the opposition fail ?
The opposition failed to get any support in the Party organisations , for its line was that of utter bankruptcy the line of wanting to supplant Leninism by Trotskyism , while the Party wished faithfully to pursue the line of Leninism – that of revolutionary Bolshevism .
" How , then , " asked Stalin , " are we to explain the fact that notwithstanding his oratorical skill , notwithstanding his will to lead , notwithstanding his abilities , Trotsky was thrown out of the leadership of the great Party which is called the CPSU ( B ) ? "
He went on to answer : " The reason is that the opposition intended to replace Leninism with Trotskyism , to ' improve ' Leninism by means Of Trotskyism .
But the Party want to remain faithful to Leninism in spite of all the various artifices of the down - at - heel aristocrats in the Party .
That is the root cause why the Party , which has made three revolutions , found it necessary to turn its back on Trotsky and on the opposition as a whole . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 10 , p. 165 ) .
Speaking at the Fifteenth Congress of the Party , Stalin returned to this question again .
" How could it happen that the Party as a whole , and after it the working class as well so thoroughly isolated the opposition ?
After a1l the opposition is headed by well - known people with well - known names , people who know how to advertise themselves ... , people who are not afflicted with modesty and who are able to blow their own trumpets , to make the most of their wares .
" It happened because the leading group of the opposition proved to be a group of petty - bourgeois intellectuals divorced from life , divorced from the revolution , divorced from the Party , from the working class . "
( Stalin , ibid. p. 345 ) .
From factionalism within the Party to counter - revolutionary struggle against the Soviet regime
Faced with utter defeat within the Party , bankrupt politically and isolated from the Party membership , the Trotskyite - Zinovievite bloc switched over from factional activity within the Party to anti-Soviet and counter - revolutionary struggle against the Bolshevik regime , attracting in the process all the anti-Soviet elements to their camp .
On 7 November , 1927 , the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution , Trotsky and Zinoviev organised anti-Party demonstrations in Moscow and Leningrad .
Poorly attended , these counter - revolutionary demonstrations were easily dispersed by the demonstrators of the working class under the leadership of the CPSU .
By its November 7 actions the opposition had given full proof of its conversion into a counter - revolutionary force openly hostile to the proletarian dictatorship in the USSR .
Having infringed all the norms and rules of Party life , the Trotskyites now embarked upon a career of violating state laws which in due course led them to murder , sabotage , wrecking and , finally , to an alliance with fascism .
On 14 November , 1927 , the Central Committee expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev from the Party , while other members of their group were removed from the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission .
The Fifteenth Congress of the Party ( December 1927 ) , noting that the opposition had ideologically broken with Leninism , had degenerated into Menshevism , had adopted the path of capitulation to international imperialism and the internal bourgeoisie and had become an instrument of struggle against the dictatorship of the proletariat , enthusiastically endorsed these expulsions .
Moreover it expelled in addition a further 75 members of the Trotsky - Zinoviev bloc , as well as 15 Democratic Centralists .
Further , the Congress instructed Party organisations to purge their ranks of incorrigible Trotskyites and take steps to re-educate the rank - and - file members of the opposition in the spirit of Leninism .
After the Congress many ordinary members of the opposition recognised their errors , broke with Trotskyism and were restored to Party membership .
In January 1928 Trotsky was exiled to Alma - Ata in Central Asia ( Kazakhstan ) .
Even there he continued clandestinely to indulge in his anti-Party , anti-Soviet activity .
Consequently , in January 1929 he was expelled from the Soviet Union .
Since the opposition intended little by little to switch the Bolshevik Party from the Leninist path to that of Trotskyism , and since the Party wanted to remain a Leninist Party , it was only natural that the Party turned its back on the opposition and raised ever higher the banner of Leninism .
This alone explains why , as Stalin put it , " yesterday 's leaders of the Party have now become renegades . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 10 , p. 199 ) .
Not personal factors but departure from Leninism is the cause of Trotskyism 's failure
Instead of grasping this truth , the Trotskyite opposition in its day , and the Trotskyites ever since then , have explained the opposition 's defeat by personal factors .
This is how Stalin described the far - reaching historical roots of Trotsky 's fight against Bolshevism and the reasons for the failure and bankruptcy of the opposition 's line :
" The opposition thinks that its defeat can be ' explained ' by the personal factor , by Stalin 's rudeness ...
That is too cheap an explanation .
It is an incantation , not an explanation .
Trotsky has been fighting Leninism since 1904 .
From 1904 until the February revolution in 1917 he hung around the Mensheviks desperately fighting Lenin 's Party all the time .
During that period Trotsky suffered a number of defeats at the hand of Lenin's Party - Why ?
Perhaps Stalin 's rudeness was to blame ?
But Stalin was not yet the secretary of the Central Committee at that time ; he was not abroad , but in Russia , fighting tsarism underground , whereas the struggle between Trotsky and Lenin raged abroad .
So what has Stalin 's rudeness got to do with it ?
" During the period from the October Revolution to 1922 , Trotsky , already a member of the Bolshevik Party , managed to make two ' grand ' sorties against Lenin and his Party : in 1918 – on the question of the Brest Peace ; and in 1921 – on the trade - union question .
Both those sorties ended in Trotsky being defeated .
Why ?
Perhaps Stalin 's rudeness was to blame here ?
But at that time Stalin was not yet the secretary of the Central Committee .
The secretarial posts were then occupied by notorious Trotskyists .
So what has Stalin 's rudeness got to do with it ?
" Later , Trotsky made a number of fresh sorties against the Party ( 1923 , 1924 , 1926 , 1927 ) and each sortie ended in Trotsky suffering a fresh defeat .
" Is it not obvious from all this that Trotsky 's fight against the Leninist Party has deep , far - reaching historical roots ?
Is it not obvious from this that the struggle the Party is now waging against Trotskyism is a continuation of the struggle that the Party , headed by Lenin , waged from 1904 onwards ?
" Is it not obvious from all this that the attempts of the Trotskyists to replace Leninism by Trotskyism are the chief cause of the failure and bankruptcy of the entire line of the opposition ?
" Our Party was born and grew up in the storm of revolutionary battles .
It is not a party that grew up in a period of peaceful development .
For that very reason it is rich in revolutionary traditions and does not make a fetish of its leaders .
At one time Plekhanov was the most popular man in the Party .
More than that he was the founder of the Party , and his popularity was incomparably greater than that of Trotsky or Zinoviev .
Nevertheless , in spite of that the Party turned away from Plekhanov as soon as he began to depart from Marxism and go over to opportunism .
Is it surprising , then , that people who are not so ' great , people like Trotsky and Zinoviev , found themselves at the tail of the Party after they began to depart from Leninism ? "
( Collected Works , Vol. 10 , pp 199-201 ) .
Just as the struggle waged against Trotskyism by the Bolshevik Party headed by Stalin from 1924 onwards was a continuation of the struggle that the Party headed by Lenin had waged from 1903 onwards , equally Trotsky 's fight against the Bolshevik Party headed by Stalin was a continuation of the struggle that Trotskyism waged against the Bolshevik Party when it was headed by Lenin .
Lenin had been the chief target of Trotsky 's vilifications from 1903 to 1917 .
After the death of Lenin , Stalin came to occupy this honourable position , became the chief target of the opposition 's attack .
This was because Stalin , by faithfully defending and carrying forward the Leninist fine , became the most representative spokesman of the Bolshevik Party and in that capacity drew the wrath of the opposition in its repeated , if unsuccessful , attempts to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism .
It was not a case of the allegedly Leninist Trotsky fighting against an allegedly outside usurper , Stalin , as is put out in Trotskyite fairy tales ; on the contrary , it was the staunch and indefatigable Leninist ( Stalin ) who brilliantly continued the successful Leninist assault on the anti-Bolshevik and petty - bourgeois ideology of Trotskyism .
This alone explains Trotskyism 's hatred of Joseph St " the very mention of whose name causes Trotskyite gentry to foam at the mouth -
This is how Stalin described the opposition 's hatred for him :
" First of all about the personal factor .
You have heard here how assiduously the oppositionists hurl abuse at Stalin , abuse him with all their might .
The reason why the main attacks were directed against Stalin is because Stalin knows all the opposition 's tricks better , perhaps , than some of our comrades do , and it is not easy , I dare say , to fool him .
So they strike their blows primarily at Stalin .
Well , let them hurt abuse to their hearts ' content .
" And what is Stalin ?
Stalin is only a minor figure .
Take Lenin .
Who does not know that at the time of the August bloc the opposition , headed by Trotsky , waged an even more scurrilous campaign of slander against Lenin ?
Listen to Trotsky , for example .
" ' The wretched squabbling systematically provoked by Lenin , that old hand at the game , that professional exploiter of all that is backward in the Russian labour movement , seems like a senseless obsession '
( See Trotsky 's ' Letter to Chkeidze ' , April 1913 ) .
" Note the language , comrades !
Note the language !
It is Trotsky writing .
And writing about Lenin .
" Is it surprising , then , that Trotsky , who wrote in such an ill - mannered way about the great Lenin , whose shoe - laces he was not worthy of tying , should now hurl abuse at one of Lenin 's numerous pupils – Comrade Stalin ?
" More than that .
I think the opposition does me honour by venting all its hatred against Stalin .
That is as it should be .
I think it would be strange and offensive if the opposition , which is trying to wreck the Party , were to praise Stalin , who is defending the fundamentals of the Leninist Party principle . "
( Collected Works , Vol. 10 , pp. 177-178 ) .
Trotsky 's regular predictions of doom
Proceeding from the unscientific and pessimistic , not to say anti-Leninist , theory of ' permanent revolution ' , which was refuted by the experience of the three Russian revolutions and by all further social development in the USSR and elsewhere , Trotsky could , and did , predict nothing but doom .
The underlying theme and purpose of all his statements between 1923 and 1940 was to deny all possibility of building socialism in the USSR and thus to undermine the confidence of the Soviet proletariat in building a new society by its own efforts if the world revolution failed to come to its rescue .
This was accompanied by vicious attacks on the only guarantee for the successes of the USSR during this epoch - making period of particular difficulty and particular achievement , namely the Leninist leadership of the Party and state of the proletarian dictatorship .
Of course these attacks were always hidden under a guise of attacking the ' bureaucratic state apparatus ' , or ' Stalinist bureaucracy , with the alleged desire to improve matters .
And when the oft - predicted disaster did not happen , this only provided Trotsky with an occasion to report on invented widespread disaster , disillusionment and demoralisation as a means of bringing about the fulfilment of his jeremiads .
Trotsky's ' New Course ' predicts degeneration of the Party
In 1923 , at the time of the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) , Trotsky predicted immediate doom for the proletarian dictatorship through the " degeneration of the state apparatus in a bourgeois direction . "
In his New Course , written in 1923 , he claimed that " Bureaucratism has reached an excessive and truly alarming development . "
This is how he predicted the restoration of capitalism through the NEP , claiming that quantity would at a certain stage be transformed into quality :
" ... The rapid development of private capital ... would show that private capital is interposing itself more and more between the workers ' state and the peasantry , is acquiring an economic and therefore a political influence ...
[ S ]uch a rupture between Soviet industry and agriculture , between the proletariat and the peasantry , would constitute a grave danger for the proletarian revolution , a symptom of the possibility of the triumph of the counter - revolution .
" What are the political paths by which the victory of the counter - revolution might come if the economic hypothesis just set forth were to be realised ?...
[ T ] he political process would assume in the main the character of the degeneration of the state apparatus in a bourgeois direction ...
If private capital in creased rapidly and succeeded in fusing with the peasantry , the active counter - revolutionary tendencies directed against the Communist Party would then probably prevail ...
" The counter - revolutionary tendencies can find a support among the kulaks , the middlemen , the retailers , the concessionaires , in a word , among elements much more capable of surrounding the state apparatus than the Party itself ...
… [ T ] he negative social phenomena we have just enumerated and which now nurture bureaucratisation could place the revolution in peril should they continue to develop ... bureaucratism in the state and party apparatus is the expression of the most vexatious tendencies inherent in our situation , of the defects and deviations in our work which ... might sap the basis of the revolution ...
Quantity will at a certain stage be transformed into quality . " ( Chapter 4 ) .
In all this , Trotsky forgets completely the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat .
Of course , the introduction of the NEP did unleash capitalist elements , in the countryside in particular ; of course it was a partial return to capitalism .
All that was known to the author of the NEP , Vladimir Ilyich Lenin .
But there was no other way of transition from war communism to socialism except through the NEP even though the latter , by unleashing capitalist elements in the countryside , carried the danger of capitalist restoration .
This danger , however , this possibility of capitalist restoration , could never be realised as long as the proletarian dictatorship exercised its iron rule over hostile capitalist classes – kulaks and traders .
That is why Lenin called for the maximum strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat .
This , in turn , could only be done through unity of will and iron discipline in the ruling Bolshevik Party .
That is why he caused the Tenth Party Congress to pass the resolution , written by himself , calling for existing factions within the Party to be disbanded forthwith , for the formation of new factions in the future to be banned , and declaring that non-compliance with this resolution by anyone would result in their immediate expulsion from the Party .
Trotsky for his part consistently undermined the proletarian dictatorship by his vicious attacks on the leadership of the Party , his denigration of the Party and state apparatus in the USSR , and by flouting all norms and discipline of the Bolshevik Party .
Failure of Trotsky 's predictions
Notwithstanding Trotskyist sabotage , Trotsky 's predictions did not come true , thanks to the Leninist leadership of the Party and the state during this very difficult period .
Instead NEP Russia was actually transformed into a mighty socialist USSR that then went on to achieve the crowning glory of defeating the mighty Nazi war machine almost single - handedly .
As the " degeneration " , " initiative - killing bureaucratism " , " ossification " , " estrangement " and " morbid uneasiness " predicted by Trotsky failed to materialise and the USSR began to be transformed through the collectivisation and industrialisation drive of the Five - Year Plans , Trotsky intensified his attacks on the USSR and the leadership of the Bolshevik Party – revealing in the process his true hideous features as a market socialist , i.e. , as a bourgeois socialist of the social - democratic variety .
Contemptible and cowardly capitulator
In 1933 , Trotsky published his pamphlet Soviet Economy in Danger , in which he came out in opposition to this second assault on capitalism , i.e. , the assault mounted through socialist industrialisation and collectivisation – both measures of world revolutionary historic significance .
He declared that the " correct and economically sound collectivisation , at a given stage , SHOULD NOT LEAD TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE NEP but to the GRADUAL REORGANISATION OF ITS METHODS . " ( p. 32 ) .
In other words , no attempt should be made to eliminate capitalism in general , and capitalism in the countryside in particular .
Gorbachev style , pretending to stand for some sort of control of the market , Trotsky 's method of controlling the market is to leave it to the market to control itself !
" The regulation of the market , " he says , " itself must depend upon the tendencies that are brought about through its medium . " ( p. 30 ) .
Every revolutionary giant stride forward of the Soviet economy at that time , because outside the market , is portrayed by this high priest of market socialism as disorder and " economic chaos . "
He says :
" By eliminating the market and installing instead Asiatic bazaars the bureaucracy has created ... the conditions for the most barbaric gyrations of prices and consequently has placed a mine under commercial calculations .
As a result economic chaos has been redoubled . " ( p. 34 ) .
Trotsky , who in December 1925 , at the 14th Party Congress of the CPSU , had tried to force on the Party the policy of immediate collectivisation of the peasantry , when the conditions necessary for such collectivisation were totally lacking , this same Trotsky in 1933 , when collectivisation was well on the way to completion , comes out in opposition to the policy of liquidating the kulaks as a class , demanding instead the establishment of " a policy of severely restricting the exploiting tendencies of the kulaks . " ( p. 47 ) .
In other words , capitalism must not be eliminated in the countryside .
Praying for miracles Trotsky declares : " Commodities must be adapted to human needs ... "
Trotsky 's position amounts to this : ' Economic accounting is unthinkable without market relations . '
In view of this , it is hardly surprising that Trotsky came to the conclusion that : " It is necessary to put off the Second Five - Year Plan .
Away with shrieking enthusiasm ! " ( p. 41 ) .
No wonder then that Stalin , in his Report to the 17th Party Congress ( 26 January 1934 ) made the following observation on the Trotskyist programme :
" We have always said that the ' Lefts ' are in fact Rights who mask their Rightness by Left phrases .
Now the ' Lefts ' themselves confirm the correctness of our statement .
Take last year 's issues of the Trotskyist ' Bulletin .
What do Messieurs the Trotskyists demand , what do they write about in what does their ' Left ' programme find expression ?
They demand : THE DISSOLUTION OF THE STATE FARMS , on the grounds that they do not pay , THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLECTIVE FARMS , on the grounds that they are fictitious , the ABANDONMENT OF THE POLICY OF ELIMINATING THE KULAKS , REVERSION TO THE POLICY OF CONCESSIONS , AND THE LEASING TO CONCESSIONAIRES OF A NUMBER OF OUR INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES , on the grounds that they do not pay .
" There you have the programme of these contemptible cowards and capitulators – their counter - revolutionary programme for restoring capitalism in the USSR !
" What difference is there between this programme and that of the extreme Rights ?
Clearly , there is none .
It follows that the Lefts ' have openly associated themselves with the counter - revolutionary programme of the Rights in order to enter into a bloc with them and to wage a joint struggle against the Party . "
( Stalin , Collected Works , Vol. 13 , pp. 370-371 .
Trotsky 's anti-Soviet diatribes are grist to the imperialist mill
Although bourgeois economics learnt nothing from Trotsky 's Soviet Economy in Danger , seeing as he had but repeated , in a clumsy way , what had been said a decade earlier by bourgeois economists such as Von Mises and Brutzkus , it was nevertheless extensively quoted in the imperialist press by the bourgeois critics of socialist construction , for it enabled them to stress that their ' objective ' and ' impartial ' critiques of socialism , and their dogma that it was impossible for society to free itself of the market , were fully accepted by this ' old Bolshevik ' .
( For a fuller treatment of this subject , the reader is referred to chapter 11 of my book Perestroika – the Complete Collapse of Revisionism ) .
Trotsky 's diatribes against the Soviet regime were grasped with alacrity by the German and Italian fascists : " See , my friends , " said Goebbels to the German socialists and communists , " what Trotsky is saying about the Soviet state .
It is no longer a Socialist State but a state dominated by a parasitic bureaucracy , living on the Russian people . " ( see Appendix 2 ) These and similar arguments , broadcast by the fascists as well as other imperialist states , were designed to weaken both the faith the masses might have in the USSR as well as their faith in themselves , in their capacity to build a new life for themselves .
These Trotskyist arguments were , and continue to be , seized upon by the opponents of communism in the Labour movement as well as by the radical petty - bourgeois intelligentsia .
Trotskyism thus performed , and continues to perform , the function of confusing and disarming the working - class movement politically and ideologically .
Flying in the face of all reality , ignoring the developments in socialist construction in the USSR , Trotsky continued to predict disaster and to advocate the overthrow of the ' Stalinist bureaucracy ' – a euphemism for the Leninist leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state – in other words , the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat .
in an article written in October 1933 , Trotsky predicted the restoration of capitalism if ' Stalinist bureaucracy ' continued to hold sway :
" The further unhindered development of bureaucratism must lead inevitably to the cessation of economic and cultural growth , to a terrible social crisis and to the downward plunge of the entire society .
But this would imply not only the collapse of the proletarian dictatorship but also the end of bureaucratic domination .
In place of the workers ' state would come not ' social bureaucratic ' but capitalist relations . "
( The Class Nature of the Soviet State ) .
In February 1935 Trotsky predicted the " inevitable collapse of the Stalinist political regime " and its replacement by fascist - capitalist counterrevolution " , unless the removal of the Soviet regime came " as a conscious act of the proletarian vanguard , " to wit , the same Trotskyist counter - revolutionaries who denied the very possibility of building socialism in the first place , who tried to put every obstacle ( albeit unsuccessfully ) in the way of socialist construction , who hand in hand with the imperialist bourgeoisie slandered the Soviet state and Bolshevik Party leadership , who belittled and denigrated every single achievement of socialist industry , agriculture , science , technology and the arts and who ended up by being allies and tools of German and Japanese fascism !!
These very contemptible cowards and counter - revolutionaries , these ardent advocates of the programme of capitalist restoration , in the topsy - turvy world of Trotskyist make - believe and intrigue , convince themselves that they are the ' proletarian vanguard ' !
At the same time we are told by Trotsky that the Bolshevik Party which , following the Leninist line , not only believes in the possibility of building socialism in the USSR but is actually accomplishing it successfully in the face of internal and external difficulties and foes , is a regime of ' Bonapartism ' which is bound to make way for ' counter - revolution ' unless its removal comes about at the hands of the counter - revolutionary Trotskyists who have awarded themselves the title of " proletarian vanguard " !
" The inevitable collapse of the Stalinist political regime will lead to the establishment of Soviet democracy only in the event that the removal of Bonapartism comes as the conscious act of the proletarian vanguard
In all other cases , in place of Stalinism there could only come the fascist - capitalist counterrevolution " .
( Trotsky , The Workers ' State , Thermidor and Bonapartism ) .
Trotsky acknowledges socialist achievements as a means of gaining credibility
By the end of the Second Five - Year plan , however , even the blind could not fail to see the gigantic , truly heroic and world - historic achievements of socialist construction .
Even intelligent representatives of imperialism began to make admissions of the achievements of socialism in all walks of life of the USSR – the only country to have achieved full employment while the capitalist world was reeling under the hammer blows of recession .
Trotsky was in danger of being discredited because of the crying discrepancy between Soviet reality and Trotsky 's description of it .
So Trotsky , that most anti-Soviet of all anti-Soviets , in order to gain some credibility , was compelled to write almost effusively of the gains of socialism in the USSR , again , of course , merely as a prelude to a further scurrilous campaign of lies and slander against the Soviet regime .
In his Revolution Betrayed ( 1933 ) , he writes :
" Gigantic achievements in industry , enormously promising beginnings in agriculture , an extraordinary growth of the old industrial cities and a building of new ones , a rapid increase of the number of workers , a rise in cultural level and cultural demands – such are the indubitable results of the October revolution ...
" Socialism has demonstrated its fight to victory , not in the pages of ' Das Kapital ' but in an industrial arena comprising a sixth part of the earth 's surface – not in the language of dialectics , but in the language of steel cement ; and electricity ... a backward country has achieved in less than ten years successes unexampled in history .
" This also ends the quarrel with the reformists in the workers ' movement .
Can we compare for one moment their mouse - like fussing with the titanic work accomplished by this people aroused to a new life by revolution ?... " ( p. 16 ) .
Thus quite mysteriously , and without any explanation let alone a correction or an apology from Trotsky , we find that the " smug , negative , disdainful cliquish , bureaucratic apparatus , " characterised on the one hand by " inertia " and on the other by " antagonistic violence towards criticism , " staffed with only " careerists and political hangers - on " who are so divorced from reality as to be in danger of losing support of the masses and forfeiting state dominance to the " counter - revolutionary tendencies " among " retailers , middlemen ... and kulaks – this bureaucratic apparatus " , i.e. , the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state , has somehow risen to the occasion and organised " ten years of successes unexampled in history . " !
Normally Trotskyism paints a picture of the Soviet people being ordered about and herded around by the ' Stalinist bureaucracy ' , meekly and sullenly accepting their fate .
–
Yet in some pages of this book , which are characteristically contradicted by some other pages in the same book , Trotsky describes the enthusiasm with which the Soviet youth plunged into economic , cultural and artistic activity , in the following glowing terms :
" To be sure , the youth are very active in the sphere of economics .
In the Soviet Union there are now 1.2 million Communist Youth in the collective farms .
Hundreds of thousands of members of the Communist Youth have been mobilised during recent years for construction work timber work coal mining .
gold production ; for work in the Arctic , Sakhalin , or in Amur where the new town of Komsomolsk is in process of construction .
The new generation is putting out shock brigades , champion workers , Stakhanovites , foremen ; under administrators .
The youth are studying and a considerable part of them are studying assiduously .
They are as active , if not more so , in the sphere of athletics in its most daring or war - like forms such as parachute jumping and marksmanship .

MarketWatch is reporting Retail sales jump 1.4 % , biggest gain in 16 months
Gasoline , clothing , autos lead higher - than - expected gains for May .
U.S. retail sales rose by 1.4 % in May , the largest seasonally adjusted gain in 16 months , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday .
The report should reassure markets and policymakers that consumers are regaining their footing after a very weak start to the spring .
Economists had thought consumers would slow their pace of spending in the second quarter in the face of much higher gasoline prices .
Estimates for second - quarter growth will be pushed higher than the current 3 % median forecast .
Lehman Bros. bumped its estimate to 4 % from 3.6 % .
April 's sales were revised higher by a tenth to a 0.1 % decline .
Inflation accounted for much of the sales gain in May , but by no means all of it .
Gasoline sales rose 3.8 % , driven by record prices at the pump .
Sales excluding gas rose 1.2 % .
Gas prices are expected to ease slightly , but remain above $ 3 a gallon for the remainder of the summer , the Energy Department estimated Tuesday .
Conundrum ?
What Conundrum ?
things # 1
things # 2
Retail sales in the U.S. jumped by the most in more than a year last month as Americans flocked to shopping malls , undeterred by record gasoline prices and falling home values , determined to empty their wallets of all traces of dollar - denominated paper and plastic .
Retail sales are now running at a plus 5 % pace year - over - year .
The increase was broad - based with clothing and clothing accessories stores up 7.8 % and sales of nonstore retailers up 7.7 % , the report said .
Even retailers that had previously seen declines related to housing weakness showed increases , with furniture retailers ' sales rising 0.3 % and building material and garden supplies dealers rising 2.1 % .
No categories showed decreases in the report .
But wait , how can this be happening ?
Are n't rising prices for gasoline and food combining with declining home prices to conspire against retail sales and consumer spending ?
Those very questions lead us to today 's Number Two ...
Import prices rose 0.9 % in May after the 1.4 % jump in April , according to the Labor Department .
Expectations were for a more modest increase of 0.2 % .
Naturally , petroleum was a significant factor , up 2.7 % in May , though that increase was far below the 6.6 % increase in April .
But the report exceeded expectations even ex-petroleum , up 0.5 % in May ( the largest gain since last November ) thanks to a rise in industrial materials such as metals , which increased in price for the sixth month out of seven .
Excluding all fuels import prices rose 0.4 % , which was the largest increase in nearly a year .
Also of note , though undermentioned , capital goods imports were flat , but that follows three consecutive months of declining prices for capital goods imports .
Finally , consumer goods - ex automotive prices were again flat in May .
The surge in imported inflation should keep everyone on edge ahead of tomorrow 's Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index data .
And so we have the " New Conundrum " - consumer spending rising in the face of increasing prices paid for gas and food , and declining prices received for homes and labor .
Another Conumdrum
Details
Auto sales rose 1.8 % , the government said , but the automakers reported a decline in unit sales .
Sales at the malls were strong according to the government ( the biggest increase in 19 months ) despite tepid reports from the retail chains .
A Big Disconnect
A few months ago , it looked like the U.S. economy was on its sickbed .
The economy grew at an anemic 0.6 % pace in the first quarter .
And the future looked a little bleak , with the continuing collapse of the housing market , the slump in the factory sector and a credit - strapped consumer faced with $ 3.25 - a - gallon gas .
Now , that 's all forgotten ( except that housing is still mired in the swamp ) .
The consumer is back .
Wednesday 's retail - sales data from the Commerce Department were uniformly strong -- the best since early 2006 .
However , the retail giants did n't report a blockbuster month in May .
In fact , they were working hard to lower expectations and issuing warnings that the consumer would n't be free spending if gas prices stayed high .
Automobile makers had another off month .
There 's a big disconnect between the government 's spending data and what the companies are reporting .
It could take months to sift through the differences .
Inquiring minds might be asking where 's the conundrum ?
There are at least two .
For the first let 's check outandin today 's Five Things with Kevin Depew on Minyanville .
Kevin Depew was talking about retail sales and import prices in those things .
1. Retail Sales2 .
Import Prices
That 's the conundrum that Kevin sees .
Perhaps another mammoth jump in the negative savings rate will show up later to help explain it .
I see a different conundrum .
The devil as usual is in the details :
Why the difference between what the government is saying and retailers are reporting ?
I 'm not the only one asking that question .
Please consider Financial markets reeling from economy 's turn
So who do you believe , the government or the retail stores ?
Either ?
Before you answer , Scott Reamer on Minyanville pinged me with this comment : " Commerce rigs this data all the time and goes through wrenching revisions later on .
The net of the data is this : retail sales less autos , bldg materials and gas stations ( so called core retail sales ) were up 2.6 % y/y .
The CPI is up 2.6 % y/y. Voila ... you have effectively 0 % real core retail sales in May and that is WITH their gaming the numbers .

This political process of ours is fascinating to witness , on the eve of a new primary season ripe for change after President Bush and two failed Congresses have plunged the nation 's wealth distribution some 100 years backwards to the days of the robber barons .
We are 5 years into a staged war whose cost is still hidden , leaving us a grim economic outlook , record debt with spiraling interest and our military readiness at dangerous lows .
Our most valued industries have been parceled out to multinationals and our financial markets are artificially held together by nations who sell us goods or hold our debt .
Unfortunately , as a nation we have learned almost nothing from this - we stand poised to elect leaders who will not be confronting many of these issues .
The 2006 election showed how slow people are to wake up , even when faced with the prospect of endless war and a host of unconstitutional improprieties staring us in the face .
The basis of our electoral system is legal bribery , with corporate cash and special interests speaking many times louder then the will of the people on almost every issue .
2006 's electoral outcome gave the US a reversal of power in appearance only - the slim majority afforded the Dems has done nothing to stop the war , the # 1 concern cited by voters .
The current Congress wo n't stop the torture or wiretapping or the defense contract cronyism without oversight .
Faced with this , what is the 2008 voter to do ?
Let 's look at the choices , but let 's play out the scenarios too .
And in each case , let 's look critically at the process by which we decide who to vote for - and check our own decision - making and ethics as American citizens who all have a duty to participate , enforcing the Constitution the country was founded upon .
If Hillary is nominated , the anti-war movement loses again - she is the worst of the Dems on her war record , waiting far too long to apologize for her ill - advised vote for the invasion of Iraq .
There would be no national " mandate " for pulling out because the right knows she simply followed national opinion .
Also anticipate Whitewater , Filegate , Travelgate , Monica Lewinsky and various other scandals being thoroughly revisited in a general election , as well as the litany of improprieties between Rose Law and the Pan - Asian donor scandals which are still making fresh news to this day .
Fast forwarding to November , a Hillary nomination is probably the best shot for putting a Republican in the White House - any other Dem would bore the right - wing base and keep them home on election day .
Edwards has a positive theme - reuniting the two Americas .
His stand on combating corporate influence is admirable and he has spoken about reforming elections .
I 'd like to see these things prioritized , but I think Edwards ' health care plan is compromised by the fact that he'd keep the corporate profiteers in the equation , expecting government care to compete with private care .
This sounds like it will be " two Americas " of medicine , no ?
Edwards also voted for the war while millions worldwide marched in protest , skeptical and distrustful of the military - industrial influence on Washington .
How did I know it sounded fishy in pre-invasion 2003 without any inside information ?
Edwards has apologized , but remains a candidate whose election would not be the all - out anti-war clarion call needed .
His detractors would probably swift - boat his legal career , painting him as a sleazy shark lawyer who got rich chasing huge personal injury awards , but Edwards would probably get a large turn out from the disenfranchised and middle class .
Since he has vehemently and vocally opposed the Iraq war from the start , his election would also signal the end of the era of privatized defense profiteering and a loud , clear mandate for ending the war and bringing home the troops .
His plans to create a " Green " department and a " Peace " department signal his stands on the environment and foreign policy , but one of his other biggest issues has been his desire to repeal NAFTA so as to resurrect American jobs and manufacturing .
Though the Kucinich message may be the most doggedly pro-America , pro-Constitution and anti-corruption , his showing in polls only reveals how much image and popularity play into our candidate choices .
Ron Paul is worth mention because he shows how anxious many Americans are for anti-establishment alternatives , especially in the GOP where the unpopular Iraq war compromises the front running candidates all marching in lock - step .
Perhaps the greatest moment in '08 campaigning so far was when Paul stunned a GOP debate crowd , sharing the belief that 9/11 was the result of " blowback " for decades of black bag operations carried out by US intelligence agencies in the MidEast , including installation of puppet rulers , propagandizing , or aiding and then deserting thugs like Osama bin Laden , Saddam Hussein , and the Taliban .
This truth has invigorated many within the right to rally behind Paul who advocates peace , removing US troops from all foreign countries , and a general non-interventionist strategy for economic cooperation around the globe , restoring personal and collective liberties at home .
This is ironically , a message more strictly adherent to traditional Conservativism then espoused by any of the other candidates , talk show hosts or pundits sympathetic to the illusory " neo-con " ideology .
Paul 's negatives aside , these qualities should be noted by all candidates - refreshing honesty about Iraq and US involvement abroad resonates deeply .
Sadly , the greatest factors involved in deciding our President are not related to the content of their message : the factors are related more to the amount of TV advertising , media coverage , physical appearance , and perceived electability .
TV advertising time is the greatest determinate , meaning the candidates that raise the most money will likely prevail .
This leaves candidates beholden to whomever provides this money ( still mostly corporations , PACs and SIGs , legally " bundling " contributions to outweigh private donations from individuals ) .
Also key are the enormous media megaconglomerates upon whose airwaves these ads play - they end up with all this money that comes through the candidates .
Even more shameful are American aesthetic considerations .
Network commentators openly discuss whether candidates look or sound " presidential " .
The media is wholly complicit in the avoidance of issues - based discussions , because they can't sell aftershave and hemorrhoid cream as easily to a well - informed , discerning public .
So debates on a candidates ' haircut or cleavage may dominate the conversation .
But the media is also hiding political preferences , with each major network acting as squire for it 's corporate overlord .
If Time - Warner will make billions after cable deregulation and setting up " premium " internet tiers , why would it ever cover candidates who insist on net neutrality ?
If big pharma and defense contractors are major sponsors , how can medical studies or war coverage on these channels ever be trusted ?
Answer : they can't .
Individual voters are simply gullible - ask around the watercooler or at the local bar , not who their choices are but why .
A new body of research presented Dr. Drew Westen 's book The Political Brain " The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of a Nation shows convincing proof that Americans have voted with their hearts , not their heads for decades .
One chapter shows that our brains shut down logic functions when shown proof that challenges beliefs we 've previously held - for example , reciting John Kerry quotes that contradict each other to a staunch supporter , the logic centers in the subject 's brain show no activity while the emotional centers flare like fire alarms , looking for rationalizations , excuses and comebacks .

HAVANA–Canadian Mary McCarthy lives in the same mansion she and her millionaire husband moved into 62 years ago in the once - posh Country Club area of Havana .
Peacocks still strut the garden under royal palm trees , but the lawn is overgrown and the house filled with Napoleon III furniture , chandeliers and a Steinway grand piano is falling apart .
At the age of 107 , McCarthy is wheelchair - bound , but still dresses up for visitors in a satin dress , silk blouse and chiffon scarf , red lipstick colouring her wrinkled face .
Her pearl necklace and earrings , though , are plastic .
Her real jewellery and the small fortune she inherited when she was widowed in 1951 have been frozen in a Boston bank since the United States placed Cuba under sanctions after Fidel Castro 's leftist revolution in 1959 .
That 's because she lived in Cuba and did not leave with most of her wealthy Cuban neighbours who fled to Miami when Castro nationalized businesses and steered the Caribbean nation toward Soviet communism .
The Cuban government confiscated her properties and her husband 's leather factory , assets valued at $ 4 million ( U.S. ) , and she was left only with " Villa Mary , " a dilapidated mansion in need of repairs where she lives in virtual poverty .
Since January this year the U.S. government has let her withdraw a $ 96 a month allowance from her U.S. bank after Canadian diplomats interceded on her behalf .
McCarthy is asking U.S. President George W. Bush to free her money so that she can live her remaining days with dignity .
She would also like to have her family 's " trinkets " released .
" They said they could n't give it to me because I live in Cuba .
That 's the only money that I have left .
It is in Boston , but I live in Cuba , that 's the great terrible , terrible thing , " she said during a recent visit to her home .
" The only thing I want it for is medicines and my doctor .
I do n't even want to buy candy out of it , " she said .
Framed congratulations from Pope John Paul , the Queen and former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien on her 100th birthday hang on walls in need of a coat of paint .
Pictures on a sitting room table include Castro in his trademark green military fatigues greeting a lively McCarthy during an embassy reception for Chrétien when he visited in 1997 .
McCarthy , who was born in St. John's , Nfld. , in 1900 , met Spanish - born businessman Pedro Gomez Cueto at the opera in Boston .
He swept the 24 - year - old music student off her feet and down to Havana , a city booming on the wealth of sugar barons and a playground for the rich .
Gomez Cueto made his fortune manufacturing boots for soldiers at his Havana heel factory during World War II .
As a member of Cuba 's high society , McCarthy co-founded the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra , played golf at the Country Club , funded charities and danced at lavish parties at the Havana Yacht Club that she can barely remember today .
After Castro and his guerrillas took power in 1959 , the Canadian widow visited her wealthy friends in their Miami exile .
McCarthy decided to go home and wait it out .
Four decades later , Castro 's government is still in power , though the ailing Cuban leader has not appeared in public for a whole year , and Mary McCarthy is as cash - strapped as Cuba 's state - run economy .
Last year Stan Keyes , the Canadian consul general in Boston at the time , wrote to the U.S. Treasury office that enforces sanctions against Cuba , to request the transfer of her funds to Canada .
" She is an unfortunate , albeit unintentional , victim of political circumstances , " Keyes wrote .
" She relies on charity .
She deserves to live the rest of her days in comfort . "
Responding to U.S. officials who suggested McCarthy leave Cuba and return to Canada , Keyes said she was no longer able to withstand a harsh Canadian winter .
McCarthy has been confined to a wheelchair since she fell and broke her hip in 2002 .
A devout Catholic , she prays after tea every day .
Her godson Elio Garcia wheels her to a darkened lobby where , under the gaze of a marble statue of Salome , she prays with a rosary to Cuba 's Virgin of Charity .
McCarthy figures in the last edition of the 1960 Anglo - American directory of Cuba .
Her address is still the same .
With an install rate of more than 5 % on Windows PCs worldwide , uTorrent is now by far the most popular BitTorrent client .
Azureus , the most installed BitTorrent application of last year fell back to the third place .
The graph on the right ( click to enlarge ) is based on data published by Digital Music News based on reports from PC Pitstop , a company that gathers data by “ inspecting ” the computers of users that try their free online virus / spyware scanners .
The data used in this report are collected from Windows registry and table entries of over a million PC’s .
The percentages reflect the percentage of PCs that has these applications installed .
September last year Azureus was installed on more than 3 % of all PCs but their install rate has declined by more than 30 % this year , while uTorrent ’s install rate nearly tripled .
In the table below we have listed the 5 most installed BitTorrent applications .
It is interesting to not that Azureus moved from the first to the third spot over the past year .
The BitTorrent mainline client is now runner up .
This means that BitTorrent Inc. now owns the two most popular BitTorrent clients .
The percentages in the table indicate the install base of the most popular BitTorrent clients :
Rank Application Installed on % Desktops 1 . uTorrent 5.56 % 2 . BitTorrent ( a.k.a. mainline ) 2.28 % 3 . Azureus 2.11 % 4 . Bitcomet 1.89 % 5 . Bitlord 1.27 %
From the data where the report is based on we further learn that Limewire ’s popularity is slowly declining .
However , with an install base of almost 18 % it is still the P2P application that is installed on most desktop computers .
Unfortunately Digital Music
News has trouble interpreting their own data , they claim in their press release that it is 36.4 % , but that is the market share compared to other P2P clients ( shame on you ! ) .
Apart from this tiny mistake , there are a few more concerns about the usability of the data .
For example , install rates do not equal usage .
The fact that someone installed a P2P client does not mean that they actually use it .
So the report ca n’t say much about the popularity of a filesharing network or application .
Secondly , it could be that Azureus and BitTorrent Mainline are installed on almost an equal number of PCs , but that the BitTorrent mainline client is hardly ever used .
For instance , novices may start with the mainline client , but move on to better BitTorrent clients later on .
Lastly , the report is based on a sample of people who voluntarily did an online spyware scan , something to think about .
Perhaps an even more important comment on the data collection for this report , uTorrent does n’t necessarily use the Windows registry .
So the real install rate for uTorrent might be even higher .
Also , Azureus is a true multi-platform client , whilst this test is only for windows based systems .
In summing up we think it is ( despite all the flaws ) safe to say that uTorrent is becoming more popular while Azureus is losing ground .
Whether this is due to negative factors affecting Azureus ( such as the rebranding to Vuze , Java or the heavy use of resources ) , or positive factors around the mainline and ÂµTorrent clients ( such as the small install size , and low system requirements ) it certainly shows a slide for Azureus .
Finally : Data Structure Constants in Erlang
Here 's a simple Erlang function to enclose some text in a styled paragraph , returning a deep list :
para( Text ) -> [ " < p class= \ " normal\ " > " , Text , " < / p > " ] .
Prior to the new R12B release of Erlang , this little function had some less than ideal behavior .
Every time para was called , the two constant lists ( a.k.a. strings ) were created , which is to say that there were n't true data structure constants in Erlang .
Each string was built - up , letter by letter , via a series of BEAM virtual machine instructions .
The larger the constant , the more code there was to generate it , and the more time it took to generate .
Because a new version of each string was created for each para call , there was absolutely no sharing of data .
If para was called 200 times , 400 strings were created ( 200 of each ) .
Remember , too , that each element of a list / string in 32 - bit Erlang is 8 bytes .
Doing the math on this example is mildly unsettling : 22 characters * 8 bytes per character * 200 instances = 35,200 bytes of " constant " string data .
As a result of more data being created , garbage collection occurred more frequently and took longer ( because there was more live data ) .
Years ago , this problem was solved in HIPE , the standard native code compiler for Erlang , by putting constant data structures into a pool .
Rather than using BEAM instructions to build constants , each constant list or tuple or more complex structure is simply a pointer into the pool .
For some applications , such as turning a tree into HTML , the HIPE approach is a significant win .
And now , finally , as of the December 2007 R12B release , true data structure constants are supported in BEAM .

IS IT distressing to experience consciousness slipping away or something people can accept with equanimity ?
Are there any surprises in store as our existence draws to a close ?
These are questions that have plagued philosophers and scientists for centuries , and chances are you ’ve pondered them too occasionally .
None of us can know the answers for sure until our own time comes , but the few individuals who have their brush with death interrupted by a last - minute reprieve can offer some intriguing insights .
Advances in medical science , too , have led to a better understanding of what goes on as the body gives …
Object oriented programming provides a useful modelling paradigm based on hierarchies and tree shaped abstractions .
Reality however is not always hierarchical , highlights Neal Ford .
Its “ tangled branches and interconnections ” are rather difficult to model with idealized tree pictures .
And this results in a widespread use of aspects and XML and eventually adds complexity undermining the very purpose of abstraction .
To remedy to this issue the abstraction level should be upgraded and to this end Ford suggests using languages rather than hierarchies as a modelling mechanism .
According to Martin Fowler object - oriented domain modelling allows to “ build up a vocabulary ” but the grammar – ways to combine these vocabularies – is not defined ; DSLs add this grammar side .
Therefore language - oriented programming inducts “ this shift of moving from thinking about vocabulary , which is objects , to the notion of a language that combines vocabulary and grammar . ”
For Neal Ford , what makes the use of DSLs as a new abstraction mechanism particularly interesting is its ability to supply context .
In a context free environment one should “ start at the lowest level possible of understanding and have to explain every single detail ” .
This is the way one talks to APIs and frameworks because they do not have " any sort of context built into " them .
Hence the code is full of repeated context often perceived as noise .
DSLs on the contrary “ always have an implicit context that shows up either not at all or shows up in a very , very light way and usually at the most one time ” .
Thus this context does n’t have to be supplied over and over again , which makes the code more readable and more expressive .
Both Fowler and Ford stress how critical the readability issue is .
They insist that the purpose of DSLs is often misunderstood .
It is not to make it possible for business analysts to write code but to make it possible for them to read and to review it , in order to bridge the gap separating professional developers and business people .
Some are reluctant to use the language oriented programming style because of possible maintainability issues and increasing learning burden , especially given the lack of rich IDEs for the plain text DSLs .
Fowler , who argued in his recent article that “ larger frameworks [ … ] present as much of a challenge to learn as a language ” , emphasizes again the complexity of projects written in a single language .
Moreover , Neal Ford stresses that if a DSL is hard to read then it was very poorly designed because “ one of the goals [ of using DSLs is ] to create more readable code ” .
As for IDE support there are today at least three major vendors offering this kind of tooling to support language oriented programming : Intentional Software developed by Charles Simonyi , Microsoft ’s Software Factories , Meta Programming System developed by JetBrains .
These tools , referred to as Language Workbenches by Martin Fowler , make it easier to design and then to use DSLs .
This increases the competitive advantage of the language oriented programming style even though Fowler believes that it “ is going to be a few years before most people can think about using [ Language Workbenches ] for real projects . ”
What is your opinion ?
Does language oriented programming have a chance to become “ the next big thing ” ?
And to which extent the availability of language workbenches tools could affect your decision to use DSLs on your projects ?

Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protest at a memorial to soldiers killed in combat
" Hiding in plain sight " , the Americans call it , and the expression came to my mind as I sat in Kansas City airport waiting for an ice storm to pass .
Hiding in plain sight in this state is a revolution in American Christendom , a change of heart that could see American Protestant churches looking increasingly like their European equivalents .
The state of Kansas gets a bad press .
It is huge and empty and mostly flat .
In the summer it is uncomfortably hot and prone to tornadoes .
In the winter it can be bitterly cold .
Its big cities are not very big and rather grey .
It is not in the culinary avant garde .
In the airport cafe they have introduced nutritional advice next to their meals : the fresh strawberries are described as containing no trans - fats - which is a relief , I suppose - but only in Kansas could it be a surprise .
A million Kansans will be taking their Bibles to church in the coming week but they will not be bashing them
Kansas has also long been home to religious revivals and eccentric preachers , a few of them deeply wacky , to put it mildly .
Creationists , for instance , keep up a constant low - level guerrilla war in this state and , if that is insufficiently odd for you , try going to Topeka to see the Reverend Fred Phelps and his flock at the Westboro Baptist Church .
' God 's punishment '
They entertain themselves by turning up at public events with placards saying : " God hates gays " .
Their campaign against homosexuals came to national prominence when they protested ( and this really did happen ) at the funerals of soldiers who had been killed in Iraq .
Mr Phelps still grabs horrified attention from foreigners and Americans alike
The sexual orientation of the individual soldiers was not the issue .
According to the church , all Americans who die there are part of a punishment God is visiting on the United States because of his profound dislike of homosexuality in this country .
The point is that Pastor Phelps and his followers are not much liked by anyone inside or outside Kansas .
The " burning at the stake " wing of America 's Christian churches - the wing that stresses vengeance over love - is in trouble .
The gentle , Nativity - scene crowd are the ones on the up .
Mr Phelps still grabs horrified attention from foreigners and Americans alike but most religious Kansans ( and that means most Kansans ) are becoming steadily less aggressive : not less religious but less intolerant .
Opinion polls suggest that younger evangelical Christians are falling out of love with the " big causes " their churches have championed in recent years , in particular with opposing abortion and supporting the Iraq war .
Fire and brimstone
This change is nowhere clearer than in Wichita in southern Kansas .
The Reverend Terry Fox is a man you would have considered until recently to be a typical Wichita preacher : a fire and brimstone merchant .
His sermon , delivered in staccato bursts , with heavy breathing for effect , concentrates on sin , in particular the sin of murdering babies in the womb .
" I am proud to be called the religious right , " he blasts .
" I am religious and I am right ! "
On the day I met him there was " good news " : hundreds of thousands of foreigners had just been converted to Christianity including many Muslims .
You would expect the Rev Fox in God-fearing Kansas , to be preaching in a mega- church , an establishment big enough to cope with the crowds .
And until recently he was : the Immanuel Baptist Church near the centre of town was his .
It was easily spotted because of the huge , tubular , white cross , 100 ft ( 30 metres ) high and heated from the inside so that it does not freeze and topple over .
But the Rev Fox 's cross is all that is left of his ministry at the old place .
He tells me it was time to move on but most locals think he was thrown out for being too dogmatic , too extreme , even in Wichita .
Major change
To see Rev Fox in action , I had to go to the Best Western hotel out among the tattier motels and gas stations on the far outskirts of town .
They clear a central atrium for him , they turn down the muzak , they put away the tinselly plastic Christmas trees , and several hundred turn up for a cheerful haranguing .
Rev
Fox is not about to be run out of town but he is metaphorically , as well as literally , on the outskirts now .
His hatred of abortion , his contempt for gay rights , his support for the Iraq war have all led him to his current predicament .
At his old church , the new pastor tells me sniffily that he has never had the pleasure of meeting Rev Fox .
The concerns of his ministry are , he said , human rights and the environment .
Golly , this is a big change .
I have come to town to speak to these people about whether they still support the Republican Party but that is a minor issue , it seems to me , compared with the much bigger question of how they still support God .
Hidden in plain sight this Christmas , is the softening of evangelical America .
A million Kansans will be taking their Bibles to church in the coming week but they will not be bashing them .

Claim : Bert , the Sesame Street muppet , appeared on posters carried by supporters of Osama bin Laden .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via Facebook , October 2001 ]
Did Bert from ‘ Sesame Street ’ really appear on posters carried by bin Laden supporters ?
Did Bert from ‘ Sesame Street ’ really appear on posters carried by bin Laden supporters ?
Origins : Eh ?
Is that really Bert , the irascible muppet partner of Ernie on TV’s Sesame Street , peering over the left shoulder of Osama on posters displayed by bin Laden supporters ?
How did he get there ?
The process that turned Bert into a henchman of evil was as follows :
Dino Ignacio , a San Francisco artist , started Bert is Evil ! , a humor site on which , as a running joke , he attempted to prove the muppet Bert was “ evil ” by inserting him , Zelig - like , into photographs with notorious people and infamous historical scenes .
Although Ignacio stopped updating his site a few years before the 9/11 attacks , several mirror sites kept the gag going , and “ Bert is Evil ! ” enthusiasts continued to create and post new pictures , including an image of Bert posing with Osama bin Laden :
The picture of muppet Bert with Osama bin Laden was inadvertently picked up by someone in Bangladesh scouring the web looking for photographs of Osama bin Laden to use in a collage - like poster :
Mostafa Kamal , production manager of Azad Products , the Dhaka shop that made the posters , said he had gotten the images off the Internet .
Mostafa Kamal , production manager of Azad Products , the Dhaka shop that made the posters , said he had gotten the images off the Internet .
“ We did not give the pictures a second look or realize what they signified until you pointed it out to us , ” he said The company had printed about 2,000 posters , and they were snapped up by the demonstrators , who were angry over the U.S. - led attacks on Afghanistan .
Kamal said he would leave out the controversial images from his next posters .
The Osama bin Laden poster — with the muppet — was displayed at rallies by pro-bin Laden protesters and appeared in photographs carried by news agencies such as Reuters and Associated Press .

A massive education bill ( 747 - page PDF ) introduced into Congress contains a provision that would force colleges and universities to offer " technology - based deterrents " to file - sharing under the pain of losing all federal financial aid .
Section 494 of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 is entitled " Campus - Based Digital Theft Prevention " that could have just as easily been called " Motion Picture and Recording Industry Subsidies , " as it could force schools into signing up for subscription - based services like Napster and Rhapsody .
Under the terms of the act , which is cosponsored by Rep. George Miller ( D - CA ) and Rep. Ruben Hinojosa ( D - TX ) , schools will have to inform students of their official policies about copyright infringement during the financial aid application and disbursement process .
In addition , students will be warned about the possible civil and criminal penalties for file - sharing as well as the steps the schools take to prevent and detect illicit P2P traffic .
That 's not all : schools would have to give students an alternative to file - sharing while evaluating technological measures ( i.e. , traffic shaping , deep packet inspection ) that they could deploy to thwart P2P traffic on campus networks .
Many — if not most — schools already closely monitor traffic on their networks , with some ( e.g. , Ohio University ) blocking it altogether , and the bill would provide grants to colleges so they could evaluate different technological solutions .
The most objectionable part of the bill is the part that could force schools into signing up for music subscription services .
In order to keep that beloved federal aid money flowing , universities would have to " develop a plan for offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property . "
Introduced in 2003 , campus - wide subscription agreements give students access to download services like Napster or Rhapsody whether they want it — or can use it ( the iPod is n't supported by any of the subscription services ) .
The services are typically funded by activity fees ; by and large , they 've been met with a collective yawn from students .
Lack of iPod support is a major turn - off , as is the fact that the subscriptions end when a student graduates or transfers , rendering the downloads unplayable .
The Motion Picture Association of America does n't see it that way .
Chairman and CEO Dan Glickman called it a positive step in the fight against file - sharing , throwing out some unsubstantiated figures on how file - sharing allegedly costs jobs and hurts the economy .
" Intellectual property theft is a worldwide problem that hurts our economy and costs more than 140,000 American jobs every year , " said Glickman in a statement .
" We are pleased to see that Congress is taking this step to help keep our economy strong by protecting copyrighted material on college campuses . "
The Association of American Universities does n't like the idea at all .
In a letter ( PDF ) sent to Rep .
Miller just before the bill was introduced , the group expressed its " grave concerns " about Section 494 of the bill .
" We urge the Education and Labor Committee to reject the entertainment industry 's proposal as it crafts its bill to reauthorize the HEA , " reads the letter .
" The proposal would mandate a completely inappropriate role for the Secretary of Education to single out individual institutions based on information under the control of the entertainment industry , force institutions to seek an unachievable goal of preventing illegal P2P file sharing , and risk the loss of student aid for countless students innocent of any illegal file sharing activity . "
This is n't the first time Congress has threatened colleges and universities over file - sharing .
In June , the House Committee on Science and Technology held hearings on the issue , with committee members telling schools that they need to explore technological measures in the battle against illicit P2P traffic .
Two months later , an amendment to the Higher Education Act was proposed by Sen. Harry Reid ( R - NV ) that would have forced schools to crack down on P2P traffic .
Schools have objected to attempts to force them to the front lines of the copyright wars .
Technological measures can be costly and are not always effective : they may not block all illicit traffic , while preventing some legitimate BitTorrent traffic from going through .
Colleges and universities do n't believe they should be forced to do the RIAA and MPAA 's dirty work , especially since current copyright law and the DMCA give both organizations several avenues by which they can enforce their copyrights .
File - sharing may be commonplace on many college campuses , but universities should n't be treated any differently than other ISPs .
The DMCA shields them from liability for the kind of traffic on their network , and removing that protection via an amendment to the Higher Education Act would create a dangerous precedent .
Turning universities into copyright cops and forcing them to spend millions of dollars on untested technological solutions in a time of rising tuition and shrinking budgets is a bad idea .
In American politics , supply - side economics is the monster that will not die .
The supply - side argument that , in the United States , tax - rate cuts pay for themselves — that , after cutting taxes , the government actually ends up with more revenue — has little or no support within the mainstream economic profession , and no hard empirical data to back it up .
Myriad studies demonstrated that both the Reagan tax cuts of the nineteen - eighties and the tax cuts put through under the current Administration shrank government revenues and led to bigger budget deficits .
Yet the absence of proof for supply - side theory has not dimmed Republicans ’ devotion to it .
Last month , President Bush told Fox News that his tax cuts had “ yielded more tax revenues , which allows us to shrink the deficit . ”
Dick Cheney insists that “ sensible tax cuts increase economic growth and add to the federal treasury . ”
Every major Republican Presidential candidate — including John McCain , who actually voted against Bush ’s 2001 tax bill — is on the record as saying that tax cuts pay for themselves .
And , just last week , a New York Sun editorial published a list of what “ the Republican Party stands for . ”
First on the list ?
“ Reductions in top marginal tax rates . . . lead to greater government revenues in the long run . ”
This supply - side orthodoxy is striking in a couple of ways .
First , it requires Republican politicians to commit themselves publicly to a position that is wrong — and wrong not as a matter of ideology or faith but as a matter of fact .
Saying today that tax cuts will increase tax revenues is not like saying that bombing Iran constitutes a sensible foreign policy , or that education vouchers will wreck the public schools .
It ’s more like saying that the best way to treat sick people is to bleed them to let out the evil spirits .
Second , despite the fact that the supply - side faith has no grounding in reality , within the Republican Party there is little room for dissent on the subject , as Jonathan Chait details in his new book , “ The Big Con . ”
Last week , the blogger Megan McArdle wrote that she had a book review for an unnamed right - wing publication spiked because in it she dared suggest that , in the U.S. , tax cuts decreased government revenues .
The cynical explanation for the persistence of the supply - side dogma is that it ’s simply cover for cutting taxes for the rich .
But the supply - side orthodoxy has flourished for other reasons , too .
To begin with , the absurd idea that tax cuts pay for themselves is based on an idea that is not at all absurd , which is that tax rates can have an impact on people ’s behavior .
Increase taxes too much , and people may work less ( since they get to keep less of the income they earn ) and invest less ( since their gains will be taxed more heavily ) , and so the economy will grow more slowly .
The opposite can happen if you cut taxes .
( How much of an impact tax rates have — and how high taxes have to get before they have an impact — is a subject of much debate in economics , but it ’s inarguable that they do matter . )
What supply - siders have done is start with that reasonable idea and extrapolate it to unreasonable lengths .
They ’re aided in that extrapolation by the simple fact that the American economy grows over time .
As a result , even if you cut taxes the federal government will eventually take in more tax revenue than it once did .
And that allows supply - siders to fashion a spurious syllogism : taxes were cut in 2001 , government revenues are higher in 2007 than they were in 2001 , therefore the tax cuts increased revenue .
The comparison that really matters in analyzing the impact of the tax cuts , of course , is not between government revenue in 2001 and government revenue in 2007 .
It ’s the comparison between actual tax revenue in 2007 and what tax revenue would have been in 2007 had there been no tax cuts in 2001 .
And studies that make these types of comparisons — including one by Bush ’s own Treasury Department that looked at the tax cuts ’ impact on economic growth — find that government revenues would be greater had taxes not been cut .
But that has n’t stopped President Bush from claiming victory .
In one sense , of course , it ’s odd that a Republican President should treat higher government revenues as a point of pride .
Historically , after all , Republicans have been the party of small government and fiscal restraint .
But , while Republicans still talk a good game about the need for spending discipline , in practice it matters far less to them than tax cutting .
After all , if tax cuts pay for themselves , then there ’s not much reason to worry about restraining government spending — we can afford it all .
In fact , if government spending grows too big , you can cut taxes again to pay for it .
The conservative pundit Larry Kudlow recently attacked the Republican candidates for failing , in their most recent debate , to explain what spending cuts they would advocate to accompany the tax cuts they propose .
But Kudlow should hardly have been surprised , because supply - side rhetoric suggests that spending cuts are n’t really necessary .
You can let people keep more of their income and increase government spending at the same time .
This tax - cut - and - spend approach is the promise of a free lunch , something that voters like to hear .
The appeal of that promise may make it easier for politicians to run a campaign .
But the fraudulence of the promise makes it awfully hard to run a government . ♦

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Fever can temporarily unlock autism ’s grip on children , a finding that could shed light on the roots of the condition and perhaps provide clues for treatment , researchers reported on Monday .
It appears that fever restores nerve cell communications in regions of the autistic brain , restoring a child ’s ability to interact and socialize during the fever , the study said .
“ The results of this study are important because they show us that the autistic brain is plastic , or capable of altering current connections and forming new ones in response to different experiences or conditions , ” said Dr. Andrew Zimmerman , a pediatric neurologist at Baltimore ’s Kennedy Krieger Institute , who was one of the study authors .
The study , published in the journal Pediatrics , was based on 30 children with autism aged 2 to 18 who were observed during and after a fever of at least 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit .
More than 80 percent of those with fever showed some improvements in behavior during it and 30 percent had dramatic improvements , the researchers said .
The change involved things like longer concentration spans , more talking , improved eye contact and better overall relations with adults and other children .
Zimmerman ’s team said the fever effect had been noted anecdotally in the past by parents and doctors .
Lee Grossman , president and chief executive officer of the Autism Society of America , said he had noticed it in his own son , who is now 20 .
But he noted in an interview that the study ’s authors said expanded research was needed on the fever effect and its implications .
“ It ’s good that they ’ve noticed this and are bringing it forward , ” he said .
People with autism spectrum disorders suffer in varying degrees from limited social interactions , lack of verbal and non-verbal communication and other abilities .
As many as 1.5 million Americans have some form of autism , according to ASA .
It is not known what causes the condition .
Zimmerman said that while there currently is no definitive medical treatment , speech and language therapy started as soon as possible after diagnosis “ can make a significant difference . ”
He called the fever research , headed by colleague Laura Curran , “ an exciting lead ” that could help point the way to a treatment that would reconnect the autistic brain .
He said the fever effect was believed found only in children , whose brains are more “ plastic ” than those of adults .

We 've come to expect Republicans to do the wrong thing over and over again .
That 's why no one was surprised that virtually every Republican in the House and Senate voted for President Bush 's revisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
But why did 16 Democratic Senators and 41 Democratic House members vote to expand Bush 's authority to spy on the international telephone calls and e-mails of Americans ?
Why should a president who has admitted and expressed his pride in repeatedly breaking FISA for nearly six years be given more authority to spy on Americans ?
Why should the law be changed so that his illegal spying would be now be legal ?
Even more outrageous , why should the power to authorize the spying now rest with the attorney general and the director of national intelligence , rather than with the special court that was created in 1978 to regulate spying requests ?
Few Democrats wanted to ask these questions .
Too many are still afraid of standing up to the president and his allies in the news media .
Too many are afraid of seeing campaign commercials from their Republican opponents painting them as soft on terrorism for voting against this bill .
Too many are afraid of Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and the rest of the right - wing barking heads attacking their patriotism .
Too many are more concerned about saving their own hides than saving the Constitution .
Why did so many Democrats fall for Bush 's " vote for this bill or the terrorists will kill us all " nonsense ?
They should have been smart enough to recognize this bill for what it is â€ ” another power grab by an administration that recognizes no limits on its power .
Because of the actions of the Democrats who voted their fears rather than their principles , the vast abuses and criminal acts committed by the Bush White House in its various surveillance programs will remain undisclosed and uninvestigated .
There are now no limits to what the administration can do .
And while the Democrats who voted for this bill can rationalize their vote by saying " it 's only for six months and next time , we 'll be able to make changes and rewrite this law properly , " we can almost guarantee that the administration will make the same feeble arguments and the Democrats will put up the same feeble defense .
Does anyone still remember why FISA was created in the first place ?
Back in the mid-1970s , congressional investigations uncovered countless abuses by the FBI , CIA and other government agencies .
They involved the collection of intelligence about the political advocacy and actions of American citizens .
That information was used to destroy the lives and reputations of those whom the government deemed " subversive . "
That is why the laws were rewritten â€ ” to put limits on domestic surveillance .
The Bush administration , which has failed to obey these laws for nearly six years , was coming under increased legal pressure .
But the Democrats have just allowed Bush to not only get away with his years of lawlessness , but to expand that lawlessness further .
For every American who believes in the Constitution and the rule of law , these are dangerous times .
The core liberties that our nation 's constitutional framework secures are under attack .
The checks and balances to preserve those liberties and protect us from tyranny are nearly gone .
As we 've seen time and time again , the Bush administration does n't care what Congress or the American people think .
President Bush long ago decided it does n't have to follow any law that he does n't like .
He can defy Congress , secure in the knowledge that he can get away with it .
That 's because Congress still refuses to impeach Bush despite the multitude of crimes he and his administration have committed .
We are in a dangerous time for our Constitution and our country .
If Congress wishes to remain a meaningful and independent branch of our government , it must rein in the executive branch .
The tool for doing this is impeachment .
The time for doing this is now .

This map shows the stars within the dwarf galaxy Andromeda XII found to have fallen for the first time into the Local Group of galaxies .
Updated7:26 p.m. Eastern
HONOLULU ?Agalactic tourist has drifted from its hometown into the neighborhood of the Milky Way , marking the first clear evidence of a dwarf galaxy entering theso - called Local Group of galaxies .
Thetraveling galaxy is the fastest known galaxy in this region and could sweepthrough the Local Group without so much as a ?rub ?
with the natives , hurlingback out into empty space .
Thisstellar system , called Andromeda XII , could be the faintest dwarfgalaxy ever discovered and may have the lowest mass ever measured , said aco- author of the study , Jorge Penarrubia of the University of Victoria inBritish Columbia .
Newobservations show the galaxy is a first - time guest in the Local Group and sohas yet to be pushed and pulled by the group ?s giants ?
the Milky Way and Andromeda .
The Local Group contains about 40 galaxies , most of which are smallsatellites called dwarf galaxies that are gravitationally bound to the giantsof the group , Andromeda ( also called M31 ) and the Milky Way .
Forinstance , a pass through the Local Group can strip a dwarf galaxy of up to halfof its mass .
Galactic guests also lose some of their dark matter frominteractions with local - group members .
Dwarf galaxies are thought to containaround 50 to 500 times the dark matter found in stars .
? AndromedaXII may be the first galaxy of the local group ever observed that has not yetbeen disrupted by the strong gravity of the Local Group , ? said Penarrubia said .
The newentrant has preserved traits from when it formed and will thus provide animportant window into galaxy formation .
The finding , presented here at ameeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) , will shed light on galaxyformation and even the distribution of dark matter .
Galactictravelers
Scientistspredict that small galaxieslike this one should continue to fall into the Local Group , yet until now nonehas been spotted .
Dubbed the Olympian Galaxy after the twelve Olympians in the Greek Pantheon , Andromeda XII was first spotted in October 2006 in a wide - fieldsurvey .?
ScottChapman of the University of Cambridge , Institute of Astronomy , and hiscolleagues used the Keck II Observatory operated atop Mauna Kea to observe 49stars in the region of Andromeda XII , finding that eight were members of thenew dwarf galaxy .
From their observations , they estimated the galaxy ?s orbit , speed and dark - matter content .
They found the galaxy has a highly eccentricorbit and is moving at a swift pace through the Local Group .
? OtherLocal Group members are thought to have extreme orbits , including Leo I , Andromeda XIV and Andromeda XI , ?
Chapman said , ? but Andromeda XII really standsout as a contender for a new entrant into the Local Group .?
He added , ?
Theothers have likely already been seriously harassed by Andromeda and the MilkyWay .?
Free-fallinggalaxy
Its lowmass and high speed suggest the galaxy will be a short - term guest .
The systemis moving at a staggering 345 miles per second ( 556 kilometers per second ) toward Earth , or 174 miles per second ( 280 kilometers per second ) towardAndromeda .
?
It 'sfalling into M31 on a plunging orbit ( rather than circular ) so it is basicallyat the speed one would expect for something that arrived at the edge of M31 ' sgravity influence and started to free fall toward the center , ?
Chapman said .?
The universeis not old enough for Andromeda XII to have started its life in the dense LocalGroup and to now be on its second trip through our system .
Plus , by tracing outits past orbit , the astronomers estimate Andromeda XII likely formed about375,000 light - years from the center of the Andromeda galaxy before free - fallinginto the star - dense environment of the Local Group .
? Eventuallyit will merge with Andromeda or the Milky Way , ?
Chapman told SPACE.com .?
It 's hard to say which or at what time at this point without a betterconstrained orbit .?
Anotherpossibility is , ? that Andromeda XII could sail right through the Local Groupand continue out into empty space ?

Outed CIA covert operative Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband , Joe Wilson , gave an interview to Katie Couric on 60 Minutes .
In the first segment , Plame Wilson spoke frankly about being betrayed by this administration , as well as her assessment of the damage done to the nation 's security by revealing her identity :
Part One : Download Download ( thanks to BillW for videos )
But the second segment is where Couric goes off the rails and shows her flair for White House talking points .
It 's almost as if she implies that Plame Wilson should have expected the White House to out her because the work she did touched on the question that sent her husband , Amb. Joseph Wilson , to Niger .
COURIC : You never for a moment thought this could potentially jeopardize my career ?
PLAME : It 's called ‘ living your cover . '
This had nothing to do with what I was doing .
He was part of the debate .
COURIC : But admit it , it comes awfully close to what you were doing , even covertly .
I mean , you were trying to ascertain if Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
He 's writing an article saying ‘ it 's really not valid , this one assertion . '
I mean , ca n't you see how those two things might collide and in a very dangerous way ?
Part Two : Download Download
Couric should be embarassed for her arsenal of GOP talking points disguised as an interview .
Seriously , this is a covert agent telling you that national security was compromised and you think this is the kind of question that needed to be asked ?
Can you understand how people just were turned off by that whole thing ?
They felt " Gee , maybe she 's enjoying her celebrity a little too much . "
She even at one point accused Valerie of being very partisan and Joseph Wilson of still seething ... can you believe that hackery ?
Did it ever cross her mind to ask that of President Bush in her softball interview from Iraq ?
Of course not .
To the end , the Wilsons held strong to the truth and never backed down , even when the CIA made it difficult for her to publish her own book on the events , Fair Game , eventually redacting 10 % of it .
Archaeological evidence shows that bone skates ( skates made of animal bones ) are the oldest human powered means of transport , dating back to 3000 BC .
Why people started skating on ice and where is not as clear , since ancient remains were found in several locations spread across Central and North Europe .
In a recent paper , published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society of London , Dr. Federico Formenti and Professor Alberto Minetti show substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that the birth of ice skating took place in Southern Finland , where the number of lakes within 100 square kilometres is the highest in the world .
“ In Central and Northern Europe , five thousand years ago people struggled to survive the severe winter conditions and it seems unlikely that ice skating developed as a hobby ” says Dr Formenti .
“ As happened later for skis and bicycles , I am convinced that we first made ice skates in order to limit the energy required for our daily journeys ” .
Credit : Federico Formenti
Formenti and Minetti did their experiments on an ice rink by the Alps , where they measured the energy consumption of people skating on bones .
Through mathematical models and computer simulations of 240 ten - kilometre journeys , their research study shows that in winter the use of bone skates would have limited the energy requirements of Finnish people by 10 % .
On the other hand , the advantage given by the use of skates in other North European countries would be only about 1 % .

Thus , they write , Finnish populations could benefit more than others from developing this ingenious locomotion tool .
Subsequent studies performed by Formenti and Minetti have shown how fast and how far people could skate in past epochs , from 3000 BC to date .

Woohoo !
Well , it 's time to go after both the bastards .
With Joe Biden sticking his toes in a tentative move toward the impeachment pool , impeachment is gaining in importance .
Let 's keep the pressure up .
You can contact your congressperson , Nancy Pelosi and John Conyers here : http://www.visi.com/... .
You can contact the House Judiciary Committee here : General e-mail and specific members .
The Concord Monitor covered Dennis ' visit to Concord High , where Dennis held a back and forth with students .
Here 's a highlight :
Concord students , for the most part , supported Kucinich , applauding his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and our invasion of Iraq .
One student , however , took the offensive .
He agreed with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and our involvement in Iraq .
" Do you believe Saddam Hussein was a bad man ? " the student asked .
" Sure . "
" Do you believe the United States , as one of the most powerful countries in the world , should sit back and watch people be raped , be killed , starved and just sit back ? "
" No . " " Then how can you not support us going in there and giving them a better life ? "
Kucinich then asked audience members to applaud if they believed the quality in Iraq had improved since we arrived .
Few did .
Then he fleshed out his answer , saying , " Do we have the right to go into any country we choose to change its leadership ?
Do we ? "
With the campaign on a roll , it 's time to help pick up Dennis ' fundraising .
There are several ways to go about it .
You can donate directly to the campaign online , or , if you choose to , you can donate the old fashioned way through snail mail !
Also , the internet is gearing up for December 15 , 2007 , where a fuding bomb day is being planned .

TESTOSTERONE gradually declines with age , right ?
Not for the Ariaal – subsistence pastoralists living in northern Kenya .
They experience a decline in levels of the male hormone only when they get married .
The finding provides a social and evolutionary explanation for the decrease in testosterone , rather than an age - related one .
Ariaal men remain single “ warriors ” until they are around 30 , at which time they marry one or more women .
Peter Gray of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , and colleagues measured testosterone in 205 Ariaal men and found that those with one wife had lower levels of the hormone than unmarried men , and men with more than one wife had the lowest levels …
Over the years I have often asked my physicist colleagues why the laws of physics are what they are .
The answers vary from “ that ’s not a scientific question ” to “ nobody knows . ”
The favorite reply is , “ There is no reason they are what they are — they just are . ”
The idea that the laws exist reasonlessly is deeply anti-rational .
After all , the very essence of a scientific explanation of some phenomenon is that the world is ordered logically and that there are reasons things are as they are .
If one traces these reasons all the way down to the bedrock of reality — the laws of physics — only to find that reason then deserts us , it makes a mockery of science .
Can the mighty edifice of physical order we perceive in the world about us ultimately be rooted in reasonless absurdity ?
If so , then nature is a fiendishly clever bit of trickery : meaninglessness and absurdity somehow masquerading as ingenious order and rationality .
Although scientists have long had an inclination to shrug aside such questions concerning the source of the laws of physics , the mood has now shifted considerably .
Part of the reason is the growing acceptance that the emergence of life in the universe , and hence the existence of observers like ourselves , depends rather sensitively on the form of the laws .
If the laws of physics were just any old ragbag of rules , life would almost certainly not exist .
A second reason that the laws of physics have now been brought within the scope of scientific inquiry is the realization that what we long regarded as absolute and universal laws might not be truly fundamental at all , but more like local bylaws .
They could vary from place to place on a mega - cosmic scale .
A God ’s - eye view might reveal a vast patchwork quilt of universes , each with its own distinctive set of bylaws .
In this “ multiverse , ” life will arise only in those patches with bio - friendly bylaws , so it is no surprise that we find ourselves in a Goldilocks universe — one that is just right for life .
We have selected it by our very existence .
The multiverse theory is increasingly popular , but it does n’t so much explain the laws of physics as dodge the whole issue .
There has to be a physical mechanism to make all those universes and bestow bylaws on them .
This process will require its own laws , or meta - laws .
Where do they come from ?
The problem has simply been shifted up a level from the laws of the universe to the meta - laws of the multiverse .

This is a guest post by Guinevere Orvis .
Guinevere is a Web Producer in Toronto , Canada working both freelance and in the broadcast industry for Alliance Atlantis , CTVglobemedia and currently CBC .
She has 10 years experience in the online space and specializes in social media , online marketing and content production .
If you ’re a TV exec , there ’s a magical number that you worship to measure your show ’s success … those digits handed down on high from Neilsen ratings .
Traditionally , little else mattered , but the television landscape is drastically changing .
Is it time our success measurement tools change too ?
Our online audience numbers have grown to a level where they ’re demanding serious attention .
Show promotions , trailers and clips that broadcasters are pushing on YouTube and other video sharing sites are getting more views than some shows do .
Television is reaching a milestone where online is veritably driving on air viewership .
Neilsen TV is n’t the only game in town anymore .
If we are going to understand what our audience wants , we have to consider a bigger picture .
So , if YouTube numbers matter , what about members on a Facebook fan group ?
What about mashups and fan art ?
How about BitTorrent downloads ?
Yeah you heard me : maybe we should use unsanctioned downloads of our shows as a measurement of legitimate demand .
Tech - savvy consumers have been boldly declaring that piracy can help and not hinder industry for years ( especially when it comes to music downloads ) , but I was shocked the first time I heard the same claim from another group : from some very knowledgeable marketing types one day over a year ago in a boardroom .
One of them simply asked , “ Is the show on BitTorrent ?
How many people are downloading it ? ”
The rest of the group looked genuinely interested in the answer from a demand point of view , not from an outraged one .
I ’ve since heard the same thing again several times , from different companies .
An even more interesting thing has started to happen : unofficial , but sanctioned television show leaks on BitTorrent .
Broadcasters are n’t posting their shows directly on PirateBay yet , but they are talking informally and giving copies of shows to a friend of a friend who is unaffiliated with the company to make a torrent .
Why ?
Well , it ’s partially an experiment , but the hope is that distribution of content this way will lead to new viewers that would n’t have been reached through traditional marketing means .
Early signs indicate that these experiments are working .
The hit TV series Weeds has had some high profile “ unofficial ” leaks of their shows prior to airing on television .
When a show is on BitTorrent that has n’t yet aired , it ’s a fairly good indicator that there ’s a insiders nod - and - wink at play .
The Weeds show producer Jenji Kohan hinted at both her approval of the leaks and the reasons behind them , “ Revenue aside , I do n’t expect to get rich on Weeds , I ’m excited it ’s out there .
Showtime is great , but it does have a limited audience . ”
Weeds ratings continue to grow and leaks seem to be part of their ongoing strategy .
While the Motion Picture Association of America is uploading fake torrents of movies to discourage torrent use , mainstream television show producers are engaging in flirtatious trials with torrents as a viable new way to promote their programs and reach new audiences .
Clearly content producers & distributors do n’t agree on how to deal with this technology and the battle will wage on for some time .
In the meantime , seeders and leechers are building a business case for digital distribution by proving demand .
BitTorrent and the like are simply new distribution models and the number of our viewers choosing to view our content this way is as relevant as those still choosing to watch on broadcast television .
What ’s missing is the definitive business model for online that has existed for decades for TV .
My prediction is that one single model wo n’t emerge and that we ’ll monetize our content in as many different ways as there are to distribute it .
It caused almost £ 10,000 of damage , involved mass underage drinking and required 30 police officers , a police helicopter and the police dog squad to break up .
But it was still " the best party ever " , according to the Australian teenager currently under investigation for throwing a raucous bash when his parents went away on holiday .
Corey Delaney , 16 , of Melbourne , could face a bill to pay for the havoc caused by the 500 marauding teenagers who attended the party at his home on Saturday .
He will have to face his parents too : he was hoping the mess could be cleared up by the time they returned home from their break in Queensland , in northern Australia , but huge media coverage has ruled out that idea .
On her way home last night after cutting her holiday short , his mother , Jo , told the Seven Network : " We 're a good family .
I 'm just devastated and horrified that this has actually occurred .
" Obviously he 's very scared of the consequences that we 're going to bring upon him . "
Fear , however , was not the emotion most obvious yesterday when her son - sporting bleached blond hair , yellow outsized sunglasses and a bare chest - was interviewed by Nine Network television news .
Asked what advice he had for other teenagers planning a home alone party , he said : " Get me to do it for you .
" Best party ever , that 's what everyone 's saying . "
He claimed to have ignored his parents ' phone calls since the news broke and said he would not be at home when they returned .
His father Steve proclaimed himself horrified .
He said his son pulled out of the family trip at the last minute , saying he had to work .
Jo Delaney added : " I can't believe that Corey would do this to us to start with .
Honestly , he must have planned the party . "
The teenager is reported to have advertised his party on the internet and by text messages and it attracted a number of strangers .
He told local media his invited guests had no part in the melee , and that it was the gatecrashers who had caused all the trouble .
Police were called by neighbours worried about the noise level .
When officers arrived they were greeted with a barrage of bottles and rocks , damaging police cars .
The guests were eventually dispersed with the help of a police helicopter .
An estimated A$ 20,000 ( about £ 9,200 ) worth of damage was done but no arrests were made .
Nearby houses and gardens were damaged .
Victoria state 's police commissioner , Christine Nixon , said the police were considering billing him up to $ 20,000 for the intervention .
" He needs to learn a lesson , and one way or another we will be making sure that happens , " she told a news conference .
Nixon said that if Corey did not pay , the community in effect would pay for his irresponsibility .
John Trumbull 's Declaration of Independence [ wiki ] | Key to Painting [ Flash ]
1. There Was No " United States " in the Declaration of Independence .
When the Founding Fathers adopted " The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America " [ wiki ] on July 4 , 1776 , they did n't form the nation called The United States of America .
Indeed , the United States of America actually came into being on March 1 , 1781 when the Second Continental Congress ratified the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ( or more commonly known as the Article of Confederation [ wiki ] ) .
2. Jefferson Was Upset that Slavery was Edited out .
In his first draft of the Declaration of Independence , Jefferson [ wiki ] listed the British crown 's support and importation of slavery to the colonies as one of the grievances :
" He has waged cruel war against human nature itself , violating its most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him , captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere , or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither . "
The passage , however , was edited out by request of the delegates from South Carolina and Georgia .
Jefferson ( himself a slave owner ! ) remained upset about this removal of the condemnation of slavery until his death .
3. The Youngest and Oldest Signers
The youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence was Edward Rutledge [ wiki ] of Southern Carolina .
He was 26 .
Actually that was n't the only interesting thing : Rutledge argued for the deletion of Jefferson 's condemnation of slavery ( see above ) .
He was also initially opposed to independence , but signed the Declaration for the sake of unanimity .
The oldest signer was Benjamin Franklin [ wiki ] , who was 70 at the time .
At the signing , Franklin famously said " We must all hang together , or , most assuredly , we shall all hang separately . "
4. The Sole Recanter : Richard Stockton
During the course of the Revolutionary War , four signers were captured by the British ( George Walton , Thomas Heyward , Jr. , Arthur Middleton , and Edward Rutledge ) while fighting .
Although they were treated harshly , all four were eventually released .
Only one guy , Richard Stockton [ wiki ] of New Jersey , was captured in the middle of the night and taken prisoner specifically because he was a signer of the Declaration .
Stockton also had the singular misfortune of being the only recanter of the oath to support the Declaration of Independence with " our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor . "
Under duress of harsh British confinement , Stockton recanted his signature on the Declaration and declared his allegiance to the King George III before he was released .
( Source : American Heritage ) .
Stockton 's ordeal did n't end there : his estate was taken by the British army during his absence , and all of his household belongings were taken or destroyed .
The imprisonment not only broke Stockton 's mind and spirit , but also ruined his health - it took him years to fully recuperate .
Before he died , Stockton re-affirmed his oath of allegiance to the United States .
5. Bargain Hunter Bought an Old Copy of the Declaration of Independence for $ 4 , Sold It For Millions !
In 1989 , a bargain hunter who bought an old and torn painting for $ 4 at a flea market found an old copy of the Declaration of Independence tucked away between the canvas and the frame !
A copy of the Dunlap Broadside , now at Yale University .
It turned out to be one of the 200 official copies from the first printing of the Declaration of Independence , called the Dunlap Broadsides [ wiki ] .
Before this discovery , only 24 copies were known to exist .
The lucky bargain hunter sold his copy of the Declaration at an auction for $ 8.14 million !

Pssst . Wanna know a secret ?
This is a story .
In the Middle Ages there was a secretive organisation called the Knights Templar .
They were disbanded with many killed on the orders of the Pope because they knew the secret that Jesus had had a child with Mary Magdalene .
Despite the killing of the order 's members , societies carry on its legacy of hidden knowledge today .
There 's a problem with this version of events , part - inspired by Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown and other earlier authors .
It 's cobblers .
There are lots of organisations today that bear the Templar name , but for the most part they are in the business of charitable works inspired by the original order .
Secret documents about Mary Magdalene are not the order of the day .
TEMPLAR HISTORY 1099 : Jerusalem captured by Crusaders 1118 : Order formed 1129 : Endorsed by church 1307 : Members arrested in France 1312 : Pope dissolves order 1314 : Last Grand Master burned at stake
The original Templars were founded in the 12th Century to guard pilgrims on their way along the dangerous roads that led to Jerusalem .
Its members were effectively armed monk - like knights who were granted certain legal privileges and whose status was backed by the church .
They were reputed to be the possessors of great wealth and power .
But the latter - day Templars are rather like a version of the Rotary Club , with a vague religious tinge , author and broadcaster on religious history Martin Palmer says .
" It 's a sort of version of the Rotarians with long cloaks and swords . "
The overall effect is " clubby with a slight mystical element " .
The major non-Masonic , non-Catholic affiliated , ecumenical Templar organisation is the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani .
Tracing its ancestry back to 1804 , the group stresses that " it reclaims the spirit of , but does not assert any direct descent from the ancient Order " .
Full members are Christians , but non-Christians are welcomed as " friends and supporters " .
Chivalric side
Its branch in England and Wales , the Grand Priory of Knights Templar , has about 140 members .
Geoff Beck has the rather non-12th Century title of Webmaster of the Grand Priory and explains that it is far from a secret cult .
" We have taken the chivalric side of it .
It is a good standard to live up to .
We get one or two cranks trying to join particularly after the Da Vinci Code .
" Put it this way , the keys of some vault containing the wealth of Jerusalem have never been given to me .
We do n't have any secret ceremonies , our initiation ceremonies are in public church services .
Any member of the public is free to walk in . "
The Vatican 's move has excited Templar history enthusiasts
Perhaps the strongest link to the 12th Century Templars is the modern version 's interest in the Middle East .
The Grand Priory of England and Wales sponsors Medical Aid for Iraqi Children and the Foundation for Reconciliation in the Middle East .
The Middle Ages Templars had a reputation , used occasionally to their detriment , for being prepared to negotiate with Muslims and Jews , and the modern Templars like to see themselves in the same vein .
The other major strand of latter - day Templarism in the UK is within the Freemason fraternity .
The organisation says it has 30,000 Knights Templar members among its 250,000 Freemasons in England and Wales .
The Knights Templar , dating back to the 18th Century , are very much like other Freemasons but with a Christian ethic .
Again , the ( Dan ) Brownites are going to be disappointed .
" We do n't claim any descent .
They originated as a means of commemorating the original Templars and of exemplifying certain Masonic principles , " says John Hamill , communications director of the United Grand Lodge of England .
Again charity work is the order of the day , with an eye hospital in Jerusalem being the recipient of much of the fundraising .
The third main strand of modern Templars is the lay organisation of the Catholic Church , the Militia Templi , formed in 1979 .
Again , it claims no descent .
There are various other esoteric or semi-esoteric organisations that claim some kind of link , including a man in Hertford who says he is a direct descendant of a Templar .
All of them will be pleased at the Vatican 's recent revelation that it plans to release documents from the 14th Century which will confirm that commonly held view that the Templars were not guilty of heresy and in fact succumbed to the predations of a heavily - indebted king of France who was able to bully the pope .
Their modern legacy in England , where the 14th Century persecution was relatively light , includes the Inner and Middle Temple of the legal profession , once the English Templars ' HQ , and their part , along with other religious organisations in the birth of Europe 's banking system .
But the conspiracy theorists will continue looking for those elusive secret descendants , and a smattering of ambiguity will always fuel them .
" We have our own archive that will prove our own heritage but we do n't need to put that in the public arena , " Mr Beck mysteriously explains .
" But the latter - day Templars are rather like a version of the Rotary Club , with a vague religious tinge . "
Sure .
Or maybe that 's just what they 'd like people to believe ...

By a quirk of history , the place where the Templars appear to have survived in their original form for the longest was Scotland , not Enlgand - the Papal Bull excommunicating them was never read in Scotland , as the border was closed due to war with England .
In a cross - border battle during the 16th Century a dead nobleman was found to have original Templar insignia and artefacts on his somewhat outdated armour , suggesting that the order survived in some form for several centuries after their main dissolution .

Surely claiming direct descent from a Templar is self evidently rubbish ?
They were a celibate order after all !
My grandfather once told me that there is still a ' proper '
Templar order in existence which he knew of by virtue of almost continuous family records dating back to the time before the Order was originally destroyed .
He was not inducted into the order as it was incompatible with his own slightly unusual religious beliefs .

It 's unclear whether the Templars were a chaste order or a celibate order .
Chastity is the avoidance of sex outside of marriage , and abstinence for the unmarried .
It is quite possible for a chaste person to be married and have children .
Celibacy means to remain unmarried .
If you are celibate without being chaste it means you may have sex but not marry .
You can of course still have children in this way .
The early church did not require celibacy for its priesthood .
This came later as a political concession because the nobility were concerned that powerful dynastic families might arise within the church .
Even if Templars were both chaste and celibate ( i.e. no sex under any circumstances ) , then it 's quite possible , being human , that some broke their vows and sired children .

How can you say that it is cobblers ?
Presumably you can adduce evidence to prove that fact .
Absent any evidence all theories ( whether conspiracy or otherwise ) are equally valid .
What most critics of conspiracy theories , e.g. regarding 911 , fail to address is that the official version of 911 or 7/7 is in itself a conspiracy theory .
It is a theory ( backed with some limited evidence released by the authorities ) of a conspiracy - in 911 it is that Osama acted in conspiracy with others to commit a criminal offence - the atrocity of 911 .
The theory that he did it is only a conspiracy theory ( or a theory of a conspiracy ) , and as no - one has ever been tried in a court of law - and you can have trials in absentia - so we do n't actually need a defendant - absent proof , it is itself just a conspiracy theory .
So , with respect , let 's see your proof regarding the Knights Templar and its load of cobblers !

The Templar name also lives on in Aberdeen where the Scout campsite on the banks of the River Dee is known as Templar 's Park .
It is the site of a former Knight 's Templar community and its graveyard can still be visited in the grounds of the Maryculter House Hotel .
It is rumoured to be haunted by the Green Lady , the ghost of a Saracen woman who followed a knight back from the Crusades .

The heritage of the Templar Knights should not be dismissed by revisionist historians or fiction writers , a glorious tradition of unselfishness and a willingness to help others , the forebears of diplomatic relations in the middle east , all with a healthy Christian ethos .

These people were nothing but thugs and criminals .
Even in Britain during the 12th and 13th century they abused there position and treated the native British with contempt .
Their actions in the ' East ' during this time - (" protecting pilgrims " - do n't make me laugh ) marks the start of a dreadful conflict that still plagues the world today .
There is no romance or chivalry associated with them or their order in any way .
They are a product of the Norman period of our history that is best forgotten .

So the article says that at least two modern day Knights Templar groups claim no descent and do not hold any treasures .
Well , they WOULD say that , would n't they ...

Most of my friends believe in the conspiracy that the Masons and Templars control or influence UK companies and government institutions .
Why do they believe all that stuff ?

Links between early Freemasonry and the Templar¿s may not be as sceptical as historians like to suggest .
In Scotland , the earliest Masonic lodges appear to go back to within 100 years of the dissolution of the Order in 1309 .
On going research by Sheffield University , in to the origins of Freemasonry , continues to reveal earlier and earlier connections ; it may only be a matter of time before a full link is made .
However , mystical speculation ( Dan Brown , Lincoln , Baigent and Leigh et al ) still represents an ' enemy of reason ' when it comes to interpreting actual historical evidence .
Keepers of sacred knowledge they are not ! ( sadly ! )

FYI there is only one true strand of the templars left in the world .
This is the portugeuse Order of Christ - which is a state order .
When the templars were suppressed , the king of portugal got an exemption and all lands etc were kept safe for the order .
The name reverted to the original name of the order , the Order of Christ and the gift was in the hands of the king .
The pope only allowed this however , if he also was able to confer the Order of Christ .
Thus there are two branches today of the templars - the Order of Christ .
The portuguese order and also the hiughest order of the Vatican state - also called the order of Christ .
Only these two branches of the same order can claim to have any decent from the templars
Ewen , London
All the released documents ( which have been known about for several years ) do is show that the Pope granted absolution for the confessions made by the Grand Master and some other prominent Templars .
The Church is not making much of the fact that the Grand Master later retracted his confession , because it had been made under duress ( torture or threat of torture ) : for this he was burned as a relapsed heretic .
Other Templars were tortured into confessing to " worshipping idols " ( in reality , nothing more sinister than venerating relics of saints ) .
It seems to me that the Church is hyping the Chinon Parchment to distract attention from the fact that Clement V and the Inquisition were complicit in the brutal destruction of a religious order which had served the Church loyally for some 2 centuries .
The suppression was not confined to France , although the worst torture was carried out there and in the Papal States .

Arabs in Europe have launched a public campaign to stop Al - Jazeera TV broadcasts in Europe .
In a petition , they accuse the channel of fostering extremism among European Arab youth and of supporting terrorism .
While the petition 's initiators have not provided their names , it seems likely that they are Iraqi expatriates ; although various Arab news websites , such as Elaph , [ 1 ] have reported on the campaign , the petition itself has been posted primarily on Iraqi websites .
These sites include the Iraqi news site Sotaliraq ; [ 2 ] the Iraq of Tomorrow news site ; [ 3 ] the Al - Najaf News site ; [ 4 ] the website of Al - Fayhaa TV , a liberal Iraqi station ; [ 5 ] the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan website ; [ 6 ]
Bahzani , a news and opinion website focusing on the Yazidi community and other Iraqi minorities ; [ 7 ] the Yezidi Community website ; [ 8 ] the website of the Gilgamish Center for Kurdish Studies and Research ; [ 9 ] and the Kurdistan Times e-journal . [ 10 ]
In addition , on November 28 , 2007 , Iraqi exile Joseph Shallal wrote an article on the Arab left - liberal Modern Discussion website urging a boycott of Al - Jazeera .
TO VIEW MEMRI TV'S PAGE OF AL - JAZEERA CLIPS VISIT : http://www.memritv.org/subject/en/166.htm
The following are excerpts from the petition and from Shallal 's article :
" Since Its Inception , Al - Jazeera Has Chosen the Path of Fostering Violence and Hatred "
" Why should Al - Jazeera be blocked in liberal Europe ?
" More than 10 years after the emergence of the extremist Al - Jazeera channel , the time has come for Arabs who live in Europe and believe in a free Europe to defend the principles of a continent that has sacrificed millions of victims to reach its current state of progress , respect for human rights , rejection of extremism , and rejection of the fostering of hatred .
" Since its inception , Al - Jazeera TV has chosen the path of fostering violence and hatred in the world , and has acted so as to be an arm of terrorist forces , such as Al - Qaeda and other extremist forces .
[ Al - Jazeera TV ] has already been prevented from operating in many countries , and some of its presenters and technical crew have been arrested for their involvement in aiding obscurantist terrorist forces like Al - Qaeda and others . "
" The Time Has Come for … ' The Bin Laden Channel ' to Face Its Day of Reckoning on the European Continent "
" The time has come for Al - Jazeera TV , whose name has become ' the bin Laden channel , ' to face its day of reckoning on the European continent .
" It would be difficult , in this brief [ overview ] , to provide examples of the calamitous influence , danger , and ignominy that Al - Jazeera TV has presented and continues to present .
Every day that this channel [ continues to ] broadcast constitutes a clear violation of the principles of the media , and poisons the minds of the youth … "
Al - Jazeera is Exploiting Europe 's Democratic Environment in Order to Wholeheartedly Oppose Freedom and Respect
" One can not remain silent in the face of the dangerous insinuations broadcast by Al - Jazeera , that are aimed at trying to show that there is an extremist religious campaign against Muslims in Europe .
" One cannot remain silent , given the statements of European political and cultural researchers as to Al - Jazeera 's dangerous influence on the Arab youth in Europe .
" One can not remain silent in the face of [ Sheikh Yousef ] Al - Qaradhawi calling Christians and Westerners ' infidels ' on Al - Jazeera , [ and in the face of ] his calls for violence .
" European governments cannot but note Al - Jazeera 's record in the Middle East , and the restricting orders issued against it in countries such as Iraq , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia .
Perhaps these countries are not models of the kind of democracy found in Europe – but their judges and media personnel presented clear and irrefutable evidence of Al - Jazeera 's involvement in actions unbefitting a media outlet .
" One can not remain silent in the face of Al - Jazeera 's continued exploitation of the European continent 's democratic environment in order to practice a media policy that is wholeheartedly opposed to the freedom and respect that European principles promote .
" It is not our intention here to mention further examples of the Qatari Al - Jazeera channel 's extremism .
We will leave it to every free and sincere Arab individual to remember the many hours of anger he has spent viewing Al - Jazeera 's destructive discourse . "
" Sign Your Name With Us and Take a Stand Against Hatred and Extremism "
" Who is behind this campaign ?
" This is a campaign of Arabs and Europeans aimed at implementing peaceful pressure against European governments and the European Union to stop broadcasting by the extremist Al - Jazeera satellite channel on European cable networks , as a first step towards stopping the channel from broadcasting over the European satellite [ service ]
Hotbird …
" This is an appeal to all Arabs and Europeans , those who live in the European continent and those outside it , to add their names to the campaign .
" This is an appeal to all academics and intellectuals , to provide us with their testimony regarding the terrorist channel .
" This is an appeal to all lawyers and rights specialists , in Europe and elsewhere , to help us with their legal expertise in order to draw up a legal paper that we can present to the European parliaments and the EU .
" This is an appeal to you , as an Arab and a European , and as a consumer , to join us in pressuring the European cable networks to remove Al - Jazeera …
You do not want yourself , or anyone close to you , to turn to extremism and to hatred for the countries that have given us so much love .
" Sign your name with us , and take a stand against hatred and extremism .
Sign on to our campaign for 'a Europe without Al - Jazeera . '
" Sign at this address : [ email protected ] . "
" When Will Al - Jazeera 's Hatred for Iraq and the Iraqis End ? "
In an article titled " When Will Al - Jazeera 's Hatred for Iraq and the Iraqis End ? " published November 28 , 2007 by the Arab left - liberal Modern Discussion website , Joseph Shallal , an Iraqi exile living in Germany , wrote that Al - Jazeera is biased against Iraq , and urged a boycott against it .
( It is not clear whether Shallal is connected to the petition initiative . )
He also argued that Qatar , which sponsors Al - Jazeera , is hypocritical , since it is home to the largest U.S. military base in the region :
" The Al - Jazeera channel was struck with hysteria after the fall of the late Saddam regime …
" The goal of Al - Jazeera , and of those who stand behind it , is to harm intra-Arab relations as well as relations between Arabs and the countries of the world , and to sow and deepen religious and [ Sunni - Shi'ite ] sectarianism and hatred among all elements if the Arab region .
" Most guests on its shows are from a single school and tendency …
If we look at the Al - Jazeera Direct broadcasts , all we see are things harmful to the Iraqis and to Iraq – speeches , meetings , and conferences by Islamist terrorists from Al - Qaeda and from [ other ] terrorist organizations …
" At the same time , Al - Jazeera Direct ignores anything positive , inside or outside Iraq …
While it carried a speech by wanted Iraqi terrorist Harith Al - Dari , who represents nothing in Iraq , it did not carry the ceremony of Iraqi Patriarch Emmanuel Delly 's ordination as cardinal …
" What can we hope for and expect from a channel whose religious spokesman [ i.e. Sheikh Yousef Al - Qaradhawi ] calls day and night for jihad , killing , and terrorism , and issued a fatwa permitting the killing of Iraqis , and another fatwa permitting criminal terrorist suicide operations – so - called martyrdom operations – that violate all international laws [ ? ] …
" The channel [ i.e. Al - Jazeera ] says that Iraq is occupied .
The occupation of Iraq was [ based on ] international resolutions , and was declared openly by the American administration .
What we do n't know is how Qatar was occupied and became the largest U.S. base …
Did it take place with the agreement of the Al - Jazeera channel and its religious spokesman , or with that of the ruler of Qatar and his group ?
" The occupation of Iraq will end one day .
But is the ruling family of the Qatari emirate and mini-state capable of expelling the Americans from their land ?...
" For these reasons , I call for a boycott of Al - Jazeera , and of Qatar .
Every noble Iraqi should refrain from participating in Al - Jazeera programs , and refrain from visiting Qatar .
And we demand that European countries remove Al - Jazeera from European satellite [ services ] , particularly Hotbird , and that the channel 's employees be denied entry to European and Arab countries because there are question marks regarding some of them – as was the case with Al - Jazeera correspondent and cameraman [ Sami Al - Hajj ] in Afghanistan .
" We demand that Iraq break off all relations with the mini-state of Qatar , its government , and its biased media … " [ 11 ]

Michael Powell , the former chair of the United States Federal Communications Commission , received his first TiVo , a popular personal video recorder ( PVR ) , as a Christmas gift in 2002 .
Within days , Powell gushed that the TiVo was " God 's machine , " predicting that it would have a transformative effect on how consumers watch television by allowing them to easily record programs , pause shows in real time , and quickly skip through unwanted commercials .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Years later , TiVo claims that its service is available in Canada , yet few retailers carry the product .
In fact , notwithstanding the growing popularity of PVRs and the ubiquity of VCRs -- the CRTC estimates that 700,000 Canadian households own a PVR and Statistics Canada reports that over 10 million households have video cassette recorders ( VCR ) -- the absence of the TiVo is not the only difference between the U.S. and Canadian markets .
In the U.S. , using TiVos and VCRs is clearly legal .
In Canada , it is not .
Criminal couch potatoes
While it may come as news to many Canadians that they infringe copyright on daily basis , those involved in the industry are well aware of this state of the law .
The law includes a series of copying exceptions that cover research , private study , and criticism ; however , there is nothing that clearly permits home recording of television programs .
Indeed , the delayed introduction of the TiVo or the Slingbox , another popular product that allows consumers to transfer their television programs over the Internet to their computer and which only entered the Canadian market last year , may stem in part from fears about the legal climate .
Ottawa has regularly introduced legislation demanded by lobby groups ( new laws against camcording in movie theatres and Internet rebroadcasting have been passed over the past five years ) , yet nothing has been done to address the legality of commonplace , non-commercial activities that affects millions of Canadians .
This stands in stark contrast to many of our leading trading partners , including the U.S. , Australia , United Kingdom , and New Zealand , who have all passed or proposed legislation that removes the home television recording from the cloud of possible illegality .
For example , the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue in a case involving the legality of the Sony Betamax machine in 1984 .
The court sided with Sony , who argued that recording television programs simply enabled users to shift the time when they watch the taped program .
Perfect opportunity
The forthcoming copyright bill provides the ideal opportunity to remedy decades of inaction .
Prime Minister Stephen Harpers 's government should introduce a new personal network exception into the Copyright Act that would feature three main components .
First , a " time shifting " provision to grant Canadians the right to record television programming for personal , non-commercial purposes .
The exception would legalize what is already a common activity for millions of Canadians and might fuel new products and services from Canada 's telecommunications and consumer electronics companies .
Second , a " format shifting " provision that would legalize the transfer of content from one format to another .
For example , it would expressly permit transferring music on a store - bought CD to an iPod or the transfer of video from a cable box to a personal computer .
Third , a modernized backup copy provision that would address today 's consumer realities .
The law already permits the making of a single backup copy of a computer program , rightly recognizing that software programs are intangible products that are susceptible to loss .
Today , digital data includes CDs , DVDs , and video games , which all suffer from the same frailties as software programs , namely the ease with which hard drives become corrupted or CDs and DVDs scratched and non-functional .
Modernizing the law should include bringing this provision into the 21st century by expanding the right to make a backup copy to all digital consumer products .
Christmas cheers
Addressing these issues in the forthcoming copyright bill would be more than just good policy .
It would also be good politics , since voters will have little patience for special interest legislation that is geared toward placating U.S. lobby groups rather than considering their needs .
With a bill expected before the year is out , Canadians will soon learn whether Industry Minister Jim Prentice and Canadian Heritage Minister Josée Verner plan to provide an early holiday gift to lobby groups or allow them to use their holiday gifts without fear of breaking the law .

Tyee stories :
If anyone from Bush ’s inner circle is going to defend Mike Huckabee ’s Christian - centered presidential campaign , you ’d think it would be Peter Wehner .
Not only is Wehner , the former White House director of strategic initiatives , a self - described evangelical Christian conservative , but he also helped oversee Bush ’s faith - based office .
It ’s not like the separation of church and state would be high on Wehner ’s priority list .
And yet , in an interesting WaPo op - ed today , Wehner said Huckabee ’s emphasis on religion is giving him a “ queasy feeling , ” because the former governor ’s tack is “ disturbing . ”
After noting a litany of recent examples — the “ Christian leader ” ad , the talk of being God ’s anointed candidate , the theological shots at Mormons , and the “ birth of Christ ” ad —
Wehner suggests Huckabee is confused about his goals .
This is a man who , in 1998 , when explaining to a Baptist pastors conference why he got involved in politics , answered , “ I got into politics because I knew government did n’t have the real answers , that the real answers lie in accepting Jesus Christ into our lives .
. . .
I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ . ”
Now is n’t that odd — a former pastor who leaves his ministry so he can get involved in politics because he “ knew government did n’t have the real answers . ”
Well , sure , when you put it that way , it is odd .
Wehner ends up focusing on how very unusual all of this , asking whether Huckabee is “ playing the Jesus card in a way that is unlike anything we have quite seen before . ”
Invoking one ’s faith is not unprecedented in American politics and is not , by itself , disconcerting .
It can even be reassuring .
But it is also fraught with danger .
If certain lines — inherently ambiguous lines — are crossed and faith becomes a tool in a political campaign , it can damage our civic comity and our politics and demean our faith . [ … ]
Mike Huckabee , by all accounts a faithful Christian , may not have crossed any bright lines yet — but he ’s edging close to them .
He should pull back now , before his political ambitions injure what he claims to care about , and undoubtedly does care about , most .
All of this sounds quite persuasive , but I was on a radio show yesterday with my friend Bill Simmon who raised a good point : as aggressively as Huckabee is pushing a line , and as uncomfortable as he ’s making a lot of people feel , there ’s an upside — at least there wo n’t be any surprises from this guy .
In other words , Huckabee ’s candidness has the benefit of transparency .
There ’s no real wink - wink here ;
Huckabee is laying it out there for all to see — on matters of faith , he ’s a right - wing evangelical creationist who has admitted publicly that he wants to help take the nation “ back for Christ . ”
It ’s better for Americans to see that and evaluate those beliefs accordingly , than for Huckabee to believe this and keep his agenda under wraps .
To a certain extent , Huckabee is undermining American political norms and using Christianity in ways no credible , modern candidate has .
But at a minimum , at least we know what we ’re getting .
Ten private investigators in several states were indicted for identity theft this week after using pretexting methods similar to those used by Hewlett - Packard investigators to obtain the personal information of about 12,000 people .
The investigators reportedly used lies and trickery as well as technology to obtain private financial , medical and tax information on targets that they were investigating for clients .
The clients who purchased the ill - gotten confidential records were other private investigators who were working on behalf of attorneys , law firms , collection agents , insurance companies and others .
The PIs are being charged with conspiracy , wire fraud and aggravated identity theft .
Authorities say that the clients who purchased the information from the investigators may also face charges .
The indictment says the clients wanted to uncover information about people who were involved in lawsuits or claims against them .
According to prosecutors , this is only the second time – the H - P case being the first – that someone has been prosecuted for using pretexting to obtain confidential records .
Pretexting involves using someone else 's Social Security number , birthdate or other personal information to trick companies or government agencies into handing over private information about that individual .
In the HP case , investigators used the method to obtain the phone call records of journalists and HP board members to determine who was leaking company information to the journalists .
The current case involves private investigators in Washington , California , Oregon , Texas and New York .
In addition to pretexting , they and a few of their employees used voice - disguising technology and other technical methods to conceal their true identity to obtain information , according to one news report .
They obtained information from state and federal agencies – such as unemployment insurance departments , the Social Security Administration and the IRS – as well as from banks , pharmacies and hospitals .
According to the indictment ( PDF ) , to obtain tax returns , an investigator would call the IRS posing as the individual whose returns he wanted to obtain and claim that he needed copies of his tax returns because he'd just fired his bookkeeper for impropriety and needed to verify that the returns had been filed accurately .
To obtain medical and drug records , an investigator would call a pharmacy or hospital posing as a representative from a fictitious doctor 's office and claim that he or she had been authorized to obtain a patient 's prescription or hospitalization records .
The private investigators charged various amounts to their clients for the confidential information .
One agency , for example , charged $ 100 for bank account information and $ 130 - $ 250 for each tax return .
Medical information about someone could be obtained for as little as $ 50 , or $ 150 for a five - year comprehensive medical history .
Pretexting , of course , is n't a new method .
In a story I wrote for Wired News in January 2006 before the H- P scandal broke , Rob Douglas an information security consultant , told me that pretexting was a dirty little secret among private investigators and one of the primary ways they had used to obtain information for years .
" No one likes to talk about who uses these records the most , " he told me then , " but it 's lawyers for the most part who created this market " and often claim ignorance of the ways in which the information they purchase is obtained .

We all know that FOXNews is famous for switching R's to D's when Republicans get into trouble or they do n't like what they hear from one , but they changed up their tactics in the case of Senator Lavvy Craig 's potty scandal .
Instead of assigning him to the bad , naughty , nasty Democratic party , in the below article from their website FOX chose to completely leave out his political affiliation altogether .
That 's right , nowhere in the article will you see the word REPUBLICAN attached to Senator Larry Craig 's name .
The article also quotes numerous Republicans stating their disdain for the Senator 's actions -- attempting to give the impression they were n't talking about a fellow Republican .
Brilliant !
Craig , who was taken into custody on June 11 by a plainclothes officer investigating reports of lewd conduct in the restroom , said he pleaded guilty to a disorderly conduct charge in an effort to suppress a story — pursued by his home - state newspaper — that he has secretly engaged in gay trysts .
Denying that he did anything wrong and stating emphatically that " I am not gay , " Sen .
Larry Craig asked the people of Idaho on Tuesday to forgive him for being arrested two months ago in a police sting in a men's room at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
Meanwhile , back in Washington , Republican leaders announced they will launch an ethics review of the senator .
UPDATE : As Media Matters points out , on August 27th , between 5:00 pm and 11:00 pm , FOXNews devoted just 3:47 seconds to the Larry Craig scandal as opposed to 8:26 from MSNBC and 20:38 from CNN .

I 've posted the rest of the FOX article below instead of asking our fine readers to link to their site . :)
" This is a serious matter .
Due to the reported and disputed circumstances , and the legal resolution of this serious case , we will recommend that Senator Craig 's incident be reported to the Senate Ethics Committee for its review .
In the meantime , leadership is examining other aspects of the case to determine if additional action is required , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on behalf of the party 's Senate leadership .
Click here to read the police report for Sen. Larry Craig .
Craig was arrested on June 11 by a plainclothes officer .
The police report from Sgt. Dave Karsnia , who made the arrest after an encounter in which he was seated in a stall next to a stall occupied by Craig , described Craig tapping his foot and blocking the stall door with his roller luggage .
Karsnia said he recognized the actions " as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct . "
Craig pleaded guilty in a Hennepin County , Minn . court earlier this month .
He claims he is innocent of anything untoward , but he should have consulted a lawyer rather than trying to brush the June incident under the rug .
He paid a $ 575 fine and was given a stay on a 10 - day prison sentence barring no further violations during one year of unsupervised probation .
Craig said Tuesday that he is now reviewing his actions with an attorney to see if he can reverse the damages .
" I did not seek any counsel either from an attorney , staff , friends or family .
That was a mistake and I deeply regret it .
Because of that , I have now retained counsel , and I am asking counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed , " he said .
The senator has been debating whether to prolong his 27 - year career as an elected official by running for a another term in office , and was expected to make an announcement next month .
He said he will stick to that plan .
" Next month , I will announce , as planned , as many of you have already been told , whether or not I will seek re-election .
As an elected official , I fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny , and I take full responsibility for a lapse in judgment I made in attempting to handle this matter myself , " he said .
" I am not gay .
I love my wife , my family .
I care about friends and staff and Idaho .
I love serving this great state .
Over the years , I have accomplished a lot for Idaho , and I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue to do that , " he said .
Both friends and opponents are closely watching the latest events unfold .
Idaho state Sen. R. Steven Bair told FOX
News that if the allegation of Craig trying to initiate a gay sex tryst in the bathroom is true then the three - term senator is " about done politically . "
Another Republican state senator , Charles Coiner , said Craig " has done a lot of good for Idaho . "
He said the rumors about sexual indiscretions have gone on for years but he never thought any of the claims had much significance , and it was part of the hardball tactics used against those in public service .
A spokeswoman for fellow Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo , told FOX News that Crapo called Craig on Monday shortly after the story broke .
She said her boss " considers Senator Craig a good friend as well as colleague . "
" Senator Crapo supports any decisions Senator Craig makes regarding his political future and will not make any judgments regarding any part of the incident or any rumors regarding it , " the spokeswoman said .
Earlier in the day , liberal government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Senate ethics committee seeking an investigation into whether Craig violated Senate rules by engaging in disorderly conduct .
" The Senate Ethics Manual provides that certain conduct may be improper even though it does not violate specific Senate rules or regulations .
Such conduct has been characterized as ' improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate , ' " CREW said in a press release .
" This rule is intended to protect the integrity and reputation of the Senate as a whole . "
The Senate Democratic Campaign Committee also hoped to capitalize on the disorderly conduct misdemeanor now on Craig 's record .
Spokeswoman Hannah August said the guilty plea " has given Americans another reason not to vote Republican . "
But while Democrats look to exploit the incident for political gain , Republicans too are saying they are displeased with the turn of events .
On Monday , Craig quit Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign , where he was a co-chairman .
Romney said Tuesday he did n't know whether Craig should resign from the Senate but he was very disappointed to read about the guilty plea .
" Once again , we 've found people in Washington have not lived up to the level of respect and dignity that we would expect for somebody that gets elected to a position of high influence .
Very disappointing , " Romney told CNBC .
" He 's no longer associated with my campaign , as you can imagine . "
A former Craig staffer called the senator 's behavior stupid and selfish .
" I am disappointed by how he dealt with the situation , " the staffer , who worked for Craig for a number of years , told FOX News .
Patrick Sammon , president of the Log Cabin Republicans , a gay Republican group , said by " his own admission , " Craig violated the law , and voters should expect more from their representatives .
" Senator Larry Craig 's ability to continue serving the people of Idaho is in serious doubt , " Sammon said .
" He has violated the public trust , not just with his inappropriate and illegal behavior , but in the subsequent explanation of his actions .
Innocent people do n't plead guilty .
The time to contest these allegations would 've been before his guilty plea . "
Craig , 62 , has a conservative record in the Senate — he has voted against gay marriage , opposed extending special protections to gay and lesbian crime victims and supported barring homosexuals from serving in the Boy Scouts .
But Idaho Statesman reporter Dan Popkey said Craig has never been cruel in his opposition to gay rights .
Allegations that Craig is a closet homosexual have dogged him since his college days in the 1960s , according to the 3,700 - word article in Tuesday 's edition .
During Craig 's first term in Congress back in the early 1980s , when House and Senate members stood accused of abusing congressional pages , Craig took the unusual step of issuing a pre-emptive denial of involvement .
The paper said it had received allegations in May from a man who said he and Craig engaged in sex at a men's bathroom in Washington , D.C. 's Union Station .
Another man claimed Craig eyed him up during a half - hour cat and mouse chase in a Boise , Idaho , store in 1994 .
At the time , Craig called the charges scurrilous .
" I 've been in this business 27 years in the public eye here .
I do n't go around anywhere hitting on men , and by God , if I did , I would n't do it in Boise , Idaho !
Jiminy ! " he told the newspaper .

As sea levels rise , coastal communities could lose up to 50 percent more of their fresh water supplies than previously thought , according to a new study from Ohio State University .
Hydrologists here have simulated how saltwater will intrude into fresh water aquifers , given the sea level rise predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The IPCC has concluded that within the next 100 years , sea level could rise as much as 23 inches , flooding coasts worldwide .
Scientists previously assumed that , as saltwater moved inland , it would penetrate underground only as far as it did above ground .
But this new research shows that when saltwater and fresh water meet , they mix in complex ways , depending on the texture of the sand along the coastline .
In some cases , a zone of mixed , or brackish , water can extend 50 percent further inland underground than it does above ground .
Like saltwater , brackish water is not safe to drink because it causes dehydration .
Water that contains less than 250 milligrams of salt per liter is considered fresh water and safe to drink .
Motomu Ibaraki , associate professor of earth sciences at Ohio State , led the study .
Graduate student Jun Mizuno presented the results Tuesday , October 30 , 2007 , at the Geological Society of America meeting in Denver .
“ Most people are probably aware of the damage that rising sea levels can do above ground , but not underground , which is where the fresh water is , ” Ibaraki said .
“ Climate change is already diminishing fresh water resources , with changes in precipitation patterns and the melting of glaciers .
With this work , we are pointing out another way that climate change can potentially reduce available drinking water .
The coastlines that are vulnerable include some of the most densely populated regions of the world . ”
In the United States , lands along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico — especially Florida and Louisiana — are most likely to be flooded as sea levels rise .
Vulnerable areas worldwide include Southeast Asia , the Middle East , and northern Europe .
“ Almost 40 percent of the world population lives in coastal areas , less than 60 kilometers from the shoreline , ” Mizuno said .
“ These regions may face loss of freshwater resources more than we originally thought . ”
Scientists have used the IPCC reports to draw maps of how the world ’s coastlines will change as waters rise , and they have produced some of the most striking images of the potential consequences of climate change .
Ibaraki said that he would like to create similar maps that show how the water supply could be affected .
That ’s not an easy task , since scientists do n’t know exactly where all of the world ’s fresh water is located , or how much is there .
Nor do they know the details of the subterranean structure in many places .
One finding of this study is that saltwater will penetrate further into areas that have a complex underground structure .
Typically , coastlines are made of different sandy layers that have built up over time , Ibaraki explained .
Some layers may contain coarse sand and others fine sand .
Fine sand tends to block more water , while coarse sand lets more flow through .
The researchers simulated coastlines made entirely of coarse or fine sand , and different textures in between .
They also simulated more realistic , layered underground structures .
The simulation showed that , the more layers a coastline has , the more the saltwater and fresh water mix .
The mixing causes convection — similar to the currents that stir water in the open sea .
Between the incoming saltwater and the inland fresh water , a pool of brackish water forms .
Further sea level rise increases the mixing even more .
Depending on how these two factors interact , underground brackish water can extend 10 to 50 percent further inland than the saltwater on the surface .
According to the United States Geological Survey , about half the country gets its drinking water from groundwater .
Fresh water is also used nationwide for irrigating crops .
“ In order to obtain cheap water for everybody , we need to use groundwater , river water , or lake water , ” Ibaraki said .
“ But all those waters are disappearing due to several factors –including an increase in demand and climate change . ”
One way to create more fresh water is to desalinate saltwater , but that ’s expensive to do , he said .
“ To desalinate , we need energy , so our water problem would become an energy problem in the future . ”

LAWRENCE , Kan . ( AP ) -- Creationism and intelligent design are going to be studied at the University of Kansas , but not in the way advocated by opponents of the theory of evolution .
A course being offered next semester by the university religious studies department is titled " Special Topics in Religion : Intelligent Design , Creationism and other Religious Mythologies . ''
" The KU faculty has had enough , '' said Paul Mirecki , department chairman .
" Creationism is mythology , '' Mirecki said .
" Intelligent design is mythology .
It 's not science .
They try to make it sound like science .
It clearly is not . ''
Earlier this month , the state Board of Education adopted new science teaching standards that treat evolution as a flawed theory , defying the view of science groups .
Although local school boards still decide how science is taught in the classrooms , the vote was seen as a major victory for proponents of intelligent design , which says that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by a higher power .
Critics say intelligent design is merely creationism -- a literal reading of the Bible 's story of creation as the handiwork of God -- camouflaged in scientific language as a way to get around court rulings that creationism injects religion into public schools .
John Calvert , an attorney and managing director of the Intelligent Design Network in Johnson County , said Mirecki will go down in history as a laughingstock .
" To equate intelligent design to mythology is really an absurdity , and it's just another example of labeling anybody who proposes ( intelligent design ) to be simply a religious nut , '' Calvert said .
" That 's the reason for this little charade . ''
Mirecki said his course , limited to 120 students , would explore intelligent design as a modern American mythology .
Several faculty members have volunteered to be guest lecturers , he said .
University Chancellor Robert Hemenway said Monday said he did n't know all the details about the new course .
" If it 's a course that 's being offered in a serious and intellectually honest way , those are the kind of courses a university frequently offers , '' he said .

How Evolution Works
The late Douglas Adams once wrote that dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you , saving the trouble of washing them yourself , and VCRs watched tedious television for you , saving you from the same fate .
He would have loved the SnapStream Television Search Appliance , a digital video recorder that can record up to ten television channels simultaneously and store up to 2,300 hours of programming on 1.5 terabytes of storage ( or more ) .
Now , multi- channel digital video recorders are nothing new — I once worked for a company that assembled 16 and even some 32 - channel recorders from standard PC parts and software from South Korea — but traditionally such beasts have been confined to the security industry , capturing low - framerate movies of hoodlums robbing retail stores .
However , huge advances in video capture technology and rapidly - plummeting cost - per - gigabyte of hard drives have made such recording behemoths worthwhile for more ( uh ) important tasks , such as recording everything you can think of on TV .
10 tuners and gobs of storage aside , the coolest thing about this SnapStream DVR is its search interface .
We 've not seen anything like it in the DVR world : the DVR stores the closed captioning signal — where available — as a stream of text , which is then searchable by the end user like a database .
Spelling errors on live television events aside , this allows users to flag any shows in which certain keywords pop up , and even send an e-mail alert when this happens .
Selected programs can then be burned to DVD -R in standard MPEG - 2 format that can be viewed by any media player .
The 10 - channel DVR .
Unsurprisingly , SnapStream says that it is the keyword search feature that appeals the most to their clients .
For example , a PR firm might like to monitor local and national news channels for a any mention of their client 's product .
Journalism students at Emerson College used the system to monitor and compare different news stories on the same topic ( one wonders if the Daily Show staffers are using a similar product ) .
City governments also found the device useful for monitoring news stories about their city and local government .
Prices for the technology range from $ 6,000 for a four - channel unit up to $ 15,000 for the Enterprise 10 - channel system .
A bit costly , to be sure , but for the target market such price ranges are not unusual .
Of course , the very nature of PC hardware and software means that prices will go down over time .
Back when I worked at my security DVR company , we would sell a 4 - channel unit for around $ 2,000 , but these days you can buy a $ 100 capture card and software and install it on a $ 500 PC and get the same thing .
The idea of fully - searchable transcript databases for all television programming will be a real boon to researchers and journalists anxious to tame the unruly tiger of information overload .
It might even filter down to the consumer level at some point — would n't it be nice if your computer could watch all the boring channels for you and just filter out the ones you are interested in ?
Next thing you know , they 'll be coming out with an Electric Monk ...
Props to ZNF for spotting this product .
We 'll see if SnapStream will give us a review unit .
Do n't hold your breath !
My story about a basically sound bank beset by a crisis of confidence , which can be rescued with a temporary loan from the Fed , is more or less what happened to the financial system as a whole in 1998 .
Russia ’s default led to the collapse of the giant hedge fund Long Term Capital Management , and for a few weeks there was panic in the markets .
Image Paul Krugman Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
But when all was said and done , not that much money had been lost ; a temporary expansion of credit by the Fed gave everyone time to regain their nerve , and the crisis soon passed .
In August , the Fed tried again to do what it did in 1998 , and at first it seemed to work .
But then the crisis of confidence came back , worse than ever .
And the reason is that this time the financial system  both banks and , probably even more important , nonbank financial institutions  made a lot of loans that are likely to go very , very bad .
It ’s easy to get lost in the details of subprime mortgages , resets , collateralized debt obligations , and so on .
But there are two important facts that may give you a sense of just how big the problem is .
First , we had an enormous housing bubble in the middle of this decade .
To restore a historically normal ratio of housing prices to rents or incomes , average home prices would have to fall about 30 percent from their current levels .
Second , there was a tremendous amount of borrowing into the bubble , as new home buyers purchased houses with little or no money down , and as people who already owned houses refinanced their mortgages as a way of converting rising home prices into cash .
As home prices come back down to earth , many of these borrowers will find themselves with negative equity  owing more than their houses are worth .
Negative equity , in turn , often leads to foreclosures and big losses for lenders .

Print This Email This With Americans expected to spend about almost $ 500 billion this Christmas , ABC's ' Nightline ' takes a closer look at one man trying to spread the message that America is being crushed under the weight of consumerism .
" We 're proceeding into the shopping season under an enormous misunderstanding .
We think we are consumers at Christmas time , " shouted the flamboyant Rev. Billy Talen of the Church of Stop Shopping .
" No , we are being consumed ! "
Talen is an activist and performance artist who 's made his presence known at malls and chain stores in New York City .
His efforts to halt what he and his followers call the " shopocalypse " have been chronicled in a new documentary , ' What Would Jesus Buy ? '
In the film , Talen is shown being kicked out of a Starbucks , performing an exorcism at Wal - Mart headquarters , and getting arrested in front of a Disney store .
" I think the commercial Christmas has become the Grinch , " says Talen .
" Polls indicate that most Americans now think of Christmas with dread rather than happy anticipation , and that 's sad . "

MONDAY , Nov. 19 , 2007 ( HealthDay News ) --
A young , trim farmer with four or more children : According to a new study , that 's the ideal profile for American men hoping to reach 100 years of age .
The research , based largely on data from World War I draft cards , suggests that keeping off excess weight in youth , farming and fathering a large number of offspring all help men live past a century .
One finding in particular was unexpected , the researchers said .
" We were surprised that having more than three children is beneficial to longevity -- based on previous studies by other authors , and common sense , quite the opposite could be expected , " said study co-author Leonid Gavrilov , who conducted the study with his wife , Natalia Gavrilova , both of the University of Chicago 's Center on Aging .
Gavrilov , a leader in longevity research , was to present the findings Monday at the Gerontological Society of America annual meeting , in San Francisco .
The husband - and - wife team have long mined vital statistics and other data , looking for clues to why some people live into extreme old age .
Just last year , they reported one new finding : Babies born to women under 25 years of age were twice as likely to live to 100 years of age compared to infants born to moms aged 25 or older .
The new research in men was spurred by the fact that a treasure trove of information about 20th - century American males has now been put online : World War I Draft Registration Cards .
From 1917 to 1918 , almost all adult males aged 46 or under were required by law to fill out these cards , which asked them to detail a number of physical and social attributes .
In their study , Gavrilov and Gavrilova first used Social Security data to locate 240 men born in 1887 who lived to be at least 100 .
In 171 of those cases , the men's physical and social attributes at age 30 were recorded on their WW I draft cards -- giving the researchers a snapshot of their lives at the time .
The Chicago team then compared that data against draft card information for a randomly selected group of American men who were also born in 1887 but who did not reach 100 .
Some surprising findings emerged .
First of all , a man 's chances of reaching 100 rose along with the number of children he had produced by age 30 .
Compared to childless men of the same age , a 30 - year - old man in 1917 who had one to three children had a 61 percent increased chance of living past a century , the data showed .
However , a man 's chances for extreme longevity almost tripled if he had fathered four or more children by age 30 , the study found .
That 's at odds with a prevailing theory in longevity research that holds that " there is a trade - off between the number of children and [ parental ] longevity , " noted Arnold Mitnitski , a longevity researcher and associate professor of medicine , mathematics and statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax , Canada .
He described the study as " very well - done , very clean . "
Theoretically , a household full of young kids should deplete a family 's resources and undermine the longevity of parents , Mitnitski said .
And yet , young dads with many children lived much longer than other men in this sample .
" This may be due to the support by the children when the person becomes older , " Gavrilov speculated .
Alternatively , siring many children " could be an indicator of good general health and attractiveness on the marriage market , leading to earlier marriage and hence to more kids by age 30 , " he said .
In other words , the same robust health that boosted a man 's marriage prospects and fertility might also promote long life , Gavrilov reasoned .
Another finding , replicated in prior studies , was that being a farmer ( as listed on the Draft Card ) more than doubled a man 's odds of living into the triple digits .
" The most popular hypothesis [ there ] is that people in the past had poor sanitation in towns , and hence a high infection load early in life , " Gavrilov said .
Farms were more isolated , and so farmers were less likely to contract life - limiting illnesses , he reasoned .
Not unexpectedly , overweight -- what the researchers described as a " stout " physique -- reduced a man 's likelihood for very long life .
In fact , slender or medium - built men were twice as likely to reach the century mark compared to stout types .
But , " surprisingly , there is not much difference between the slender and the medium body build , in terms of survival chance to 100 , " Gavrilov said .
That runs counter to the results of animal studies that have suggested that low - calorie diets , and resultant skinniness , boosts longevity .
Other characteristics -- including marital and immigration status at 30 -- had little or no impact on longevity .
Finally , taller men were only marginally more likely to live to 100 than their shorter peers , the team found .
Experts have long linked shorter adult height to the types of childhood infections that might shorten lifespan , so this finding is also a bit of a puzzle , Gavrilov said .
" We need to make a larger study and take a closer look at the links between adult height , childhood infection and longevity , " he said .
He stressed that findings for women would no doubt be different , for a variety of reasons .
" We need to find [ similar ] data for women to get the answer , " Gavrilov said .

This otherwise amusing story has some serious lessons :
John :
Yes , I ’m calling to find out why request number 48931258 to transfer somedomain.com was rejected .
ISP : Oh , it was rejected because the request was n’t submitted on company letterhead .
John : Oh… sure … but … uh , just so we ’re on the same page , can you define exactly what you mean by ‘ company letterhead ? ’
ISP : Well , you know , it has the company ’s logo , maybe a phone number and web site address … that sort of thing .
I mean , your fax looks like it could ’ve been typed by anyone !
John :
So you know what my company letterhead looks like ?
ISP : Ye… no .
Not specifically .
But , like , we ’d know it if we saw it .
John :
And what if we do n’t have letterhead ?
What if we ’re a startup ?
What if we ’re redesigning our logo ?
ISP : Well , you ’d have to speak to customer –
John ( clicking and typing ) : I could probably just pick out a semi- professional - looking MS Word template and paste my request in that and resubmit it , right ?
ISP : Look , our policy –
John :
Oh , it ’s ok , I just sent the request back in on letterhead .
Have you noticed ?
It 's getting quieter --- and it 's terrifying .
Day by day , I roll through the outstanding journalists , well - represented at Truthout.com , among other sites .
I read Tom Englehard 's interview with James Carroll , a former Catholic priest who made his bones by speaking out against the Viet Nam War , and for reasons that were not dissimilar to our plight today .
Tom portrays a very convincing picture of James Carroll , as a Catholic and a former collegiate , who is convincing us that Bush sees himself as a religious icon , grabbing the mantle from The Almighty , on a religious crusade , as a born - again Christian .
Now we know for sure .
Brilliant interview .
Just brilliant .
Are there any suggestions as to what we can do with this vision , what action is indicated ?
Oh , sorry .
I must 've slept through the answer ?
Jeb Rubenfeld , of the New York Times recalls his evaluation of Judge Mukasey , before whom Rubenfeld had appeared when he was an Assistant United States Attorney .
He was speaking of his evaluation of Judge Mukasey as nominee for the position of Attorney General .
The Judge had come out with the most extraordinary statement , ( Quoting Rubenfeld quoting the judge )
" was asked whether the president is required to obey federal statutes .
Judge Mukasey replied , ' That would have to depend on whether what goes outside the statute nonetheless lies within the authority of the president to defend the country . ' ”
Rubenfeld , who holds a professorship of Constitutional Law at Yale , in his article " Lawbreaker " states emphatically that
" Under the American Constitution , federal statutes , not executive decisions in the name of national security , are “ the supreme law of the land . ”
It ’s that simple .
So long as a statute is constitutional , it is binding on everyone , including the president . "
Brilliant .
Devastating .
And what , you may ask , is this Yale Law Professor 's sage advice ?
" But before voting to confirm him as the nation ’s chief law enforcement officer , the Senate should demand that he retract this statement . "
Has the full implication of that statement struck you ?
Summed up in the schoolyard challenge , " You take that back ! "
This response speaks volumes --- both for the lack of vision as to what can be done , as well as the utterly meaningless nature of his solution :
" You take that back ! "
We have seen this Imperial President issue edicts , proclamations .
He is " the Decider . "
We have seen the decimation of Habeus Corpus and the summary abandonment of Posse Comutatus , as evidenced by the use of Blackwater mercenaries and National Guards .
We have seen legislators perorate , obfuscate , concilliate , mediate ....
And what have they done to help us out of this quandry ?
Nothing .
Absolutely nothing .
They go home -- with a handsome paycheck .
You go home , lucky if you still have one -- paycheck or home , take your pick .
The legislature goes on its merry way , having sold us out , and being eager to be re-elected to do more mischief , or at least to allow Executive and Judicial mischief to continue .
" Impeachment is off the table , " our Speaker informs us .
This is a person from the Party of Peace and Love , in whom , and by a vote , we entrusted our lives , fortunes and sacred honors -- to reverse the juggernaut .
Imagine :
While the citizenry holds its communal breath , waiting for The " I " Word , there is no explanation , just a simple declarative statement , couched in Auctioneer 's vernacular .
One wonders why she saw fit to say anything at all .
Perhaps she correctly anticipated the outrage that would ensue if the truth had to be forced out of her , all the worse - - for her .
... and these legislators go home , with a paycheck .
" Write to your Senator and congressperson immediately ! "
So we are jarred into action --- of writing that which will be trashed upon arrival .
Better yet , we are treated to some carefully - parsed form letter , fashioned by some smug staffer and signed by the boodle by their respective legislator .
I honestly do n't think they have the stomach to hear the letters read out loud .
Take a greater turn back into perfidy and observe the behavior of the Supreme Court , the highest arbiter of justice , literally , the Court of Last Resort .
The nature of their abuse of responsibility makes us wax nostalgic over the Dred Scott decision .
( At least the Chief Justice , speaking for the Majority , said that it was the Law of the Land . )
Each and every move of this administration is a dark mirror image of what William Shirer described so clearly , so crisp and sharp , in " The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . "
But that 's all over now , is n't it ?
Or is it ?
How about the State Department ?
In " Two Reports Assail State Department Role on Iraq Security " by Eric Schmitt and David Rohde , of October 23rd , 2007 the authors opine :
" Washington - A pair of new reports have delivered sharply critical judgments about the State Department 's performance in overseeing work done by the private companies that the government relies on increasingly in Iraq and Afghanistan to carry out delicate security work and other missions .
" ... A State Department review of its own security practices in Iraq assails the department for poor coordination , communication , oversight and accountability involving armed security companies like Blackwater USA , according to people who have been briefed on the report .
In addition to Blackwater , the State Department 's two other security contractors in Iraq are DynCorp International and Triple Canopy . "
Notice the careful wording :
Oh , it 's not " just " Blackwater .
Funny , but I never heard a word about " Dynacorp " and " Triple Canopy " atrocities .
In fact , I never heard anything about them , period .
With Blackwater goons slaying everyone in the neighborhood on numerous documented occasions , somehow " sharply critical judgments " just does n't cut it .
And does " overseeing work " include turning a blind eye to slaughter of innocents ?
Somehow , I do n't think that we can rescue anyone , Iraqi , American , or what - have - you , by reference to " poor coordination , communication , oversight and accountability involving armed security companies like Blackwater USA , " as If we could only get these folks to coordinate , communicate , oversee and account for something , we can hang up our spurs that jingle - jangle - jingle .
" Like " Blackwater ?
Name any other atrocity -- that matches Blackwater in perfidy and indiscriminate slaughter .
... and these writers go home , and collect a paycheck .
Have you seen anyone suggest a scheme that might work ?
Like a boycott of specific oil pumps , and the use of those that do not sell Arab oil .
British Petroleum comes to mind : like an organized recall election of key congresspersons and subsequent nomination of one of us --- remember ?
The People ?
In this regard it is instructive to see that those who write are speaking in broad , political - philosophic terms .
Never in recent years have I see such a plethora of writings , referring to Madison 's papers , Jefferson 's letters , quotes from our Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to our constitution .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Metal Gear Solid 4 ” is not only one of the most eagerly awaited games for Sony ’s PlayStation 3 , it is also among the last of a dying breed -- games designed exclusively for one gaming console .

" Metal Gear Solid 4 " is not only one of the most eagerly awaited games for Sony 's PlayStation 3 , it is also among the last of a dying breed -- games designed exclusively for one gaming console .

Developed by Japan's Konami 9766.T and due out next year , the game is the latest installment in the action series that produced smash hits for Sony 's 6758 .
T earlier PlayStation 2 .
It 's a prime example of a game known in the industry as a " third party exclusive " , as opposed to " first party " ones made by game - console makers Sony , Microsoft MSFT.O and Nintendo 7974.OS .
For years , the console makers have sought to secure such exclusives as a way to drive adoption of their machines .
“ We ’re telling our fans that if you want to play ‘ Metal Gear Solid 4 ’ , you have to buy a PS3 , ” said Ryan Payton , the assistant producer of the game .
“ The PlayStation brand has always been good to us , and we ’re pretty bullish on the PS3 . ”
But soaring production costs mean it ’s tougher for third - party games to turn a profit if they are limited to just one console .
That ’s especially true for the PS3 , sales of which have lagged those of the Xbox 360 and Wii .
Sony said it has been preparing for the demise of third - party exclusives for a long time .
“ We understand publishers are needing to recoup their investment , ” said Peter Dille , senior vice president of marketing for Sony .
“ From our perspective , as long as the games are n’t going exclusive to other platforms , PS3 gamers are not actually losing anything . ”
Sony has compensated by ramping up its own game production and has 15 internal studios working on PlayStation titles , more than Microsoft and Nintendo combined , Dille said .
He added that there will be 15 PS3 exclusives released between September 2007 and April 2008 .
Payton said the new “ Metal Gear Solid ” needs to sell over a million copies on the first day it goes on sale due to its costly production , but that may be a tough mark to hit given sluggish PS3 sales .
As of October , only 2 million PS3s had been sold in the United States , compared to 5.2 million Wii consoles from rival Nintendo and 7.2 million Xbox 360s from Microsoft , according to market research firm NPD .
A year after its release , only two PS3 games have sold more than 1 million copies , a benchmark of financial success for a big - budget game .
The 7 - year - old PlayStation 2 had nearly 100 games sell more than a million copies .
Top next - generation video games cost between $ 10 million and $ 50 million , according to IDC videogame analyst Billy Pidgeon .
That means publishers must hedge their bets by going onto as many platforms as possible .
“ You might be able to weather one title coming in at 500,000 in sales , ” said Pidgeon .
“ But two or three failures like that and even big publishers are going to be hurting . ”
Several former PlayStation exclusives , including “ Grand Theft Auto , ” “ Virtua Fighter ” and “ Devil May Cry , ” are now appearing on rival consoles , making the benefits of purchasing a PS3 questionable to some hard - core game buyers .
Some people think even “ MGS4 ” might not be compelling enough to turn the sales tide .
“ No , ‘ Metal Gear Solid 4 ’ is n’t the killer app , ” said Adam Sessler , a video game critic on the G4 network .
“ People who already own a PS3 will likely get it .
But it does n’t have that kind of broad - based appeal . ”
Still , the iconic nature of the game combined with a cheap new PS3 model could boost sales when the game hits the market in the second quarter of 2008 .
“ There are definitely a lot of people still sitting on the fence about buying a PS3 , and this game could be the one that gets them to buy it , ” Pidgeon said .
Mottaki said Iran would defend itself against a strike
" Our analysis is clear : [ the ] US is not in a position to impose another war in our region , against their taxpayers , " Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters .
He warned Washington against making such a " mad decision " .
Iran rejects accusations that it is seeking to build atomic weapons under the cover of a nuclear power programme .
Despite its conviction that the US would find launching another military assault extremely taxing , Iran was making preparations for such an attack , Mr Mottaki said on the fringes of a UN General Assembly session in New York .
He said information had been received which gave specific details of planned strikes .
The US says it is pursuing a diplomatic resolution but has refused to rule out a strike against Iran .
Former Major Leaguer Jim Leyritz Charged with DUI and Vehicular Homicide
Former Yankees Major Leaguer Jim Leyritz , was arrested and charged with DUI and vehicular homicide after a Friday morning accident which left one person dead .
Leyritz was driving a 2006 Ford Expedition in Fort Lauderdale when he crashed into a 2000 Mitsubishi driven by a 30 - year - old woman , who was thrown from the vehicle .
The woman was transported to a hospital , where she later died .
The woman 's identity has not been released to the media .
According to reports , Lyeritz refused a breathalyser test .
If convicted , the former World Series hero faces a fine of up to $ 10,000 and up to 15 years in prison , as well as losing his drivers license permanently .

The ' Robin Hood ' generation did not go in for refined sugar
Their low - fat , vegetable - rich diet - washed down by weak ale - was far better for the heart than today 's starchy , processed foods , one GP says .
And while they consumed more they burnt off calories in a workout of 12 hours ' labour , Dr Roger Henderson concludes .
But the Shropshire GP accepts that life for even prosperous peasants was tough .
But after examining the available records , Dr Henderson suggests that medieval meals were perhaps even better than the much touted " Mediterranean " diet enjoyed by the Romans .
While this would have involved fish , fruit , whole grains and olive oil - as well as red wine - the rich often overindulged , while the poor may not always have been able to obtain them .
The average medieval peasant however would have eaten nearly two loaves of bread each day , and 8 oz of meat or fish , the size of an average steak .
MEDIEVAL LIFESTYLE
Calories : 3,500 - 4,000
Nearly two loaves of bread
Three pints of ale Up to 12 hours labour each day
This would have been accompanied by liberal quantities of vegetables , including beans , turnips and parsnips , and washed down by three pints of ale .
Crucially , there was little refined sugar in their food , while modern eating habits are dominated by biscuits , cake and sweets .
" If you put this together with the incredible work load , medieval man was at much less risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes than we are today , " said Dr Henderson .
MODERN LIFESTYLE

However , he did acknowledge that people today did have one advantage over their ancestors when it came to staying alive .
" If you got to 30 in those days you were doing well , past 40 and you were distinctly long in the tooth , " he concedes .
Anna Denny of the British Nutrition Foundation said : " This research highlights how much lifestyles have changed over the centuries .
" Today , the majority of adults in the UK are overweight or obese , but energy intakes have actually been decreasing for several decades . "
The New York Times this morning has an analysis of the " fragile , and possibly fleeting " situation in Iraq .
Officials attribute the relative calm to a huge increase in the number of Sunni Arab rebels who have turned their guns on jihadists instead of American troops ; a six - month halt to military action by the militia of a top Shiite leader , Moktada al - Sadr ; and the increased number of American troops on the streets here .
The Kurdish Deputy Prime Minister described it as " more a cease - fire than a peace . "
The point about a cease - fire is that they can easily cease .
Here is the rub :
all of these changes can be reversed , and on relatively short notice .
The Americans have already started to reduce troop levels and Mr. Sadr , who has only three months to go on his pledge , has issued increasingly bellicose pronouncements recently .
The Sunni insurgents who turned against the jihadists are now expecting to be rewarded with government jobs .
Yet , so far , barely 5 percent of the 77,000 Sunni volunteers have been given jobs in the Iraqi security forces , and the bureaucratic wheels have moved excruciatingly slowly despite government pledges to bring more Sunnis in .
One of the major problems with both the surge and " Sunni awakening " strategy has been their long term sustainability .
For the surge , we never had enough troops to adequately implement a counter - insurgency strategy over the long term .
The ground forces are simply stretched too thin to make the necessary long - term commitment .
Additionally , the Sunni strategy may have serious unintended consequences , as we have organized an armed Sunni group that the Shia - led government is loathe to incorporate .
We have armed both sides in the civil war .
And ...
it is likely that the old divisions will rapidly resurface as the United States reduces its troop levels .
If that happens , extremist Sunnis will renew their assaults on Shiites and Mr. Sadr ’s Mahdi Army militia will respond in kind .
What sense did it make to institute a strategy that was not sustainable from the get - go ?

What 's This Site About ?
Did you ever sit at the airport or at a cafe and there was a unencrypted wireless access point nearby , but whenever you wanted to visit a site their website would pop up asking for a fee to use the internet through their AccessPoint ( aka. Captive Portal ) ?
Well , I did , several times .
But in most cases you are able to look up arbitrary hostnames , ie . google.com .
That is because if you cannot resolve a host name your browser wo n't display any site .
So these providers usually allow to look up hostnames to then filter whether they are allowed to access the site or not .
In the latter case , their pay - to - get - access site pops up .
But you can use the fact that you can resolve arbitrary hostnames to gain free connection to the internet .
Not a very fast one , though , but still a free internet connection .
The Idea
The Idea is to tunnel all outgoing traffic through DNS .
Yes , you heard right , through DNS , the Domain Name System , used to translate human - readable hostnames to numerical IP addresses and vice versa .
To understand how this 'll work , you need a little knowledge of DNS .
The DNS system has quite a lot of so - called types of records , such as A for address record , NS for nameserver record , CNAME for canonical name record etc .
The most commonly used record is the A record .
To let the hostname example.com point to 192.0.34.166 you 'd set up the following in your DNS server 's config :
example.com .
IN A 192.0.34.166
Usually , such entries are stored at your provider 's nameserver and you do n't have any / full control over them ( most likely if you bought a rather cheap webhosting package ) .
But to allow DNS tunneling to work , there has to be a little bit more advanced setup .
What we 'll do is delegate all requests to a certain subdomain ( or , subzone ) to another nameserver .
That means : People want to look up your IP , get to your ISP 's nameserver and will be redirected to your own nameserver which can then answer the request .
For this , of course , you 'll need a server running the client where you can become root .
Keep in mind :
All requests to a certain subdomain are relayed to your host , which then answers them .
And you wo n't look up ordinary hostnames , I tell you .
Hope you got the idea .
Technical Setup
To delegate all requests to sub.example.com to ns.anothernameserver.com , you first have to delegate all requests to that server ( NS record , line 1 ) and then send a so - called GLUE record ( that is , glued to the record before because it 's most likely the asking server will need this info as well ) with your server 's IP ( line 2 , A record ) .
sub.example.com .
IN NS ns.anothernameserver.com .
ns.anothernameserver.com .
IN A 192.0.34.166
If you just have a DynDNS account and no static IP , you 'd set up the delegation using a CNAME record .
As mentioned above , CNAME is a canonical name ( speak : an alias ) .
So when a server gets back a CNAME instead of an A record ( IP address ) he continues to look up this hostname .
That brings us to the following :
sub.example.com .
IN NS ns.extern.example.com .
ns.extern.example.com .
IN CNAME foo.bar.dyndns.org .
The Fake Server
The fake server you can set up at your server to tunnel all the traffic through is a little program called OzymanDNS , written in Perl ( Client and Server together 642 SLOC ) by DNS guru Dan Kaminsky .
The tool is split in four files , two of them being a file upload / download tool using DNS .
Nice examples , but rather uninteresting for our approach .
The script nomde.pl is the server .
Since the server binds to port 53 UDP on your server ( which is a privileged port ) you must be root to start the server .
Also , make sure port 53 UDP is reachable from the outside ( consider running nmap - v - sU host from a remote machine ) .
You will usually want to start it as follows :
sudo ./nomde.pl - i 0.0.0.0 server.example.com
Here , the server will only listen to DNS requests for all subdomains of server.example.com .
That way , people who do n't know that exact address cannot use the service on your server .
The Client
The OzymanDNS client is just a perl script which encodes and transfers everything it receives on STDIN to it 's destination , via DNS requests .
Replys are written to STDOUT .
So this is n't particularly useful as a standalone program .
But it was designed to be used together with SSH .
And with SSH this works great .
SSH has a config option , ProxyCommand , which lets you use OzymanDNS 's droute.pl client to tunnel the SSH traffic .
The command to connect to your server would look like this :
ssh -o ProxyCommand= " ./droute.pl sshdns.server.example.com " user@localhost
Note two things :
Add a sshdns .
in front of the hostname you specified the server to listen to and Since your connection will already have been tunneled through DNS ( and thus has come out at your host already ) there is no need to login as user@server.example.com ( because that already is localhost )
Once the connection is established ( you 'll probably have to enter your password ) you have a shell !
The connection is a little bit droppy sometimes and has not got the best latency , but it is still good keeping in mind that connections to the internet are not allowed at this Cafe / Airport / ....
Tunneling
Once you verified that the connection is actually working , you can set up a tunnel so that you may not only have shell , but complete web acces , can fetch mails using POP , etc. , etc ...
For this , I recommend to read my tutorial on How to Tunnel Everything through SSH .
Do n't forget :
It may provide great performance increases to use SSH's - C ( " compress data " ) switch !
Communication between the Servers
So , now how might the servers communicate with each other , not being directly able to establish a connection ? , you might ask now .
Well , since all subdomain resolve requests are delegatet ( ie. , relayed ) to your host , you can include arbitrary data in the hostname which your server then can interpret and execute / relay .
The bytes you want to send to the server ( upstream ) will be encoded using Base32 ( if you know what Base64 is , Base32 is just the same except there is no case sensivitiy , for EXAMPLE .
COM ist just the same as example.com ) .
After the data , there is a unique ID ( since some DNS requests may take longer than others and the UDP protocol has no methods to check this ) and either one of the keywords up or down , indicating whether the traffic 's up - or downstream .
Here is what an example request could look like ( transferring something to the server ) :
ntez375sy2qk7jsg2og3eswo2jujscb3r43as6m6hl2ws xobm7h2olu4tmaq.lyazbf2e2rdynrd3fldvdy2w3tifi gy2csrx3cqczxyhnxygor72a7fx47uo.nwqy4oa3v5rx6 6b4aek5krzkdm5btgz6jbiwd57ubnohnknpcuybg7py.6 3026-0.id-32227.up.sshdns.feh.dnstunnel.de
The server 's response comes as a DNS TXT record .
A TXT record can hold arbitrary ASCII data and can hold uppercase letters as well as lowercase letters and numbers ( some other characters , as well ) .
So the responses come Base64 encoded .
Such a response might look like the following one :
695-8859.id-39201.down.sshdns.feh.dnstunnel.de. 0 IN TXT " AAAAlAgfAAAAgQDKrd3sFmf8aLX6FdU8ThUy3SRWGhotR6EsAavqHgBzH2khqsQHQjEf355jS7cT
G+4a8kAmFVQ4mpEEJeBE6IyDWbAQ9a0rgOKcsaWwJ7GdngGm9jpvReXX7S/2oqAIUFCn0M8= " " MHw9tR0kkDVZB7RCfCOpjfHrir7yuiCbt7FpyX8AAAABBQAAAAAAAAAA
"
That is , in rough outlines , how tunneling via DNS works .
Security Issues
There are a few security issues you 'll have to think about before letting the server run permanently :
As soon as some people guess which subdomain you use to tunnel DNS they can send arbitrary commands to the server .
I have n't reviewed the code for too long , but there might be the possiblity of a bug which could be exploited to gain access to your system .
But that ist just a unlikely hypothesis .
The software still is very experimental and crashes every now and then ( see below for a workaround ) .
Consider that the server puts a high load on your system while actively surfing .
I own a Server but my ISP does n't allow me to change ( the relevant ) DNS settings
Well , that is the reason I created this website .
I offer to set up a subdomain for you which delegates all requests ( see above ) to your fake nameserver .
I cannot handle the mass of requests coming in ; doing the communication and ( manually ! ) setting up the records is just too much .
Therefore , I advise you to check at free DNS providers first , for example :
If you 're willing to pay a little money ( like 5 EUR ) you could just as well register a domain name at INWX , which is the provider I use for hosting the DNS of this domain .
If you have no whatsoever means to do the setup on your own write me an email at < request AT dnstunnel.de > .
You should include your full name , your server 's static IP or DynDNS hostname and the desired subdomain name ( name.dnstunnel.de ; I encourage you to keep this secret for your own security ) .
Be prepared to wait a few days or even weeks until I get around to setting up the records !
Legal Warning
Circumventing the AP 's access controls ( that includes DNS tunneling ) is most probably considered to be a crime , depending on the country you live in .
I am not responsible for whatever you do with your tunnel .
I am just providing two simple entries in my ISP 's DNS server to let a hostname point to your server 's IP .
Helper Script
Here are two little helper scripts that 'll allow you to automatically start OzymanDNS on system boot through initd .
This is my / etc / init.d / ozymandns file :
#!/bin/sh # Written by Julius Plenz set -e case " $ 1 " in start ) echo -n " Starting ozymandns listener ... " screen -d -m /usr/local/bin/ozymandns -listener echo " . " ;; stop ) echo -n " Stopping ozymandns listener ... " kill `cat /var/run/ozymandns.pid` echo " . " ;; restart )
/etc/init.d/ozymandns stop /etc/init.d/ozymandns start ; ; reload|force - reload ) echo " cannot do that " echo " . " ;; *) echo " Usage : /etc/init.d/$NAME { start|stop|restart} " exit 1 ; ; esac exit 0
Of course , you 'll have to make the script executable .
Then I 'd suggest to put two links to automatically start and terminate the server on bootup / shutdown :
~# cd /etc/rc0.d / ; ln -s ../init.d/ozymandns K15ozymandns ~# cd /etc/rc2.d/ ; ln -s ../init.d/ozymandns S99ozymandns
The program called from the init script ( /usr/local/bin/ozymandns - listener ) looks like this :
#!/bin/sh REPLYIP=0.0.0.0 DNSHOST=name.dnstunnel.de echo $ $ > /var/run/ozymandns.pid while [ [ -e /var/run/ozymandns.pid ] ] ; do cd /usr / local / bin/ nomde.pl - i $ REPLYIP $ DNSHOST >/dev/null 2>&1 done
Note :
This script again assumes you have installed the nomde.pl server in /usr / local / bin / as well .

Documentation
There are a few other documents on the net explaining how DNS tunneling works .
Some of these documents describe how DNS tunneling works with nstx , which is a different application , but basically also does the same as OzymanDNS .

White House says Bush plans administrative orders to govern , avoiding Congress
It 's not quite signing statements , where President George W. Bush used legal means to " interpret " laws , allowing him to avoid Congressional directives , but the White House is now planning to implement as much new policy " as it can " by administrative order " after concluding that President Bush cannot do much business with the Democratic leadership . "
According to officials who spoke to the Washington Post , Bush blames Democrats for the holdup of Judge Michael Muskasey 's nomination as attorney general , the failure to pass budget bills and an inability to reach compromise on child healthcare .
Bush vetoed the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP , saying Democrats had n't found a way to offset spending for the expansion of the program .
Democrats have reservations about Mukasey because he has refused to denounce the president 's policy on waterboarding .
" White House aides say the only way Bush seems to be able to influence the process is by vetoing legislation or by issuing administrative orders , as he has in recent weeks on veterans ' health care , air - traffic congestion , protecting endangered fish and immigration , " the Post authors write .
" They say they expect Bush to issue more of such orders in the next several months , even as he speaks out on the need to limit spending and resist any tax increases . "
House Democrats disagree with Bush 's assessments .
The article gave little information about Bush 's plans for administrative orders , focusing mostly on Congressional infighting and legislative disagreements between the White House and Congress .
On Wednesday , a diarist at the liberal blog Daily Kos noted that administrative orders differ from executive orders and directives , citing a University of Tulsa research document on executive power .
" Administrative Orders include numbered documents called determinations , and notices or memorandum designated by date , " the document states .
" These orders often concern foreign policy decisions but may also include management decisions made by the President that concern Executive Departments . "
Recent examples of such documents , as listed by the National Archives , include " Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia , " " Memorandum on Waiver and Certification of Statutory Provisions Regarding the Palestine Liberation Organization Office , " and " Memorandum on Waiver of Limitation on Obligation and Expenditure of $ 1,051.6 Million in Fiscal Year 2007 Economic Support Funds for Iraq . "
" Given Bush s dubious track record over the past seven - years , I get the distinct and ominous feeling this has more to do with Congress  hesitation to green light a preemptive attack on Iran than it does with the amount of work Congress is doing overall , " the Kos diarist remarks .

In case you missed it , a recent Johns Hopkins study concludes that 20 % of American high schools graduate 40 % or fewer seniors than they enrolled four years earlier .
The methodology leaves something to be desired .
At least some of those schools probably have a high transfer rate .
When you take the numbers as a whole , though , it ’s pretty clear that there is an unacceptable number of high school students who are dropping out .
While some of them will go on to get a GED ( which is hardly a substitute for four years of college prep courses ) , most will live life without a diploma or , worse , without the basic skills needed to hold anything but the most menial of jobs .
I suppose I could go into just how bad this is for society , but why ?
Anyone reading this knows that , in a society in which income depends increasingly on possessing in - demand skills , having a substantial segment of Americans that do n’t have , and cannot acquire , those skills is a bad thing .
If the US wants to have more people living in poverty , more outsourced jobs , declining productivity , and outsized crime rates , we ’re doing all the right things with public education .
The question , as always , is how to fix the problem .
Everyone seems to have an opinion , even Robert Balfanz and John Bridgeland who wrote this particularly vacuous piece for the Christian Science Monitor .
Balfanz and Bridgeland assert that surveys of high school dropouts indicate that “ they would have stayed on track to graduate if school had been more relevant , challenging , and supportive of their needs . ”
There you have it .
All those future Nobel Laureates dropped out of school because it was n’t challenging enough .
Eureka !!!
Why did n’t we allthink of this .
Presumably , their solution is to take kids who can barely do long division , or barely read the Sunday comics , and teach them multivariable calculus and Chaucer in the original Middle English .
What ’s wrong with Balfanz ’s and Bridgeland ’s approach is that the intervention they suggest is too late .
There was a time in American manufacturing when “ quality control ” was designed to catch defective products at the end of the assembly line and either fix them or discard them .
Naturally , a number of defective products got into consumers ’ hands .
The Japanese decided to fix the manufacturing process itself , so that few , if any , defective products ever reached the end of the assembly line .
Consumers liked that , which is largely why the Japanese kicked American butt in some important American industries , and continue to do so .
When it comes to education , we seem to have learned nothing from this experience .
If we want US students to succeed in high school , we ’re not going to get there by fixing the product ( high school ) at the end of the assembly line .
We ’re not going to get it by putting them into more “ challenging ” classes in which they cannot succeed .
The only way we ’re going to turn out well - educated , capable , willing - and - able - to - learn high school graduates is by fixing the educational process from the front end and controlling , measuring , and adjusting it as students move through school .
To simplify things , I ’m going to focus on what needs to be done with one skill : reading .
Reading is the cornerstone of everything else .
If you do n’t read well , you wo n’t write well .
You ca n’t learn science , history , or any other subject very easily , if at all .
Even mathematics textbooks require reading , and the best tests ( probably ) of mathematical reasoning involve explaining , in writing , why you did what you did with the numbers at hand , so that number manipulation is n’t learned simply by rote .
Many people ( and maybe most ) have the idea that reading is all about deciphering a code .
Surely , deciphering that code comes in handy when one encounters an unfamiliar word , but that is not how skilled readers read .
Skilled readers see whole words as symbols .
They do not read every letter , sounding out every word .
This takes practice , which means that learning to read well means reading often .
Not surprisingly , reading often is one of the two factors predicting reading level .
The other factor , a high comprehension of what one reads , seems intuitive at first , but has a counter - intuitive implication :
It is counterproductive to push students into reading material that is at the limit of , or above , their capabilities .
Readers progress most rapidly when they comprehend 90 % to 100 % of the material they read , and while syntax , sentence length , and paragraph length have an impact on reading comprehension , the most important factor is vocabulary .
We all have great difficulty comprehending something when we do n’t know what the words mean .
( If you doubt this , try reading a treatise on medieval armor parts , or try reading Shakespeare without annotation if you are relatively unfamiliar with Elizabethan words . )
Which brings us to the fix .
I ’m not a big fan of ED Hirsch , but he gets it right when he points out that vocabulary is closely linked to the chances one will ever be a skilled reader .
When we have some kids coming to the first grade with 1,000 - word listening vocabularies ( or worse ) , and some with 12,000 - word listening vocabularies , it ’s quite clear that the kids with the larger vocabularies are going to learn reading skills faster than their vocabulary - disadvantaged classmates , all things ( like the amount of reading done ) being equal .
Given all this , here is what I suggest to fix the problem :
Devote more time in elementary education to reading a lot , and reading within one ’s level of comprehension ( 90 % to 100 % comprehension ) .
Science , history , geography , social studies , and ( God forbid ) spelling are useless unless a kid knows how to read .
Provide free , government - sponsored daycare / pre-school to children from families with limited vocabularies .
This pre-school would focus on reading aloud to children , building listening vocabulary , and teaching early alphabet , decoding , and reading skills .
This would build listening vocabularies to acceptable levels prior to entering K - 12 education , and have the added benefit of providing free day care to parents who need to find and keep jobs .
Manage classrooms so that those behind in reading receive extra time and assistance , and those who are reading well can learn science , social studies , and the like .
Hold principals ’ and teachers ’ feet to the fire over two factors :
How much their children are reading and how well they are comprehending what they read .
What ’s really maddening about all this is that there is good software that will measure students ’ time spent reading and comprehension levels .
The software generates reports that allow school districts to hold principals and teachers accountable .
The reports aid the ability to manage classrooms for the benefit of all children .
Getting more time for reading can be done with a simple change in curriculum and focus .
All that is lacking is # 2 , and that will take tax money and political will .
That ’s all .
If we fix elementary education for students with inadequate vocabularies , I ’m convinced that the high school dropout rate will take care of itself .
High school English faculty will be teaching To the Lighthouse instead of The Little Red Lighthouse , and Virginia Woolf instead of the Big Bad Wolf .
Mathematics will terminate in calculus instead of “ making change . ”
Colleges will have to expand to accommodate all the new future engineers , poets , scientists , and music theorists who want to attend .
It all comes down to reading .
Let ’s invest our tax dollars in something that will actually work , getting to children when real good can be done — instead of years too late .
In Australia buying Beer or Gin and ordering Rum as well as other kinds of Liqueurs is easy through the various trusted , authentic and reliable sellers who offer online options for drink lovers .
In most of the areas where people need to buy their top quality drinks , they can request the online stores and various brands that sell their super - crafted beer products for their online buyers .
People have favourites when it comes to the type of drink they prefer as well as when they buy from some stores , manufacturers or sellers who are available online .
Not all manufacturers keep their manufacturing process the same and they do add some unique flavors and options for buyers to make sure they enjoy every drink in a unique way .
For every buy there is always an option to choose from Stout , Lager Beer and other kinds such as the Wheat Beer or Cider products .
People can easily browse through the categories that are offered online and they can simply choose which ever of the options the best as per their taste and desire is .
Taste of Scotch
Whisky or any kind of beer that people may want to buy and drink from their trusted and favourite brands may stay the same or sometimes the taste may vary depending on the age , the source and the process that is involved in making of the drink .
In addition to that there could be many other things that may alter the taste .
Though it is important to see that if the taste differs you must take notice and find the cause in order to avoid risks to your health .
The temperature at which the bottles or cans are stored usually play an important role in determining what best flavor that you can get from it is .
In addition to that the age of the drink and shelf life must be noticed before consumption so that there is no doubt in the quality of the drink .
Sometime sit just the blend or the source of the drink that makes it feel different and you can simply notice the added flavor if you want to make sure you are drinking the safe drink .

In the last twenty years , the craft of safe cracking has tragically declined .
It is no longer the glamorous activity featured in every other detective film , and the number of real criminal attacks on safes has fallen dramatically .
So I m delighted to see so many children in the audience as its time to start training up a new generation of safe crackers or it will become a lost art .
I suspect this decline is linked to the general loss of practical mechanical skills  children today are no longer taught metalwork , just DT .
A sound knowledge of metalwork would be very useful in breaking into a safe , but DT is no help at all .
At first glance a modern safe does look totally impregnable .
The two locks , ( one key and one combination ) do not themselves open the door , they merely release the elaborate bolt mechanism .
This pushes 50 mm steel bolts out in all directions , securing every side of the safe door , even the hinge side .
It is no use chopping the hinges off a safe , the bolts will still hold it as firmly shut as ever .
If it looks virtually impossible to get in through the door , getting in through the walls or the back is no easier .
They are about four inches thick , an inner and outer skin of steel , with the cavity between filled with extra strong concrete .
The enormous weight of a safe makes it very difficult for thieves to carry it off , whole  it also makes the door very dangerous .
Its extreme weight gives it such momentum when closing that it becomes a guillotine , chopping any fingers caught between door and frame .
Larger bank vault doors are often circular , with bolts that shoot out all round the edge .
The reason for circular doors is simply that they are easier to make .
Both door and frame can be cut accurately round on a large lathe to make them a snug fit .
Getting a rectangular door to fit closely at every point is more difficult , particularly with its enormous weight , which can cause distortion .
Behind the door , bank vaults are massive , built in concrete structures .
Criminals have had some success tunnelling their ways in .
Adam Worth , a cerebrated Victorian criminal , made his initial fortune tunnelling into a bank in Boston .
He then moved to England with his accomplice Piano Charlie where they both fell for an irish barmaid prostitute called Kitty Flynn .
She eventually married Piano Charlie , but continued to sleep with both .
Worth masterminded a huge variety of crimes in Britain , including stealing an entire diamond shipment from the Kimberley mines , and was not caught until 40 years later .
He then , with his exploits publicised , became the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes adversary Moriarty .
Both Worth and Piano Charlie died in poverty , but Kitty became a rich and litigious widow in New York .
Anyway , to counter the threat of tunnelling bank vaults started to incorporate patrol passages  round the outside to check no one is attempting to tunnel their way in .
The invincibility of bank safes is so convincing that they are quite often left on open display ( less so in Britain than most other parts of the world ) as proof of the security of your money .
Mies Van Der Rohe designed a particularly elegant bank in Torronto called the  Transparent Bank .
The need to keep precious and valuable possessions safe is nothing new .
The modern safe is directly descended from the medieval chests , now often found in museums and churches , used as collecting boxes .
These chests were beautifully decorated , at first mainly made of wood , with iron hinges , locks and strappings .
Later ones were entirely made of iron .
The lids often had elaborate bolt work , like a modern safe .
For extra security the keyhole would often be hidden under a secret flap , or disguised as part of the decoration .
A few even had knives which shot out if the lock was tampered with .
Ive always admired these chests , they were obviously such important objects , so when my sister , who lived in Brixton , got burgled some years ago , I decided to make one for her .
Large locks are great things to make , turning the key makes a wonderfully satisfying clunk , much better than any modern mass produced lock .
To surprise the burglar , I incorporated a device that released a small explosive charge inside the lock when the key was turned , unless one of the side handles was first lifted .
My hope was that this would be so unnerving that he would then run away .
Unfortunately I never found whether it worked , my sister moved out of Brixton and hasnt been burgled since .
Building elaborate chests continued well into the 19th century .
The price dropped dramatically as they started to be made of cast iron , an idea which dates from 1780 , following the craze for cast iron coffins .
There are some records of complaints as wrought iron was replaced by cast iron , the artistry of the blacksmith replaced by crude mass production , but that s progress .
Early in the 19th century one key idea was introduced , the double skin .
It was realised that 100 mm of insulation between the outer wall and the inner wall would provide great thermal insulation and protect the contents if caught in a fire .
The most common insulation used was sawdust , though even greater protection came from filling the gap with water , an idea patented by Thomas Milner in 1830 ( Milner is to this day one of the main British safe companies ) .
The name safe came from these new fireproof cabinets .
At the time it was seen as astonishing that the contents of these safes could survive the heat of a fire ( they were sometimes called Salamanders ) and safe companies often staged public demonstrations , mounting their safes on large bonfires .
Strauss was actually commissioned to write some music for one of these events , he called it the  Feufest Polka .
In fact , sitting on top of a bonfire is not a particularly severe test for a safe , real fires in buildings are often much larger and leave the safe buried under hot rubble for hours .
Most modern safes will protect the contents against almost any fire  there is a famous example of a safe 300 metres from the centre of the atomic blast at Hiroshima , whose contents survived intact .
Cast iron was not the ideal material to use for victorian fireproof safes , it was too brittle .
If a safe fell any distance in a fire it would certainly shatter .
For this reason most safes came to be made of flat iron plates , riveted together into a box .
This was a very strong form of construction , practically all large Victorian engineering feats used rivets  bridges , steam engines , ships etc .
Even boilers with high pressure steam inside , were riveted together .
Used in safes though , rivets had a fatal flaw .
In the 1860s there were a series of robberies , particularly one in the city of London from the Cornhill Insurance Company , in which the thieves simply broke the rivets and peeled open the top of the safe .
Breaking the heads off rivets is surprisingly quick and easy  you simply insert a cold chisel under the head and hit it with a large hammer .
Fortunately the quality of steel was gradually improving , ( it was becoming more ductile ) , and by 1900 a method of bending the outside walls of a safe from a single sheet of steel had been perfected .
This bending process , which could be done with up to 12 mm thick steel , produced the rounded edges and corners that have characterised safes ever since , even though safes today are square boxes again , made of flat plates welded together .
With the structure of the safe improved , attention turned to the locks .
The medieval chests had very impressive looking locks , and even more impressive looking keys .
Inside the lock , the key passes through a ward , a plate cut to a negative of the profile of the key .
The top edge of the key then pulls the locks bolt back , opening it up .
Although it would be very difficult to make an exact copy of the real key , anything the right height that will fit through the ward will open the lock .
Minimal fake keys like this came to be called skeleton keys .
Because of this weakness more secure lever locks were introduced in the 18th century , culminating in the unpickable  lock invented by Joseph Bramah in 1784 .
Bramah was a prolific inventor , he invented the hydraullic press and the WC amongst other things .
Amazingly , his lock is still manufactured today , virtually unchanged , in the UK , I recently bought one for about £ 100 .
The key is a cylinder with tiny grooves cut in it .
No skeleton key could open his lock and it remained infallible for 67 years , until it was finally opened at the 1851 Great Exhibition by an American locksmith called Hobbs .
Instead of a skeleton key Hobbs used a selection of picks .
The principle of picking a lock is to insert two thin springy strips of metal into the keyhole , one applies a small turning force , while the other feels  the various pins or levers , lifting them inside the lock .
When one reaches the right height , a small give can be felt in the turning pick .
With luck , as long as the turning force is maintained , the pin will stay raised while the feeler pick works on the next pin .
This is not easy to do  the process has been described as being like Sysiphus ; you just get to the last pin and then something slips and they all fall back and you have to start all over again .
I have never managed to do it .
It took Hobbs 51 hours to pick Bramahs lock .
The reason for Hobbs perseverance was to convince people of the superiority of his own  Champion Parautoptic Bank Lock  ( Paraupoptic means preventing internal inspection ) .
In fact Hobbs lock did less well than Bramahs , it was picked within 5 years by another American locksmith called Linus Yale , simply using a wooden key .
One distressed bank manager wrote ;  Mr
Yale picked my ten tumbler ( Hobbs ) lock , the finest of its kind , for which I paid $ 300 .
He cut a wooden key solely from inspection of the lock through the keyhole , which turned the bolt back as readily as my own key would have done .
And then , to complete my discomforture , he cut away one bit of his wooden key and locked it so I could have never again unlocked it with my own key . 
Like Hobbs ,
Yale had his own design of Champion bank lock .
( This game , revealling the lack of security of the rivals products is very similar to todays game , cracking computer encryption software ) .
Yales son , another Linus Yale , wanted to become a portrait painter , but eventually followed his father , inventing the standard  Yale  lock used on front doors ever since .
Though
Yale seniors champion bank lock was never picked , he later decided that it was in theory pickable , as is any lock which leaves its pins or levers exposed through sight or feeling through the keyhole .
For this reason , he changed tack and invented a combination lock  with no keyhole .
Perhaps because it was an American invention , combination locks are to this day more popular in America than in Europe .
A combination lock is elegantly simple inside , I made a crude model of one in a couple of hours .
Theres no way of picking a lock like this without any keyhole .
It also obvious that theres no click or other noise as the tumblers reach their correct position , the only noise is when the lever finally descends into the slot , once the right combination has been dialled in .
I used to think the use of stethoscopes was a big myth of safe cracking , until a couple of years ago when a real safe cracker introduced himself at the end of my lecture .
He told me the stethoscope is only useful when used in conjunction with a large dial and pointer fixed to the safe ( something I 've certainly never seen in the movies )
Its a slow process which takes hours , listening to the slight noise of the lever touching the tumblers and marking where the pointer is on the dial , then moving the tumblers a bit between each reading .
With hundreds of readings , its possible to ' map ' the very slight eccentricity of the tumblers - the lever is unlikely to touch all three simultaneously .
Once you know which of the tumblers the lever is touching , its relatively simple to find the exact combination .
The safecracker I met was an electronics engineer who had been automating the process for a gang .
However , there are other less elaborate ways to crack a combination lock .
The nobel prize winning physicist , Richard Feynman , became very interested in combination locks while working on the atomic bomb in Los Alomos during the second world war .
The scientists were rarely allowed to leave the site , so there wasnt much to do when he wasnt working , and safe cracking became a sort of hobby .
As the project was all top secret , every office had combination locks on its filing cabinets .
Feynman first discovered , playing with the locks on his own filing cabinet , that the numbers did not have to be that precise , each one could be up to two digits either side of the true number and the lock would still open .
This enormously reduced the number of possible combinations ( from 1,000,000 down to 8,000 ) .
With practice he found he could try 400 different combinations in half an hour , so trying every single combination it would take on average 4 hours to open the lock .
A modern version of this , advertised on the internet , is a motorised German device that turns the dial , trying every combination in turn , for use by locksmiths trying to get into a safe whoes combination has been lost .
Feynmans next technique depended on his visiting an office during the day , while the lock was open .
While chatting to the occupant of the office he would idly fiddle with the lock .
He turned the simply turned the dial back and forth , going one number further each time .
After each number he would turn the dial back to see if the lock would still open .
The number he reached when the lock first refused to open again was the first number of the combination .
With a slightly more lengthy version of this he could find the second number as well .
Feynmans final approach was to use psychology .
Surprisingly often combination locks are left on their factory settings , ( usually 100 , 50 , 100 ) .
However , when a new combination i s chosen the person entrusted with it lives in fear of forgetting it .
So , people tend to use numbers they know , like their birthday , or their phone number .
At Los Alamos the scientists often used mathematical constants like pi .
If anyone does choose random numbers , they are almost certain to write them down somewhere , often thinly disguised in address books .
By the end of the war Feynman had a record of almost everyones combination and a fearsome reputation as a safecracker .
Although it is possible to crack a combination lock , its rarely a method used by criminals , or even by safe manufacturers called to open a safe whose combination has been lost .
Many safes have time locks , so even if the combination is cracked , the safe will not open outside office hours .
All post offices have time locks on their safes .
Many safes also have a simple microswitch inside the combination lock connected to the alarm system to trigger it whenever the dial is turned .
For these reasons , most attempts to break into safes by - pass the lock altogether .
One method is to drill the door .
With engineering drawings of the bolt mechanism , it is possible to find a point on the safe door to drill through .
A screwdriver can then be pushed through and manipulated to release the bolt mechanism  by - passing the combination lock altogether .
Without precise knowledge of the mechanism , it is almost impossible to find the right place to drill , particularly because special extra hard , drill resistant materials are used around the vulnerable lock area .
These extra hard materials include Tungsten carbide and ceramics  the materials used as cutters in modern machine tools .
Theres also sometimes a layer of ordinary steel washers or ball bearings .
These arent particularly hard , but they spin round when a drill bit touches them , so are almost impossible to cut through .
Theres one story of a bungled attack on a safe in which the thieves kept having to fetch cans of coke from a nearby drinks machines to pour over the drill bits in an attempt to keep them cool .
The safe was discovered , unopened , the next day , surrounded by empty cans and broken drill bits embedded in the door .
The extra hard layers could quite easily be incorporated over the entire lock area , making drilling completely impossible .
However , drilling is the normal method used by safe manufacturers when called to open up their safes , so I suspect manufacturers must deliberately leave a gap somewhere .
A popular alternative to drilling  safes is to use explosives .
Gunpowder was used with some success in 19th century America , simply pouring it in through the keyhole .
The shock burst the front plate of the door open , making the bolt mechanism accessible .
There was a simple solution to this form of attack , the powderproof lock .
This was a close fitting tin box round the lock which simply limited the amount of gunpowder that could be poured in .
With only a small amount of gunpowder , the force of the explosion was not great enough to burst open the door .
The introduction of much more powerful high explosives  presented more of a challenge , particularly after the first world war , when many soldiers with first - hand experience of using them returned to civilian life .
It was during the 20s and thirties that safecracking gained its notoriety .
Perhaps the star safecracker of this golden age was a man called Chapman .
He started simply prising the back off an old riveted safe in the Fyffes banana factory , but soon progressed after robbing a welsh quarry of gelignite and detonators .
Gelignite was a commercial high explosive of the same family as nitroglycerine and trinitrotoluene .
It was a plastic explosive ( mouldable ) , with the consistency and smell of oily marzipan .
( All the older high explosives smelt similar , semtex was the first to have no smell ) .
Chapmans technique was ingeniously simple .
He kept to relatively basic safes , ( particularly keen on robbing those in those in Odeon cinemas ) .
He first tied the office typewriter to the boltwork handle .
He then wrapped a tiny amount of Gelignite with a detonator inside a condom , pushed it through the keyhole , and held everything in place with chewing gum .
A few grams was all that was needed , he said his most common mistake was to use too much .
Retreating to a safe distance , the small explosion , pushing everything momentarily outwards , was enough to lift the levers restraining the bolt mechanism .
The weight of the typewriter would then simply turn the mechanism , opening the safe .
Chapman robbed about 40 safes up and down the country through the thirties and was finally caught in Jersey in 39 , just before the outbreak of war .
Jersey was invaded by the Germans before he had been brought back to Britain and he was recruited as an agent , but he told the British authorities of his new role and became a double agent .
After the war he was pardoned , for services to his country , and started a successful health farm ( he eventually bought a castle in Ireland on the proceeds ) .
By the 1950s safe manufacturers had started fitting devices to counter high explosives .
A steel cable running round the inside of the door was connected to the lever that released the boltwork .
Along this cable were several small plates of toughened glass .
Any explosion would shatter the glass , releasing the cable and jamming the lever in the closed position .
All high quality safes have been fitted with anti-explosive devices like this ever since and explosives are no longer a practical method of getting into a safe .
If opening a safe door by drilling or explosives is impractical , perhaps a better technique is to ignore the door and to and break straight through the walls .
When the rounded one - piece steel casing was introduced at the turn of the century , it was virtually impregnable , but many new cutting tools have since been invented .
The latest weapon of the 1920s was the oxyacetylene cutter .
The oxyacetylene flame itself was the hottest flame ever achieved , but the extra jet of oxygen blown through the cutter onto preheated steel caused the steel itself to ignite , enabling plates of any thickness to be effortlessly sliced through .
The hardness of the steel makes no difference to the ease of cutting .
Safe manufacturers increasingly relied on the concrete in between the inner and outer steel skin for security , though it wasnt long before the introduction of a device that could even burn through concrete .
This was the thermic lance , which is simply a long tube filled with steel rods , connected to an oxygen supply .
Once preheated , the steel at the end of the tube can be ignited ( just as in oxyacetylene cutting ) and will gradually burn away , producing extremely high temperatures , enough to melt concrete .
.
On high security safes manufacturers today usually incorporate a layer of cast aluminium .
This conducts heat very well , dissipating the heat of the lance , and slowing down the cutting process .
( A twelve inch thick plate of copper dissipates heat so effectively it is impossible to cut through , but would cost so much the safe would probably be worth more than its contents ) .
Some safe manufacturers incorporate a material that gives off lots of smoke when heated , at least making working conditions uncomfortable
Fortunately for safe manufacturers there is a more serious snag about using thermic lances .
A few years ago , there was a rash of crimes in which thieves removed entire safes to open them at leisure without fear of being disturbed .
The safes were found , abandoned , having been attacked with thermic lances , but the theives had obviously not got away with anything , because the contents were still inside , completely incinerated .
Paper burns at quite a low temperature , 180c or more famously 451f of Ray Bradbury s novel .
( Incidentally , its no use trying to use a thermic lance on a safe door , the steel cable , in addition to its glass plates , also has fusible links , ( low melting point alloys ) so any heat inside the door jams the opening mechanism . )
It probably is a good idea to try and remove the whole safe however you try to break into it , but it is nt easy .
Safes are very heavy , partly for this reason .
With older safes it was possible to put a car jack under the hinges .
With wedges and levers it was then possible to it onto a pallet truck .
Today , the hinges are made with sloping bottoms , so theres no jacking point .
Another useful tool , introduced in the 1950s , is the angle grinder .
Hard particles , embedded in the disk , will cut through any steel , however hard , and also concrete .
Angle grinders can cut through any padlock in seconds .
Safes are more secure , simply because theres more material to cut through , but also because manufacturers have been relatively successful in finding materials that take a long time to cut .
The concrete used in safes is extra hard , made with extra finely ground sand and cement , incorporating fine high tensile steel wires to give it tensile strength and bonded to the concrete by the addition of a wetting agent .
High security safes also include lumps of a mineral called aloxite ( a form of Aluminium oxide ) that is particularly difficult to cut through .
Despite the difficulties , a considerable number of criminal attacks on safes have been successful .
Many of the skills of safebreaking were handed on from one generation to the next ( a sort of informal apprenticeship system ) .
However , there was also a published American Commission report ( from the 1890s ) on the best methods of safe construction , which went into great detail has to how each model of safe could be tackled .
In the twenties the Los Angeles Wayne Strong school of Safework ran courses in safe repairing and opening .
More recently in the 60s , Canadian police found a classroom in a Toronto garage full of safecracking equipment and a home printed textbook , divided into instructional modules .
In the last ten years a brilliant new tool has appeared called the diamond core drill .
This is simply a tube embedded with industrial diamonds , rotated by an ordinary electric drill .
Diamonds , ( the hardest material known ) will cut through anything .
Ive seen perfect cores cut straight through the extra hard concrete , through the aluminium , through the aloxite .
( The highest rated safes are now given some protection against the core drill  lots of angled mild steel plates embedded in the concrete .
The diamonds tend to get clogged by the relatively soft steel . )
This tool did have the potential to create a renaissance in safe breaking , but it somehow never happened , the art of Safe breaking has been in continual decline since the 60s .
A 1997 Home Office report shows that attacks on banks decreased 46 % in 1994 and a further 19 % in 1995 .
Lone criminals , acting on the spur of the moment , are replacing meticulously planned professional  operations , and the craftsman criminal has virtually disappeared .
I suspect the main reason for the disappearance of the craftsman criminal is simply that there are fewer and fewer people with the practical skills and confidence to even try to break into a safe .
Engineering apprenticeships have been decimated , and even the old metalwork shops in schools have gone , replaced by craft , design and technology , which seems to mainly involve making things of cardboard .
Todays criminals tend to favour relatively crude techniques .
If you are really only interested in the loot , its usually easier to bribe or torture someone who knows the safes combination .
To overcome the latest home security system the favoured criminal tool is simply a brick .
Throw the brick through the window , see if anyone comes , and if not , follow it in , either letting the alarm ring ( or pulverising it with the brick ) .
To some extent the most clever and sophisticated safebreaking and lockpicking feats have always been performed by legitimate locksmiths to prove the weaknesses of their rivals products , or , like Richard Feynman , out of intellectual curiosity .
In a similar way almost all the sophisticated computer hacking is done out of intellectual curiosity , or by companies marketing improved security systems , and not by criminals .
Another factor contributing to the decline in safebreaking is that the rewards are relatively modest .
The average haul from bank raids in 1993 for example , was only £ 3,743 , in contrast to the average haul from security vans of £ 378,479 .
The insurance companies give every safe a rating for the value that they are prepared to insure the contents for .
This is surprisingly low - £ 5,000 for an older standard safe , up to £ 50,000 for the most sophisticated modern safe .
To determine a safes rating , the insurance companies have a research laboratory at Boreham Wood ( called the Loss Prevention Council ) .
Members of the council , sitting round a sort of bullring , dressed in safety visors , take notes while watching engineers attempt to break into each safe .
Points are awarded for the number and sophistication of tools employed , and the length of time taken .
It is performed in strict privacy , but would obviously be great entertainment .
I hope that as the criminal incentive and appetite for safe breaking has largely disappeared , it could be revived as a hobby and competitive sport .
The trophies for winning contestants could simply be put in every safe beforehand .
Since putting this lecture up on my site , I 've received a number of interesting comments .
In particular from a retired locksmith called John Mitchell .
His website www.safeman.org.uk contains much more information about safes and their history .
He wrote to me particularly about locksmiths ' techniques for getting into their own safes .
this is his reply :
" Drilling as you rightly say was always the preferred method of opening safes .
Minimal damage was done and an easy repair could be made if necessary .
When quality safes with good drill resistance were encountered it was then normal practice to use oxy - acetylene to access the vital parts .
This practice I believe is now forbidden in business premises .
I 've been away from the tools since I retired in 1990 but occasionally get asked to help open a safe here and there .
If I can't pick the lock ( which I 've only managed twice recently ) I have to call in the experts .
The current methods which the top safemen employ is to use a magnetic limpet drill with specially ground drill bits to penetrate the hard plates .
The same final opening technique as before still applies in exposing the bolt stump of the lock at the point where it enters the gates of the lever pack and manipulating the retaction of the bolt
through the keyhole .
With keyless combination locks the lever fence is likewise exposed and the wheels aligned via the dial .
If glass plates and multiple relockers are encountered , side , and even back drilling would be the practice .
This is where the fibre optic scopes and extended tools come into play .
One safeman even reads the position of the wheels of a KC lock with a scope through the change - key hole in the back plate of the lock after side drilling .
Now that 's clever .
This type of modern safe expert , of whom I only know three , have the ability to pick most of the keylocks likely to be encountered today .
Most make their own picks to suit each different lock and some of these can be as long as 15 inches .
We 've come a long way from the breast - brace and ratchet drill . "
