( CNN ) --
Two men face up to 14 years in jail in a case that human rights activists say is a test case for gay rights , as well as one that could undermine efforts to curtail Malawi 's devastating HIV infection rates .
Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga were arrested in December at their home in Blantyre , Malawi , for professing love and marriage in the traditional way .
Police discovered the couple when local newspapers reported on their engagement ceremony , known as a chinkhoswe .
The two men stand accused of " unnatural offenses " and " indecent practices between males " under sections 153 and 156 of Malawi 's criminal code .
This week , a judge ruled that Monjeza , 26 , and Chimbalanga , 20 , must face a full trial scheduled to begin April 6 .
" This ruling is the most recent in a line of deeply troubling decisions and actions by the Malawian authorities in this case , " said a statement from Chivuli Ukwimi of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 's office in Cape Town , South Africa .
After their arrest , Monjeza and Chimbalanga were denied bail .
In early January , they were subjected to medical examinations intended to find evidence of sodomy , according to Human Rights Watch .
They also underwent psychiatric evaluations .
All the examinations were conducted without the consent of the men , said Human Rights Watch .
The exams violated the rights of the two men protected under Malawi 's constitution , regardless of gender or sexual orientation , said Monica Mbaru , Africa program coordinator for The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission ( IGLHRC ) .
Their lawyers told Human Rights Watch that Monjeza and Chimbalanga are being verbally abused and possibly beaten , and that they are not receiving adequate food and other necessities .
Homosexuality is illegal in Malawi -- as it is in most African nations -- and government officials have said they are simply upholding the law .
But one of the lawyers for the two men , Feliz Tandwe , said that Section 20 of Malawi 's constitution -- adopted in 1994 -- provides equality for all citizens and prohibits discrimination .
Tandwe said that any law that does not conform with the constitution is invalid .
" I 'm very hopeful of the outcome , " he said .
The arrests have sparked international outcry from global rights organizations .
Earlier this year , Human Rights
Watch sent a letter to Malawi's government , accusing it of threatening citizens ' fundamental rights .
" Prosecuting two adults just because they affirm their love is a terrible injustice , " said Dipika Nath , researcher in the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender rights program at Human Rights Watch .
" To subject individuals to spurious medical examinations against their will shows grave disregard for their fundamental human rights , as well as for the public welfare . "
Mbaru said the case has far reaching consequences in a nation -- like so many others in Africa -- struggling to overcome HIV and AIDS while enforcing harsh punishment for at - risk gay men engaging in sodomy .
The AIDS epidemic is responsible for eight deaths every hour in Malawi , according to Avert , a U.K. - based international HIV and AIDS charity .
One million of Malawi's nearly 14 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2007 .
Avert says most HIV infections in Malawi occur through heterosexual sex .
Because gay sex is a crime , there is no available information about the number of infections transmitted through sex between men , though Avert says indications are that the prevalence may be much higher than previously thought .
After years of struggling with HIV and AIDS , Malawi 's government has started to acknowledge the importance of recognizing the rights of gays in addressing the epidemic .
Last year , Mary Shawa , secretary for nutrition , HIV and AIDS in the president 's office , advocated for a human rights approach to the delivery of services for people living with HIV and AIDS .
She said that the fight against HIV could not be won without a change in attitude toward risk groups .
Mbaru , whose organization has visited Monjeza and Chimbalanga in prison five times , said their case is sure to undermine an effective response to the spread of HIV and AIDS .
Recently , an Early Day motion was submitted for debate in the British House of Commons , calling on the president of Malawi to decriminalize homosexuality and release Monjeza and Chimbalanga .
Such motions are usually filed to draw attention to a topic and are rarely discussed , but a similar request was made many years ago to release South African leader Nelson Mandela .
Meanwhile , Monjeza and Chimbalanga appeared in court this week .
They were together , bound to each other -- by handcuffs .
Though she and her mother may not be on the best terms with Hollywood these days , Bristol Palin plans to make her acting debut in the ABC Family series “ The Secret Life of the American Teenager , ” ABC News reported on Tuesday .
On that ABC Family show , about an unwed teenage mother dealing with the consequences of her pregnancy , Ms. Palin will play a fictionalized version of herself , who meets the show ’s lead character at a music program for teenage moms .
Ms. Palin , 19 , a daughter of the Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , revealed that she was pregnant during the 2008 campaign and gave birth to a son , Tripp , on Dec. 27 of that year .
She and her mother recently came into conflict with the Fox network when they criticized its animated show “ Family Guy ” for a joke they believed was about Sarah Palin ’s son Trig , who has Down syndrome .

Tributes flow in for ' master of the fantastic ' found dead at West End home a few days before London fashion week
The British fashion designer Alexander McQueen has been found dead at the age of 40 in his London home .
His body was discovered at the property in Green Street , central London , shortly after 10 am today .
Paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at the scene .
A postmortem has been scheduled but police said his death was not being treated as suspicious .
They would not comment on reports he had killed himself .
A spokeswoman for McQueen said : " Mr McQueen was found dead this morning at his home .
We 're devastated and I hope you understand that out of respect to his family and his colleagues we 're not going to be making any further statement . "
The death comes days before the start of London fashion week and a month before the designer was to unveil his new collection at Paris fashion week .
His family asked for privacy to come to terms with the death of McQueen , whose first name was Lee .
His company , Alexander McQueen , issued a statement saying : " On behalf of Lee McQueen 's family , Alexander McQueen today announces the tragic news that Lee McQueen , the founder and designer of the Alexander McQueen brand , has been found dead at his home .
At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee 's family . "
" Lee 's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this . "
Tributes quickly poured in after news of McQueen 's sudden death .
Alexandra Shulman , the editor of British Vogue , said McQueen had influenced a whole generation of designers .
" His brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs , " she said .
" At one level he was a master of the fantastic , creating astounding fashion shows that mixed design , technology and performance and on another he was a modern - day genius whose gothic aesthetic was adopted by women the world over .
His death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who did n't . "
The designer Katherine Hamnett said : " He was a genius .
What a terrible , tragic waste . "
Dame Vivienne Westwood said she was " incredibly sorry " to hear the news .
Matthew Williamson said : " I am shocked and deeply saddened by McQueen 's death .
He was a genius and his talent was second to none .
Like many others I always cited him as a hugely inspirational leader of world fashion .
He will be greatly missed . "
A spokesman for the model Kate Moss said : " Kate is shocked and devastated at the tragic loss of her dear friend Lee McQueen .
Her thoughts are with his family at this sad time . "
McQueen was praised for raising the profile of British fashion around the world .
" Alexander McQueen made an outstanding contribution to British fashion , " said the culture secretary , Ben Bradshaw .
" His extraordinary talent and creativity mean that his designs are adored not just by followers of haute couture but lovers of great style everywhere .
This is a great loss to one of Britain 's most successful industries and to the design world more widely . "
A spokeswoman for the British fashion council said : " He was a unique talent and one of the world 's greatest designers .
Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time . "
Comments had been posted on McQueen 's Twitter page , McQueenWorld , expressing his distress over the death of his mother on 2 February .
He wrote last week : " i'm letting my followers know the my mother passed away yesterday if it she had not me nor would you RIP mumx "
A minute later he added : " but life must go on ! "
On Sunday McQueen wrote : " sunday evening been a f****** awful week but my friends have been great but now i have to some how pull myself together ... "
Born in London in 1969 as the youngest of six children , McQueen left school at the age of 16 and was offered an apprenticeship at the traditional Savile Row tailors Anderson and Shephard , then at neighbouring Gieves and Hawkes .
At 20 he was employed by the designer Koji Tatsuno .
A year later McQueen travelled to Milan where he worked as a design assistant to Romeo Gigli .
He returned to London in 1994 where he completed a master 's degree in fashion design at Central St Martins College .
His degree collection was famously bought in its entirety by Isabella Blow , a leading figure in the fashion world who died in 2007 .
In less than 10 years McQueen became one of the most respected fashion designers in the world .
In October 1996 he was appointed chief designer at the French label Givenchy where he worked until March 2001 .
In December 2000 , 51 % of Alexander McQueen was acquired by luxury brand Gucci , where he became creative director .
Expansion followed and included the opening of flagship stores in New York , London and Milan .
McQueen was a four - time winner of the British designer of the year award as well as the international designer of the year award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America .
He was awarded the CBE in 2003 .
Your airline seat may not have much padding , but the airline 's schedule sure does .
Delta Air Lines
Flight 715 from New York to Los Angeles now takes more than seven hours to fly across the country , according to the airline 's March schedule .
That 's an hour longer than the same flight in the same type of aircraft took in 1996 .
A Phoenix - Las Vegas flight at Southwest Airlines that used to be scheduled at 60 minutes now gets 80 minutes .
What was once a two - hour American Airlines trip from Chicago to Newark , N.J. , now is two - and - a - half hours , according to the airline 's schedule .
Across the airline industry , carriers have been adding minutes to " block times " — the scheduled durations — baking delays into trips so that late flights officially arrive " on- time " and operations run better because flights pull into gates more often on schedule .
Even though the recession has led airlines to cut flights and reduce congestion at many airports and in the skies , the move to pump up schedules has continued :
Last year , most airlines added padding to scores of flights .
For some airlines , longer scheduled times for flights reflects the reality of inefficiency in the nation 's air travel system , which often can't handle the volume of planes without delay , especially when bad weather hits .
For others , lengthening scheduled arrival times boosts on - time rankings charted by the Department of Transportation :
Those numbers can have a real effect on public perception .
And in some cases , block times have grown simply because airlines have been making so many schedule changes as they have reduced capacity over the past two years .
Flights that took off without a wait can now end up stuck waiting behind a line of jets because departure times have been changed .
For travelers , it can seem like airlines are cheating .
" If you leave late , you know you will arrive late .
But now you leave late and arrive early , " said frequent traveler Steve Edmonds , who works for the city of Austin , Texas .
Because of a belief that academia skews too far to the left , the Texas Board of Education voted 10 to 5 in favor of buying history and social studies textbooks that adhere to a more conservative ideology .
Here are some of the changes they are mandating :
Inserting paragraph clarifying that the poor guy Rosa Parks would n't give up her seat for was on crutches and really needed to give his dogs a rest ; also , he later died
More focus on civic issues , particularly the separation of church and infidel
Discussion of the debate between liberal and conservative geologists about what constitutes an " igneous " rock
Tamping down traditional pro-Stalin stance

Palestinian militant group Hamas has demanded the European Union work to prevent Israeli security services from using EU passports to carry out " targeted assassination " attempts after the killing of one of its leading members in Dubai .
Mohammed al - Mabhouh , who was attached to the al - Qassam Brigades , the group 's military wing , and , according to Israeli sources , was the lead gun-runner from Iran to Gaza , died in mysterious circumstances in Dubai on 20 January .
On Sunday , however , the Dubai police investigating his death revealed that Mr al - Mabhouh had been poisoned by seven individuals travelling on European passports .
Hamas has accused EU states of willingly supplying Israel with the identity documents to aid them in foreign operations .
The Palestinian Islamic group blames the Mossad , Israel 's national intelligence service , and the Dubai police have also suggested the spy agency is responsible .
" We have no doubts that the Mossad is behind the assassination .
Israel is the only enemy of our people in the world , " Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad told EUobserver .
" The Mossad will use any means to achieve their goals , often using European passports to enter Arabic countries . "
" It could be Mossad , or another party , " police chief Dhahi Khalfan told Agence France Presse .
" Personally , I do n't exclude any possibility .
I do n't exclude any party that has an interest in the assassination . "
Israeli officials speaking to this website neither confirmed nor denied their country 's responsibility for the killing .
But some government ministers have spoken out in favour of it .
" Meir Dagan is one of the best Mossad chiefs ever .
It 's well know that anyone raising his hand against Jews does so at his own risk , " said science minister Daniel Hershkowitz on Sunday in response to the events in Dubai , according to a report in Haaretz , the Israeli centre - left newspaper .
" Israel needs , on the one hand , to act according to the rule of killing first one who comes to kill you , " said minority affairs minister Avishay Braverman .
" And on the other hand , courageously strive for peace using the two states for two peoples solution . "
On Sunday , Hamas leaders , including Osama Hamdan , the group 's external relations chief , and Abu Obeida , spokesman for the al - Qassam Brigades , said they were contemplating the launching of attacks on European soil , which they have not engaged in until now , accusing Israel of " breaking the rules of the game " by targetting the organisation beyond the Israel / Palestine borders .
However , following high - level discussions , the group , according to Mr Hamad , has pulled back from such language .
" It 's not easy for Hamas to keep silent , but because its very complicated development , Hamas will discuss this very carefully .
We have never thought to move the struggle with Israel outside Palestine .
" But what happened is very dangerous .
It means that Israel could do this again in any country , so Israel must pay the price of its crime . "
" At the same time , we are not interested to make Europe a playground of conflict between us and Israel .
The EU must take crucial actions to stop using Israel to its passports to kill people . "
An Israeli diplomat told this website that he had no idea whether any EU state supplied his country 's secret services with such documentation .
Dubai police are not saying which European nations the passports come from .
They are are working in partnership with Interpol on the incident and with those European member states involved , but will not say which countries they are .
Editor 's note :
As part of our ongoing Rainbow Planet series chronicling the global fight for gay rights , correspondents look at eastern European countries whose traditional values clash with those of their western European partners .
Below , David L. Stern examines a new Lithuanian law that could stigmatize gays and lesbians — or worse .
In neighboring Poland , Jan Cienski reports that a decision by the European Court of Human Rights has angered conservatives .
VILNIUS , Lithuania —
It may not be on the level of Uganda ’s draconian anti-gay legislation , which applies the death penalty to some homosexual relations , but Lithuania this month enacted a law that observers are calling worryingly homophobic .
The “ Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information ” came into force on March 1 and restricts any public dissemination of information which affects the “ mental health , physical , intellectual or moral development ” of children under 18 .
The legislation , in a word , is expansive .
Among the myriad of topics deemed unfit for minors are :
“ which promotes bad eating and hygiene habits and lack of physical exercise ”
" which displays a mass hypnosis session aimed at affecting the mass media audience ”
" which promotes property damage or destruction ”
“ which is of an erotic nature ”
“ which promotes sexual intercourse ”
“ which arouses fear or horror ”
“ which encourages gambling , encourages and suggests participation in the games of chance , lotteries and other games that imply easy win ”
But the paragraph that has attracted the most controversy is one that prohibits information “ which scorns family values and promotes the concept of marriage and family formation , other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania . ”
The law prohibits , in other words , any portrayal of marriage as something other than the union of a man and a woman .
The reaction to the legislation has been swift and unequivocal .
Lithuania became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed on to EU codes for human rights , including those that forbid discrimination because of sexual orientation .
Amnesty International , in a published statement , called the law “ an anachronism . ”
“ It will stigmatize gay and lesbian people and exposes advocates for their rights to the risk of censorship and financial penalties , ” said John Dalhuisen of the human rights organization .
The legislation ’s supporters say that the bill is needed to combat society ’s slow deterioration .
“ This law is necessary because we see a collapse of values that are necessary for any sort of family life , ” said Mantas Adomenas , a representative for Vilnius ’s old town from the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats , parliament ’s largest party .
Adomenas said that the law will not restrict the rights of lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgenders ( LGBT ) — just prevent them from depicting same - sex marriage in a positive light in places where children might have access .
This includes schools , public spaces , the internet and in the media , for instance on television before 10 p.m .
The law does not restrict pro-gay demonstrations , Adomenas maintained .
“ But once [ the demonstration ] is on TV , it ’s a question on how it is to be portrayed , ” he added .
He gave the example of Erling Lae , Oslo ’s openly gay mayor , who brought his spouse to a international mayoral conference in Vilnius last year .
“ He ca n’t go on national television before 10 o’clock and [ promote same sex marriage ] , ” Adomenas said .
“ If it ’s in a news report — sure .
But he ca n’t put an ad on saying we Norwegians are so great because we have this type of marriage . ”
The law , he continued , does not contradict European legal stipulations .
“ We have different notions of family , ” he said .
At the same time , it prevents Lithuanian youth from receiving “ wrong guidance . ”
“ They grow up and then find out that they actually can’t marry like that , ” Adomenas said .
Deputies in fact softened the law from an earlier version last year , which outlawed all materials “ agitating for homosexual , bisexual and polygamous relations . ”
Members of the European Parliament ’s intergroup on lesbian and gay rights wrote an open letter to the Lithuanian parliament , saying the legislation violated fundamental principles .
Nevertheless , the law ’s new version causes concern .
“ The form of the law has changed significantly , ” said Bruno Selun , the intergroup ’s secretary .
“ However its substance is essentially homophobic because it refers to a traditional concept of family , and restricts and excludes all LGBT families . ”
The issue , observers say , is how strictly the law is interpreted .
The first test may come with a “ Baltic Pride ” festival , a two - day LGBT event planned for May , which will feature a conference , art exhibit and gay pride march .
According to Vladimir Simonko and Eduardas Platovas , leaders of the Lithuanian Gay League , the country remains a traditional society where the Catholic Church plays a leading role .
The law , they fear , will deepen a general atmosphere where gays and lesbians do not feel comfortable , and the news media will fear reporting on LGBT issues .
“ We feel the difference between Brussels and Amsterdam , and here ” said Simonko .
“ There is this aggression on the streets — we always have to control ourselves . ”
“ If I see a couple of guys who might be aggressive , I cross to the other side , ” he added .
But others see the legislation as a hiccup in a general progression from a Soviet society , with its inherent restrictions and prejudices , to an open , tolerant Western nation .
“ We have a brand new generation here — there is a huge generation gap .
There is the liberal youth , and then there ’s an older generation raised in the Soviet past , who have n’t come entirely out of their stereotypes , and some are very bitter , ” said Kestutis Sadauskas , head of the EU representation in Vilnius .
Nevertheless , the EU official said his commission would observe very closely how the law would be applied .
“ The protection of minorities is a sign of strength and maturity of a democracy — this is the litmus test . ”
Here ’s just a quick summary of notes from the discussions I was in yesterday at the GNOME London UX Hackfest :
OSD & Panel Icons
Yesterday jimmac and hbons worked on Moblin icons , with the idea we could use the style for GNOME OSD ( on - screen display , e.g. , when you change your system volume , the big speaker icon pops up ) and possibly the panel / applet icons .
Why use the moblin style ?
It ’s much quicker to put together than the high - res icons ( it can take 15 hours straight to do one of these ) ; the Moblin style requires much simpler artwork .
The style , because of its simplicity , could potentially be good high - contrast / accessible icons as well .
How do you get the Moblin icons ?
git clone git://git.moblin.org/moblin-icon-theme
Challenges
We ’d like complete coverage but wo n’t have it immediately .
We should have a fallback – the Ubuntu folks suggested using a suffix for naming / calling icons from apps .
E.g , if an application that wants to use this style they need to explicitly ask for it , if it does n’t exist it falls back to the normal icon .
( I ’m not 100 % sure how accurate my notes are here . )
One issue with the style is that it does n’t work for every background color .
There are a couple of potential solutions here :
Add an extra stroke of the shape in an inverse color around the outside of the icon , similar to how Tango icons have two outlines , one light one dark .
Pick the colors from the gtk theme .
One other challenge is they do n’t work at smaller sizes right now ; we potentially have to adapt them for smaller sizes .
Since screens are getting more dense these days , we could consider doing 22 × 22 or 24 ×24 as the small size ?
There is a single Inkscape SVG with all the icons , and a script renders the individual icons .
It takes 20 minutes though ; it ’s inefficient .
To do
What work needs to be done to make this happen for GNOME ?
Icon recoloring – make it possible to recolor the icons to work on any background .
Can we implement them so they pick the color from the GTK theme settings ?
We need additional icons for GNOME
Shell that are not in the current Moblin set : battery , network , status are some examples .
We need to see if the Moblin icon theme license will be an issue for GNOME usage .
Moblin is Creative Commons Share - Alike 3.0 => is it compatible with GPL ?
Will this cause any issues ?
Consideration : in the indication of extremes – if volume is all the way up or all the way down – color it so it is visually different ?
How to get involved
The mailing list gnome - themes - list might be the place to continue the conversation .
Nautilus discussion
John from Canonical showed us some mockups he had done to try to simplify Nautilus .
We discussed them a bit .
Here are some random notes from the discussion :
remove combo box to change nautilus view , just use menu ?
frustration that nautilus is becoming like midnight commander , not beautiful to use , too complicated
dont like split pane idea , why not use two windows ?
split - pane seems universally disliked by GNOME designers .
snap to side - by - side like in windows 7 would be good and would remove need for split - pane .
search in nautilus sucks
confusion between magnifying glass icon for search vs zoom
Things to consider removing from ui : zoom controls tabs
Things to add to ui undo search folders sharing / collaboration – share with context - sensitive actions toolbar
Improving GNOME Designer Collaboration
Two main features that would make life easier :
Easier syncing of files
Version control
Garrett and jimmac use Dropbox for this today , but it is not open source and is capped at 2 GB .
Canonical Use Case Mapper
John showed us Canonical ’s Use Case Mapper , which will hopefully be open - sourced at some point so GNOME designers can use it .
It interfaces with Google docs at the moment .
The template it uses in Google docs is public .
Special bonus tips that happen when us designers are in the same room
Both of these gems are from Garrett :
I kept trying to take pictures with my digital camera when my memory card was not in it .
Garrett ’s tip : leave your memory card door open when it ’s out so when you pick up your camera you know right away the card ’s not in it .
In Gimp , filters > edge - detect > difference of gaussians , radius 1 : 30 , radius 2 : 2 – results automagical cleanup of whiteboard photos ( like the one in my post before this )
Hope these notes are useful for you .
FEBRUARY 9--Felony snowball throwing charges have been leveled against two Virginia college students for allegedly pelting a city plow and an undercover police car during Saturday 's blizzard .
Charles Gill and Ryan Knight , both 21 , were nabbed by cops in Harrisonburg , where they attend James Madison University .
According to police , the pair first targeted a city plow last Saturday afternoon .
The driver responded by calling cops to report the frosty fusillade .
When police responded to the scene in a bid to identify the assailants , their unmarked vehicle also came under an icy assault .
Gill and Knight , a guard on JMU 's basketball team , were then apprehended and booked into jail for throwing missiles at occupied vehicles , a felony .
Gill ( top ) and Knight are pictured below in Rockingham County Sheriff 's Office mug shots .
If convicted of the felonious snowball tossing , the men each face between one and five years in prison , and a maximum $ 2,500 fine .

Amazon has pulled the plug on its affiliate program in Colorado thanks to a new state regulation on sales tax collection .
The company sent a notice to its Colorado - based affiliates Monday morning to let them know about the decision , urging residents who depend on the affiliate program to contact their lawmakers if they want the program back .
Most states only require retailers to collect sales tax if they have a sufficient enough brick - and - mortar presence thanks to a 1992 Supreme Court decision on Quill Corp. v. North Dakota .
Despite this , a handful of states have tried to pass laws in recent years ( often dubbed the " Amazon Tax " ) that would force Amazon to start collecting sales tax if their affiliates — that is , those who use Amazon 's affiliate links on their own sites or blogs in order to earn a return on referrals — are based in those states .
The Colorado law in question is HB 10 - 1193 , which targets sales made by affiliates through out - of - state retailers such as Amazon .
Because the affiliate lives in Colorado and is " targeting " other Colorado residents ( in sort of a roundabout way via the Internet , since the Internet really targets everyone in the world ) , state legislators feel that Amazon should collect and pay Colorado sales taxes .
According to Amazon 's e-mail to affiliates posted by Global Geek News , " [t ] he new regulations do not require online retailers to collect sales tax .
Instead , they are clearly intended to increase the compliance burden to a point where online retailers will be induced to ' voluntarily ' collect Colorado sales tax — a course we wo n't take . "
As for current payments , everything earned before March 8 will be paid out by the end of the month , but Amazon wo n't pay for any further referrals after today .
Amazon says that it will still sell its products to customers in Colorado and advertise through other channels , including through its affiliates in other states .
Ouch .
Colorado is n't the first state to try and get taxes out of Amazon through its affiliate program .
New York first started the trend by passing a very similar law in 2008 , which caused Amazon to file a lawsuit .
The retailer argued that it does not own or lease any space in the state of New York and has no representatives soliciting business there .
Similarly , as noted by NPR , Rhode Island and North Carolina have also passed laws along these lines — Amazon responded to those by simply cutting off its affiliate programs in those states like it did with Colorado .
( Presumably , Amazon has not cut off affiliates in New York yet because the market is too big to give up . )
Amazon 's letter makes it clear that the company believes HB 10 - 1193 is neither " constitutionally - permissible " nor evenhanded .
Indeed , with the Supreme Court ruling in place , it looks as if these states are just trying to find workarounds , especially since they are obviously hurting for tax revenue .
Amazon urges its ( former ) Colorado associates to contact the General Assembly and Colorado Governor Ritter over the issue .
Seeing the world , or just a city next door can lead to all sorts of fun and adventure .
Whether you are a seasoned pro or a novice traveler , the following tips are a collaboration of helpful information to make your next journey much safer , easier and a whole lot more fun .
If you are traveling to another country brush up on that country ’s laws .
Some foreign countries have laws that you might view as a little strange or not expect .
As a precaution , it is always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the laws specific to the place you are visiting .
If you are traveling to an area that has a liquid - restriction on all liquids you might be packing , invest in bar shampoos and tooth powder .
Believe it or not , you can actually find bar shampoo and toothpaste available in powder form online .
These items are a great way to get around liquid - restrictions .

Choosing a seat on the aisle will open more options for you .
Other than providing a view , the window seat has few benefits whereas an aisle seat will enable you unrestricted access to your overhead baggage , the restrooms , airplane staff and will also give you one side that is not bulging with another person or their belongings .
If you are traveling into a malaria - prone area , in addition to anti-malaria pills , bring a mosquito net or find a room with a large ventilation fan .
The net is best as it can almost completely stop mosquitoes from getting to you at night .
The fan works because mosquitoes cannot fly as well into the wind , but it is not fool - proof .
Before you arrive at your travel destination , search the internet to find a blogger who posts about what ’s happening in this city .
Take the time to email the blogger and ask for his or her recommendations about where you should go .
This is a great way to get the inside scoop on your vacation spot .

Look for “ nonstop ” rather than just “ direct ” flights .
Nonstop flights , as their name implies , make no stops before arriving at the destination , whereas direct flights may stop at other airports on the way to the final destination .
Although you are not changing planes , the stops you make on a direct flight can lead to many unexpected delays .
When traveling by air , make sure you research your airline thoroughly .
A cheap ticket can lead to a lousy flight experience .
Many people fly to Egypt for tourism , You need Egypt Tourist Visa if you are interested in traveling there .
Tall individuals can find themselves subject to extremely uncomfortable conditions if the airline provides little leg room .
So , research your airline ahead of time , and learn about all the ticket and service options they provide .
Traveling is a memorable experience but not one you want to recall by bringing bedbugs home in your luggage .
Not even four - star hotels are exempt from the presence of these invasive insects , so give your room a thorough investigation before bringing your luggage into it .
Search the entire room for signs of the bugs , their fecal matter , and tiny rust - colored stains .
If a bedbug infestation appears likely , it is wise to move to another hotel .
If possible travel during off - peak hours .
The price of flights changes depending on the hour , the day and the month of travel .
You can save a lot of money by booking flights during off - peak hours .
For example , flights on Thursdays are usually cheaper than those of Fridays .
This is because the demand for seats is lower on a Thursday as people who work away from home during the week normally want to fly home on a Friday .
Whether traveling to see a family member or as part of an adventurous expedition , everyone needs some planning and preparation for their trip .
Hopefully , you learned something from reading this article that will help you on your next vacation and maybe something you can pass along to a friend .
The well - prepared traveler is one who does his or her research .
Great bargains , faster trips , and hassle - free travel are all waiting for you .

Mekki sez , " The city of Ottawa has launched a security campaign funded by Transport Canada ( federally ) that asks people to report any ' suspicious behaviour ' , which includes photographers and sketchers .
They explicitly list ' An individual taking photos or pictures [… ] , drawing maps or sketches ' as things to report .
My friend Sarah Gelbard teaches in the Architecture department at Carleton University in Ottawa .
She had her students do a project on transit in the city last year .
They all went to transit stations and took reference pictures to help plan out their projects .
Security stopped and questioned several of them .
And this was before this new campaign .
I 'm afraid what might happen now if people started calling in the " suspicious behaviour " of students taking photos of a transit station . "
Good to see the Anglo - American stupid creeping up to Canada .
I suppose if terrorists were precision bombers who had to place their charges to the millimetre in order to succeed , this would make sense , but given that no one 's ever shown that terrorists attacks involve carefully photographing the attack - site ( as opposed to simply walking up to it , finding a likely spot , and blowing up ) , this is simply a good way of absorbing police / security time that could be spent chasing actual bad guys .
Canadian transit photographers are trembling in their boots , I 'm sure .
Too bad they do n't actually pose any risk to the Canadian transit system .
Otherwise , Ottawa 'd really be onto something .

Alexander Haig , a former US secretary of state and senior aide to President Nixon during the Watergate scandal , died ­yesterday in a Baltimore hospital at the age of 85 .
Haig was an ambitious former four - star general , who had served in the Korean war .
He entered politics and became one of the most powerful and committed " cold war warriors " of the 1970s and 80s .
Despite Richard Nixon welcoming his appointment as Ronald Reagan 's secretary of state by calling him " the meanest , toughest , most ambitious SOB I ever knew " , Haig led failed US diplomatic efforts to negotiate between the UK and Argentina before the Falklands conflict in the so - called " peace - shuttle " talks .
He also ran for president in 1988 , seeking the nomination of the Republican party in the wake of ­Reagan 's two terms .
But his effort garnered little popular support , and the prize went to George Bush Sr , ­Reagan 's vice - president .
Haig was a ruthless man who never lost his military demeanour .
He believed in the muscular ­projection of American power abroad , and a ­commitment to conservative politics at home .
His most high - profile job was as Nixon 's chief of staff , where he succeeded Bob Haldeman , who had resigned in April 1973 under pressure from the Watergate prosecutors .
During those tumultuous years , with Nixon clinging to power , Haig 's influence grew as other senior leaders , and the president , became distracted .
In the end he played a vital role in persuading Nixon to resign – even though earlier he had controversially tried to suppress moves to force the president from office .
At one stage Haig was responsible for ordering the removal of Nixon 's tranquillisers , and denying his requests for pills , after the president had mentioned suicide .
During that period
Haig was probably at his most powerful , but his fate was to see Gerald Ford , the vice - president , take over .
Under Reagan , he became secretary of state .
After Reagan was shot during an assassination attempt in 1981 , an incident unfolded that revealed the extent of his ambition , and damaged his reputation .
As the president lay stricken in hospital , Haig effectively declared himself the acting president to members of the cabinet – despite not being next - in - line .
He then appeared on television , telling a concerned nation : " I am in control here , in the White House . "
Haig 's actions left a sour taste in the mouth for many colleagues and the public , something he later came to understand .
One of his biographers once said that Haig knew the third paragraph of his obituary would mention the incident .
He was wrong .
But only just .
In the New York Times online obituary yesterday , it was in the second paragraph .
It looked like the Lakers never hopped on a charter bus and headed 90 miles northeast .
Strangely , they seemed to be stranded in Oakland , finding themselves in another up - tempo game against another rookie guard who might be the best of the first - year players .
Tyreke Evans was the one harassing the Lakers on Tuesday , not Stephen Curry , pushing the visitors to another problem area in another road game against another well - below - .500 team .
This time , the Lakers did n’t wait for the last minute to exhale , beating back the Sacramento Kings after a ragged first half , 106 - 99 , at Arco Arena .
Kobe Bryant had 30 points , nine rebounds and seven assists , settling down after a shot - happy start .
Andrew Bynum continued to roll , collecting 21 points and  12 rebounds , and Pau Gasol had 28 points and 12 rebounds .
If Bryant had one more rebound , the Lakers would have had three players with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for the first time since a fairly capable trio did it against Phoenix in December 1984 ( Magic Johnson , Kareem Abdul - Jabbar and James Worthy ) .
“ We ’re playing with the right energy to win games , ” Bryant said .
“ That ’s kind of what I wanted to see , just start playing with a heightened sense of things .
Guys understand that we can be beat .
Once you understand that ... guys become a little bit more focused . ”
Gasol had 17 points on seven - for - eight shooting in the second half .
He then pointed to a speech by Derek Fisher at halftime of a listless game against Toronto eight days ago .
The Lakers won that one , barely , and have n’t lost since Fisher lit into the team .
“ When a veteran like Fisher speaks , you listen , ” said Gasol .
The Lakers ( 50 - 18 ) suddenly are n’t such a road liability , winning three consecutive away from Staples Center after losing four in a row on the road .
And they have a new motto : win 60 games this season .
They have two eminently winnable home games ( Minnesota and Washington are a combined 35 - 99 ) before hitting the road for their last long trip of the regular season , a five - gamer that could be an early indicator of things to come when the games really count : San Antonio , Oklahoma City , Houston , New Orleans and Atlanta .
The trip will “ tell us whether we ’re going to reach that 60 - win mark or not , ” Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said .
The Lakers have won eight of their last nine against the Kings ( 23 - 45 ) , though the first two this season were anything but easy , the Lakers needing double overtime to win in December and Bryant ’s three - pointer at the buzzer to win in January .
A night after Curry blistered them for 29 points and nine assists , Evans had 25 points , 11 rebounds and nine assists but cooled after a frenetic first half and made only seven of 19 shots .
The first half Tuesday was fast and furious , the Lakers taking a 13 - point lead on the strength of several Bynum dunks .
But then the reserves could n’t hold the lead and the Lakers barely led , 49 - 48 , even though Bynum was close to a double - double after two quarters ( 17 points , nine rebounds ) .
Bynum had four dunks and a layup in the first quarter and showed versatility later , making a 13 - footer .
A quick recap of his last few games : 19 points and 14 rebounds against Golden State , 18 points and nine rebounds against Phoenix , 22 points and six rebounds against Toronto .
Not a bad week ’s worth of work for the 22 - year - old .
“ I think we ’ve found a better idea what and how to use ‘ Drew inside , ” Jackson said .
“ He ’s got a resurgence after he hurt his hip .
He had a bad knee bruise .
He had a couple things physically that kept him from having the power that he likes to have in the post .
Tonight was an exhibition by him and Pau that showed the strength of our team . ”

Designer Josselin Zaïgouche , who created the Zero Phone we ’ve shown you half an year ago has now sent us an incredible design , the Apple Black Hole concept , possibly the iPhone of the year 2020 .
“ What ’s going to happen in 10 years ” asks the designer and the answer should look something like this ( click on images to enlarge ) :
As you can see , the Apple Black Hole comprises 4 components : the charging base , the Prism , the Black Hole and the giftbox .
Things get interesting when you try to use the handset … its central ball will levitate when you open your hand and all functions will be controlled in mid-air , with the aid of holographic technology .
How cool is that ?
The Black Hole concept phone can be connected to the charging base and used as a desktop device , still projecting the needed interface .
Brilliant ?
Yes !
Viable ?
Maybe…

A strike by British Airways cabin crew will go ahead after talks between the airline and the Unite union collapsed .
The three - day walkout begins at midnight , with a further four days of action set to commence on 27 March .
BA chief Willie Walsh said the strike was " deeply regrettable " .
The airline has said 65 % of passengers will reach their destination during the action .
Unite 's joint general secretary , Tony Woodley , said that BA " ultimately wants to go to war with this union " .
BA said there could also be disruption to flights between the two strikes .
Separately , railway signal workers have voted in favour of strikes in a row over jobs and safety .
' Serve passengers ' A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " The Prime Minister believes that this strike is in no - one 's interest and will cause unacceptable inconvenience to passengers .
" He urges the strike be called off immediately .
He also urges BA 's management and workforce to get together without delay to resolve what is a dispute about jobs and wages . "
A total of 1,100 BA flights out of the 1,950 scheduled to operate during the first three - day strike will be cancelled .
Please turn on JavaScript .

At Gatwick , all long - haul flights and more than half of short - haul flights are expected to operate as normal .
At Heathrow , more than 60 % of long - haul flights will operate , though only 30 % of short - haul flights are expected to do so , with the help of aircraft leased from eight rival airlines .
" Tens of thousands of BA people stand ready to serve our passengers and BA will be flying and will continue to fly through these periods of industrial action , " Mr Walsh said .
He added he remained available for talks on reaching a " sensible " agreement , but said that loss - making BA must cut costs .
An offer which the carrier had put to the union , but which had not been accepted , would be " formally withdrawn once industrial action commences " , Mr Walsh said .
Earlier , BA said that any staff who took part in strike action would lose perks , including heavily discounted travel fares .
Pay demand
The airline and the union held talks late into the night on Thursday and resumed discussions on Friday .
Mr Woodley had called on BA to put an earlier deal to end the strikes " back on the table " - a move he said would allow him to call off the strike while union members considered it .
BA is now run by accountants
BA cabin crew member
BA employee speaks out Your stories of BA strike
That settlement offer had included commitments on working hours and annual pay rises in exchange for the cabin crew workers agreeing to BA 's planned £ 62.5 m of cost cuts .
But after announcing that the strike would go ahead , Mr Woodley said the airline " did not want to negotiate " .
" I am extremely disappointed for the travelling public and our members , but this union will now support our members , while remaining open for talks with the company , " he said .
" It is an absolute disgrace and an insult to our people that [ Mr Walsh ] tabled a deal that reduced the amount of pay on offer .
" It is ridiculous to expect anyone to go to their membership with a worse offer . "
Mr Walsh said suggestions that he wanted to break the union were " absolute nonsense " .
" We have spent 13 months in negotiations .
BA has been at the table , ready , willing and able to negotiate .
If people want a scapegoat , they will have to look somewhere else . "

This is the highest level since last November .
Hilda Brucker was sitting at home one day working her job as a freelance writer .
The phone rang , she answered , and was told by a hostile voice that if she did n’t come down to the courthouse at once she would be given a failure to appear violation .
She hastily complied .
When she got there , she found out that the city had issued a citation , although it had never told her about it .
She later learned the citation stated she was charged with ( 1 ) “ Rotted wood on house and chipping paint on fascia boards ” ; ( 2 ) “ High weeds in backyard and ivy on tree and vines on house ” ; and ( 3 ) “ Driveway in a state of disrepair . ”
Not knowing what to do , Hilda pled guilty to the driveway charge , while the other two were dismissed .
She paid a fine of $ 100 and was sentenced to six months probation , where she had to report to a probation officer , avoid alcoholic intoxication , and cooperate “ with code enforcement upon request . ”
She later hired an attorney who filed a motion to vacate her sentence , but the motion was continued several times , eventually being granted only after her six - month probation would have already ended .
She also obtained a home equity line of credit in case she needed to pay for any of the fixes that the city nebulously demanded .
On Wednesday , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Congress that the Federal Reserve does not plan to “ print money ” to help Congress finance the exploding U.S. national debt .
In fact , Bernanke told Congress that the U.S. could soon face a debt crisis as bad as the one in Greece if the U.S. government does not get things in order financially .
This represents a fundamental change in policy for the Federal Reserve , because they have been enabling the massive borrowing by the U.S. government over the past couple of years by “ buying ” the majority of new U.S. government debt that has been issued .
But now the fat cats over at the Federal Reserve have apparently changed their minds .
Using uncharacteristic bluntness , Bernanke told Congress that the Federal Reserve is “ not going to monetize the debt ” .
So why is the Federal Reserve changing course ?
Well , there are a couple of possibilities .
One is that the Federal Reserve could legitimately be concerned that the exploding U.S. debt could actually collapse the U.S. economy and ultimately the U.S. government .
You see , the Federal Reserve is a parasite .
They make money for their owners by sucking money out of the U.S. government and out of U.S. taxpayers .
So , just like any parasite , they must strike a delicate balance .
They have to keep feeding off the host without killing off the host completely .
If the host dies it could end up killing the parasite .
So the Federal Reserve actually needs to try to keep the U.S. economy alive so that it can slowly keep draining it .
In fact , during his remarks to Congress , it certainly sounded like Bernanke honestly desires that the U.S. government will come up with a sustainable financial plan for the future ….
“ It is very , very important for Congress and administration to come to some kind of program , some kind of plan that will credibly show how the United States government is going to bring itself back to a sustainable position . ”
The second possibility is a bit more insidious .
As we have written previously , it looks like “ the financial powers that be ” have decided to reduce the money supply , tighten credit and hoard cash .
All of those things reduce economic activity .
This new public stance by Bernanke is right in line with that .
If the Federal Reserve will not finance the exploding U.S. government debt , then either the U.S. government will have to dramatically cut back on spending ( which would seriously slow down the U.S. economy ) or the U.S. government will have to borrow from other sources at much higher interest rates ( which will have very serious negative effects on the U.S.. economy ) .
Either way , this new stance by the Federal Reserve is not good news for those hoping for U.S. economic growth .
The truth is that someday the exponential growth of the U.S. national debt will basically force the Federal Reserve to “ print money ” , but for now it looks like the financial powers have another agenda .
From all indications , it look like that agenda is seriously going to slow down the U.S. economy .
That is likely to seriously anger American voters .
Already , millions of Americans have lost their homes and their jobs , and things are probably only going to get worse .
The result is that there is likely to be an overwhelmingly strong anti-incumbent mood in the nation as we approach the election season of 2010 .
Even now , only 10 % of American voters say that Congress is doing a good or excellent job .
That is not good news for the fat cats in Washington .
Not that we should feel sorry for them when they get voted out .

URL shortening services are ubiquitous on Twitter and other cramped online spaces .
They wo n't all last , as tr.im has demonstrated , and their shutdowns could annihilate your linking history .
If you own a domain , though , you can host your own service .

Even if you consider the links you 've shortened for Facebook , Twitter , IMs and other services to be just of - the - moment , nothing - serious items that are n't worth backing up , leaving a host of dead links lingering around the net is n't good for anybody , or anybody 's searches .
There 's not a lot you can do about your already - posted social network links , but anyone who 's got $ 10 for a domain name registration , and a creative short URL idea , can host , monitor , and control their shortened links .

We 're going to run through a basic installation of Yourls , a server - based webapp that can run pretty much anywhere a WordPress installation can .
There are lots of other options , which we 'll get to as well , but Yourls is a fairly smart and fast way to get up and running with your own URL shortener .
What you 'll need
Hosted or DIY server space :
That space must be running at least PHP 4.3 , MySQL 4.1 , and with " mod_rewrite " enabled .
In plain English , that 's most any mainstream web server an individual pays about $ 5 / month to for basic hosting .
For DIY server types , any installation of LAMP WAMP MAMP setting up and hosting a blog on your computer

For DIY server types , any installation of A domain name :
You 'll preferably want something short , which can be difficult in the super - saturated .com/.biz /.net market .
You might get inspired and lucky , but you also might need to pay just a bit more for an international top - level domain ( TLD ) — the part after the period , like .tv , .nl , and the like — which can cost between $ 15 - $ 90 .
The URL used in the screenshots up top is an example , albeit not really feasible , unless I figure out how to buy a straight - up Nicaraguan TLD .

Setting up
Advertisement
First up , go and download the latest Yourls package , then un-zip it somewhere you can get to it .
After that , determine how you can access your server 's databases — can you create new , separate databases yourself , or do you only get access to a single spot ?
I use 1&1 to host my personal web site , so in my case , that involves heading to my " control panel " at admin.1and1.com , logging in , clicking on " MySQL Administration , " then clicking the " New Database " button and naming it " yourls . "
Your mileage will vary from host to host , but it 's likely you can Google around and figure out how to create a new database , or access the one you 're given .
Copy all those strings of characters for the database 's name , host name , user , and password , then head back to where you stashed your Yourls download .
Advertisement
Inside the folder you extracted from the Yourls archive package , head inside the " includes " folder and look for config - sample .
php .
Open it inside a text editor , and , near the top , you 'll find a series of lines asking you to fill in a username , database name , password , host name — all the stuff you grabbed from your host .
Replace the default answers for those four settings inside the single quotes on the right , as shown in the picture here .

Farther down the file , under " Site options , " look for a line asking for a " Short domain URL . "
If you 've got your own domain name , simply fill it out and be sure to leave off the trailing " / " slash .
If , like me , you 're putting Yourls in a sub - folder of your existing domain name , fill out the sub - folders and , again , leave off the slash .
Finally , decide whether you want to let everybody and his brother create short URLs through your site , or whether you 'll hand out passwords .
For the former , open option , simply change the value next to " YOURLS_PRIVATE " to true .
For the likely more sensible , password - protected setup , substitute the username and password values just a bit further down the file .
Advertisement
When you 're all done with everything , re-save the file with a new name , config.php .
If you 're installing Yourls in a sub - folder of your domain , you 'll need to make one more tweak .
In a file named .htaccess in the main Yourls folder ( which might be hidden , so enable your " show hidden files " setting ) , remove the " # " from the beginning of the line , and add in your folder names after the RewriteBase / — in my case , that became RewriteBase /u/ , because I installed Yourls at thepurdman.com /u/ .
Save and close that file .
Your last setup step is to fire up your FTP client , command line , or web access tool and copy the contents of your Yourls folder to your server .
Those with dedicated domains can just drop those folders and files into the main access space , or the www section in some cases , while those doing a sub - folder installation should drop them in that folder .
Advertisement
Using Yourls
If the files copied without error to your server , head to where you put them in a browser , followed by / admin/install.php .
If your database and configuration files were set up successfully , you 'll see a confirmation like the one pictured at left .
Head to your Yourls installation site , followed by / admin , and let 's make some links .
Advertisement
As you can see above ( or click for a larger view ) , Yourls has a fairly straightforward interface .
Type in a long URL , a custom short code , if you 'd like , and hit " Generate Short URL " to have your server do its thing .
The administrator can edit and delete short URLs created with his domain , and search for existing short links with filters and keywords .
Advertisement
That 's about it for Yourls — it 's one of those apps that , once you get it working , just works .
There are , however , two added tools worth noting : a WordPress plugin that can automate the creation of Yourl - generated short links for each and every post , and a bookmarklet generator for those who do n't want to head back to their own site to create new short links .
Other options
Have your own domain , but not paid server space ?
Are you mostly a blogger who just wants secure links back to your own content ?
Here 's a few avenues to explore :

Got your own way around potentially faltering URL services ?
Found a neat script , server package , or free webapp that gets your URL shortening done ?
Tell us about it , and anything else you 've tried , in the comments .

Mexico Drug War Dispatch : How The Drug Wars Ruined Monterrey ’s Killer Club Scene
The eXiled ’s Special Drug War Correspondent MONTERREY , MEXICO–This is the longest time that I ’ve been AWOL from The Exiled .
Sure I ’ve never been perfect about delivering regular on - time dispatches , but since 2008 , I ’d at least file a couple of articles every month or so .
And the strange thing is that every time I stop writing , or every time I forget to answer emails , everyone asks me if I ’m still alive , how am I doing , how many bullet holes I ’m nursing …
It ’s strange because things have been pretty uneventful here .
People write to me as if I ’m living in 1999 Kosovo , but everything is the same .
And when I say “ same ” I mean the exactly the SAME .
As in , we ’re no better today than a year ago , or two years ago , or three , four , five years ago .

Mexico Drug War Dispatch : Human Rights Are n’t Always Right
The eXiled ’s special Drug War Correspondent MONTERREY , NUEVO LEÓN–I just learned that a friend of mine got his human rights violated by the Mexican army , when he was grabbed off the street by a couple of soldiers , thrown into some dirty room , tied to a chair , stripped of his clothes and interrogated with the help of a friendly blowtorch .
The soldiers waved the flame close enough to his naked torso that , by the time they were through , it looked like a blackened rack of BBQed ribs .
All that was missing was the BBQ sauce .

Wrong Turn in San Luis Potosi : Why Did The Zetas Ambush Two ICE Agents On A Lonely Mexican Desert Road ?
The eXiled ’s special Drug War Correspondent MONTERREY , NUEVO LEÓN–While meeting Mexico ’s President Felipe Calderon at the White House today , Barack Obama is expected to discuss the idea of letting armed US agents operate on Mexican territory .
You know , to help us deal with our deadly drug violence .
Boy oh boy do we Mexicans feel safe now !
I wonder if the idea to put US troops on Mexican soil has anything to with a recent trip by a few ICE agents into Northern Mexico that ended with one dead , one injured and one SUV turned to swiss cheese ?

Narco - War Dispatch : Gulf Cartel Releases A Brutal Video Threat Against The Zetas …
This brutal video , which just came out , pretty much speaks for itself … that is , if you can understand Spanish .
If not , I ’ll explain it to you so you understand what ’s going on .
It was filmed in Reynosa , Tamaulipas , and it shows various Gulf Cartel sicarios ( assassins ) posing with two decapitated Zetas who were supposedly part of cell run by a guy called “ The Guide . ”
In the video , not only do they issue some pretty gruesome threats against two powerful leaders of the Zetas–Miguel Treviño ( aka “ Z - 40 ” ) and Heriberto Lazcano ( aka “ Z - 3 ” ) –but , well , it ’s also kind of funny .

Mexico ’s Narco - War 2011 : The Gulf Cartel Chops Up the Zetas The eXiled ’s special Drug War Correspondent MONTERREY , NUEVO LEÓN–Here we go again , a new year and a fresh new wave of narco - war porn to go along with it .
If you ’ve been paying close attention to the drug war in Monterrey ( and if you ’re reading this you must have ) you will have noticed that the new year has only meant more violence , more drugs and more black SUVs shooting it out in the streets , 3 - sided full - bore firefights between rival narco gangs and the army , pretty much like a Michael Bay movie .
Life in Monterrey right now is like living in the set of Bad Boys 2 .
Non-stop car - chases and multiple shootouts , but no point to it , no reason for the apparently random , senseless violence .
Shit , MTV should make a reality show based on Monterrey or even better , a “ Tampico Shores ” show , only in this version we get to watch the entire cast having their bodies dissolved in acid .
That ’s what it looks like from here , anyway .
But I´ve come to figuring out how to follow this mess and make some sense of the violence .

The Mexican Drug War in One Lesson : Know Your Zetas !
The “ Z ” is for “ Zetas ”
It ’s been a long , long time since my last article , but believe me it ’s not because there has n’t been any news .
If anything , it ’s because too much has been happening too fast to really explain the situation ―even by Mexico ’s Drug War standards , the news here is a fast - moving target and getting faster ―and bloodier ―by the day .
I have n’t been able to finish a fucking paragraph without some new and bigger development changing the game .
If you ’ve been paying attention to Monterrey ’s drug wars ( that ’s my beat ) , then you probably heard about how there are roadblocks all over the city , and how there ’s a kind of civil war going on , pitting the Gulf Cartel against their former armed wing , Los Zetas .
And while it ’s true that this mostly accounts for all the recent carnage , to understand the recent dark turn of events , you have to backtrack a bit .

I Propose We Never See Each Other Ag …
The head of Russia 's main security agency says Caucasus rebels are believed to have carried out two suicide bombings on Moscow 's subway system that killed 36 people .
Officials say two female suicide bombers blew themselves up on trains as the subway was packed with rush - hour passengers Monday morning .
In a televised meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev , the head of the Federal Security Service said preliminary investigation points to terrorists connected to the restive Caucasus region that includes Chechnya .
Alexander Bortnikov said the assessment was based on fragments of the bombers ' bodies .
He did not elaborate .
Emergency Ministry spokeswoman Svetlana Chumikova said 23 people were killed in an explosion shortly before 8 a.m. at the Lubyanka station in central Moscow .
The station is underneath the building that houses the main offices of the Federal Security Service , or FSB , the KGB 's main successor agency .
A second explosion hit the Park Kultury station about 45 minutes later .
Chumikova said at least 12 were dead there .
The ministry later said 38 people were injured .
" I heard a bang , turned my head and smoke was everywhere .
People ran for the exits screaming , " said 24 - year - old Alexander Vakulov , who said he was waiting on the platform opposite the targeted train at Park Kultury .
" I saw a dead person for the first time in my life , " said 19 - year - old Valtin Popov , who also was standing on the opposite platform .
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said both explosions were believed to have been set off on the trains .
" The first data that the FSB has given us is that there were two female suicide bombers , " Luzhkov told reporters at the Park Kultury site .
The blasts practically paralyzed movement in the city center as emergency vehicles sped to the stations .
In the Park Kultury blast , the bomber was wearing a belt packed with plastic explosive and set it off as the train 's doors opened , said Vladimir Markin , a spokesman for Russia 's top investigative body .
The woman has not been identified , he told reporters .
A woman who sells newspapers outside the Lubyanka station , Ludmila Famokatova , said there appeared to be no panic , but that many of the people who streamed out were distraught .
" One man was weeping , crossing himself , saying ' thank God I survived ' , " she said .
The last confirmed terrorist attack in Moscow was in August 2004 , when a suicide bomber blew herself up outside a city subway station , killing 10 people .
Responsibility for that blast was claimed by Chechen rebels and suspicion in Monday 's explosions is likely to focus on them and other separatist groups in the restive North Caucasus region .
Russian police have killed several Islamic militant leaders in the North Caucasus recently , including one last week in the Kabardino - Balkariya region .
The killing of Anzor Astemirov was mourned by contributors to two al - Qaida - affiliated Web sites .
The killings have raised fears of retaliatory strikes by the militants .
In February , Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov warned in an interview on a rebel - affiliated Website that " the zone of military operations will be extended to the territory of Russia ... the war is coming to their cities . "
Umarov also claimed his fighters were responsible for the November bombing of the Nevsky Express passenger train that killed 26 people en route from Moscow to St. Petersburg .
The Moscow subway system is one of the world 's busiest , carrying around 7 million passengers on an average workday , and is a key element in running the sprawling and traffic - choked city .
Helicopters hovered over the Park Kultury station area , which is near the renowned Gorky Park .

Iraq Mercury Poisoning
In the early 1970 's a major methyl mercury poisoning catastrophe occurred in which an estimated 10,000 people died and 100,000 were severely and permanently brain damaged .
Saddam Hussein 's regime was largely successful in suppressing information about the event .
The problem began in the late 1960 's and early 1970 's , when Iraq experienced a series of abysmal harvests its leader decided to import a newly branded " wonder wheat " from Mexico .
The risk was that the seed might grow moldy during the long , humid ocean transport to Iraq if it was not dressed with some fungicide .
Methyl mercury became the most cost - effective fungicide , because it had recently been banned in Scandinavia and several American states due to environmental and toxicological risks .
So the world market was flooded and prices dropped .
( reference )
The wheat seeds dressed with methyl mercury were sent to Basra in Iraq 's south .
Because the shipment arrived late , trucks and trains that had been at hand were reassigned .
So it took another couple of months before the grain reached the farmers .
By then the sowing season was over .
Farmers were left with a pink grain that they were told not to eat , only to plant .
But recent harvests had been lousy and farmers had little or nothing to feed their animals and themselves .
Like many farmers of the world , Iraqi farmers mistrust their government and began feeding the grain to chickens or sheep and watched to see if there were any bad side effects .
Nothing happened for weeks .
At that point , most farmers began giving the grain to their livestock and eating it themselves .
Children got to like the pink bread .
However , bad things start to happen a few months later and hospitals were flooded with patients showing symptoms of damage to the central nervous system .
At first , doctors initially had no idea as to the cause .
Some suspected an epidemic of " brain fever " of some sort .
Others more accurately pointed to methyl mercury .
A small group of international experts on mercury were called in and methyl mercury poisoning was confirmed through contaminated food .
When the imported grain was identified as the cause of the poisoning , Iraq 's government acted decisively .
Farmers were ordered to hand over all remaining supplies within a fortnight .
To stress the urgency , a death penalty for possessing pink grain after that date was declared .
But most farmers had no access to radio , television , or daily newspapers .
By the time most learned about the order and the penalty , the two weeks were gone and the army had started to execute those found still to be in possession of the grain .
So the farmers dumped grain wherever they could : along roadsides , in irrigation canals , in rivers .
Fish soon became contaminated , as did migratory birds .
One father of a family with several poisoned members and without any traditional food left stood in his doorway praising Allah for having made these migratory birds easy to catch when they had nothing else to eat .
At hospitals throughout the country , doctors concluded that there was nothing they could do .
There is no real treatment for methyl mercury poisoning .
In rural Iraq the tradition is that a person preferably should die at home with his or her family around .
Thus , when they saw and heard that doctors could n't help , people brought their sick family member home .
Consequently , the official figures that put the number of deaths from methyl mercury poisoning at 6,500 people only cover those who died in hospital .
The real number is certainly far higher .
The crisis did provide doctors with some greater understanding of how to detect methyl mercury poisoning .
" Quiet baby syndrome , " for example , when mothers praise their babies for never crying , is now considered a warning sign for methyl mercury induced brain damage in children .
Treatment , too , has changed in the wake of the mass poisoning .
The agents traditionally used to speed up excretion of inorganic metals from poisoned patients turned out to make symptoms of methyl mercury poisoning worse rather than milder .

Vers un refroidissement de l'Europe ?
Les eaux profondes océaniques suivent un circuit bien identifié autour de la planète Ñ parcouru en près de deux mille ans .
L'analyse isotopique d'organismes marins fossiles a montré que la vitesse de ce flux avait varié dans le passé , et qu'un ralentissement se traduisait par le refroidissement des régions auxquelles l'océan apporte de la chaleur .
Or l'augmentation des pluies induite par le changement climatique qui est probablement en train de se produire pourrait ralentir cette circulation et , du coup , refroidir le climat européen .
L'océan est généralement considéré comme un régulateur du climat .
En été , l 'eau de mer absorbe le rayonnement solaire intense , mais s'échauffe peu en raison de sa forte capacité calorifique .
En hiver , elle restitue la chaleur emmagasinée pendant l'été , de sorte que l'océan joue le rôle d'un gigantesque volant thermique qui atténue l'amplitude des variations saisonnières de la température des zones côtières .
En outre , les eaux superficielles qui baignent les côtes françaises proviennent de l'océan Atlantique subtropical et leur température reste généralement comprise entre 10 °C et 20 °C , ce qui assure des conditions tempérées à la Bretagne .
En revanche , c'est un courant d'eau froide , venant de l'océan Glacial Arctique qui s'écoule le long du Groenland et contribue à y maintenir un climat rigoureux , même pendant l'été .
En 1988 , un géologue allemand , Hartmut Heinrich , a eu son attention attirée par l'existence dans les sédiments atlantiques de plusieurs couches sombres , épaisses de quelques centimètres .
Leur analyse a montré qu'elles étaient surtout constituées de débris de roches continentales qui , en raison de leur poids , ne pouvaient avoir été transportés que par des icebergs .
L'équipe de paléoclimatologie du Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory de New York et celle du Centre des faibles radioactivités de Gif - sur - Yvette ont montré en 1992 que ces dépôts couvraient la quasi - totalité de l'océan Atlantique au nord des Açores et qu'ils correspondaient à des événements bien définis de débâcles massives d'icebergs relâchés par les glaciers canadiens ou nord - européens et connus sous le nom d'« événements de Heinrich » .
Les calottes glaciaires qui recouvraient les continents de l'hémisphère nord n'étaient pas très stables et , tous les sept à dix mille ans , la glace qui bordait l'océan Atlantique glissait dans la mer , provoquant une montée des eaux de plusieurs mètres en quelques siècles .
La composition isotopique des rares foraminifères trouvés dans les sédiments de cette époque présente des rapports 18O / 16O très faibles , ce qui indique que les icebergs constitués de glace très pauvre en 18O fondaient pendant l'été , provoquant une diminution importante de la salinité des eaux superficielles ( 3 ) , un ralentissement de la circulation océanique et un renforcement du froid sur l'ensemble de la planète : il a été sensible en Europe , mais aussi en Floride où la végétation tropicale a été remplacée par une forêt de pins , et en Asie qui était balayée par les vents glacés de nord - est pendant l'hiver .
Dès que les apports d'icebergs cessaient , le tapis roulant océanique reprenait un rythme plus soutenu et des conditions moins défavorables revenaient , même si la présence des glaciers qui s'étaient maintenus empêchait l'établissement de conditions aussi clémentes qu'aujourd ' hui .
Le dernier événement d'Heinrich date d'environ 15 000 ans .
Toutefois , l'hémisphère nord a connu un fort coup de froid il y a environ 11 000 ans , alors que les glaciers fondaient et que notre planète passait vers les conditions chaudes actuelles en réponse à l'augmentation de l'insolation d'été sur l'hémisphère nord associée au cycle calculé par Milutin Milankovitch au début du siècle .
Ce coup de froid inattendu est appelé « Dryas Récent » .
En moins de cent ans , les températures moyennes annuelles ont chuté d'une dizaine de degrés sur la France ainsi qu'au large de la Bretagne ou du Portugal .
Le refroidissement a également affecté le Groenland et le nord de l'océan Pacifique , tandis que la sécheresse sévissait en Afrique .
Les sédiments de l'Atlantique nord ont bien enregistré la baisse des températures , mais ils ne contiennent pas de quantité significative de débris transportés par les icebergs .
En revanche , ils contiennent des cendres relâchées par un volcan islandais .
Le volcanisme , dont l'effet sur le climat est temporaire , ne peut être responsable de ce coup de froid qui a duré près d'un millénaire .
La présence de cendres dispersées sur tout l'Atlantique nord témoigne de l'existence de glaces dérivantes , déversées massivement dans la mer du Groenland et l'océan Atlantique nord par l'océan Glacial Arctique .
La production accrue de glace de mer dans cet océan est vraisemblablement liée à l'augmentation de débit de la rivière Mackenzie dont le bassin d'alimentation recevait davantage de pluie et qui , de surcroît , venait de capter les eaux de fonte de la calotte glaciaire canadienne .
En outre , la mer dont le niveau montait , venait juste d'envahir le vaste plateau continental qui ceinture l'océan Glacial Arctique et qui constitue une zone favorable à la production de glace de mer .
Expulsées de l'océan Arctique au travers du détroit de Fram , ces glaces ont provoqué en fondant une forte baisse des salinités , un ralentissement du rythme de plongée des eaux superficielles de l'océan Atlantique nord et du tapis roulant océanique , avec pour conséquence une diminution sensible de l'apport de chaleur sur l'Europe .
Les études paléoclimatiques confirment bien que les conditions clémentes régnant actuellement sur l'Europe occidentale dépendent étroitement du transport de chaleur par les courants marins et que la circulation générale de l'océan est extrêmement sensible aux variations des apports d'eau douce sur l'Atlantique Nord .
Cette sensibilité constitue le talon d'Achille du tapis roulant océanique .
Le climat de notre planète est en train de changer .
Les mesures effectuées dans les stations du réseau météorologique mondial montrent que la Terre se réchauffe depuis le début du vingtième siècle ( 4 ) .
L'augmentation des températures est particulièrement sensible depuis une dizaine d'années et beaucoup de climatologues pensent que les hommes en sont , au moins en partie , responsables .
En effet , les activités industrielles et agricoles ont provoqué l'augmentation de la teneur en gaz carbonique de l'atmosphère qui est passée de 280 ppm ( 1 ppm , ou partie par million , représente ici 1 cm3/m3 ) à l'époque de Louis XIV à 360 ppm aujourd ' hui .
Elles ont nettement accru les teneurs en méthane , oxydes d'azote , composés organo - fluorés gazeux et poussières ( aérosols soufrés et carbonés ) .
Tous ces gaz contribuent à augmenter l'effet de serre de la planète et à réchauffer la basse atmosphère , tandis que les aérosols ont l'effet inverse .
Il est cependant bien difficile de prédire comment le cycle hydrologique sera perturbé .
D'abord parce qu'il présente une variabilité considérable , ensuite parce qu'il est encore très mal connu en raison de la médiocrité et du faible nombre d'observations en milieu océanique .
C'est un phénomène d'observation courante qu'il pleut beaucoup plus au - dessus des îles montagneuses sur lesquelles butent les masses d'air humide que sur l'océan lui-même .
Les enregistrements obtenus dans les stations météorologiques installées dans les îles ne permettent donc pas de mettre en évidence un changement dans la quantité moyenne de pluie au dessus de l'Atlantique nord .
Plusieurs observations paléoclimatiques montrent en effet que les modifications de la circulation océanique qui en résulteraient pourraient entraîner un refroidissement rapide de l'Europe occidentale .
Le Dryas Récent , nous l'avons vu , est un exemple typique dans lequel une injection massive de glace depuis l'océan Arctique peut déstabiliser le climat de l'hémisphère nord , et peut - être même de l'ensemble de la planète .
Il est probable que dans ce cas , la quantité d'eau douce injectée dans l'océan Arctique a été particulièrement forte en raison de la coïncidence entre une période de pluies intenses sur le Canada et la capture par la rivière Mackenzie d'un lac qui collectait l'eau de fonte des calottes glaciaires voisines .
Beaucoup plus récemment , dans les années 1965 - 1976 , le climat de la Terre a connu une évolution curieuse au cours de laquelle le réchauffement de la planète était surtout marqué dans l'hémisphère Sud , alors qu'une grande partie de l'hémisphère nord subissait un refroidissement , notamment dans l'Atlantique ( 6 ) .
Les glaces , qui étaient très rares depuis 1920 , ont alors bloqué la totalité de la côte nord de l'Islande à la fin de l'hiver et au début du printemps .
L'impact économique a été considérable et a provoqué la dévaluation de la monnaie islandaise .
Océanographes et climatologues ont découvert , avec dix ans de retard , que cette crise climatique avait été associée à un accroissement des pluies et des neiges sur le continent nord - américain dans les années 1964 - 1966 , suivi de la production massive de glace de mer par l'océan Arctique .
Cette glace a été expulsée dans la mer du Groenland où elle a donné lieu à une baisse de salinité lorsqu'elle fondait en été ; la variation a été tellement forte que les océanographes l'ont désignée sous le nom de « Grande A nomalie de salinité » .
La nappe d'eau superficielle peu salée a ensuite fait le tour de l'océan Atlantique nord ; elle s'est mélangée progressivement avec les eaux sous - jacentes et a disparu vers 1980 ( fig. 4 ) .
En stratifiant les eaux superficielles , elle a ralenti la convection hivernale ainsi que le transport de chaleur vers les hautes latitudes .
Cet exemple , qui s'est déroulé sous nos yeux , constitue peut - être un modèle réduit du « Petit Age glaciaire » qui a duré trois siècles , du règne de Louis XIV à celui de Napoléon III .
En effet tous les indices concordent pour suggérer que cet événement froid pourrait bien être associé à un caprice de l'océan Atlantique .
Les historiens confirment qu'il a surtout affecté l'hémisphère nord , qu'il a été particulièrement marqué en Europe , tandis que les archives des ports indiquent que les glaces bloquaient l'Islande de dix à vingt - cinq semaines par an , le record étant pour l'année 1750 de neuf mois d'englacement .
Une production accrue de glace de mer arctique et un ralentissement de la circulation océanique pourraient bien être les responsables de ce coup de froid qui a tant marqué notre histoire .
Ainsi , l'océan considéré traditionnellement comme un stabilisateur du climat pourrait devenir un agent déstabilisateur pour peu que le cycle hydrologique soit perturbé .
L'évolution climatique des prochaines décennies risque d'être pleine de surprises .

En effet tous les indices concordent pour suggérer que cet événement froid pourrait bien être associé à un caprice de l'océan Atlantique .
Les historiens confirment qu'il a surtout affecté l'hémisphère nord , qu'il a été particulièrement marqué en Europe , tandis que les archives des ports indiquent que les glaces bloquaient l'Islande de dix à vingt - cinq semaines par an , le record étant pour l'année 1750 de neuf mois d'englacement .
Une production accrue de glace de mer arctique et un ralentissement de la circulation océanique pourraient bien être les responsables de ce coup de froid qui a tant marqué notre histoire .
Ainsi , l'océan considéré traditionnellement comme un stabilisateur du climat pourrait devenir un agent déstabilisateur pour peu que le cycle hydrologique soit perturbé .
L'évolution climatique des prochaines décennies risque d'être pleine de surprises .
I follow the aging literature using ( among other tools ) a set of RSS feeds that monitors recent journal articles in PubMed .
Today , my feeds were all overflowing , and with great titles , way more than usual … and then I noticed that all of the papers seemed to be from the same journal .
What ’s going on ?
PubMed has started indexing AGING , the open- access biogerontology journal that launched a little less than a year ago , and several issues at once were added to the database ( and , therefore , to my feeds ) .
This was announced last year but it ’s taken a while for the full catalog of articles to make it into the database .
Getting indexed is an important step for a new publishing effort , since if an article is n’t in PubMed it ’s basically invisible to scholars around the world .
So , congratulations are in order .
Looking over the last year of AGING , I ’m reasonably impressed .
For such a new journal , they ’re getting lots of papers from major labs , and publishing quite a few nice studies .
This bodes well for measures of importance such as impact factor and article - level metrics ( though neither is yet available for AGING ) .
The great thing about open - access journals is that content is free to everyone — so if the lack of journal subscriptions has been holding you back , now is a great time to jump into the aging literature .
AGING is highly technical , but it represents a rare confluence of universal accessibility and a high concentration of aging - related articles , so it ’s a good place to start exploring .
A spate of recent reports from home sales to mortgage activity has been starkly negative .
And , even if some of it can be written off to seasonal patterns , namely weather , the weakness is not what what people expected with the extension and expansion of the government ’s homebuyer tax credit that jacked sales for several months last summer and fall .
New homes sales fell to a record low in January , extending a two - month slide ; pending and existing home sales were down in December ; homebuilder sentiment in January fell back to where it was last June , and mortgage applications have fallen three of the past four weeks ,
Existing - Home Sales Plunge In January
“ The data is telling us that it is weaker than we ’ve been anticipating , ” says Pat Newport , a housing analyst at IHS Global Insight .
“ What the housing market has needed all along is a better economy . ”
Even the optimists never expected a traditional housing recovery with unemployment stubbornly high , the consumer balance sheet still in repair mode and credit conditions stingy , but right now there ’s palpable worry about momentum — especially given a string of solid months in mid- to late - 2009 .
The Mortgage Bankers Association ’s outlook was and remains “ fairly cautious , ” says Michael Fratantoni , vice president of research .
“ I think we were getting some false signals in the late summer and early fall , when we seeing some price increase , that were more than the seasonal impact . ”
The MBA is expecting a modest year - over - year increase in home sales and housing starts , with prices leveling out .
Global Insight , for one , says it will probably lower its projections for housing starts and new home sales .
The homebuyer tax credit , which now applies to repeat buyers and not just first - time ones , “ is n’t panning out , its ’ not registering , " says Newport .
“ Demand for new housing is a lot weaker than we thought it would be . ”
As sales jumped last year , making the tax credit look like a major success , some analysts feared that it would hurt sales later , essentially pushing activity forward .
That now appears to be the case .
Bargain Prices Cut Both Ways
Meanwhile , foreclosed properties continue to dominate sales with less than the usual activity in the middle market , where people trade up to new or better existing homes .
“ Foreclosed homes are selling at remarkable pace , ” says Richard Smith , CEO of Realogy , the national real estate company , whose brands include Coldwell Banker , Century 21 and The Corcoran Group .
“ People are looking for the value play .
The majority of homes are being bought by investors and first - time buyers ..
Smith says the government ’s mortgage modification program meant to avert foreclosures “ is doing nothing more than prolonging the housing recovery .
It is doing more harm than good . ”
Reporting from Beirut — Iranian officials trumpeted new nuclear and military ambitions Monday in the face of domestic political discord and stepped - up international talk of tightening economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic .
Ali Akbar Salehi , head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , announced that Tehran had informed the United Nations ’ nuclear watchdog that it intended to launch construction of 10 new nuclear - fuel plants in the Persian calendar year starting March 2010 and begin producing 20 % - enriched uranium to provide fuel for a Tehran medical reactor .
Up until now , Iran has only produced reactor - grade 3.5 % - enriched uranium and has managed to build only one functioning nuclear - fuel plant .
“ The 20 % enrichment begins on Tuesday under supervision of inspectors and observers from the International Atomic Energy Agency , ” or IAEA , Salehi said in an interview published on the website of Iran ’s state - owned Al - Alam television news channel .
As of Monday morning , diplomats and arms inspectors in Vienna , home to the IAEA , had yet to receive anything in writing , said an official in the Austrian capital who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Western diplomats have vowed to pursue tougher sanctions against Iran to pressure it into curbing sensitive components of its nuclear and missile programs that they suspect are the cornerstones of an eventual atomic - weapons capability .
Iranian military officials also announced plans to build new military planes , aerial drones and anti-aircraft missiles in a flurry of pronouncements hailing national achievements ahead of annual commemorations of Iran ’s 1979 Islamic Revolution on Thursday , when a burgeoning opposition movement and security forces are expected to clash on the streets of Tehran and other cities .
The eight - month political crisis continues to divide the Iranian political establishment .
The Fars news agency , close to the Revolutionary Guard , reported that pro-government Iranians had signed a petition demanding the arrest of opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi , a former prime minister ; Mehdi Karroubi , a former parliament speaker ; and Mohammad Khatami , a former president .
Another official hinted at upcoming purges of the nation ’s security forces .
“ Well - known intelligence and military elements were instrumental in the post- election sedition , ” said intelligence minister Heydar Moslehi , according to the news website Aftabnews.ir .
Experts and international inspectors have concluded that Iran ’s nuclear program has been stagnant in the months since the country ’s domestic political crisis erupted following the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Any move to escalate the program could alarm Western nations and Israel .
Iran lacks a plant to turn enriched uranium into fuel plates for the medical reactor .
Few experts believe it has the infrastructure to build 10 enrichment facilities any time soon .
Ahmadinejad ordered Salehi to produce the 20 % - enriched uranium fuel on Sunday .
Salehi said the fuel would be produced at Iran ’s Natanz enrichment facility but left the door open to a compromise .
Western officials accuse Iran of failing to respond to a U.N. - backed offer to transfer the bulk of Iran ’s low - enriched uranium abroad in exchange for 20 % - enriched fuel plates to power the ailing Tehran medical reactor .
Iranian officials say they want to conduct the fuel exchange on their own soil , a condition the West has rejected .
Salehi said Tehran ’s move to further enrich uranium was only meant to help cancer - stricken Iranians .
“ We will stop enrichment as soon as we get the necessary fuel for the reactor , ” he said .

Must Watch Documentaries
What They Wo n't Show You On Television
Welcome to the Must Watch section .
It is our understanding that for a truly democratic society to exist , there must be a free flow of easily accessible information .
For the most part ( not including heavy censorship in China ) , the Internet has allowed for this free flow of information to everyone and anyone with access to the internet and it is imperative that this right continues to be protected .
Unfortunately , the principle of free flowing information does not exist in the mainstream media because our governments continue to allow large corporations to consolidate the entire media industry .
For this reason , many facts , perspectives , and opinions do not make it to our televisions , movie theatres , newspapers , and radio stations .
The documentaries below epitomize the importance of free flowing information and the lack of it in mainstream media .
Although the documentaries have been categorized for easier selection , please keep in mind that this was quite a difficult task ; not because of the sheer number , but because of the overlapping ideas and themes each documentary has to provide .
After all , everything is interconnected .
Please take the time to educate yourself and to educate others about the important issues raised in each of the documentaries .
It is important to understand that truth is not a matter of belief , it is a matter of understanding .

No - Fly Terror List Includes Big Financial Backer of Clinton FBI stops Nigerian with ties to ex-president ; allowed to fly after questioning .
Feb. 17 , 2010  -- A Nigerian businessman who has been a significant financial supporter for former President Bill Clinton was stopped from boarding a private jet last month in New Jersey after law enforcement authorities discovered he had been put on the U.S. government 's recently expanded terrorist no -fly list , according to a report of the incident provided to ABCNews.com .
The businessman , Gilbert Chagoury , 64 , was prevented from boarding the jet at Teterboro airport in New Jersey on Jan. 15 , according to the report .
Law enforcement authorities reported they ultimately obtained a " waiver " from Washington to permit Chagoury to fly out of the country to France .
According to the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , the no-fly list is designed to " keep known terrorists off planes . "
The TSA website says it works with intelligence and law enforcement partners to compile the list and has a " dedicated staff to review and scrub the existing No - Fly list and ensure all nominees meet the standing criteria . "
The TSA declined to comment on why or when Chagoury had been placed on the terror no - fly list or who provided the waiver to allow him to board his flight .
and referred ABC News to the FBI 's Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) for comment .
A spokesperson for the FBI 's TSC also declined to comment about Chagoury , saying the TSC never comments on individual names on the no-fly list .
The spokesperson did say the list is " fluid " and individuals may be moved up or downgraded at any time based on the current threat environment , but " an individual 's social status , financial means , and political affiliations are not considered " in an individual being moved up or down the list .
Chagoury 's son , Gilbert Jr. , confirmed that his father had been stopped by the FBI at Teterboro .
He said he would ask his father to call ABC News for further comment but the senior Chagoury has yet to respond .
A Clinton spokesman , Matt McKenna , said the former President 's office was unaware of the incident until contacted by ABCNews.com .
" We had no role whatsoever " in helping Chagoury get the waiver , said McKenna .
" Nor would we ever , " he added .
Chagoury is a controversial figure in Africa and Europe but it is the first time there has been any suggestion of alleged ties to terrorism .
Described as a billionaire , Chagoury runs an industrial conglomerate in Nigeria , the Chagoury Group , and had ties to a former corrupt president there .
In 2009 Chagoury pledged $ 1 billion via the Chagoury Group as part of his commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative , according to the Global Initiative website .
Chagoury also recently donated more than $ 1 million to the Clinton Foundation , according to a list of donors made public by the foundation in December .
Members of Chagoury 's family were contributors to the 2008 Presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton .
Chagoury Donated to 1996 Clinton Campaign
The money for Clinton 's re-election helped to fund a get - out - the - vote effort , which legally can accept contributions from a non-US resident .
Law enforcement authorities say Chagoury was a " positive match " to the Gilbert Chagoury on the terrorism no fly list , based on his date of birth .
He was traveling on a British passport which does not require a US visa to enter the country .
According to the law enforcement report , Chagoury also is named on a second watch list called , TIDE , the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment , maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center .
According to the Center website , the TIDE list is the US government 's " central repository on international terrorist identities . "
Federal agencies nominate individuals for the TIDE list based on possible connections to terrorist organizations or terrorist financing , according to the website .
The report on the incident said a private jet owned by Chagoury was at Teterboro for repairs and he was attempting to leave on a second jet , a Dassault Falcon 900EX .
Chagoury , five passengers and two crew members were all detained by TSA officers who called in agents from the FBI and Customs and Border Patrol .
After being questioned for several hours by the FBI , the crew and passengers were released without incident , according to the report .
By the time Chagoury 's " waiver " to fly was processed , authorities said , the repairs had been finished on his jet and he departed for Paris on that aircraft .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Chagoury , of Lebanese descent , has also been a financial supporter of Christian politicians and religious leaders in Lebanon .
The paper also cited reports that Chagoury had been the subject of " government investigations into suspected bribery by Western companies that do business in Nigeria . "

05:11 pm - Death of a Couch Potato
I should have known
They 'd find me eventually .
Clearly
They had realized I was around here somewhere .
It 's getting harder and harder to find the last remaining caches of edible food - breaking into 7 - 11s for Twinkies , mostly , and those turbo - dogs that can be microwaved .
All the fast - food joints have been torn down , or converted into serving to Their tastes .
* shudder * I miss a good old - fashioned hamburger .
What They call a " burger " is beyond horrifying .
They are mostly active during the day , so I move about at night .
Well before the sun comes up , I 'm holed back up in my basement , quietly watching DVDs of The Simpsons behind my double - barred door .
There 's nothing on TV anymore except Their " educational " material .
It all blurs together after a while , bland and humorless , numbers and words and facts without life .
What good is filling your brain at the cost of your soul ?
It was just a matter of time before
They decided to do something about me .
They 're already used to being up at the first grey light - the ones that jog at least .
But I 'd noticed the last couple of weeks that there were occasional groups of Them , out even earlier and not so much jogging as just … patrolling … in that awkward - looking double - time that keeps circulation up even if you 're not in full aerobic cardio burn .
Sweeping the neighborhood with flashlights .
In their Nikes .
Listening to their Pods .
I stepped up my own scavenging activities to prepare for a relocation .
I 've had to move before .
I used to live with my girlfriend , but They got to her and I had to escape before she brought
Them to come get me as well .
Last I saw of her , she was wearing pink sweats , her hair pulled back with a band , drinking f'ing wheatgrass juice .
The healthy sheen of sweat on her skin made me want to vomit .
How can anyone live like that ?
I 'd rather die than find out , if I have the choice .
But it 's not to be :
As I 'm stuffing the last of my Cheetos - maybe the last Cheetos anywhere - into the rucksack , I hear an ominous shuffling all around upstairs , the sound that only the high - grip rubber soles of quality cross- trainers can make .
They 're at the top of the stairs , so I dash for the little storm window , tear down the board , pull it open .
But it 's up high , hard for me to climb to , and harder for me to squeeze through .
They burst into the basement behind me , howling .
" Grab his fat ass ! "
Their well - manicured nails clutch at my feet .
I kick Them away and pull the rest of the way through the window , up into the yard .
I can hear more just over the fence , out front , so I rush to the back of the yard where the loose boards are .
I can get through that space pretty quickly still .
It 's big enough .
I made it big enough for just this reason .
But when I reach the street , as the sun breaks over the hills , I see that They 're everywhere .
I run and run and run as hard and as fast as I can , but there is no way :
They do a 5 K every morning like clockwork and I 'm huffing and puffing after a hundred yards .
They fall on me and lift me easily up over
Their heads with arms that can do pushups for an hour straight .
I struggle as best I can , but a minute
They have plunked me down in front of a particularly lean and healthy looking woman dressed like a coach .
" I can sssssssmell the cholesssssssterol in your blood , " she hisses .
Then , with a wave to my captors : " Take him to eat sssssssomething healthy .
Then ... get him ssssome exerccccccisssssse . "
I scream all the way to the FoodShack at the corner , where they pin me down in a counter seat and hold my mouth open to force a " burger " in : No bread .
Lettuce instead .
No beef , just soy .
I gag at first .
" Stop fighting , " a voice whispers in my ear .
I begin to sob .
But then there 's a swallow and something terrible happens in my body and the next bite goes down easier .
I can't see through my weeping .
The burger is followed by a fruit smoothie with extra vitamins .
They are clutching at my feet ; my trusty old combat boots are replaced by a nice new pair of running shoes .
No , god no , anything but this .
Please let me have just one last cup of coffee .
Where are they taking me ?
We 're in a building , Their hands set me down somewhere , in a seat of some kind - a chair to be tortured in .
God no , anything but this : it 's a recumbent exercise bike .
My legs begin pumping at the pedals , slowly at first but then harder and more insistently , refusing to obey as I beg them to stop .

For consideration : why yes I am still working out regularly why do you ask
Hill Preps for Big Tech Thursday
Thursday will be a busy day on Capitol Hill on the issue of the power of Big Tech and what , if anything , to do about it .
GREENSBURG , Pa. —
Pittsburgh 's federal prosecutor is reviewing the torture death of a mentally disabled woman under a new federal law banning hate crimes against people with disabilities .
Acting U.S. Attorney Robert Cessar said today that it 's too early to tell if his office will file charges against any or all of the six suspects under the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act signed by President Obama in October .
The suspects face homicide and other charges in state court in last week ’s death of 30 - year - old Jennifer Daugherty .
Her body was found in a trash can at a school in Greensburg .
Cessar says he needs to do more research to determine whether his office may file an extra charge against the suspects or bring the entire case into federal court .
Daugherty 's head had been shaved , and she had been bound with Christmas decorations and clothing ; she also was hit with a towel rack , vacuum cleaner hose and a crutch , according to an affidavit .
Her face was painted with nail polish , and she was fed vegetable oil , spices and medications in addition to soap and urine , police said .
" She was exploited , and her kindness and her handicap made her very vulnerable , " Daugherty 's sister , Joy Burkholder , said .
" She trusted everybody ; she believed everyone was good , and no one would hurt her . "
Six people were charged with criminal homicide , kidnapping and related charges in the death of Daugherty .
Charged were Robert Loren Masters Jr. , 36 ; Ricky Smyrnes , 23 ; Melvin Knight , 20 ; Amber Meidinger , 20 ; and a 17 - year - old , all of Greensburg ; and Peggy Darlene Miller , 27 , of Mount Pleasant Township .
All were being held without bond in the Westmoreland County prison .
Stepfather Bobby Murphy , 62 , of Mount Pleasant , told The Associated Press that the victim had the mental abilities of a 12 - to 14 - year - old .
Murphy said he was the last family member to see Daugherty alive , on Feb. 8 , when he took her to get on a bus to Greensburg .
She had a dentist there , as well as a counselor there who helped her with a mental disability , he said .
Murphy said that he's not sure which one Daugherty had an appointment with , but that later that day , she called home and asked permission to spend the night at " Peggy 's " house .
Murphy said his stepdaughter planned to return home Feb . 9 .
BENGHAZI , Libya ( Reuters ) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi called on Thursday for a “ jihad ” or armed struggle against Switzerland , saying it was an infidel state that was destroying mosques .

“ Any Muslim in any part of the world who works with Switzerland is an apostate , is against ( the Prophet ) Mohammad , God and the Koran , ” Gaddafi said during a meeting in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi to mark the Prophet ’s birthday .
“ The masses of Muslims must go to all airports in the Islamic world and prevent any Swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any Swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any Swiss goods being sold , ” Gaddafi said .
The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it had no comment on Gaddafi ’s remarks .
Libya ’s relations with Switzerland broke down in 2008 when a son of Gaddafi was arrested in a Geneva hotel and charged with abusing domestic servants .
He was released shortly afterwards and the charges were dropped , but Libya cut oil supplies to Switzerland , withdrew billions of dollars from Swiss bank accounts and arrested two Swiss businessmen working in the North African country .
One has been released but the other was forced this week to leave the Swiss embassy in Tripoli where he had been sheltering and move to a prison to serve a four - month sentence , apparently avoiding a major confrontation .
Libya says the Geneva arrest and the case of the two businessmen are not linked .
“ Let us fight against Switzerland , Zionism and foreign aggression , ” said Gaddafi , adding that “ this is not terrorism , ” in contrast with the work of al Qaeda which he called a “ kind of crime and a psychological disease . ”
“ There is a big difference between terrorism and jihad which is a right to armed struggle , ” he said .
Gaddafi accused Switzerland of being an “ infidel , obscene state which is destroying mosques , ” in reference to a Swiss referendum verdict barring construction of minarets .
He called for a “ jihad against it with all means . ”
Gaddafi was speaking before leading prayers in a Benghazi square in the presence of envoys from dozens of Muslim countries .
Swiss nationals voted 57.5 percent in favor of the minaret ban in the November 29 referendum backed by the right - wing Swiss People ’s Party .
The federal government had urged voters to reject it , warning it would contravene religious freedom .

And now , we present the

Example of a questionnaire used to form a semantic differential for one particular brand .
Subjects had to rate the brands according to their relationships to 18 pairs of contrary adjectives .

Is this aspirin playful or serious ?

Semantic space built by the results of the semantic differentials .
Brands and concepts are displayed on a 2D schema ( factors ‘ social competence ’ and ‘ potency ’ ; factors were orthogonal ) .
Colored circles depict the different brands .
[ NOTE : click on the figure for a larger view , and you can see the adjectives used in the present study are depicted in light blue . ]
... Although semantic differentials have been investigated for decades , the correct description of these factors remains an issue .
Thus , different researchers have been using very different labels for the underlying factors .
This is particularly true for the factor ‘ evaluation ’ ( Osgood et al. , 1957 ) , which also has been described as ‘ mother ’ [ in a psychoanalytic view ( Hofstätter , 1957 ) ] and more recently as ‘ social competence ’ ( Dziobek and Hülser , 2007 ) .
(2) Ratings on bipolar adjective scales tend to be correlated , and three basic dimensions of response account for most of the co-variation in ratings .
The three dimensions , which have been labeled Evaluation , Potency , and Activity ( EPA ) , have been verified and replicated in an impressive variety of studies .
( 3 ) Some adjective scales are almost pure measures of the EPA dimensions ; for example , good - bad for Evaluation , powerful - powerless for Potency , and fast - slow for Activity .
Using a few pure scales of this sort , one can obtain , with considerable economy , reliable measures of a person 's overall response to something .
Typically , a concept is rated on several pure scales associated with a single dimension , and the results are averaged to provide a single factor score for each dimension .
Measurements of a concept on the EPA dimensions are referred to as the concept 's profile .

Contrasts of brands loading high on the factor ‘ social competence ’ compared with brands loading high on the factor ‘ potency ’ .
This contrast showed significant activation in the MPFC and the SFG ( Contrasts of brands loading high on the factor ‘ social competence ’ compared with brands loading high on the factor ‘ potency ’ .
This contrast showed significant activation in the MPFC and the SFG ( superior frontal gyrus ) .
fMRI enable us to link the factors driven out of the behavioral data with the activation of certain cortical areas .
Since the functional meaning of those areas ( the MPFC and the SFG ) are known from previous studies , the results can tell us what the extracted factors are about .
More in detail , the results suggest to mark the factor originally described as ‘ evaluation ’ now as being mainly characterized by social perceptions .
Thus , the description ‘ social competence ’ for this factor seems to be much more appropriate .
Hence , the fMRI results provide important improvements for the factorial model of semantic space , which would not have been possible by looking on the behavioral data alone .
However , since the SFG has been related not only to working memory but also to a variety of different cognitive functions , these explanations remain speculative .
The nascent field of neuromarketing has grown tremendously in the last 5 years .
Its goal is to use brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG to gain hidden insights into consumer preferences .
Commercial applications have far outstripped the peer - reviewed science necessary to validate their use .
Google returns 322,000 hits for the term , whereas PubMed coughs up a sorry number - only 5 references !
That does n't stop large corporations from funneling millions of dollars into neuromarketing .
A new study published by Schaefer & Rotte , 2010 combined the techniques of semantic differentials ( rating products along a 7 point scale between 2 bipolar adjectives , as shown in Fig. 2 ) with fMRI .
First , participants viewed 18 pictures of common pharaceutical brands , such as aspirin .
They were asked to rate these stimuli on a 5 - point - scale regarding their personal attractiveness .
After the imaging session was over , they completed the semantic differential questionnaire .
These ratings were used to analyze the fMRI data .
I knew next to nothing about semantic differentials before reading this paper , and that state of ignorance did not improve much when I finished reading .
Some of the concepts were really murky and dependent on familiarity with the literature from 1957 and / or in German :
The terms " evaluation " , " mother " , and " social competence " do not seem remotely equivalent .
A book chapter by David Heise ( 1970 ) provided some clarity on the methodology :
So why is a brand of aspirin rated on the dimension of seclusive - - sociable ?
Because the results here were incorporated into a larger semantic space established in an earlier study .
Principal component analysis reduced the dimensionality of the data to two main factors that accounted for 87 % of the variance : ‘ evaluation ’ and ‘ potency ’ .
The authors did n't like ‘ evaluation ’ for some unexplained reason and instead used the term ‘ social competence ’ for a series of inanimate pharmaceuticals .
Moving on to the fMRI aspect of the experiment , it seems the authors wanted to relate the social competence of drug brands to neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex ( MPFC ) , which has been associated with self - referential processing and social cognition .
Oddly , the reverse contrast of high potency brands vs. high social competence brands did not produce any significant activity in the brain at all , which seems unexpected for a series of drugs .
The high potency vs. low potency comparison revealed a reduction in SFG activity .
To explain these results , the authors comitted the logical fallacy known as " reverse inference " by inferring the participants ' mental state from the observed pattern of brain activity .
As for the SFG , they 'd like to relate greater activity there to enhanced cognitive effort and working memory , but acknowledged this caveat :
Overall , I 'm not sure how Bayer can target a new marketing campaign based on these results .
The social competence of doctors recommending the aspirin , as in the classic commercial below ?
Comments , anyone ?

Up to 200 beds at two hospitals are to close to save money , Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has announced .
The trust , which runs Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General hospitals , said it has to save between £ 27 m and £ 30 m in the 2010 / 11 financial year .
The first phase will see 95 beds close in four wards at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital from 1 April .
A Unison spokesman said he was " dismayed " at the announcement .
The first phase of closures will be in a rehabilitation ward , Ward 2A , Acute Care Unit B and Neurology .
The prospective savings represent a 6.5 % reduction on the previous year 's budget .
Staff at the hospitals , which have 1,128 in - patient beds , were told the news earlier this week .
' Times are difficult '
A trust spokesman said the decision to close between 150 and 200 beds had been made due to reductions in public sector spending for the foreseeable future .
He added the trust did not expect to make redundancies , but would look to redeploy staff .
Chief executive Dr Frank Harsent said the trust had " no choice " but to make the savings .
He added : " We do not have the right to spend taxpayers ' money that we have not been given and in order to make the savings , these plans have to be ready to begin making a difference from the start of the financial year on 1 April . "
Ian Ducat , regional secretary of Unison South West , said : " Closing a rehabilitation ward may deliver short term savings , but patients will take longer to recover without the specialist help they need to get back on their feet .
" We understand that times are difficult , but the loss of so many beds will have serious consequences for local people . "
He said pressures on staff to deliver the same level of service would be " enormous " .
People will be able to read the whole manuscript online
The original version of the story of Sir Isaac Newton and the falling apple has been made available online .
Newton recounted the story that inspired his theory of gravitation to scholar William Stukeley .
It then appeared in Stukeley 's 1752 biography , Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton 's Life .
The UK's Royal Society converted the fragile manuscript into an electronic book , which anybody with internet access will now be able to read .
The story of Newton and the apple ... is based on a conversation between Newton and Stukeley
Martin Kemp
Art historian
In the story , Newton claimed to have been inspired by a falling apple in his garden to investigate the theory of gravitation .
Martin Kemp , emeritus professor of the history of art at Oxford University 's Trinity College , UK , said that being able to see the manuscript in its original form , rather than rely on a transcript , was " incredibly valuable to historians " .
" The story of Newton and the apple , which had gradually become debunked over the years .
It is now clear , it is based on a conversation between Newton and Stukeley , " he told BBC News .
" We need n't believe that the apple hit his head , but sitting in the orchard and seeing the apple fall triggered that work .
" It was a chance event that got him engaged with something he might have otherwise have shelved . "
Turn the page The Royal Society has created a " fully interactive " version of the manuscript , enabling people to turn its pages online .
The software allows readers to magnify and rotate pages , and to read commentary on much of the content .
Lord Rees , president of the Royal Society , said this would be as if online viewers were " holding the manuscript in front of them " .
The society will , at the same time , make other treasures from its archive available online .
These include Thomas Paine 's iron bridge design , the philosopher John Locke 's contribution to an early American constitution , and rare natural history illustrations from the 17th through to the 19th Centuries .

A recent article ( link no longer active ) from US News & World Report shed light on an interesting phenomenon occurring in the world of personal finance–a noticable shift in U.S. consumer behavior that prioritizes credit card debt over mortgages .
The statistical shift is significant enough for people to take notice :
“ … the percentage of Americans who were current on their credit cards but behind on their mortgage increased to 6.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009 , up from 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2008 . ”
Bankers are shaking in their boots :
“ Before the housing crisis , bankers typically operated under the assumption that homeowners would do whatever possible to remain current on their mortgage–even if that meant falling behind on other bills … ”
Not the case anymore .
The article cites a number of reasons for this recent phenomenon ; many are deeply rooted in some of the underlying causes of the recession :
People do n’t want to throw good money after bad , continuing to fund assets that are underwater , and were often purchased with little or no equity .
Credit is being used to flexibly finance everyday expenses when there ’s a cash shortage , something a house ca n’t do .
For a home , the time between a late payment and final foreclosure can stretch out over more than a year , providing a much - needed stop to most families ’ largest expense .
On the other hand , falling behind on credit cards results in a quick lock or closure of the account .
That ’s a good start , but I wanted to dig deeper .
I have a few more potential reasons for this phenomenon , as well as some curious observations about the whole thing :
Foreclosure is no longer shameful .
It used to be that you were looked down on if you somehow overreached in your home purchase and ended up losing everything .
Simply running a mortgage calculator is a great start , but is no longer sufficient on its own as a way of determining affordability .
Now , I bet every one of us knows at least one person going through the foreclosure experience .
It makes it very real and very serious , but it also brings a spirit of camaraderie to people that are going through it .
And from my own experience , many even wear it as a “ badge of honor . ”
Banks are being demonized .
Political discussion aside , it ’s pretty clear that many people hold the banks at least as equally at fault as the homeowners who overreached .
The result is a “ stick it to them ” attitude , whereby people are simply sick of not only throwing in money to a dead asset , but doing so to a financial institution that they despise .
Credit cards are giving people a sense of self - worth , where there is none .
Many people still find comfort and a sense of accomplishment in being able to buy things , even if that ’s no longer luxuries , but only groceries for the family .
When it seems like everything else is crumbling down , this can feel so uplifting and even powerful .
It ’s very easy to fall into the trap of swiping a credit card and getting that ego boost .
People still view credit cards as necessities .
Even the article I mentioned has this view ( or more specifically –a quote ) , but I believe that ’s not the case .
Many personal finance bloggers have shown easy work - arounds to the most commonly cited “ needs ” for credit cards .
Many have also closed all of their credit accounts for good .
Unfortunately , when the public still views plastic as a must - have , they will be more willing to do everything to keep it .
It ’s clear that people still look out for # 1 .
We can talk about ethics , “ doing the right thing , ” the public good , and all of that all day long .
But it ’s clear to me that when push comes to shove , in times of real financial stress or desperation , people are going to look out for no one else but # 1 .
Given a choice between two or more financial options , they will pick the one that benefits them the most , even if it means screwing someone else .
Now , that really scares bankers .
And it ’s unfortunate for those of us who will be looking to buy in the next few years … but it ’s only human nature .
What would I do in that situation ?
It ’s tough to say–given my thoughts on the subject , I would probably try to keep the house first and worry about rebuilding my credit later .
But there are so many nuances to each situation …
Balance , one of my favorite financial principles , hardly applies in this case – you can’t really pay half of your mortgage and credit card bills if that ’s all the money you have .
What do you think ?
Do you see other potential reasons for this trend ?
Do you know someone who ’s had to face the choice ?
What do you think you would do given an ultimatum between one or the other ?

Israeli goods made in the West Bank will not benefit from trade privileges
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Israeli goods made in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank cannot be considered Israeli .
This means goods made by Israelis or Jews in the West Bank cannot benefit from a trade deal giving Israel preferential access to EU markets .
EU import duties on Israeli goods from the settlements may now be imposed , making them less competitive .
Jewish settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law .
The EU has agreements with both Israel and the Palestinians that end customs duties .
Israeli companies based around settlements manufacture a host of products including confectionery , wine , cosmetics and computer equipment .
Some of the companies employ Palestinian workers , who are restricted from working in Israel .
Palestinians have long argued that Israeli goods made in settlements should not receive trade privileges , as settlements are not part of Israel .
Pro-Palestinian campaigners have also regularly protested that European supermarkets stock goods with Israeli labels on farm products from the West Bank .
German dispute
The ruling on Thursday by the EU court in Luxembourg stems from a case brought by the German drinks company Brita .
It imports products from an Israeli company based in Mishor Adumin in the West Bank and was refused preferential trade treatment by the German customs authorities .
On appeal , a German court asked the European Court of Justice for its decision .
European Court of Justice rulings are binding on member states .
The decision reflects what has been the general policy of the EU on the issue .
In December the UK government said that food labels would distinguish between goods from Palestinians in the occupied territories and produce from Israeli settlements .
Israel has yet to formally comment on the court ruling .
" The European Union takes the view that products obtained in locations which have been placed under Israeli administration since 1967 do not qualify for the preferential treatment provided for under [ the EC - Israel Agreement ] , " the judges said .
" As it is , despite a specific request from the German authorities , the Israeli authorities did not reply to the question whether the products had been manufactured in Israeli - occupied settlements in Palestinian territory .
" The Court notes in this respect that , under the EC - Israel Agreement , the Israeli authorities are obliged to provide sufficient information to enable the real origin of products to be determined . "
The following are excerpts from a show in which a toddler is taught to recite the Koran .
The show aired on Al - Nas TV on January 1 , 2010 .
Host :
We have a special show today .
We have with us a father , who taught his daughter to read the book of Allah properly , according to rules of Koranic recitation .
No one could imagine that any child of that age could do this .
Let 's meet this father , who should be a role model for Muslim fathers in the Islamic world .
Welcome , sheik .
Father : May Allah bless you .
Host :
What is your name ?
Father : Bahaa Ahmad Badr Al - Najjar .
Host : Welcome , Bahaa Ahmad Badr Al - Najjar .
Father : God bless you .
Host :
This is your daughter ...
Father : Yes .
Host :
What 's her name ?
Father : Duaa .
Host :
Does she know how to say her name ?
Father : Say your name , Duaa .
Toddler mumbles something
Host : Nobody can hear you .
What 's your name ?
Toddler : Duaa Ahmad Badr Al - Najjar .
Host : Al - Najjar ?
Toddler : Yes .
Host : May God bless you , and you too , sheik .
Tell us about the beginning of this successful journey .
Father :
We began by teaching her how to read from the Koran .
We taught her how to recite the Koran in its entirety .
We began teaching her when she was 2 years and 4 months old .
With the grace of Allah , we finished within 5 - 6 months .
[...]
With the grace of Allah , Duaa was blessed with an extraordinary memory , and her grasp is better than that of the rest of our kids .
With the grace of Allah , all our children got the hang of it , but nobody reached the level of Duaa , despite her young age .
[...]
Host : Sister Duaa ...
Father :
Now recite for us , and then you can do what you want , okay ?
Host : This is Surat Al - Taubah .
I opened the Koran at a random page .
We will start at the top of the page .
Come on , read .
This is page 189 .
Toddler : " Fight them .
Allah will torture them at your hands , and will bring disgrace upon them and will grant you victory ... ”
Host : Allah will grant you victory ...
Father : Read from here .
From this line .
Toddler : I want one [ candy ] first .
Father : Come on , Duaa .
Toddler :
Where did you put the lollipop ?
Father : First , let 's read .
Host : Allah will grant you victory ...
Toddler : " ... Allah will grant you victory over them , and will heal the hearts of the believers . "
Father : Come on , complete it .
Toddler : I want my candy .
Father :
After you finish , I will ask you about the rules of recitation , and that 's it .
Host : Let 's open another chapter .
Just this line .
From here ...
Father : Read this , and then I will ask you about the rules of recitation , and that 's it .
Toddler starts to cry
Host :
She is affected by the Koran .
Toddler : Do n't ask me about the rules .
Host : Okay , we wo n't ask you about the rules of recitation .
Toddler : “ Whoso bringeth a good deed will have better than its worth , and they shall be secure from terror on that Day . ”
Host :
Well done !
God bless you .
Father : Read another line .
Toddler : No .
Show Host : Enough .
[...]
Today , she is three years old .
If her father and mother continue on the same path , by the age of five or six she will have completed the Koran with all the rules of recitation and pronunciation .
She will move from one story to another , as we 've seen her doing .
Such a thing can only occur in the Islamic nation .
We have never heard of a non-Muslim child who memorized their holy books and religions , like Muslim children memorize the Koran at such an early age .
[...]
How about reciting ... another verse ?
Toddler recites , unintelligible
Host :
Take it out , so that people can hear you .
Father : Come on , continue .
Host : No , no .
Above that .
Do n't go down .
Toddler : Daddy , enough .
Father :
One line more .
Host : Okay , enough .
Let 's go to another page .
Toddler : No .
[...]
I want another candy .
Father : Okay , I will give you another lollipop .
Host : Finish this one , and I will give you another one .
God bless you , sheik .
[...]
Just one more , and you can go ...
Toddler : Enough , enough ...
Eric Cantor accuses Democrats of ' fanning flames ' on member threats
Updated 6:05 p.m.
By Ben Pershing
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) angrily lashed out at Democratic leaders for their handling of reported threats against members of Congress Thursday , accusing them of " dangerously fanning the flames " by blaming the GOP and confiding that he has also been the recipient of threats .
Concerns about security for members of Congress burst into the spotlight this week after several lawmakers reported death threats or incidents of vandalism directed at them and their offices because of their support for the health - care overhaul legislation .
Some Democrats have suggested that Republicans may have encouraged such behavior by acting rowdily during the weekend House debate on the reform bill .
Cantor , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) all addressed the issue of member threats in separate press conferences Thursday .
But while the other two leaders avoided accusing the other party of exploiting the topic , Cantor was forceful in attacking Democrats .
" Let me be clear -- I do not condone violence , " Cantor said at the start of his press event .
" There are no leaders in this building , no rank and file members in this building , that condone violence , period . "
Then he contrasted his own actions with those of Democrats who have been harassed :
" I 've received threats since I assumed elected office , not only because of my position but also because I'm Jewish .
I 've never blamed anyone in this body for that , period .
Any suggestion that a leader in this body would incite threats or acts against other members is akin to saying that I would endanger myself , my wife or my children .
Just recently I have been directly threatened .
A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week , and I 've received threatening e-mails .
But I will not release them , because I believe such actions will only encourage more to be sent , " he said .
Cantor provided no further details about the shooting during his press event .
The Richmond Police Department said in a press release Thursday that it " is investigating an act of vandalism at the Reagan Building , 25 E. Main St. , Richmond , Virginia .
A first floor window was struck by a bullet at approximately 1 a.m. on Tuesday , March 23 .
The building , which has several tenants including an office used by Congressman Eric Cantor , was unoccupied at the time .
A preliminary investigation shows that a bullet was fired into the air and struck the window in a downward direction , landing on the floor about a foot from the window .
The round struck with enough force to break the windowpane but did not penetrate the window blinds .
There was no other damage to the room , which is used occasionally for meetings by the congressman . "
Currently there are no suspects in the case , and it is unclear whether the bullet was targeted at the office or simply landed there at random .
In his comment about not publicizing threats , Cantor appeared to be taking a shot at Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) who has publicly released some of the threatening messages he has received since he cut a deal on abortion funding in the reform bill with the White House and Democratic leaders .
Stupak 's messages were also forwarded to reporters by the Democratic National Committee .
" I want to stress this , and it 's very important : Legitimate threats should be treated as security issues , " Cantor said .
" And they should be dealt with by the appropriate law enforcement officials .
It is reckless to use these incidents as media vehicles for political gain .
That is why I have deep concerns that some -- DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen and DNC Chairman Tim Kaine in particular -- are dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon .
Security threats against members of Congress is not a partisan issue , and they should not be treated that way .
To use such threats as political weapons is reprehensible . "
Cantor concluded by saying that issuing press releases and releasing threatening messages " can easily fan the flames " and lead to more threats .
" Enough is enough , It has to stop , " Cantor said .
After leveling serious accusations against Democratic leaders , Cantor left the press conference without taking any questions from reporters .
DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said Cantor 's accusations were off the mark .
" We disagree with the charge made by Rep. Cantor today that Democrats are using acts of violence for political gain , " Woodhouse said .
" Let 's be clear : Calling on Republican leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate .
Instead of distracting from the issue with more attacks , we would again ask Mr. Cantor and other Republicans , as we did yesterday , to join Chairman Kaine in working to ratchet down the rhetoric , condemn deplorable behavior and find ways to disagree on these issues without the charged rhetoric that we 've been hearing from Republican leaders . "
Doug Thornell , a spokesman for Van Hollen , suggested that Cantor was blaming others rather than acting responsibly as a leader .
" Today , Mr. Cantor had the opportunity to join Mr. Van Hollen in calling for restraint , " Thornell said .
" Instead , he chose to use his press conference to level false accusations .
This is straight out of the Republicans ' political playbook of deflecting responsibility and distracting attention away from a serious issue . "
Appearing on MSNBC Wednesday , Van Hollen said Republicans leaders " are pouring more and more gasoline on flames " and that a Republican leader needed to make clear that " this is unacceptable . "
Kaine , meanwhile , alleged Wednesday that " Republican leaders are themselves engaging in actions and rhetoric that previously would have been limited to fringe elements of the Republican Party . "
In emphasizing that no GOP leader had condoned violence , Cantor may have been referencing the case of Rep. Steve Driehaus ( D - Ohio ) , who complained to Boehner after the top GOP leader said in an interview with National Review that Driehaus would be " a dead man " if he voted for the health bill .
In his own press conference Thursday , Boehner complained , " No one saw this quote of mine in this publication until Mr. Driehaus and others made a public issue of it . "
Boehner did make a point of condemning the threats : " I know many Americans are angry over this health care bill ... but as I 've said before , violence and threats are unacceptable .
They have no place in a political debate .
We need to take that anger and channel it into what I would describe as positive change . "
Boehner declined to address a question about whether it was appropriate for Republican members to hold signs off a Capitol balcony saying " Kill the Bill " -- Boehner said he had n't seen the signs , though they were widely reported .
But he did say " there was a lot of activity on the floor over the last several months that I would describe as unacceptable .
And it 's happened on both sides of the political aisle .
That 's why the speaker and I talked about it yesterday .
... We ought to be respectful of each other . "
Pelosi , for her part , took pains not to tar all of the health bill 's opponents with the actions of an extreme few .
" All who participate in our freedom of expression should not be painted with the same brush , " Pelosi said , later adding that she did not blame any Republican members for provoking the threats .
" I do n't subscribe to the fact that these acts of violence sprang from any words of my colleagues , " she said .
Asked to react to the reports of member threats , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday , " Look , I think as strongly as your beliefs are held in a country as free as America , we ought to be able to have a debate that is done in a way that 's civil without any threat of violence .
We 've done that for a good portion of our country 's history .
And I think there 's absolutely no reason to believe that we can't debate big issues that people are passionate about but leave any threat of violence out of those passionate discussions . "

Chances are you ’ve never heard of a challenge coin unless you ’re in the services or the military .
The metal tokens are a simple mark of service or achievement .
They commemorate everything from membership in a particular unit to service in a certain conflict .
Think of them as Trophies you can earn in real life .
Here ’s what they usually look like in their military form :
( Image credit : Image credit . )
However , this is what happens when video games get hold of them :
( Image credit : Image credit )
The chunky medallions have an unclear history , with origins that vary from a specially minted bonus payment given to Roman legionaries , or a simple present given by a World War 1 lieutenant to his men , that later helped a downed pilot prove he was n’t a spy and avoid a firing squad .
Over the years they 've been increasingly co-opted to commemorate everything from special anniversaries to products and companies .
And that includes video games .
They usually come with games bought on military bases or exchanges ( generally accessible by active / former service members , or their families ) .
And , like the more serious official versions , these are basically a thank you for putting your life at risk .
Check out this gallery :
Obviously their limited availability and apparent value - soldiers earn them in the service of their country - mean they quickly become collectors items .
Ebay is littered with listings , and prices vary wildly .
Stuff like Skyrim and Fallout 4 can still hit $ 50 - 60 dollars , while Dishonored 2 is currently available for $ 15 ( I suspect the games with a more military feel command higher prices ) .
However , while collectors might want to round them up , some see the coins in general as overused .
While the more ‘ serious ’ service - focused and commemorative ones used to have a more meaningful value , films , TV shows , manufacturers and , obviously , video games have diluted their appeal for some : “ Challenge coins used to be cool , and some smaller military communities still value them .
They get passed out like candy , and any person who 's been in the military for a little while generally has a box full of them , no wonder most people do n't give a crap about them , ” says one commenter in response to a post discussing the rewards .
That ’s not always the case though .
One navy officer with 20 years of service told me , “ Just remember that you are reading the vocal minority ” as far those opinions go .
With the official coins he explains that , “ you can buy a lot of those coins at the exchange , or in my case , ship 's stores .
There are some coins that are only given out and can't be bought .
If you ever meet secdef [ the secretary of defense ] or the CNO [ Chief of Naval Operations ] or someone like that , they 'll typically give out a few coins . ”
The video game versions , on the other hand , might not be issued for service , achievements or meetings - you basically buy them - but that actually means they can be harder to get than the ones you earn .
“ I 've only gotten one challenge coin by buying Destiny at the Navy exchange .
They 're not given to us and are rarely available , ” explains the Navy officer .
“ The game ones are usually attached to the physical copy of the game for sale .
I 've seen a handful with major AAA releases , but not very often . ”
It ’s that scarcity that , to the right people , makes them all the more interesting .
“ In regards to gaming challenge coins , personally , I 'd think they'd be highly collectible , ” my Navy source explains .
“ I 'd love to have them for my favorite games .
If they 're included in a collector 's edition ( maybe for an extra $ 5 ) , I 'd be all in . ”
As it is these coins are more randomly acquired : “ they 're just taped to the game packages on select titles .
Wish I could find them more often . ”
These video game challenge coins tread a strange middle ground between collectors ’ items and rewards for life risking work .
Merchandise you can buy , sure , but only if you serve your country in the military or other services .
An odd recompense for putting yourself in danger but it means that while people who are n’t in the armed forces or services might be able to drop a few dollars on eBay to buy one , we ’ll never really earn them .
There is a universal Masonic requirement of belief in Deity , which is followed by all regular Grand Lodges of the world .
As Entered Apprentices , receiving Light for the first time , Masons are cautioned that no Atheist may be made a Mason .
Therefore , as soon as we become Entered Apprentices , we are warned not to submit known Atheists for candidacy for the Degrees .
Upon being raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason , Brethren are later reminded not to proffer Atheists for membership as one group in a list of people whom may never be made Masons .
As Macoy puts it , “ Freemasonry accepts the idea of God , as a supreme fact , and bars its gates with inflexible sternness against those who deny his existence ” ( p. 156 ) .
Atheism , long the taboo of the Western World , makes up a surprisingly large percentage of the population of the United States .
Nearly 30,000 Americans in 2001 identified themselves as being “ Secular , ” being “ Atheist , ” or having “ No Religion ” ( United States Census Bureau , Table 73 ) .
Although there is no place for Atheists in the Craft , there has been little to no reason ever given for the exclusion of such a large group of men .
The following paragraphs will discuss the history of God in Masonry and give a detailed look at precedents and current trends which make the Lodge an inhospitable place for those who do not acknowledge the supremacy of Deity .
To begin , we must leave aside all Divine aspects of Masonry for a moment and focus on other core Masonic principles , namely the duties of brotherly love , relief , and truth .
It becomes apparent upon brief introspection that those who disbelieve in the Grand Architect are fully capable of performing these duties .
A close friend of the author ’s from childhood is one of the most kind , generous , and honest people he has ever known .
Indeed , he would make a good member of the Craft if he was not an Atheist .
In spite of many discussions about the existence of a Supreme Being over the years , he has come to his own conclusion that there is no Supreme Being ; the author therefore cannot ever recommend this man for the Degrees of Freemasonry , though he may otherwise be a good candidate .
There has been little non-prejudiced , reasoned discussion explaining why this gentleman cannot be admitted — many of the arguments are clouded in rhetoric , unacceptably biased , or not argued through the use of reason .
This paper will take a new look at why Masons exclude Atheists from their ranks and then explain why they should continue to do so .
Previous authors who have set out to discuss the topic of Atheism and Masonry have come to one of only a few conclusions .
Either Atheists are incapable of following Moral Law and can therefore not be counted among the Craft , or Atheists , because they do not believe in God or Divine Retribution , are somehow beneath us .
Both of these perspectives are outdated and prejudicial .
Yet for some reason , the bulk of the literature written over the last century or more points to one or both of these perspectives .
The Morality Argument
The first conclusion is that Atheists are incapable of following God ’s Moral Law , and they are therefore incapable of meeting on the Square .
The most often - quoted example of this comes from James Anderson in his Constitutions of Free - Masons ( p. 50 ) : “ A Maſon is oblig ’d , by his Tenure , to obey the moral Law ; and if he rightly underſtands the Art , he will never be a ſtupid Atheiſt , nor an irregular Libertine . ”
Can Atheists follow moral law ?
Again , from an areligious perspective , an Atheist can hold the same values that a non-Atheist holds , but for different reasons .
A religious man may hold moral law to be a sacred or divine teaching , whereas a man without religion may believe that “ doing good ” is beneficial to himself and all of humanity , though not link it to God .
Therefore , Atheists are capable of reaching the same end , that of acting uprightly , though they may have used different means to arrive at their conclusion .
If Atheists can practice brotherly love , relief , and truth , then why deny them admittance to our Order ?
Paton ( p.154 ) suggests that the Atheist “… acknowledges no relation to God which should lead to fear , or hope , or love , or obedience .
To him , as to the most absolute speculative atheist , the moral law is nothing . ”
Paton suggests that following moral law is but a whim , a fleet of fancy which may be turned upon because a man who does not fear God has no reason to remain moral .
Perhaps the best example of this philosophy was given by Albert Pike ( ch. 23 ) :
The intellect of the Atheist would find matter everywhere ; but no Causing and Providing Mind : his moral sense would find no Equitable Will , no Beauty of Moral Excellence , no Conscience enacting justice into the unchanging law of right , no spiritual Order or spiritual Providence , but only material Fate and Chance .
His affections would find only finite things to love ; and to them the dead who were loved and who died yesterday , are like the rainbow that yesterday evening lived a moment and then passed away .
His soul , flying through the vast Inane , and feeling the darkness with its wings , seeking the Soul of all , which at once is Reason , Conscience , and the Heart of all that is , would find no God , but a universe all disorder ; no Infinite , no Reason , no Conscience , no Heart , no Soul of things ; nothing to reverence , to esteem , to love , to worship , to trust in ; but only an Ugly Force , alien and foreign to us , that strikes down those we love , and makes us mere worms on the hot sand of the world .
No voice would speak from the Earth to comfort him .
Paton adds the idea that Masons believe in a “ Future State , ” which he defines loosely as rewards and punishments to be given in the next life or in the afterlife .
In this case , Paton makes the point that without a belief in a Supreme Being or the afterlife , there is no immortal consequence to breaking moral law .
This has historically been a key reason for denying Atheists positions in Masonry — they can not be trusted to maintain morality .
Although it is true that Atheists have no belief in immortal consequences , good men tend to be good men ; using this as the only argument to keep Atheists out of Masonry is hardly sufficient .
The other perspective often repeated in Masonic literature dealing with the subject of Atheists is that those who do not believe in a Grand Architect are somehow baser than those of us who do believe .
The effect of allowing Atheists entry into Masonry would be to lessen confidence and weaken friendship , and no obligation would be regarded as binding among men …
Mankind would give way to the most unrestrained , cruel , and base passions of their worst natures .
The very foundations of good order would be subverted , and society would soon degenerate into a state of anarchy .
( Ernst , p. 69 - 70 )
This is an even more prejudiced view than the view that Atheists cannot be trusted to uphold moral law , though there are connections between them .
Anderson ’s reference to Atheists as “ stupid ” ( meaning base , not of lower intelligence ) , implies the belief that non-believers are less of men .
This , in addition to the aforementioned arguments , makes up the bulk of the arguments opposing the Atheist ’s admission to the Lodge .
From the Historical Perspective
In the time since most of the above - cited works were written , we as a secular , Western society have moved beyond the name - calling and prejudices that plagued our forefathers .
Indeed , the forbearers of our Craft did not always require religion in their ritual .
Prior to the establishment of modern Freemasonry , when our predecessors still hewed stone and built magnificent cathedrals , religion may not have always played a part in meetings .
There is no denying that Masons as early as c.1430 were required to be Christian .
Surviving fifteenth century records indicate that there were religious overtones in Masonry this early as c.1430 , when the document now known as the Regius MS was written ( Waite , p. 3 - 4 ) .
And though there was a requirement that Masons at this time “ lift up their hearts to Christ ” ( Waite , p. 4 ) , it was not until three centuries later that there was an absolute requirement that Christianity had to be professed ( Coil , p. 515 ) .
Early on , therefore , it was certainly preferred that members of the Craft be Christian and God-fearing .
From a historical standpoint , however , how much was the Christian requirement simply based on the power and control exercised by the Church during the late Middle Ages ?
Given the nature of European feudal society , especially on the British Isles and in France , Church officials held most power in most places , and they held in their hands the “ only ” way to worship .
In the Regius MS , Masons were required to “ assist at Holy Mass with becoming reverence . ”
Since the primary buildings constructed by stone masons at the time were cathedrals , or places of Christian worship , there was likely some degree of religious oversight of the process by a Church official .
Though they may not have been given the operative secrets of the guild ( therefore making the Catholic Church distrust the Masons as an organization in later centuries ) , it is not an unreasonable assumption that the edicts requiring Christian faith may have come — either directly or indirectly — from the clergy .
Indeed , in the era of the Masonic Guild , it is clear historically that there was often a blurring of lines between Church and Lodge .
The Comacine order , the early forbearer of later guilds of masonry , for example , was known to admit priests as members .
Masonic
Monks were not uncommon , and there were such monks associated with the Comacine body ; so that qualified architects were easily found in the ranks of religious orders .
( Scott , p. 160 ) Belief in God has clearly been at the core of Masonry since its inception .
Given the obvious historic influence of the Church on what was to become Speculative Freemasonry , ritual and belief system within the Lodge was “ erected to God . ”
No room for Atheists was left ; this was likely done on purpose , at least early on , through the influence of the monk - architects .
This , however , was likely not a sinister act .
After all , “ A Freemason in the year 1200 A.D. … thought of himself as a Catholic , [ but ] it did not occur to him to think of his art or craft as having anything to do with Catholicism ” ( Haywood , p. 122 ) .
Nonetheless , the required belief in Deity became a core tenet of the fledgling guild during that era .
Beyond the Historical Perspective Until this point , this paper has dealt with Masonry from a historical perspective .
Various opinions of prominent Masonic authors from the last three centuries were discussed , and a brief history of the inclusion of God as a part of Masonic teaching has been laid out .
However , none of the theory or philosophy thus far presented has gotten to the heart of the issue : why ca n’t Atheists be admitted to Lodges today ?
Answers of “ that ’s the way it has always been ” have been proffered ( see , for example , Lippincott & Johnson , p. 84 ) .
However , this excuse is on its surface weak .
There was a time when only men of sound body were admitted ; several Grand Lodges , including the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia , have begun admitting men with physical deformities ( see , for example , Hoenes , p. 6 - 7 ) .
Other changes have been made over time ; admitting Atheists would only be a modernizing adaptation .
Other answers to this question have been dealt with above .
Though some may find solace in these answers , others may find them to be excuses based on prejudice and fear .
The remainder of this paper will attempt to discuss , why , in the culturally accepting 21st century , there is still no room for Atheists in Masonry .
In the end , the origins of religiosity in Masonry are not as important today to the argument of admitting Atheists as the role of the Mystic Tye .
The prime reason for continuing to deny Atheists admittance into our Brotherhood is the presence of God and religion throughout Masonic beliefs , as noted before .
By itself , the ritual we practice has overtones of the Grand Architect .
These rituals would make Atheists ( a ) uncomfortable given their individual beliefs and ( b ) unable to understand the nuances of Masonry , given the absolute importance Masons put on their faith to God .
Beyond ritual , the myths and legends that make Masonry what it is today are inherently religious .
Was Freemasonry only a society of fraternity , with no religious component , such as a Moose Club , or a charity - only organization , such as Rotary International , these stringent requirements regarding an individual ’s beliefs would not be as important .
Our Fraternity , however , is one with religious components .
One needs look no further than the Ritual presented to a Candidate during the First Degree .
A candidate is asked in whom he puts his trust and is required to give an answer which acknowledges a belief in Deity .
He is told that since his trust is in God , he is sound in faith in the Great Architect .
In other words , to proceed past the first moments in the Lodge , one must affirm his faith in Deity .
Naturally , such a display would be difficult for someone who does not hold a belief in the Supreme Architect of the Universe .
One might assume that an Atheist , not being tied to his morality , would lie ( as has been suggested by some ) ; but to what end ?
What would an Atheist see in an open lodge that would interest him ?
As the ritual stands , an incredible number of references are made to the Volume of Sacred Law , to God , and of our submission to Him .
An Atheist in such surroundings would likely feel uncomfortable .
Nor should we change our Craft and the beliefs of our Order ; to do so would be to destroy the heart and soul of the Fraternity .
The foundation of Masonry , that which supports us and holds us together , is the shared belief in the existence of Deity :
Other foundation there is none ; upon God Masonry builds its temple of Brotherly Love , Relief , and Truth … God is the first Fact and the final Reality — the Truth that makes all other truth true ; the corner stone of faith , the keystone of thought , the capstone of home … Everything in Masonry has reference to God , implies God , speaks of God , points and leads to God .
Not a degree , not a symbol , not an obligation , not a lecture , not a charge but finds its meaning and derives its beauty from God , the Great Architect , in whose Temple all Masons are workmen .
( Newton , p. 58- 60 )
In reality , therefore , Masonry is necessarily theistic .
There is no part of Masonry which does not call upon the Great Architect , in whose presence we conduct our meetings .
If an Atheist were to join the Craft , he would find that he would be not be able to fully understand even part of the esoteric mysteries which bind Masons together .
Looking no farther than the lecture and charge given to new brethren upon being initiated into our Craft , it is clear that the firm belief in God is required to understand the nuances of these lessons . [ ii ]
Take , for example , the significance of something as simple as the white leather apron : as an “ emblem of innocence , ” the white leather apron ’s purpose is to symbolize right and proper behavior is the path to the Celestial Temple above ( Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia [ hereafter GLDC ] , p. 179-180 ) .
Furthermore , the significance of Jacob ’s Ladder , key instruments thereof being Faith , Hope , and Charity , shows that proper reverence must be given to Deity .
Finally , an Atheist would likely be put off by the discussion of the perfect Ashlar and Trestle Board :
By the rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature ; by the perfect ashlar , of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education , our own endeavors and the blessing of God ; and by the Trestle Board we are also reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle Board , so should we , both operative and speculative , endeavor to erect our spiritual building in accordance with the rules laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Books of nature and revelation , which are our spiritual , moral and Masonic Trestle Board .
( p. 183 ) What does it mean to “ erect our spiritual building in accordance with the rules laid down by the Supreme Architect ” ?
One interpretation is that our “ spiritual buildings ” are our individual souls — the essential parts of ourselves , which will inevitably be brought to the World Hereafter ( what Paton called the “ Future State ” ) .
We therefore instruct our new initiates to stand tall before God , marking our lives against those laws
He has set down for us , in our Volumes of Sacred Law and in our hearts as Brothers formed in His image .
To “ erect ” our souls is to stand upright and to act nobly in our lives , especially in service to Deity .
It is therefore impossible to allow Atheists to join order because they are incapable of measuring themselves against the will of God , to whom Masons all must show reverence .
Though an Atheist may be a good man in the traditional sense of the word , as someone who acts nobly and charitably towards his fellow man , he is missing a vital component of Masonry : reverence to God .
It is only through God that a man may be a Mason , for it is only through appropriate “ reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator ” ( GLDC , p. 187 ) that a man can be an appropriate candidate .

The premise of Imax : Hubble 3D is simple : Make home movies in space .
And what beautiful movies they are .
The stunning space vistas and intimate moments with astronauts make for a fascinating flash of interstellar eye candy .
The images were captured in 2009 when the space shuttle Atlantis crew left Earth to repair the Hubble Space Telescope .
The astronauts — Commander Scott Atman , pilot Gregory Johnson and mission specialists John Grunsfeld , Mike Massimino , Megan McArthur , Andrew Feustel and Michael Good — brought an Imax 3 - D camera on board to document the trip .
At the time , filmgoers ’ expectations of what 3 - D movies can deliver had yet to be transformed by the dazzling look of stunners like Coraline , Avatar and Alice in Wonderland .
But now people are pulling out their wallets and paying a little extra to don 3 - D glasses and immerse themselves in wild worlds they never thought possible .
Hubble 3D ‘s breathtaking visuals just happen to be based in reality .
The 3 - D technology amplifies the beauty of the already captivating images captured by the space telescope .
Immersive and engaging , the movie , which opened Friday , is far more of an experience than anything else .
Writer / director Toni Myers sets up the film in three ways .
First , narrator Leonardo DiCaprio provides
Hubble history and his best , “ Are we the only ones out there ? ” questioning .
Second , the crew ’s trials and ultimate success are captured .
Finally , the audience is taken on a moving journey through the cosmos with images from Hubble ’s data .
It ’s in these space - travel sequences that the film truly impresses and provides a childlike sense of wonderment .
The natural phenomena captured in these moving images are billions of miles — light - years upon light - years — away from Earth .
Upon pulling away from the stars , we see 3 - D galaxies interwoven with one another like a web .
It is a testament to Hubble ’s importance and contribution to how we see space .
Probably the movie ’s biggest failing is its scant 45 - minute running time , but it ’s hard to criticize Hubble 3D ‘s brevity , simply due to real - world constraints .
The film is shorter than you ’d like it to be in large part due to Imax ’s desire to log as many museum screenings as possible , but also because you can only carry so much film into space .
Plus , these documentarians are n’t filmmakers :
They ’re astronauts and they had a job to do .
If anything is missing from the film , it ’s more time with the Atlantis crew .
We see the mission .
We get what they ’re doing .
However , we never really get to know any of them , aside from witnessing some of their quirky antics .
The trip was the first space flight for some members of the crew .
I wanted to know what it was like for them : I wanted to know how they felt seeing Earth from 350 miles above for the first time .
Just because Hubble 3D shows space in the most realistic way yet does n’t mean I ’ve actually seen it .
I wanted to know what it felt like for those who had .
Despite this criticism , the film is a success in capturing and presenting beautifully rendered images from the outer reaches of the universe .

Much of the record breaking loss of ice in the Arctic ocean in recent years is down to the region 's swirling winds and is not a direct result of global warming , a new study reveals .
Ice blown out of the region by Arctic winds can explain around one - third of the steep downward trend in sea ice extent in the region since 1979 , the scientists say .
The study does not question that global warming is also melting ice in the Arctic , but it could raise doubts about high - profile claims that the region has passed a climate " tipping point " that could see ice loss sharply accelerate in coming years .
The new findings also help to explain the massive loss of Arctic ice seen in the summers of 2007 - 08 , which prompted suggestions that the summertime Arctic Ocean could be ice - free withing a decade .
About half of the variation in maximum ice loss each September is down to changes in wind patterns , the study says .
Masayo Ogi , a scientist with the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology in Yokohama , and her colleagues , looked at records of how winds have behaved across the Arctic since satellite measurements of ice extent there began in 1979 .
They found that changes in wind patterns , such as summertime winds that blow clockwise around the Beaufort Sea , seemed to coincide with years where sea ice loss was highest .
Writing in a paper to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , the scientists suggest these winds have blown large amounts of Arctic ice south through the Fram Strait , which passes between Greenland and the Norwegian islands of Svalbard , and leads to the warmer waters of the north Atlantic .
These winds have increased recently , which could help explain the apparent acceleration in ice loss .
" Wind - induced , year - to - year differences in the rate of flow of ice toward and through Fram Strait play an important role in modulating September sea ice extent on a year - to - year basis , " the scientists say .
" A trend toward an increased wind - induced rate of flow has contributed to the decline in the areal coverage of Arctic summer sea ice . "
Ogi said this was the first time the Arctic winds have been analysed in such a way .
" Both winter and summer winds could blow ice out of the Arctic [ through ] the Fram Strait during 1979 - 2009 , " she said .
A number of other factors were also responsible for ice loss , including warming of the air and ocean , she added .
According to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado , Arctic sea ice " is in a state of ongoing decline " .
Since 1979 , the ice has shrunk by about 10 % a decade , or 28,000 square miles each year .
The ice reaches its minimum extent each September , when it begins to reform as the freezing Arctic winter takes hold .

So far , 32 motorists have received warning tickets for talking on a cell phone while driving in Dubuque .
The city passed an ordinance that took effect Friday , outlawing the use of a cell phone held up to the ear or texting while driving .
Dubuque Police Lieutenant Scott Baxter says officers will issue warning tickets for the first 30 days of the ban .
“ After March 19 , the officers still have discretion in terms of issuing a written citation , a written warning or a verbal warning , ” Baxter said .
“ It ’ll be up to each independent officer to make that decision . ”
Dubuque is the first municipality in Iowa to enanct a distracted driving ordinance .
The measure still allows drivers to use hands - free devices .
After March 19 , motorists who violate the ordinance could face a hefty fine .
Violating the ban costs $ 50 and the fine jumps to $ 250 if the driver is involved in a crash .
Baxter says Dubuque residents have a wide range of opinions about the new ordinance .
“ Some are totally in support , some are totally against it and some are somewhere in between – they want to ban just the texting and not the cell phone talking , ” Baxter said .
“ Obvioulsy , everyone is entitled to their own opinion but our main goal is to keep the roads safe . ”
The Iowa House today is expected to debate a bill that would ban texting while driving .
Baxter says a statewide law would take precedent over the city ’s ordinance .
The internet will potentially lose one of its main sources of bestiality videos under a ban approved by the upper house of the Dutch Parliament .
The new law bans human sex with animals , including in private situations where the animals are not injured , a summary of the law posted on the upper chamber 's website said .
Sex with animals had been legal in the Netherlands , as long as it could be proven the animals were not injured .
The law also prohibits the production or distribution of animal pornography .
Given the illicit nature of the product , precise figures on animal pornography video sales are difficult to find .
The Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad found in a 2007 survey that distributors in the Netherlands were responsible for some 80 per cent of bestiality videos worldwide .
The bill was introduced in April 2007 and passed the lower house in July 2008 , but took time to make its way through the upper house to final approval .
It was not immediately clear how soon the law would go into effect .

In an announcement given to a " bunch of penguins " , from the bowels of their Antarctic fortress , the worlds sickest band , the mighty GWAR , has announced the continuation of their 25th Anniversary with a public event of colossal proportion -- The Crack - a- Thon !
" We are trying to raise money for the kids ... not just muscular dystrophy , but retards as well , all kinds of fucked - up freaks , " said Oderus .
The event will kickoff on April 10th , 2010 at the notorious MF Gallery in Brooklyn , NY .
The weeklong debauchery will be broadcast live on the World Wide Web , and anybody with internet access will be able to view the gala event free of charge .
Viewers will be able to pledge funds via a website , ( To be announced later - check www.MFgallery.net for details . ) as powerful computers illegally drain your bank account .
Rumors that any money raised will actually be used to pay off Oderus 's crack debt were immediately confirmed .
Gwar frontmonster Oderus Urungus - coincidentally both vegan and from Brooklyn - will be performing in Texas and throwing a huge crack - a- thon in April to raise money to pay off existing crack debts and ideally begin new ones .
He speaks now over the shrieks of tormented slaves .
You can catch Gwar even sooner if you happen to be in Austin this Saturday ( March 20th ) evening as they headline day two of the annual unofficial SXSW party WXTX ( formerly known as Mess With Texas ) .
We asked Oderus a few questions about all of the above , his appearances on Fox , and more ...
---
What kind of refreshments will you be serving at the opening reception for your crack benefit ?
Oderus :
Well , crack , of course .
And malt liquor .
This might be taking place in an art gallery , but this ain't no wine - and - cheese party .
These people are gonna be smoking CRACK .
I wo n't be smoking crack - I will be eating crack .
continued below ....
What 's the best thing about crack ?
A lot of people ask me that question .
What 's not to like about it ?
Everything about is so great .
It does n't really get me high anymore .
I just need it to crawl out of the coffin in the morning .
I do n't really know or care what money is .
I wipe my ass with hundred dollar bills .
But fucking Sleazy P. Martini wants money , so basically I 'm desperately trying to get out of debt to him .
And I also wanted to use the opportunity to make fun of Jerry Lewis .
Just because he 's a fat fuck , and I 'm sick of all the muscular dystrophy kids getting all the money .
There 's lots of retards out there , and for our benefit we are lying and saying it's for all kinds of fucked - up kids , but really it 's for my fucking insane crack habit .
He did make probably the best Holocaust clown movie of all time .
He is a pretty interesting example of the human species .
He 's partially cybernetic .
He 's got like weird machine parts stuck in him up that he charges up .
He 's one of those Hollywood celebrities that you have to wonder if he 's really from this planet .
There 's a lot of scumdogs who 've gone missing through time and we do n't really know what happened to them , and it is very possible that he might have been from outer space originally .
As he gets past 90 or 100 and he 's still doing these fucking muscular dystrophy telethons , I think the truth will be coming out .
Are there any other celebrities you wanna haul out of the scumcloset ?
Rush Limbaugh is actually a scumdog , but we 're very ashamed of it .
Why ?
He 's high all the time .
But he 's a Republican conservative fuck .
What 's it say about America that FOX News is the only place Gwar can get a fair shake ?
That 's pretty weird .
A lot of people are like , ' They 're the most conservative network out there blah - blah - blah . '
But the only reason they 're the most conservative is George Bush was in office for the last eight years and it was good for ratings .
It 's pretty trendy now to hate Obama , so they 're still riding that wave - kind of reminds me of when Jimmy Carter was in office , and they made life so miserable for him that he basically gave up totally .
Yeah , it 's very odd - but FOX brought us The Simpsons , so is it really so strange ?
Is n't FOX News ' slogan the same as Gwar's ?
' America Must Be Destroyed '?
On the down - low , that 's what it is and it 's getting more and more popular all the time , and as usual Gwar was fucking light years ahead of everybody else .
John Mayer got a lot of press for talking about his dick recently .
As someone who has talked about his dick for years , do you feel you 've been unfairly denied credit ?
Oh , constantly .
Gwar is snubbed on so many levels and it all comes down to penis envy .
You see the regurgitating Cuttlefish of Cthulhu dripping syphilitic pus-people are jealous .
' God , where can I get a cock like that ? '
And they go to Gwar shows and they rub pus all over their genitals , and they might get something growing out of their dick slit but they 're not gonna get any bigger .
People are just jealous of my massive cock - what can I say ?
And I have three testicles - the size of bowling balls .
That 's pretty heavy .
Do they each do a different flavor ?
It 's all scumdog flavor , but it can go anything from pineapple to squirrel vomit .
Just like a Slurpee .
Another example of how Gwar has affected society !
We 're the trendsetters .
But we never get credit for it .
But that 's OK .
Is ' Brooklyn Vegan ' the most repulsive possible phrase in the English language to Gwar ?
Yeah , but I figure if I can be on FOX News , then Brooklyn Vegan is OK , too .
Do you think performing in an art gallery is emasculating ?
We 're gonna just go for it .
Nobody will give Gwar their own TV show , so we 're just gonna do it ourselves .
The people at MF Gallery let us do all kinds of horrible things in there , and they 're all over it .
This is very exciting for us because when people see us all over the web and see how great we are in the variety - show setting , it wo n't be long til we have our own network .
And if they wo n't give us one , well , that 's what the fucking world wide web is for .
We 'll just do it ourselves .
How soon until you are pumping Gwar sperm directly into fetal minds ?
We have pretty much spread our seed through the entire gene pool .
I do n't even physically have to rape a human in order for my degenerative pus sac to have influence on how you people breed .
You do n't even need to get my sperm on you .
If you SEE my sperm , you can get pregnant .
And you do n't even have to be female .
It 's weird .
Your eyes turn into wombs and you birth these eel - like creatures out of your pupils .
Look around at the way people are - you can just see Gwar 's had an influence .
We 've been on planet alive now for 25 years .
The heavily - hooved footprint of Gwar is bloody obvious , and everyone 's gonna continue to deny it .
But we are the creators of the human race .
We fucked apes and then you were born .
It 's Gwar 's gene pool but we 're just swimming in it ?
Exactly .
We wanna get the mutation pool rolling along .
People with two arms and two legs - that 's fine .
But we want wings , we want hooves , we want multiple turnip penises ... in the slam pit of a Gwar show , you never know what 's gonna happen , but one thing is for sure - you 're gonna get pregnant .
What can the average Brooklyn vegan do at home to help ?
Since probably eating meat is out , I would practice blowjob techniques on distended dead cow udders .
They say New York is the city with everything , so I 'm sure somewhere in that town you can find a store - a boutique , if you will - that sells nothing but distended dead cow udders .
You 're playing a parking lot in Texas for SXSW - does that make you miss Hell ?
Hell - after we killed Jewcifer - it became pretty goddamn boring .
It 's a sad state of affairs when planet Earth is even more fucked - up than Hell .
Can you say for a fact that Texas is worse than Hell ?
Without a doubt .
I 'd say the entire United States .
And you can keep going south into Mexico .
Since Gwar knocked down the portal , the whole gate to Hell has been open , and the creatures from Hell come forth unto our world .
You do n't have to look around very far to see the influence it 's had .
Just look at people walking down the street .
They 're fucking freaks .
They look like hell .
They look like hell !
How do you feel about Juggalos ?
Proud ?
Paternal ?
I applaud their efforts .
I 've never been a big fan of rap except when it was - you know - good .
But we had a lot in common with them in that we 're the bastard children of the recording industry , and they - much like Gwar - have just done their own thing the whole time .
They 've been completely maligned and ridiculed and hated , but those guys make tons of fucking money and they 're completely fanatically supported by all these freaks , and it's a very strange cultural phenomenon .
And for me to think something is fucking strange - it 's gotta be pretty fucking strange .
It all boiled over when we played The Gathering of the Juggalos last year , and we almost went on tour with ICP this spring ... but they backed out at the last second .
It 's kind of scary playing for them and you look out into the audience and see nothing but a sea of clown faces staring back at you .
That scares me that it scares you .
I was molested by a clown at birth .
I was basically lowered on to an erect clown penis as I was born - anally raped by a midget clown .
His penis was like four times bigger than the rest of his body , and it was the weirdest thing - on his dickhead which plunged into my heaving anus , he had painted the face of Marcel Marceau .
Very disturbing .
Did you go to any of those Juggalo seminars ?
They had seminars ?
On how to be a clown ?
I had no idea any of that crap went on whatsoever .
They did n't ask me to speak on a panel , so they really missed the boat on that one .
I saw all kinds of disgusting spectacles , but the funniest thing was a gigantic sewer ... like the Port - A - Potties , and people had been shitting into this giant bladder that eventually filled up and they had to release the gas - like the way a colostomy bag fills up and they have to blow it out now and then ?
They were doing that and right next to where they were doing that was one of these horrible sandwich carts , and these people were standing there as this fecal - flecked cloud of anal vapor just assaulted them - they would not be stopped from getting their cheesesteaks .
I really thought I 'd seen it all til I went to the Gathering of the Juggalos .
That 's one of the most freaky fucked - up events I 've ever experienced in my life .
But I have to applaud their inbreeding tendencies .
Say what you will about them , but they 've created a vital piece of subculture .
You know - I like multi-colored vomit .
One color is no fun .
We need to have chunks , toes , carrots , peanuts - we need all kinds of vomit and we need ICP .
Does this crack benefit mean that the bad economy has finally hit Gwar ?
There are rumors .
I 've heard these fucked - up rumors that the people in Gwar are actually these dedicated artists and musicians who finally after years of searching have found an amazing building and they 're trying to get money together so they can buy an amazing building of their very own and have an incredible production facility that they can be Gwar in for the rest of their lives .
I do n't know where these rumors come from .
Sounds like a fairytale .
Artists ?
Musicians ?
It 's for crack , and hopefully people will open up their hearts and their checkbooks or at least steal their parents ' credit cards so I can pay off the crack debt I have so I can get more .
Thanks for being a good role model .
People can look at me and see what I 'm doing , and as long as they 're doing the absolute opposite , they 're probably OK .

Doll , I ’m pleased to report that Dear Abby has finally taken on an issue of paramount feminist concern :
The etiquette of reacting to the strange man who insists that you smile for him .
Abby , to her credit , suggests that the recipient of the “ smile ! ” command drop the formalities and get the eff away from her harasser .
But not before she engages in some dubious psychoanalysis of the “ Smile , Baby Guy . ”
But first , the letter :
Offended in Gilroy is actually posing two questions here :
Why are these strangers telling me to smile ?
And what should I do about it ?
Interestingly , Abby ’s response to the second question — - get yourself to safety — - contradicts her answer to the first question , which positions the “ Smile , Baby Guy ” as a hapless social misfit , not a harasser .
In Abby ’s view , strangers who demand that women smile are harmless , “ clumsy ” romantics who are just following standard behavior or what “ happens in markets . ”
Interestingly , Abby comes around when she addresses the behavior of the “ older people ” who tell people to smile .
Abby theorizes that harassment from the elderly is born of a sense of entitlement .
Actually , anyone who instructs a stranger to smile does so because they feel entitled to exert their power over another person ’s private emotions .
The fact that these casual , grocery - store power plays disproportionally target youth and women says a lot about how our social hierarchy works — - and the harasser ’s dismissal that it ’s “ only the grocery store ” shows how this sexism is far - reaching enough to be excused as “ normal ” behavior .

Team Russia ’s coach Igor Zakharkin gave a few interviews where he stated that Alexander Ovechkin ( Washington Capitals ) and Evgeni Malkin ( Pittsburgh Penguins ) might play on the same line , and that goalkeepers Evgeny Nabokov ( San Jose Sharks ) and Ilya Bryzgalov ( Phoenix Coyotes ) will both play during the robin- round at the Olympic Games in Vancouver .
Zakharkin on Ovechkin- Malkin to olympics10.ru
– Is there a chance to see Ovechkin and Malkin playing on the same line ?
Zakharkin : “ Maybe not since the very beginning but somewhere in the middle of the game or during power plays .
We will think about it .
We are also taking into account the fact that quite often Ovechkin plays on the left wing for the Capitals . ”
Zakharkin on Nabokov - Bryzgalov to sport-express.ru
– How are you going to share ice time between Nabokov and Bryzgalov ?
Zakharkin : “ We are going to use both Nabokov and Bryzgalov during the round - robin .
But I ca n’t say who ’s going to play in certain games . ”

Described in today 's Wall Street Journal as " an obscure candidate " threatening to force a runoff between Governor Rick Perry and U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for the Republican gubernatorial nomination , Debra Medina sat down briefly with Unfair Park yesterday afternoon as she 's in town for tonight 's Belo debate .
While Medina told us that the Tea Party , which she describes as " a dynamic and fluid grassroots movement , " has given her an audience and contributed to " boots on the ground " for her campaign , she hesitates to point to any one thing that has attributed to her rise in popularity as a relatively unknown former chair of the Wharton County Republican Party .
She does , however , give credit to " the growth and prominence of social media . "
Before she was whisked off to another interview , we asked her to elaborate on her stance that property taxes should be abolished -- that 's right , not cut , abolished .
She points to an April 2009 position paper by the Texas Public Policy Foundation as the foundation for her belief that a revised sales tax is a better option .
Medina says income and property taxes are the biggest drags on the economy , while sales tax has the least effect .
She compares it to putting a heavy load on a mule 's shoulder instead of spreading it across its back .
And because Texas taxes only about half of the 168 items that other states do , she says there 's a lot of room to broaden the base .
" For me , it 's not about just the fiscal idea , " she says .
" It really is about understanding that it 's an essential element of freedom .
That 's why you have to do it , but freedom and prosperity walk hand in hand .
When you do things that give people more freedom , you see that the whole society will be more prosperous . "
Is n't the scary part about that , though , is that it 's less predictable what people are going to spend money on , whereas people have to pay their property taxes ?
" But it gives us the real accountability that we need out of government , " she says .
" That 's why we 're hurting so bad right now . "
The company selling the software used by a Pennsylvania school district to allegedly spy on its students blasted what it called laptop theft - recovery " vigilantism " today .
Absolute Software said it dissuades users of theft - recovery software from acting on their own .
" We discourage any customer from taking theft recovery into their own hands , " said Stephen Midgley , the company 's head of marketing , in an interview Monday .
" That 's best left in the hands of professionals . "
Midgley confirmed that Lower Merion School District of Ardmore , Pa. was running Absolute Manage , formerly known as LANRev , which Absolute Software acquired last December .
The suburban Philadelphia school district purchased and deployed LANRev prior to Absolute 's acquisition , he said , noting that most school districts buy the software for power management features that let IT staff remotely power down systems .
Calling LANRev a " legacy " product , Midgley also said that Absolute would ship an update in the next several weeks that will permanently disable Theft Track , the name of the feature that lets administrators switch on a laptop 's camera to take photographs of a potential thief after the computer is reported stolen .
" It really does n't serve any purpose , " said Midgley of Theft Track .
Last week , Michael and Holly Robbins of Penn Valley , Pa. , on behalf of their 16 - year - old son Blake , sued Lower Merion , accusing it of spying on students and students ' families using the iSight webcams in the MacBook laptops issued to each high school student in the district .
According to the original complaint , Blake Robbins was accused by a Harriton High School assistant principal of " improper behavior in his home " and shown a photograph taken by his laptop as evidence .
In an appearance on CBS 's Early Show Saturday Edition Robbins said he was accused by the assistant principal of selling drugs and taking pills , but he claimed the pictures taken by his MacBook 's camera showed him eating candy .
Since the Robbins family filed their lawsuit last week , Lower Merion has announced it has disabled the camera activation feature , denied that it turned on the cameras for any reason other than to track lost or stolen laptops , and promised to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation .
In a follow - up motion last Friday , the Robbins asked U.S. District Court Judge Jan DuBois to issue a restraining order blocking the school district from activating the webcams , functionality the motion labeled " peeping tom technology . "
Absolute Software is probably best known for its LoJack for Laptops , a consumer - grade notebook recovery service , but it also sells the Computrace line to businesses and organizations .
All its theft - recovery software relies on a different model than the former LANRev , said Midgley .
" We give no theft recovery tools to our [ LoJack and Computrace ] customers , " he said .
" The only truly proven model is a managed service model . "
To kick off the recovery of a stolen or lost laptop , customers first must file a police report -- not a requirement of LANRev -- and only then contact Absolute , which in turn tracks the location of the missing machine via its IP address when the system goes online .
Absolute employs a team of former law enforcement professionals who reach out to local police , provide them with the location information and then get out of the way .
" We take the responsibility out of the hand of the end user , " said Midgley , " and do the work for them . "
Absolute claims that it recovers about 75 % of all laptops reported stolen .
According to Lower Merion 's superintendent , the district has switched on the camera of a lost or stolen MacBook 42 times thus far this school year , and found 18 , for a recovery rate of 43 % .
Any other approach to theft recovery is a waste of time and a potential minefield , said Midgley .
" It just gets into potential vigilantism .
Even if you are able to locate the laptop on your own , what do you do then ? " he asked .
The idea that police would be able , or willing , to follow up on individuals ' reports that they had located their laptop is unsupportable .
" Someone says , ' I think my laptop is here , ' but that could just send the police on a wild goose chase . "
Lower Merion School District spokesman Doug Young confirmed that the district uses LANRev .
Absolute 's Midgley declined to speculate about whether his company might be liable to legal action for LANRev 's part in the alleged spying on students , but put the responsibility solely on the school district .
" The customer acted on their own to do what they did , " he said .

Hamilton ’s renaissance is surely good news .
Our economy is growing larger , more diverse , with new job opportunities and unemployment rates below the provincial average .
Hamilton continues a streak of annual billion - dollar building permit totals .
Property values are rising , especially in and around the downtown core .
Culturally , the city has a new energy and dynamism .
He takes his time to enjoy the meal .
Apparently they eat just about anything , lol .

Philip Pullman , addressing an audience at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford , was asked about whether his latest book , The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ , was offensive .
Here 's his reply :
" It was a shocking thing to say and I knew it was a shocking thing to say .
But no one has the right to live without being shocked .
No one has the right to spend their life without being offended .
Nobody has to read this book .
Nobody has to pick it up .
Nobody has to open it .
And if you open it and read it , you do n't have to like it .
And if you read it and you dislike it , you do n't have to remain silent about it .
You can write to me , you can complain about it , you can write to the publisher , you can write to the papers , you can write your own book .
You can do all those things , but there your rights stop .
No one has the right to stop me writing this book .
No one has the right to stop it being published , or bought , or sold or read .
That 's all I have to say on that subject . "

Companies are buying back their shares again
This week ’s Economist mentioned that Companies are buying lots of their own shares again :
“ Although companies collectively were the biggest net buyers of shares before the financial crisis , buy - backs fell by the wayside when the markets froze in 2008 and firms began clinging to any cash they did not urgently need to spend .
Sooner than might have been expected , however , companies have regained confidence in their financial health . ”
This reminds me of what Smithers and Wright had to say in their book Valuing Wall Street :
“ household and overseas investors have increasingly , and sensibly , been net sellers of stocks … corporations have simultaneously switched to being net buyers , despite the fact that , in order to do so , they have had to raise additional , and far from cheap , financing .
If this seems more than slightly crazy , it is …
The fact that it has been allowed to happen may well appear , after the greatest bubble of the twentieth century has broken , to have been one of the greatest follies of the twentieth century . ”
Remember , they were talking about about the last bubble that ended in 2000 , not the current one .
The likely source for The Economist article is the latest U.S. Flow of Funds Accounts , which do indeed confirm ( in table “ F.213 Corporate Equities ” ) that after a brief lull last year , nonfinancial corporate purchases of equities are back up again to levels somewhat below their peak in 2007 , and significantly higher than those Smithers and Wright were complaining about ten years ago .
The Economist ’s explanation for what ’s going on is not terribly optimistic :
“ In practice , buy - backs tend to occur when firms lack other sensible uses for their cash .
So their reappearance may mean that firms are pessimistic about the broader economic outlook . ”
In other words , rising stock markets are just another sign of our current malaise .

For the longest time operating systems have been able to handle swap .
In short swap extends physical memory with slow diskspace so that applications can use more memory than there is available .
On most unix systems the swap is in a dedicated partition because that has the lowest overhead .
Plus you do n't risk running out of diskspace when you want to swap , so things are quite predictable and nice .
Linux has a very nice knob you can turn to affect the swap policy .
It will not avoid swapping ( in some situations you will have to ) , but it will affect how and when swap is used .
That knob is / proc / sys / vm / swappiness .
The kernel default is a value of 60 .
The value can be between 0 and 100 and is effectively a percentage .
It is used roughly in the following way :
If all available memory is exhausted ( application memory , buffers and filesystem cache ) and any memory allocation is requested the kernel needs to free a few pages of memory .
It can either swap out application memory or drop some filesystem cache .
The " swappiness " knob affects the probability which one is chosen .
This means that at a swappiness of 0 the kernel will try to never swap out a process , and at 100 it will try to always swap out processes and keep the filesystem cache intact .
So with the default , if you use more than ca. 40 % of your memory for applications and the rest is used as filesystem cache it will already start swapping a bit .
The hilarious result is that you may up swapping a lot with lots of memory left - think of a machine with 64GB RAM !
If you try to use 32G memory you 'll be in swap hell .
That default might have been good with machines with less than 256MB RAM , but with current desktops and servers it is usually not optimal .
Now you might be tempted to tune it down to 0 .
Avoid swap .
Swap is slow .
All is good ?
Not quite .
At 0 your machine will try to avoid swapping until the last moment .
Then it will have killed all filesystem cache ( so every file operation will hit the disks ) and in addition to that you start swapping like a madman .
The result is usually a " swap storm " that hits very sudden .
At the point where you might need some performance your machine does n't provide it and might just be unresponsive to your input for a few minutes .
The other end ( a value near 100 ) might make sense for a file server , but then it might be cheaper to just not run extra services on a machine that is very loaded already .
I do n't really see a usecase for a swappiness of 100 except maybe on machines that are very memory - limited .
On my desktop I 've found a swappiness of 10 - 20 to be the sweet spot .
This means that when 80 % + of memory is used by applications the machine will start swapping , but it 's a more gradual hit and not an instant kill .
And because there 's still some filesystem cache the responsiveness for starting new processes ( like a login shell ; ) ) is still high enough to allow recovery from this pessimal system state .
Still your goal for optimal performance should be to avoid swapping .
Disk access is slower than RAM by a factor of 1000 or more !
I 've seen servers achieve roughly double the throughput with the right swappiness value - it can avoid an expensive hardware upgrade .
Of course that 's not all the tuning advice I have , so if you wish to discuss that feel free to send me a mail and maybe I can prove to you that Gentoo is the fastest penguin out there ... Maybe I should discuss the OOM killer too - most people have seen it , but few know who it is and why he goes killing processes .
For those who have been struggling to get their CD heard — even though it is going to totally revolutionize music , man , because it ’s totally like if Pavement and Radiohead got together — there is both good and bad news .
The good news is that your local Best Buy will be willing to stock that CD .
The bad news is that it requires a $ 250 non-refundable upfront fee .
Oh , and your band will have to use Best Buy ’s preferred vendor , J Distribution ’s RegionalCD.net .
The hits keep coming , too .
Every additional release requires another $ 100 fee , and to set the CD up for iTunes requires an additional $ 50 per release .
But there is pay !
An amazing $ 5.15 per CD sold !
Unless it ’s an EP , in which case it ’s $ 3.65 per CD sold .
So , for the first LP , a band will need to sell 49 CDs to make a profit , and an additional 20 for each CD after that .
EPs will require 69 sales for the initial payback and 28 for each subsequent release .
So , if getting into Best Buy is the only thing between your band and greatness , fork over the cash and hope that the record industry is n’t as dead as Brian Eno thinks it is .
A note about pricing in the 500 Series Database LunchBox
Hero does not sell products at this time - pricing is for comparisons only .
We want the pricing to be fair , but this can be very difficult , especially for a product base that spans multiple countries , currencies and developers - ranging from major audio manufacturers to boutique designers building stuff in their lab .
At this time , product prices listed are Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price ( MSRP ) in US dollars .
Since pricing is very competitive , you would rarely pay this price , but instead would pay the Minimum Advertised Price ( MAP ) or even lower .
To further complicate matters , exchange rates may mean higher prices for some European products sold to the US market because of the current weakness of the US dollar .
Finally , for some products there is no difference between the MSRP and the MAP .
So ...
Please use the listed pricing for comparisons , knowing that even this is not totally accurate .
As reliable MAP data becomes available , we will change the column to reflect the MAP for each product .
We are in the process of surveying manufacturers to get this information .

While some other bloggers and journalists insist that recent winter snows are proof of global warming effects , they miss the fact that models have been predicting less snow in the norther hemisphere .
See this 2005 peer reviewed paper :
It says exactly the opposite of what some are saying now .
– Anthony
=====================================
Guest post by Steven Goddard
A 2005 Columbia University study titled “ WILL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT SNOW COVER OVER NORTH AMERICA ? ” ran nine climate models used by the IPCC , and all nine predicted that North American winter snow cover would decline significantly , starting in about 1990 .
In this study , current and future decadal trends in winter North American SCE ( NA - SCE ) are investigated , using nine general circulation models ( GCMs ) of the global atmosphere - ocean system participating in the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ( IPCC - AR4 ) …
all nine models exhibit a clear and statistically significant decreasing trend in 21st century NA - SCE
Some of the models predicted a significant decline in winter snow cover between 1990 and 2010 .
Climate Model predictions of Snow Cover Decline
As we know , winter snow cover has actually increased about 5 % since it bottomed in 1989 , and is now close to a record maximum .
Below is another interesting graph .
It shows the number of top 100 snow extent weeks by decade .
I took the top 100 weekly snow extents ( out of 2227 ) from the Rutgers record and sorted them by decade .
The past decade has been at least as snowy as the 1970s .
The past decade has had the most weeks in the top 100 since 1966 .
NASA Earth Observatory Images
Above are images from NASA showing snow extent from 2001 to 2004 .
Below is an image from 2010 , showing snow cover in all 48 states .

========================
UPDATE : Here is a new graph of north American winter trend produced by Steve at the request of commenters :
So far , the climate models have the wrong polarity on their predictions of winter snow cover changes .

Some protesters held a rally outside the Iranian embassy in London Britain has been given a warning by Iran 's foreign minister that it will " get slapped in the mouth " if it does not " stop the nonsense " .
Manouchehr Mottaki responded after UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband hailed the " great courage " of Iranians who staged opposition protests on Sunday .
Iran says the clashes , which resulted in at least eight people being killed , were inspired and aided by the West .
The UK ambassador is being summoned by Iran to receive a formal complaint .
Mr Mottaki said the protesters " should not be encouraged by a few ... statements by certain countries " .
He added : " They should not pin their hopes on them .
Britain will get slapped in the mouth if it does not stop its nonsense . "
Mr Mottaki 's speech was broadcast on Iranian television with an English translation on screen .
" The lowly and downgrading remarks by some foreign officials show the black stain on their record in their ... contradictory interactions . "
The tragic deaths of protesters in Iran are yet another reminder of how the Iranian regime deals with protest
David Miliband , Foreign Minister Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said that " some Western countries are supporting this sort of activities " and that this was " intervention in our internal affairs " .
He said that , as a result , the British ambassador was to be summoned on Tuesday and a formal complaint would be made .
Mr Miliband condemned the lack of restraint by Iranian security forces , saying that reports emerging from the capital were " disturbing " .
" The tragic deaths of protesters in Iran are yet another reminder of how the Iranian regime deals with protest , " he said .
" Ordinary Iranian citizens are determined to exercise their right to have their voices heard .
They are showing great courage .
" I call on the Iranian government to respect the human rights of its own citizens - rights which Iran has promised to respect . "

A decade ago , New York City officials were so reluctant to give out food stamps , they made people register one day and return the next just to get an application .
The welfare commissioner said the program caused dependency and the poor were “ better off ” without it .
Now the city urges the needy to seek aid ( in languages from Albanian to Yiddish ) .
Neighborhood groups recruit clients at churches and grocery stores , with materials that all but proclaim a civic duty to apply  to “ help New York farmers , grocers , and businesses . ”
There is even a program on Rikers Island to enroll inmates leaving the jail .
“ Applying for food stamps is easier than ever , ” city posters say .
The same is true nationwide .
After a U - turn in the politics of poverty , food stamps , a program once scorned as “ welfare , ” enjoys broad new support .
Following deep cuts in the 1990s , Congress reversed course to expand eligibility , cut red tape and burnish the program ’s image , with a special effort to enroll the working poor .
These changes , combined with soaring unemployment , have pushed enrollment to record highs , with one in eight Americans now getting aid .
“ I ’ve seen a remarkable shift , ” said Senator Richard G. Lugar , an Indiana Republican and prominent food stamp supporter .
“ People now see that it ’s necessary to have a strong food stamp program . ”
ANCHORAGE , Alaska , Jan 20 ( Reuters ) - Environmental and Alaska Native groups have filed a legal challenge seeking to overturn U.S. approval of Royal Dutch Shell Plc's RDSa .
L plans to drill up to three wells this year off the shore of Alaska , representatives said on Wednesday .
Late on Tuesday , the coalition of groups filed its challenge to drilling in the remote Chukchi Sea .
The petition in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seeks to void the U.S. Minerals Management Service ’s Dec. 7 approval of Shell ’s plan for wells about 60 miles off Alaska ’s northwestern coast .
The challenge is similar to one the same groups filed last month seeking to overturn MMS approval of Shell ’s plan to drill a pair of wells in federal waters of the Beaufort Sea .
In their Chukchi challenge , the groups say the MMS failed to properly consider the hazards posed by drilling in the remote sea area .
The sector is believed to hold high oil and gas potential but has been explored only lightly .
The petitioners said Chukchi drilling poses risks of oil spills and other pollution ; noise that would disturb marine mammals such as walruses ; and other hazards in a sensitive region already under stress because of climate change .
“ It is a major industrial undertaking in a big , poorly understood and changing ocean , ” said Michael LeVine , senior counsel for Oceana , one of the environmental groups participating in the challenge .
The combination of Beaufort and Chukchi drill plans adds to the risks , he said .
A Shell spokesman defended the MMS approval decision .
“ It ’s our belief the MMS was thorough in its technical and environmental evaluation of our 2010 Exploration Plan and that Shell has demonstrated its ability to operate in the Arctic in an environmentally responsible manner , ” Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said in a statement .
“ A tremendous amount of work went into writing and evaluating this permit and we fully expect the MMS to be successful in defending its approval . ”
Smith said “ Shell has already completed four years of successful seismic and shallow hazard work in the Chukchi Sea - an area that could be home to some of the most prolific , undiscovered hydrocarbon basins in the U.S. ”
The Chukchi , between northwest Alaska and northeastern Siberia , is believed to hold 15 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , according to MMS estimates .
But only five exploration wells have ever been drilled there .
Shell ’s Beaufort plan proposes two wells this year at a prospect located about 16 miles off Alaska ’s northern coast .
In both the Beaufort and the Chukchi , Shell plans to drill during summer and fall open - water season in the normally ice - covered region , using the same drill ship , ice breakers and support vessels for both ventures .
Shell spent about $ 84 million in 2005 and 2007 acquiring leases in the Beaufort , and in 2008 put up $ 2.1 billion to acquire exploration rights in the Chukchi .
That Chukchi lease sale drew $ 2.66 billion in high bids from several oil companies , a record dollar amount for any Alaska oil and gas auction .
ConocoPhillips COP.N , which hopes to launch a drilling program in the Chukchi in 2012 , spent over $ 500,000 acquiring leases there .
Other oil companies that acquired leases in the 2008 sale are Repsol , Statoil and Eni . ( Reporting by Yereth Rosen ; Editing by David Gregorio )
Lt Col Fehrenbach has been an air force pilot for 18 years
After the top US military commander , Adm Mike Mullen , tells senators it is right to lift a ban on openly gay personnel , Air Force pilot Lt Col Victor Fehrenbach - who is currently in the process of being discharged for being gay - tells BBC News what reversing the ban would mean to him .
In May of 2008 , my world ended .
For 17 years , I had served my country in the Air Force honourably .
I had deployed overseas five times and participated in seven major combat operations .
I had been highly decorated and had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel .
In addition , I had abided by the military 's corrupt , senseless " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
I played by the rules .
I kept my private life very private even from my family .
All that came to an end when I was " outed " by a third party and reported to my military superiors .
When you discharge people with critical combat skills ... this law harms our overall national security
In September of 2008 , I received notification that I was going to be discharged for being gay .
In April of 2009 , I faced a military discharge " board " ( a modern - day witch trial ) that recommended me for an honourable discharge and came to a baseless conclusion that my continued service was " detrimental to good order , discipline , and morale " .
After that year - long nightmare , I had nothing else to lose - they had taken my job , my livelihood , my career , my pension , my life as I knew it - but I came to the conclusion that they could never take away my honour and my sense of right and wrong .
With that , I decided to come forward and speak out in the media .
I felt that telling my story might have a positive impact and help change this law .
In all this time , even after I came out publicly in the national media , I have continued to serve in the Air Force , in the same job , in the same squadron , as an openly gay man - with no negative impact on good order , discipline , and morale .
Nearly one year later , in his State of the Union Address , President Barack Obama reaffirmed his promise to end this discriminatory policy in 2010 .
Over the course of these months , heating up in recent weeks , I have heard proponents of this policy put forth one simple argument , with absolutely zero justification based on facts , data , scientific study , nor reason of any kind .
One of their arguments is that " it 's working , it 's successful " .
Another is a stall tactic : " This is not the time , while we are in the middle of two wars . "
Neither of these arguments is based in fact .
LT COL FEHRENBACH'S SERVICE
Decorated with nine medals for distinguished service in flight Decorated for heroism the night US forces captured Baghdad International Airport in 2003 Flew F - 15E jets I can show how this law is unconstitutional - constitutional rights of privacy , due process and equal protection are violated in almost every case .
I can show how this law is blatant discrimination .
I can show how this law negatively affects the combat effectiveness of a military unit .
More importantly , I can show that , when you discharge people with critical combat skills , 13,500 times over , during two wars , to the tune of billions and billions of dollars in training and replacement costs , this law harms our overall national security .
Finally , I can show how this law goes against every value and principle that this great nation was founded on , that it compromises the integrity and honour not just of the individuals who are forced to serve under it but of the military institution as a whole .
" Do n't ask , do n't tell " is wrong - plain and simple .
I agree with President Obama , Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm Mullen .
I support their calls for repeal and I agree that it is simply " the right thing to do " .
After the Senate hearings , I have never been so proud to wear my uniform .
I am proud to serve with Adm Mullen and I am proud to serve under his command .
Today represents a small step on a long journey to justice and equality but it is still a historic step nonetheless .
I am optimistic .
I look forward to putting my uniform on tomorrow and in days to come .

The object of this desirable item has melted away , but the news itself is still hot and provocative .
After Rahway , N.J. , police received an anonymous complaint about " a naked snow woman , " the artistic family behind a front - yard tribute to Venus de Milo says an officer paid a visit and told them to cover up their Greek goddess of love and beauty .
The story attracted local attention this week and then popped up on the international radar .
" We had a visit from the local police who told us that a neighbor had complained about the statue and we needed to cover it up or knock it down , " Elisa Gonzalez , who sculpted Venus with her daughter and son , told Agence France - Presse .
" We did n't want to have any problem with the police so we covered it up . "
She did say the unidentified officer complimented her .
" He said , ' It 's very good . ' "
Gonzalez outfitted Venus with a green bikini top and blue sarong .
" I thought she looked more objectified and sexualized after you put the bikini on , " she told the Newark Star - Ledger .
Her 21 - year - old daughter , Marie Conneran , said it was art , not pornography .
She and her mother compared it to Attorney General John Ashcroft 's move to drape a semi-nude statue of the Spirit of Justice when he arrived to lead the U.S. Justice Department .
" It looks like marble .
It looks like a statue , " Conneran said .
" Are you going to go to the ( Metropolitan Museum of Art ) and cover up all the statues ? "
As temperatures rose , the zaftig sculpture 's curves melted , and down she went Monday .
It 's not clear what Gonzalez might have been charged with for her art crime had she not complied , but New Jersey ( like most states ) has laws against indecent exposure and lewd conduct .
Keep reading for information about those statutes ( which apparently apply to statues ) .
BTW , the famous semi-nude marble Venus de Milo — aka Aphrodite of Milo — resides in the Louvre , sans arms but very much with a head .
Lewd conduct and indecent exposure are two different terms for the same criminal offense in New Jersey .
The definition of a lewd act is the exposing of the genitals for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person .
A person is guilty of lewd conduct - indecent exposure in New Jersey if he commits any of the following three actions .
1 . Any flagrantly lewd and offensive act which he knows or reasonably expects is likely to be observed by other non-consenting persons who would be affronted or alarmed … ( will result in a Disorderly Person 's Offense )
2. Exposes his intimate parts for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person under circumstances where the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by a child who is less than 13 years of age where the actor is at least four years older than the child … ( will result in a Fourth Degree Crime )
3 . Exposes his intimate parts for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person under circumstances where the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed by a person who because of mental disease or defect is unable to understand the sexual nature of the actor 's conduct … ( will result in a Fourth Degree Crime )
Lewd conduct penalties
Disorderly person 's offense carries the following penalties if a conviction results :
• Up to 6 months in prison
• $ 1,000 in fines
Fourth - degree crime carries the following penalties if a conviction results :
• Up to 18 months in prison
• $ 10,000 in fines
Thirty - four years ago , Oran Canfield 's father Jack , a man who would go on to become the hugely successful author of the US self - help book Chicken Soup for the Soul , left his pregnant wife and one - year - old son , and moved in with a masseuse .
Judging by what is happening on a Berlin stage right now , it is probably safe to suggest that Oran has yet to entirely forgive him .
It is some time past midnight at a venue called West Germany in a particularly gritty part of the city , and Canfield 's band Child Abuse are halfway through a set one can only describe as pure noise terrorism .
They 've already played the songs " Wrong Hole " and " Preemptive Priapism " , and are now on to " I Hate Me " , a deeply unpleasant mess of satanic howl and jarring keyboard jabs , while Canfield pounds away tirelessly on his drums .
A crowd of maybe 60 watch with clear bemusement and , in some cases , incipient horror .
By most measures , Child Abuse make horrid music , though deliberately it would seem , for Canfield is n't the only one with issues : singer Luke Calzonetti was a model , but after turning 30 , the bookings dried up .
Consequently , he is not a contented man , gurning as he screams into the microphone and regales the crowd with a list of people he loathes .
At the moment , he tells us , he particularly hates the Bavarian police ( for matters undisclosed ) , London 's Time Out magazine ( for daring to suggest that Child Abuse made for an unpleasant band name ) , and Mark , whom they met a couple of nights ago in the Czech Republic .
" Asshole , " is how he puts it .
The audience does n't quite know what to do with this information – none has ever met Mark from the Czech Republic , after all – and several drift to the bar area in what is perhaps the most dilapidated music venue in all of Europe , a decomposing room beneath some train tracks in which it 's not hard to imagine asbestos falling from what remains of the ceiling tiles .
But the band 's noise follows them , getting progressively louder , a torture of Guantanamo proportions .
Afterwards , Canfield and I go to the only place open around here , a 24 - hour kebab shop .
He orders an open sandwich of chopped meat and diced peppers .
" I guess I 've always been drawn to playing really loud music , " he reasons .
" It 's therapeutic , cathartic .
And I needed the outlet , because I do n't express anger all that well . "
This is n't entirely true , for he has just written a memoir entitled Freefall , in which he details not just his devastating descent into heroin addiction but also the sustained anger he felt for the father who abandoned him , and a mother who he feels was somewhat negligent .
" That 's true , " he concedes , shrugging , " but I still have a lot of ... aggression , I guess you 'd call it .
Banging away at the drums every night helps me release it . "
Kebab finished , he yawns loudly .
Not just because it is late , but because throughout the first two weeks of Child Abuse 's month - long inaugural European tour in support of their imminent second album Cut and Run – the band has hit all the high spots : Ljubljana , Freising , Bydgoszcz – they have had to make do with sleeping in squats and on people 's floors , and have been driving through Arctic conditions in a 20 - year - old van that breaks down daily , and whose heating system does n't work .
Consequently , the poor man is exhausted .
" I 'm 35 years old , " he sighs , rubbing a hand across his face .
" Sometimes I think I may be a little too old for all this . "
The drug confessional has long proved a fertile ground for people – invariably American – to suddenly , and all too keenly , unload their demons in literary form , treating the page much as they would the stage at an AA meeting .
But Oran Canfield 's is far more entertaining than your average heroin memoir .
Though it details his years - long relationship with drugs – he started out on pot before progressing to acid , crack cocaine and heroin – it also recounts what was a bizarre , and at times barely believable , upbringing .
After his father left to reinvent himself as one of America 's foremost motivational speakers , his mother went through some issues of her own – sensitive ones he can no more explain to me now than he could in the book for , he relays with a heavy frown , " legal reasons " – so , as he tells it , he and his younger brother Kyle were offloaded on to a succession of friends and relatives , commune dwellers , libertarian boarding schools and the occasional travelling circus , where a young Oran learnt to juggle while balancing on a unicycle ( he 's won prizes for it ) .
He was introduced to drugs aged 13 by some crazy Mexican cops , and a year later was dropping acid with the daughter of the Grateful Dead 's frontman , Jerry Garcia .
By the time his father had authored several self - help books , all national bestsellers , Canfield was addicted to heroin , ' regularly stealing from his friends to fuel his habit – if only because stealing from friends was easier than asking his estranged father , whom he saw every couple of years , for handouts .
Nevertheless , when things got bad , which they frequently did , that is precisely what he did do .
This prompted new waves of self - loathing , which he dealt with the only way he knew how : by getting high .
Though his family made several attempts at intervention , packing him off to rehabilitation centres ( seven in total ) , he remained as mistrustful of AA as he was of his father 's books , which he considered a scam .
" I have never had any faith in any of that self - help shit , " he deadpans .
But what did he think of his father 's own books , the first of which was dedicated to him ?
" I refused to read them . "
It was only when , as a last resort , he turned to an experimental treatment using a psychedelic drug called ibogaine that he began to see light at the end of the tunnel .
Illegal in the US , he underwent the $ 12,000 treatment at an exclusive retreat in the Bahamas .
In the book , he recounts how it gave him the most vivid nightmares , but also numbed him to the wretched experience of withdrawal .
He flew back to California convinced that drugs were at last behind him ... and the next day promptly shot up again .
This time , however , the heroin did n't have quite the same effect , and would n't again .
Agreeing later to give AA another go , he finally began to win his battle against addiction .
But what really cemented his continued abstinence to this day , he says , was deciding to write a book about it .
" I 'd never written anything before but friends kept telling me to try .
At the time I started seriously thinking about it , I was probably in the darkest period of my life . "
He was 31 , recently clean and relocated to Brooklyn , where he was working as a bike messenger .
" I was living pretty much hand - to - mouth while my dad was this millionaire .
Let 's say I was feeling low .
I needed to do something positive with my life , so I gave the book a go .
Hardest thing I 've ever done , but also the best . "
The morning after the Child Abuse show , I meet Canfield in an upmarket café on the other side of town .
It is a freezing Sunday , and a fresh layer of snow lays on the ground .
He looks cold and still tired , and tells me that he slept badly once again , and that he is feeling ill .
He orders a coffee and a bowl of yoghurt , but what he really craves is a cigarette ; his tobacco pouch sits beside his cutlery on the table in front of him , and he glances at it longingly .
Canfield makes for unexpectedly genial company , a mordantly funny guy with a hangdog expression that makes you sympathise with everything he says .
Despite his age , he still dresses like a teenage slacker , in a jeans , T - shirt and jacket combination that he likely slept in last night and will again tonight .
Our conversation feels awkward at first , and he admits he finds being interviewed slightly unsettling , not least , perhaps , because since his book 's publication in America last autumn , it has had a divisive effect on his family .
Anything he says subsequently can only fuel the fire .
Presumably , Jack Canfield was the one with most to lose here : the first Chicken Soup book , published in 1993 , was followed by many others – Chicken Soup for the Prisoner 's Soul , Chicken Soup for the Volunteer 's Soul , even Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover 's Soul – each filled with stories that extolled the virtues of goodness .
They proved astoundingly successful worldwide : there are now 100 million copies in print , and they have been translated into 54 languages .
So one would imagine his reputation to be somewhat dented when it was revealed that his own family life was riven with problems .
But Canfield insists that his father has actually been supportive , unexpectedly so .
" He has always said that making mistakes is part of being human , so ... "
He smiles wryly .
" So I guess he is human , right ? "
But it must have made for painful reading ?
" It hurt him , of course it did , because I do n't think he ever realised just how bad things got .
But then he was never really part of my life .
Since he has read the book , we have actually started talking a lot more than we ever did .
He even talks about my book at his seminars now . "
Laughing incredulously , he adds : " Hey , it 's great publicity . "
It has n't gone down quite so well with his mother , however .
" Basically , she is not happy with it . "
Why ?
" Well , she does n't remember things in quite the way I do .
And she is unwilling to accept that I may have had a different experience . "
Is she suing him ?
" No , but it 's complicated .
She 's made certain complaints .
There have been letters .
From lawyers . "
His mother – who works in a similar field to that of her former husband and insisted Oran refrain from mentioning her name in his book – recently went public , suggesting that much of Freefall was pure fantasy .
" It is one story after the next , " she said .
" It is false - memory syndrome . "
So which one of them is telling the truth ?
Canfield exhales , and shakes his head sadly .
His fingers reach for his tobacco pouch .
" What can I tell you ?
The book 's all true .
It is . "
He maintains that he does not regret writing it – " it was mine to write " – and that its publication represents a high point in his life .
" In my time , I 've been a visual artist , a musician , a juggler ... but this is the first creative pursuit that has ever generated any money for me .
That 's important . "
And it has made his father proud of him .
" I do n't think my father had any particular expectations of me , but he is glad I 'm doing things I like to do , even if he does n't necessarily get it .
He came to see the band play a few months back .
It was probably the worst thing he had ever heard , but he saw me in my zone , and that was enough for him . "
What did he say to you after the performance ?
" He said to me , ' That was really something , ' and he said it with the kind of enthusiasm to make it seem like a compliment , but it probably was n't .
I can't say I 'm surprised .
I mean , the guy likes Kenny G. "
Breakfast over , we wander out into the snow and back towards the tour van , which he will drive later today on to Hamburg .
Hamburg , he says brightly , promises slightly better weather .
It is currently - 5C in Berlin , but it was even colder in Poland .
" I have n't seen the sun for two weeks , " he laments .
" I miss it . "
Nevertheless , he is enjoying the tour , even if it is n't making him any money , and despite the fact that being on the road is hardly conducive for a former junkie wanting to remain a former junkie .
Every night , he has to watch his two fellow band members getting merry with newly made fans , while he turns down every offer of a drink that comes his way .
" I know I could so easily say yes to a beer , " he points out , " but the trouble with me is that if I have just one beer , I 'll be doing heroin shortly after .
So I ride out the temptation , and then I 'm fine . "
He gives a theatrical cough .
" Well , I say fine , but that 's all relative , is n't it ? "
The most common misconception of the reformed addict , he says , is people believing that , once they have kicked the habit , all is rosy .
" It 's what always happens in drug memoirs , is n't it ?
They stop using eventually , they find God , and it 's happily ever after .
Thing is , it never is , is it ?
Not really .
Right now , that 's what I 'm having trouble coming to terms with : that even though I 'm sober , I 'm simply now in the same headspace as everyone else .
I still get depressed , though the self - loathing is n't quite as bad as it used to be .
And I still have all sorts of issues : with responsibility , with paying the bills , with maintaining a healthy relationship .
It disappoints me that I 'm not better at that .
But then I guess that 's part of my chemistry .
It 's who I am . "
When he turns 40 , Canfield will come into some money – about a quarter of a million dollars – bequeathed to him by his late grandmother .
But until then , he says , he 'll have to continue living the perpetual wolf - at - the - door existence that has come to define him .
" I have about a month 's worth of savings left right now , then it 's back to job - hunting . "
I ask him what he would like , ideally , to do with his life .
" I wish I knew .
My father thinks I should keep up with the writing .
He says I should try fiction next .
I told him I was n't sure I could write fiction , and he says , ' Well , I do n't think your mother would agree with that . ' "
He thrusts his hands deep into his pockets , tucks his chin in to protect his neck from Berlin 's cruel chill , and chuckles drily .
" Hilarious , right ? "
Bringing Lots of Liquids on a Plane at Schiphol
This would worry me , if the liquid ban were n’t already useless .
The reporter found the security flaw in the airport ’s duty - free shopping system .
At Schiphol airport , passengers flying to countries outside the Schengan Agreement Area can buy bottles of alcohol at duty - free shops before going through security .
They are then permitted to take these bottles onto flights , provided that they have the bottles sealed at the shop .
Mr Stegeman bought a bottle , emptied it and refilled it with another liquid .
After that he returned to the same shop and ‘ bought ’ the refilled bottle again .
The shop sealed the bottle in a bag , allowing him to take it with him through security and onto a London - bound flight .
In London , he transferred planes and carried the bottle onto a flight to Washington DC .
The flaw , of course , is the assumption that bottles bought at a duty - free shop actually come from the duty - free shop .
But note that 1 ) it ’s the same airport as underwear bomber , 2 ) reporter is known for trying to defeat airport security , and 3 ) body scanners would have made no difference .

髭の脱毛は、術後どれくらいで効果を実感できますか？
髭の脱毛は多くの人がその効果に懐疑的になります。
もし髭の脱毛を始めるかどうか迷っているなら、まずは脱毛をおこなっているエステサロンやクリニックのホームページを確認しましょう。
特にクリニックのホームページには脱毛の方法や料金、そして施術を受けた人の症例が載っていたりと非常に有用な情報が数多くあります。
☆ Pickup：https://hige-gorilla-datsumo.com/
無料でメールの相談をおこなっているところもありますので、そうしたサービスも活用して判断するとよいでしょう。
ただし、脱毛にはエステサロンでおこなわれてているものとクリニックでおこなわれているものがありますが、この2つは同じではありませんので注意が必要となります。
クリニックで行われているレーザー脱毛についてお話ししましょう。
■施術後2週間が効果実感の目安。
髭の脱毛は施術の仕方によって若干の個人差が出ますが、レーザー脱毛を行なった場合、だいたい1～2週間後には髭がポロポロと抜け始めます。
自然に落ちてくるので、無理に擦ったり抜いたりしないようにしてください。
レーザー照射は毛穴の奥深くにある毛乳頭という部分の働きを鈍くすることで、髭の離脱が促されます。
これを無理に引き抜いたりすると炎症を起こし赤く腫れあがることがあります。
■抜けた周囲の髭が濃く見える現象。
髭の脱毛が始まると、この時点では多くの人が効果を実感することになりますが、それとは逆に、抜けた周囲の髭が異様に目立つようになる現象が起きます。
これはレーザー照射後に、ほんの一定期間だけ髭が濃くなったように見える現象で、実際には濃くなったわけではありません。
毛穴に残存している髭の膨張作用によって、黒く見えてしまう現象です。
数日が経過すると収まります。
■医療脱毛を選択すれば、期間は短く施術時間も大幅に短縮されます。
その一方で術後には多くの現象が起こることもあります。
先にお話しした “ 毛穴から見える髭 ” のほかにも、肌の弱い人は赤い湿疹や水ぶくれのような現象に見舞われることがあります。
そのまま放置しても数日で沈静化するのが大半ですが、気になる方はクリニックに連絡して処置の仕方を聞いておきましょう。
また効果は人それぞれなので、効果実感は術後2週間を超える場合もあります。
Guilt Free Poutine !
Cyclists are always in search of that tricky combination of good AND fast when it comes to topping up our fuel tanks .
If we listed out our most self - satisfying sources of energy , then surely Poutine would be up there near the top of the heap .
Be warned however , that putting Poutine on your regular list of fuel - stops can lead to a slippery slope where the risks start to outweigh the benefits .
In a nutshell , making a habit of such a high - fat fuel will most definitely get your gear all gunky , unless you consider a few preventative maintenance tricks …
It ’s not just WHAT you eat …
But HOW you eat it !
There has been a great deal of study into the “ French Paradox ” which seeks explanations for how a French diet so rich in cholesterol and fats could still produce up to 400 % less nationwide heart disease than comparable populations …
Even with so much more smoking factored in !
It seems that the previous explanations tried to ascribe this to garlic ’s formidable curative powers , and the omega driven benefits off olive oil , but these have since been largely negated .
Also it seems that it ’s not necessarily red wine that offers healthy benefits , but rather moderate alcohol consumption that reduces the incidence of cardio - vascular breakdown .
Yet the French Paradox obviously can’t be explained solely on the basis of alcohol consumption …
So what gives ?
As a Cyclist , you already know the many positive effects of exercise and a well managed state of mind as you move through your day .
Anyone who ’s ever noticed how much more smoothly , quickly , and efficiently we cycle when we ’re in the right headspace can attest to the fact that how we think about our activities , makes an enormous difference on the quality that we derive out of them .
As it turns out , this philosophy is also finding some scientific basis in explaining the French Paradox .
You see , the French do n’t treat eating as a re-fueling exercise , but rather as a form of relaxation and social leisure .
By hormonally signaling our bodies that we are pleased to be eating , and contented by the process , we ’re in fact creating the conditions which allow the “ French Paradox ” to exist .
If you ’re curious about the damaging hormonal conflict that can be created by eating under stress , and the enormous benefits of pleasureful eating , feel free to skim the details here .
Otherwise , I ’m sure we ’ll be revisiting this premise often through the “ Fuel Windows ” here at ThumbShift.com
So in short , not only can you feel good about making poutine a moderate part of your diet , as you exercise your free - will as a Cyclist to get to any number of different purveyors here in the downtown core , but you can also take great pleasure in your indulgence knowing that your mind and body will be optimized to convert your satisfaction into high - octane energy .
Of course , you can add to this peace of mind by assuring that you support local producers , and you ’re leaving absolutely no waste behind that ca n’t be bio-degraded and metabolized right back into the natural environment that it came from to begin with …

One From the History Books
Sometimes you read a story ( casually , not knowing what to expect ) , only to have that story haunt you .
There ’s something at the heart of it that wo n’t let you go .
The story of Henry Brown was one of those for me .
It was in 1849 , in Louisa County Virginia , that Brown did a series of incredible things .
First , he used sulfuric acid to burn his hand , because it was the only way he could get some time off of work ( he used too much , and burned all the way down to the bone ) .

He then climbed into a small box – three feet by two feet , by two and a half feet high – and had his shoemaker friend nail the top shut .
And with only three small holes in the box for air , he sent Brown away by mail .
Brown travelled 350 miles in that box , for 27 hours .
When he finally reached the address in Philadelphia , a group of waiting friends pried the lid open , and Brown could finally escape , a free man .
You wo n’t be surprised to hear it , but this was a horrible way to travel .
Even though Brown had clearly labeled the box , “ this side up with care , ” handlers tossed his box around , and he spent hours of his journey traveling on his head .
At one point , the pressure had built up so much that Brown felt like the blood vessels in his head would burst , and his eyes would literally pop out of their sockets .
He waited silently for the blood to gush out and flow over him .
But as difficult and dangerous as all of this sounds , it was nothing compared to the agony Brown had endured as a slave .
Compared to most slaves , Brown himself acknowledged that he had it “ good ” – a very relative term , of course .
In his 33 years as a slave , he had been whipped just once .
He had enough food to eat , enough clothes to cover him decently , and the work he was given was never too extreme .
But nothing of his was really his own , not even his own person .
As a young boy , his mother would take him on her knee , and with trembling voice and tears rolling down her cheeks , she would point at the forest trees and say , “ my son , as yonder leaves are stripped from off the trees of the forest , so are the children of slaves swept away from them by the hands of cruel tyrants . ”
And when his first master died , Brown and his parents and siblings were divided as property between this master ’s heirs .
They were torn in separate directions , never to see each other again .
Later , when Brown was a young man , he found solace in a fellow slave named Nancy .
Brown fell in love with Nancy , and married her , and had three children with her .
He did everything in his power to keep her nearby .
But Nancy , like Brown , was not her own person .
And one day without warning , Nancy and the kids were all sold off by their owner , and Brown could do nothing except watch as his loved ones were taken from him a second time .
And it was this agony – to have his wife and children stripped mercilessly away from him – that Brown could not endure .
This was the agony that made him burn his hand , and climb into a wooden mailing box , and suffer in mute silence as he travelled , tumbling on his head , so he could be free .
Threads of Injustice
I hesitate to draw parallels between this story of Henry “ Box ” Brown and the story I am about to tell of my own life .
The history of slavery in the US is so dark , and so grim , I can think of few things that compare to that horror .
I guess by those accounts , you could say we ’ve had it good .
“ Good ” is a relative term , of course .
But as I picture my husband sitting – trapped – in an ICE detention center in Aurora , Colorado , 1,200 miles away from where I am with our kids , I ca n’t help but wonder why our country seems so hell - bent on perpetuating those same threads of injustice , so that some form of slavery , some flavor of oppression , will always endure .
My husband , Ibrahim Mohammad , is a political prisoner .
The US government will happily label him a terrorist , an accusation he is entirely innocent of .
But by all accounts ( whether you believe him to be innocent , or guilty of the “ crime ” on official records ) he is meant to be a free man .
I ’ve written about my husband before , at some length , in a story that is in a story that is now a decade long .
After a fruitless FBI raid on our home in 2011 which turned up no evidence , after my husband then cooperated with the FBI in answering any and all questions on two occasions , after four years of radio silence from them – my husband was suddenly arrested in 2015 .
Ibrahim was kept behind bars for almost two and half years after that , simply awaiting a trial that the prosecution kept pushing back .
Then in 2018 , Ibrahim took a plea deal .
It was an excruciating decision for him to make .
He had spent countless hours preparing for his own case , sifting through pages and pages of discovery .
Ibrahim was ready to go to trial and defend his innocence , when the prosecution ( who had shown up in court before unprepared and unable to make a coherent argument ) presented him with an offer that was almost impossible to turn down .
The prosecution ’s offer was for a 5 year sentence for reduced charges – half of which he had already served – followed by deportation from the country .
To go to trial , on the other hand , was to face a necessarily biased jury , and risk a potential life sentence .
It was a no brainer .
Ibrahim ’s lawyer for the case called this deal , “ The closest thing to surrender by the Government .
The Government did not indict him on life sentence terrorism offenses to have him serve 21 months [ after taking the deal ] . ”
And so my husband took the deal .
He admitted to guilt on paper so he could one day walk the earth free again , reunited with the wife and children he was so mercilessly stripped away from .
Unfortunate Crossroads
On February 7th of this year , 2020 , Ibrahim completed the remaining days of his sentence .
He was released into ICE custody as the transitional ground between the Colorado prison he was in , and the country he would be deported to ( likely India , since my husband is an Indian national ) .
His departure was needlessly delayed , and now , because of COVID - 19 and the world crisis we all find ourselves in , he is trapped .
Flights out of the country are cancelled or delayed , and India has closed its borders .
“ I never should have taken that plea deal , ” my husband said recently , and I try , as I have many times before , to console him .
It ’s a resurfacing of an internal struggle Ibrahim has had since the moment he took the deal , trying to reconcile his soul to the decision .
He has spent long days worried that by “ admitting ” even to the lesser charges in the deal , he betrayed himself and his beliefs .
He goes back in time often to reject that deal , trusting that God would clear his name .
Trusting that the research he put in , and the dedicated lawyer he had , could have easily ( easily ) stood up to the weak evidence and mumbling prosecution .
Maybe , he thinks , he should have risked everything to stand up for the truth , rather than make the slightest concession to tyranny .
But the reality is , Ibrahim never stood a chance at a fair trial , despite his glaring innocence .
Terrorism cases of the past have taught us that .
A racist President and a country that elected him gave us no reason to hope that this time would be different .
If you still think it ’s strange that my husband would admit to something he did n’t do , that he’d be willing to take on the implication of “ terrorist ” when he took his plea deal , I want to remind you again of Henry Brown .
How he burnt his hand with sulfuric acid and travelled in a nailed wooden shipping crate , risking his life .
A good and innocent man , when stripped of his family and freedom , will do desperate things to get them back .
“ If you have never been deprived of your liberty , as I was , ” wrote Brown , “ You can not realize the power of that hope of freedom , which was to me indeed , an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast . ”
A Looming Disaster
In the wake of COVID - 19 , my husband is now serving an indefinite sentence .
Everything about his situation is uncertain .
And while his prolonged stay in the ICE detention center may seem like just another inconvenience brought on suddenly by this pandemic – are n’t all of our lives on hold in so many ways ?
– my husband is in a dangerous situation .
He sits in a box , with other men , while the whole world has been flipped on its head .
While the rest of us are told to stay home , to stay safe , to keep a distance – my husband and other detainees are in cramped quarters where social distancing is impossible , where disinfectants and cleaners are inadequate , and where all it takes is for one inmate to get sick before the rest of them follow suit .
I shudder to think what could happen to Ibrahim and these other men .
I shudder to think how an already overwhelmed medical system – short - staffed and lacking necessary gear and equipment – could even begin to handle this .
Already , in early April , a staff member at my husband ’s detention center tested positive for COVID - 19 , and shortly afterwards , a fever and illness spread among the inmates .
There ’s no way to know what it was , and the detention center says they did their best to isolate the infected staff member .
What if it was n’t COVID - 19 ?
And what if COVID - 19 is on its way to them ?
All it takes is for one person – one delivery driver , one staff member , one detainee– to be infected , and the rest of the center is the perfect breeding ground for this virus .
For Cook County Jail in Chicago , all of this is no longer a “ what if . ”
At the time of writing this , more than 500 detainees and staff at that jail have been infected .
Prisoners have started rioting , and more recently going on hunger strike .
All across the nation , what has already happened in Cook County Jail will happen at other prisons , because our government is failing to act .
The data paints a horrifying picture , and some activists expect that “ tens of thousands of prisoners will needlessly die ” in the wake of COVID - 19 .
They have labelled this a time “ when mass incarceration becomes mass murder . ”
And all of us are culpable if we fail to act
Friends on Either Side
In late March , activists on the ground worked to release a number of prisoners from the Aurora Contract Detention Facility where my husband is being held .
A wave of men was released , like a breath of air , to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the verge of happening .
Ibrahim was not one of those men .
The ICE detention center claims they “ probably ” cannot release him on house arrest based on his conviction , even though they have complete jurisdiction to do so .
Despite being a non-violent prisoner , despite having no prior contact with the law before the trumped up charges were brought against him , despite having served his agreed upon sentence , my husband ( like other Muslims caught in the crossfire of the US “ War on Terror ” ) wears a scarlet letter in the shape of a “ T , ” branded onto him as if with a hot iron – without pity and without escape .
When Henry Brown made his historic escape from slavery , he was aided on either side by friends and supporters .
In Virginia , there was his shoemaker friend and another man who was himself a freed slave .
And in Philadelphia , it was a group of abolitionists who knew the evils of slavery , and the imperative of helping out a fellow man in need .
They took up his cause and fought for him before they ever met him .
For my husband , he is awaited on the other side of his captivity by a loving , longing family .
We have waited for him every day since his release date in February , and long before that in every moment since the moment of his traumatic arrest .
Ibrahim is also aided by loving friends and activists fighting to get him out as we speak .
A few weeks ago we filed for an Emergency Humanitarian Parole Request , asking that my husband be released on house arrest until India opens up its borders and he can fulfill the second half of an unjust plea deal , in a case that was always a travesty of justice .
It was denied .
ICE gave no reason , but merely wrote a few lines as if to offer some sort of appeasement .
We now have to put up a fight in the higher courts and file what ’s called a habeas corpus in the 10th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in Colorado .
A habeas corpus , simply put , challenges the court to show reason as to why an individual must remain in custody .
In Ibrahim ’s case , having served his time , further imprisonment or detention now warrants further review .
It ’s still a long shot , but worth it for the chance at freedom it gives my husband , and for the sake of not staying silent in the face of injustice .
We do need your help .
We ask that people who have never met Ibrahim take up his cause and fight for him , because the US government ’s misplaced “ war on terror ” and systems of “ mass incarceration ” are evils that need to be eradicated .
Help Ibrahim ( and other prisoners ) out of a situation that could needlessly turn into one of mass murder .
Help release Ibrahim from the indefinite sentence he is now serving after having completed the unfair sentence he was given .
Please sign the petition to free my husband , and spread the word : https://bit.ly/FreeIbrahimNow
As we see so many people stepping up during this crisis , as we witness the earth heal and restore aspects of its physical form , it ’s time for a moral transformation as well .
Help set a free man free .

A Franklin man with multiple sclerosis was sentenced today to five years in prison for growing marijuana that he has said was used for medicinal purposes .
The sentence handed down to John Wilson is the minimum prison term that he could have received .
Wilson ’s attorney , James Wronko , said he will file a motion to stay the sentence pending an appeal .
Superior Court Judge Robert Reed , who handed down the sentence , said that Wilson in six months could be eligible for the the New Jersey Intensive Supervision Program in which certain offenders , sentenced to state prisob , are given an opportunity to work their way back into the community under intensive supervision .
Reed also did not sentence Wilson to a period of partole ineligibility .
Because this is his first conviction on an indictable offense , Wilson could be eligible for a parole in little over a year .
“ It ’s the least period of imprisonment I could impose , ” said Reed .
The state attorney general ’s office , which prosecuted the case , was asking Reed to impose a seven - year sentence .
Reed said that a pre-sentencing report said that Wilson was diagnosed with MS when he was 30 in 2002 , but that he had been smoking marijuana on a daily basis since he was 15 .
Wronko said Wilson began using marijuana to treat the symptoms of MS because he did not have insurance and could not afford prescriptions .
Before Reed delivered the sentence , Wilson admitted he had broken the law .
“ I am not a bad person , ” Wilson told the judge .
“ I just made a horrible mistake . ”
“ I ’m truly sorry for what I ’ve done , ” Wilson said .
Because he could n’t afford insurance , Wilson said he has used alternative treatments , including vitamins and bee venom .
Wilson said he recently had three “ flare - ups ” of MS and has ended up in the hospital twice .

Government and industry bureaucrats addicted to spewing out mind - numbing PowerPoint presentations , be very afraid ; Edward Tufte is coming to Washington , DC .
The Obama administration has appointed Tufte to serve on the Recovery Independent Advisory Panel , which will suggest ways that the $ 787 billion stimulus program 's watchdog accountability board can do its job .
" I 'm doing this because I like accountability and transparency , and I believe in public service , " Tufte explained on his website on Sunday .
" And it is the complete opposite of everything else I do . "
We 're not so sure about that .
Edward Tufte is a leading critic of and writer about graphic presentations .
He 's also a champion of clarity in writing and public speaking .
Professor Emeritus of Political Science , Statistics , and Computer Science at Yale University , much of his life has been dedicated to thinking out loud about what works and does n't work when it comes to statistical charts , maps , and tables .
His most famous book is his 1982 opus The Visual Display of Quantitative Information , which coined the term " chartjunk . "
" Like weeds , " Tufte explained , " many varieties of chartjunk flourish . "
He identified three : " unintentional optical art " — bar and circle charts full of distracting moiré patterns ; " the dreaded grid " — thick matrices of vertical / horizontal lines that make it harder to follow data ; and " The Duck " — those goofy three dimensional graphic objects that you often see superimposed over maps and tables .
They reminded him of various roadside stores built in the literal form of ducks .
" No information , no sense of discovery , no wonder , no substance is generated by chartjunk , " Tufte warned .
But those words were written two years before the invention of PowerPoint , which Tufte went after with particular gusto — perhaps most famously in his 2003 Wired essay , " PowerPoint Is Evil . "
One damn slide after another
" Imagine a widely used and expensive prescription drug that promised to make us beautiful but didn't , " Tufte 's screed began .
" Instead the drug had frequent , serious side effects :
It induced stupidity , turned everyone into bores , wasted time , and degraded the quality and credibility of communication .
These side effects would rightly lead to a worldwide product recall . "
In " PowerPoint is Evil , " Tufte argued that this particular product makes it easier for the presenter to get through his or her talk , but harder for the audience to understand it .
Those endless cascading lines of text pretty much turn any lecture into a sales pitch , he complained .
And since each panel can only hold a relatively small amount of verbiage , the speaker must deluge the audience with " one damn slide after another " full of bulleted lines .
While the person at the lectern may feel more confident with a big PowerPoint screen at his or her side , the audience is distracted from the actual message — overwhelmed and invariably bored .
Tufte really does n't like bad presentations ( source : Tufte , The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint )
Even worse , Tufte noted , PowerPoint enables presenters to evaluate their talks based on slide format rather than content .
" Presentations largely stand or fall on the quality , relevance , and integrity of the content , " he warned .
" If your numbers are boring , then you 've got the wrong numbers .
If your words or images are not on point , making them dance in color wo n't make them relevant . "
Title eviscerated
But in later writing , Tufte took his campaign against PowerPoint beyond concerns about its impact on the quality of public speaking .
His essay " PowerPoint does rocket science " offered a devastating critique of the presentation slides used to assess the space worthiness of the doomed 2003 Columbia Space Shuttle , after engineers noticed following takeoff that foam debris from a bipod ramp had struck its wing .
Tufte observed that a key slide title offered a reassuring assessment of the condition of the ship , while subsequent bullet points undermined the lead message .
" Review of Test Data Indicates Conservatism of Tile Penetration , " the title declared .
But the last bullet noted that " flight condition is significantly outside of test database . . .
Volume of ramp is 1920 cu[ bic ] in [ ches ] vs 3 cu in for test . "
In other words , Tufte explained , the final bullet warned that the debris hitting the Columbia was 1920 divided by three , or 640 times bigger than data used in shuttle model tests .
" ' The correct headline should be ' Review of Test Data Indicates Irrelevance of Two Models ' , " he contended .
" This is a powerful conclusion , indicating that pre-launch safety standards no longer hold . "
The slide title had been " eviscerated " by the lower - level bullets , yet the overall message of the presentation was one of reassurance .
Two weeks after lift - off , the Columbia incinerated during re-entry .
But presentations such as this , the Columbia Accident Investigation Board later concluded , allowed NASA management to create documents that highlighted what they already believed , while leaving conflicting evidence at the bottom of a pile of bullet points .
From this and other incidents Tufte argues that while PowerPoint is useful for showing pictures and videos , it 's no substitute for a carefully written report that grapples with evidence in full paragraphs rather than abbreviated lines .
Now Tufte will be advising the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board , tasked to " promote accountability by coordinating and conducting oversight of Recovery funds to prevent fraud , waste , and abuse and to foster transparency on Recovery spending by providing the public with accurate , user - friendly information . "
Those last seven words sound like Tufte 's bailiwick .
" Maybe I 'll learn something , " he added in his post on his new job .
" The practical consequence is that I will probably go to Washington several days each month , in addition to whatever homework and phone meetings are necessary . "
Maybe the people he advises will learn something too .
Some cars are so beautifully designed and exquisitely engineered that they transcend mere transportation to become works of art .
They are rolling sculptures , and to see them is to think , " That car belongs in a gallery . "
Curators at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta agree .
The museum is hosting an exhibition to celebrate automotive design , and it has gathered a very impressive assortment of cars .
The Allure of the Automobile , which opens Sunday and runs through June 20 , features 18 vehicles created in what could be called the golden age of design , from the early 1930s through the early 1960s .
The vehicles range from a 1933 Pierce Silver Arrow to a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT .
Each is presented in the context of the Art Moderne and Postwar Modernity movements , and they all have a timelessness that goes beyond mere craft to become art .
Take , for example , the 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C2900B Touring Berlinetta shown above .
Phil Hill , America 's first world champion driver , said of this car , " If that does n't get your heart racing , then you do n't have any blood in you . "
Who are we to argue ?
The Touring Berlinetta exudes strength and refinement and finely shaped design that is hard to equal , let alone surpass .
Now look at the 1961 Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato .
An Italian body with a British heart .
Sleek , yet muscular ; refined , yet designed for the track .
Though the design looks simple at first , the longer you look at it , the more you see .
Like all good art .
The 1959 Chevrolet Corvette " Bill Mitchell " Stingray prototype is a show car that made it , more or less , into production when the second - generation Corvette rolled out in 1963 .
Mitchell replaced the legendary Harley Earl as GM 's vp for styling in 1958 , and he traded Earl 's bulbous styling for sculpted designs .
This car blends the classic lines of European sportscars with the futuristic cues popular among American automakers in the 1950s to create a car that still looks fresh .
Pick just about any Ferrari from the 1950s and ' 60s and it's a stunner .
And the 250 SWB ( for short wheelbase ) Berlinetta is one of the prettiest .
The car ( this one is a 1961 model ) is among the most important GT race cars ever and one of the most beautiful .
Styling is often secondary to function in auto racing , but the 250 SWB is an example of form and function coming together in harmony .
This is the 1937 Mercedes - Benz 540K Special Roadster .
It was Mercedes ' flagship vehicle , and no expense was spared .
It perfectly represents the art deco styling of its era , and with a supercharged engine ( the " K " stands for " kompressor " ) , it was as powerful as it was sleek .
Even a car as old as a 1937 Mercedes can look thoroughly fresh if it 's designed right , and everything about this car was done right .
This little brute is the 1953 Porsche 550 Le Mans / La Carrera Panamerica Coupe , and it has a very impressive racing history .
It also has very impressive styling .
Although many automakers design cars to look streamlined , the 550 coupe is streamlined .
It was designed with an eye toward maximum aerodynamic efficiency .
It 's another example of form and function coming together beautifully in a timeless design that can be seen today in the Cayman and Boxster .
UPDATE 8:30 a.m. Eastern , March 20 : Many of you are asking why one car or another is n't listed .
The answer is because these are the only photos from the exhibit the High Museum of Art provided to us .
Though we agree the Talbot - Lago T150C SS is stunning , it is not included in the exhibit .
Do n't ask us why ; perhaps the museum could n't find anyone willing to loan it one .
Here 's a full list of the cars in the exhibit ; if there 's something you think should have been included , list it in the comments .
1933 Pierce - Arrow Silver Arrow

NEW YORK --
It just got a lot tougher to throw against the New York Jets .
A few hours before the NFL 's free - agency period began , the Jets improved their secondary in a big way by agreeing in principle with the San Diego Chargers to acquire talented but troubled cornerback Antonio Cromartie on Thursday night .
The Jets confirmed the deal .
League sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter the Jets will give the Chargers a 2011 third - round draft pick that could turn into a second - round pick .
Cromartie has one year left on his contract and there are no plans for his deal to be redone now .
Cromartie was an All - Pro in 2007 and will team with Darrelle Revis in the Jets ' secondary , making them possibly the best cornerback tandem in the NFL .
Cromartie replaces Lito Sheppard , who was released earlier in the day after one disappointing season .
It could be a welcome change for Cromartie , who has struggled the last two seasons .
He has 15 interceptions in four seasons since being the 19th overall pick out of Florida State in 2006 , but the Chargers were dissatisfied with Cromartie 's performance late last season and in the playoffs .
General manager A.J. Smith made it clear he would try to trade him .

Today the Science and Technology Select Committee delivered its verdict on homeopathy and it was devastating .
The committee has called for the complete withdrawal of NHS funding and official licensing of homeopathy .
This should come as no surprise to anyone who witnessed the almost farcical nature of the proceedings , with the elite of homeopathy mocked by their own testimony .
Peter Fisher , director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital , spewed forth the sort of dialogue that would n't look out of place in a Terry Pratchett novel .
As the report drily observes :
" Dr Fisher stated that the process of ' shaking is important ' but was unable to say how much shaking was required .
He said ' that has not been fully investigated ' but did tell us that ' You have to shake it vigorously [...] if you just stir it gently , it does not work ' .
Quite .
It 's hard to say which is more ridiculous : the sight of a grown man speaking this nonsense , or the fact that after 200 years homeopaths apparenly have n't bothered to " fully investigate " how much shaking is required for their remedies to work .
And yet , bizarrely , these people expect to be taken seriously .
In this they have failed spectacularly .
The select committee report has brutally inflicted the 21st , 20th and 19th centuries on this 18th century magic ritual , and under inspection it has fallen apart .
As I reported previously in the Guardian , much of the evidence presented by homeopaths simply does not stand up to scrutiny , and the committee agrees , concurring with the government , the scientific community and independent experts in concluding that : " the systematic reviews and meta - analyses conclusively demonstrate that homeopathic products perform no better than placebos . "
Even the claims that more research is needed have been rebutted .
Plenty of evidence has accumulated regarding the effectiveness of homeopathy , and a verdict has been reached .
It is useless .
As the report states : " It is ... unethical to enter patients into trials to answer questions that have been settled already . "
Even more damning is the MPs ' assessment of the competence of homeopaths in handling evidence .
In a strongly worded statement clearly directed at the British Homeopathic Association ( BHA ) , the report expresses disappointment at the behaviour of homeopaths submitting evidence to the evidence check :
" We regret that advocates of homeopathy , including in their submissions to our inquiry , choose to rely on , and promulgate , selective approaches to the treatment of the evidence base as this risks confusing or misleading the public , the media and policy - makers . "
The BHA 's behaviour throughout the evidence check has been an embarrassment to homeopathy .
After my allegation that the BHA had misrepresented evidence to MPs , the author of the association 's submission to the committee , homeopath Robert Mathie , in particular should have made a public apology for allowing his standard of scholarship to slip .
But the BHA instead chose to attack me in a press statement that contained still further misrepresentations of the evidence .
Mathie and the BHA should take the report 's criticisms on the chin , accept that they are in error , and reflect on how they present evidence to the public in the future .
Sadly , the criticism is likely to fall on deaf ears .
Rather than take the opportunity to reassess their approach , homeopaths are filling blogs and tweets with dark imaginings of vast , Big Pharma - controlled conspiracies against their noble art , painting a vivid picture of the fantasy world that they appear to inhabit .
Of course , as Peter Fisher 's comments reveal , a grand conspiracy is not neccesary to discredit homeopathy .
The most effective way to do that is simply to let a homeopath speak .
But it 's not just homeopaths we should be criticising .
The government , and in particular the MHRA ( Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , which licenses drugs and oversees labelling ) , also come in for some strong criticism from the committee .
Both stand accused of hypocrisy for paying lip - service to the importance of evidence - based medicine while allowing special exemptions for dubious practices .
In the words of the committee , the government 's position on homeopathy is " confused " .
It accepts that homeopathy is effectively a placebo , but allows it to be practised within the NHS without considering the ethics of prescribing placebos to patients .
Members of the committee were shocked to find that the rigorous rules the MHRA normally applies for licensing medicines were simply abandoned in the case of homeopathy .
That the MHRA allows health claims to be made for medicines that cannot be shown to work suggests a failure to live up to its own standards .
Even more damning is the committee 's verdict on the labels that the MHRA deems acceptable for use on homeopathic Arnica , labels that were tested by the MHRA itself .
The report states : " We conclude that the user - testing of the Arnica Montana 30 C label was poorly designed with parts of the test actively misleading participants . "
Clearly , MHRA chief executive Kent Woods has serious questions to answer regarding how his agency came to allow a homeopathic treatment through the net .
The report also represents a victory for the blogosphere .
Sceptical bloggers such as Andy Lewis and ' Gimpy ' have been pursuing homeopaths and leading homeopathic organisations for years , whether exposing the funding of hideously unethical Aids trials in Africa , or doggedly harrying the MHRA over its failure to appropriately regulate labelling .
Today , these bloggers are relieved that MPs are finally paying attention .
Lewis expressed happiness that the behaviour of those selling homeopathic remedies had come under parliamentary scrutinity , while Gimpy observed that , " this issue is no longer just a concern within the blogosphere but is now a matter for parliament . "
For homeopaths , the message is clear .
Their attempts to defend their position in the face of questioning from MPs have ended in humiliation and embarrassment .
It is clear that they have no credible evidence to support their remedies .
Time , perhaps , to pick a new profession .
Martin Robbins writes for The Lay Scientist
( CNN ) --
The medical journal The Lancet on Tuesday retracted a controversial 1998 paper that linked the measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine to autism .
The study subsequently had been discredited , and last week , the lead author , Dr. Andrew Wakefield , was found to have acted unethically in conducting the research .
The General Medical Council , which oversees doctors in Britain , said that " there was a biased selection of patients in The Lancet paper " and that his " conduct in this regard was dishonest and irresponsible . "
The panel found that Wakefield subjected some children in the study to various invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and MRI scans .
He also paid children at his son's birthday party to have blood drawn for research purposes , an act that " showed a callous disregard " for the " distress and pain " of the children , the panel said .
After the council 's findings last week , The Lancet retracted the study and released this statement .
" It has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al. are incorrect , contrary to the findings of an earlier investigation .
In particular , the claims in the original paper that children were ' consecutively referred ' and that investigations were ' approved ' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false .
Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record . "
Has autism touched your life ?
Share your stories , thoughts on vaccination study
Dr. Richard Horton , editor of The Lancet , said he reviewed the General Medical Council report regarding Wakefield 's conduct .
" It 's the most appalling catalog and litany of some the most terrible behavior in any research and is therefore very clear that it has to be retracted , " he said .
CNN was unable to speak to Wakefield , but in a statement he denied wrongdoing .
" The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion .
In fact , the Lancet paper does not claim to confirm a link between the MMR vaccine and autism .
Research into that possible connection is still going on . "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention praised The Lancet 's retraction , saying , " It builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world 's leading scientists that concludes there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism .
We want to remind parents that vaccines are very safe and effective and they save lives .
Parents who have questions about the safety of vaccines should talk to their pediatrician or their child 's health care provider . "
Since its publication , Wakefield 's study has attracted many critics who argued that the work had been so flawed , it should not be regarded as scientific .
Wakefield theorized that the measles vaccine caused gastrointestinal problems and that those GI problems led to autism .
In his view , the virus used in the vaccine grew in the intestinal tract , leading the bowel to become porous because of inflammation .
Then material seeped from the bowel into the blood , Wakefield 's theory said , affecting the nervous system and causing autism .
But subsequent research has been unable to duplicate Wakefield 's findings .
A September 2008 study replicated key parts of Wakefield 's original paper and found no evidence that the vaccine had a connection to either autism or GI disorders .
The study , conducted at Columbia University , Massachusetts General Hospital and the CDC , also found no relationship between the timing of the vaccine and children getting GI disorders or autism .
The Wakefield study has been a key piece of evidence cited by many parents who do not vaccinate their children because of autism fears .
" The story became credible because it was published in The Lancet , " Alison Singer , president of the Autism Science Foundation , said Tuesday .
" It was in The Lancet , and we really rely on these medical journals . "
Singer , the mother of a child with autism , added , " That study did a lot of harm .
People became afraid of vaccinations .
This is the Wakefield legacy : this unscientifically grounded fear of vaccinations that result in children dying from vaccine - preventable diseases . "
Retractions are rare in medical journals and usually occur as a result of fraud or plagiarism , said Marcia Angell , a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine .
" It is a major event when there is a retraction like this , " she said .
" It sounds like there was a misleading design of the study ... patients not randomly chosen .
There were ethical violations . "
William Schaffner , professor and chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , described the journal 's level of action as " unprecedented . "
" Since Wakefield 's study came out , some 20 other studies have come out , and each one of these studies , done by different researchers , in different populations and in different countries , has denied the associations between vaccines and autism , " he said .
" Scientifically , this story is over . "
Schaffner added , " This series of events is damning and should refocus all of us in the field to find better methods of diagnosis and treatments . "
The Lancet came under criticism for the initial publication of the paper 12 years ago .
" The mere publishing of this paper created something that will never fully go way : the false notion that MMR caused autism , " said Dr. Paul Offit , author of " Autism 's False Prophets : Bad Science , Risky Medicine , and the Search for a Cure , " and the chief of division of infectious diseases at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
The retraction did little to change the opinion of Rebecca Estepp , a spokeswoman for Talk About Curing Autism .
Estepp said her son has autism and bowel problems .
She said she remains convinced that he had a vaccine reaction and that Wakefield 's research helped doctors identify how to help her son .
" I guess the GMC can say whatever they want to say for the rest of their existence , but I know that my son got better because of Dr. Wakefield , " she said .
Generation Rescue , an advocacy and support group founded by actress Jenny McCarthy , whose son has autism , expressed support for Wakefield .
A co-founder of the group , JB Handley , called him " a courageous honest doctor who told an inconvenient truth . "
McCarthy is a high - profile proponent of the belief that childhood vaccinations may play a part in the condition .
Generation Rescue criticized the General Medical Council 's judgment on Wakefield with this statement : " The sole purpose of the GMC 's ruling this week is to try and quell the growing concern of parents that the expanding vaccine schedule and the remarkable rise in autism are correlated . "
It also advised parents to do their own research before deciding to give their child the MMR vaccine .
Cases in which U.S. families have sued alleging a vaccine - autism link have had mixed outcomes .
In 2007 , a U.S. federal program intended to compensate victims of injuries caused by vaccines concluded that a 9 - year - old girl 's underlying illness had predisposed her to symptoms of autism and was " significantly aggravated " by the vaccinations .
Two years later , three American families sought compensation from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , but the panel ruled that they had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that the vaccines caused autism in their children .
CNN 's Elizabeth Landau , Sabriya Rice and Miriam Falco contributed to this report .
Testing Perl 5.12.0 RC 1 with App:: perlbrew
I ’m working on a project with Curtis “ Ovid ” Poe and Adrian Howard .
We use Perl 5.10.1 , but because we control which version of Perl 5 we use , there ’s no reason not to test with Perl 5.12.0 – and if we find bugs , we can report them and get them fixed in the proper place .
This application has its own quirks for setup and installation .
I managed to clean up some of the worst offenses as my first work on the project ; it installs and passes tests on my server with Perl 5.10.1 , so it should install cleanly if all of its dependencies work with Perl 5.12 .
My first approach was to manage my own parallel installation of Perl 5 with local : : lib and a custom installation of Perl 5.12 , but the manual intervention required to make all of that work was enough of a hassle that I took a tip from Chris Prather and installed App : : perlbrew to manage my various installations ( system Perl 5.10.0 built with threading , custom Perl 5.10.1 without threads , and now Perl 5.12.0 RC1 ) .
$ cpan App:: perlbrew $ perlbrew init $ echo ' source /home/chromatic/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc' >> ~/.bashrc $ source /home / chromatic / perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc $ perlbrew install perl - 5.12.0-RC1 - as p512
The - as p512 option was optional ; it lets me use p512 as a short name to refer to that particular installation when switching between versions .
After a while with no obvious output ( which is fine ) , the end result is the ability to switch between parallel Perl 5 installations without them stomping on each other .
They ’re all installed locally in my own home directory , so I can use CPAN or cpanminus to install modules without worrying about root access or messing up the system for anyone else .
I had already installed local : : lib , but I ’m not sure it ’s necessary in this case .
With the changes to my . bashrc , now perl is a symlink .
Switching my version with perlbrew swaps a symlink , so every time I invoke perl directly , it uses the intended version .
Shebang lines remain unaffected , so anything which invokes a program directly will use a hard - coded version of Perl .
Unfortunately , this includes cpanm , so I took to using an alias which does perl `which cpanm` as a temporary workaround .
Miyagawa suggested not using CPAN to install cpanminus .
Instead , he recommends :
$ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
Note that you ’ll have to do this for every new version of Perl you install with perlbrew .
Here ’s the nice part of perlbrew .
I can also install Perl 5.10.1 through it ( replacing my custom installation ) and switch between the two with a simple command :
$ perlbrew switch p5101 $ perlbrew switch perl - 5.10.1
You can see what you have installed with :
$ perlbrew installed
For those of you curious as to the results of my experiments with 5.12.0 , Devel : : Cover does n’t work correctly yet , but that ’s not a requirement for this project .
Devel : : BeginLift needs a patch to build .
Fortunately , that ’s available in the RT queue .
A manual build and test worked just fine .
Other than that , a little bit of babysitting on the installation satisfied all of the dependencies .
If I ’d had to manage the installation ( and module paths and … ) of all of this software , I ’d have spent a lot more time on the fiddly details of installing dependencies and not the interesting part .
App :: perlbrew allowed me to concentrate on what really matters : does my software work ?

Environmental activists are attacking a $ 60 billion deal that will keep Chinese power stations supplied with Australian coal for at least the next two decades .
Under the agreement announced last week , the Australian coal and iron ore mining company Resourcehouse will build a new mining complex to give China Power International Development 30 million tonnes of coal annually for the next two decades .
Resourcehouse Chairman Clive Palmer called it the " biggest - ever export contract " for Australia , which is the world 's leading exporter of coal .
But in supplying China , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , green groups are accusing Australia of ignoring the role it plays in maintaining dirty energy economies around the world .
" It is hypocritical for Australia to on the one hand blame China for climate change and on the other hand try so hard to sell more coal to China , " said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace China .
The deal , she said , " will only lock China further up in its unhealthy dependency on coal . "
Bradley Smith , spokesman for Friends of the Earth in Queensland , Australia , said it " drives another nail into the coffin of climate change .
If the project goes ahead , then emissions from the exported coal would equal 20 percent of Australia 's total domestic emissions . "
The tensions come on the heels of last year 's climate change summit in Copenhagen .
There , President Obama and the leaders of other industrialized nations like Australia successfully pushed China and other fast - growing developing nations to scale back the growth of carbon emissions .
While the pledges are voluntary , U.S. leaders have described them as an important step in persuading all the major economies to take responsibility for their role in causing global warming .
The start of a continuing expansion of coal trade ?
Activists say the deal raises fresh questions about what countries are most liable for global warming pollution .
Economists , meanwhile , point out that the Australia - China agreement signals an expansion of the coal trade that will likely increase in coming years without an international carbon regime to regulate it .
" Production is going to flow , where there is no restriction for using coal , " said Jeremy Carl , a research fellow at the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University .
With industrialized nations like Australia under pressure to go green , Carl said they likely " will export reserves that they may politically not be able to use at home . "
Attributing carbon emissions to a particular country is fairly straightforward .
By all internationally accepted measures , countries " own " the greenhouse gases produced within their borders .
Politically , though , the calculations are a lot trickier .
In the run-up to Copenhagen , Chinese leaders argued that since 30 percent of the country 's emissions are created by manufacturing and exporting goods to the West , industrialized nations should take responsibility for that portion of China 's carbon footprint .
It 's an argument that did n't fly with climate negotiators from industrialized nations , but resonated widely in the environmental community .
Australia , meanwhile , emits about 544 million short tons ( 493.5 million tonnes ) of CO2 annually .
But activists say the country 's greenhouse gas output doubles when overseas fossil fuel exports are factored in .
" For us , it 's always been a matter of great concern that Australia , while it needs to develop its renewable energy economy domestically , it also needs to address this dependence on exporting coal , " said Georgina Woods , international coordinator with Climate Action Network Australia .
She and others have called for Australia to develop a plan to phase out dependence on coal exports .
Aussies talk about cutting emissions , but not coal exports
" It 's always been something of an anomaly for us that while they are talking about an emissions trading system domestically , they are rapidly expanding their coal exporting , " Woods said .
But , she added , " It 's something that 's difficult for us to tackle because it 's been so integral to Australia 's economic identity for so long . "
Government officials in Australia , meanwhile , say that 's the wrong way to look at a complicated issue like global energy needs in a world where coal is still one of the most abundant and cheapest sources of power .
And with coal bringing Australia more than $ 50 billion annually , there 's little mainstream discussion there of reducing or phasing out the country 's biggest export .
" Consistent with International Energy Agency forecasts , the Australian government recognises coal will continue to be a very important part of the global energy mix in the decades ahead , " Michael Bradley , spokesman for Australian Minister for Resources and Energy Martin Ferguson , said in an e-mail .
" Rather than trying to reduce the use of fossil fuels , the Australian government is focused on developing technologies to reduce emissions from these fuels and the increase of energy efficiency throughout the economy , " he said .
In a written statement sent by his office , Australian Assistant Minister for Climate Change Greg Combet noted that international emissions accounting rules regarding burning coal for energy production are an individual country 's responsibility , no matter which country supplies the coal .
But , he said , Australia is playing a leading role in seeking technological solutions to global warming pollution by encouraging the development of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology and the recent establishment in Australia of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute .
Asia 's coal demands expand rapidly
" The most effective way we can encourage the reduction of emissions in the energy production sector is through a comprehensive international agreement on climate change , which is why the Australian government is playing a constructive role in the international negotiations , " he said .
It 's a view that is strongly echoed by the Australian Coal Association , which is contributing $ 1 billion over the coming decade to CCS development efforts .
In a press release the trade group put out before the Copenhagen summit , ACA Executive Director Ralph Hillman said the group supports a carbon pricing mechanism that goes hand in hand with research and development funding .
" Preserving the competitiveness of Australia 's industry must be a central aim of this approach along with reducing emissions , " he said .
Australia provides about 30 percent of the world 's coal , exporting 233 tonnes annually , according to the Australia Coal Association .
It 's the nation 's largest commodity export , and the Sino - Australian deal is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs in Queensland and generate multimillion - dollar royalty payments for the state , according to Australian press reports .
Meanwhile , China 's hunger for coal remains insatiable , and throughout Asia , demand for coal is high and getting stronger .
Japan , Korea , China and India are the largest importers of coal .
At the same time , they and other countries , like the Philippines and Malaysia , are rapidly expanding the number of thermal power plants and importing fuel at ever - growing rates .
Seaborne trade in coal has increased by 7 percent every year over the past two decades , according to the World Coal Institute , with Australia leading the world , followed by Indonesia .
Australia has four coal mega- projects under development in the state of Queensland , sometimes called the Wild West of the country .
Resourcehouse 's First China Coal is only one of the four , and it aims to extract steam coal from the Galilee Basin .
4 mega-projects in Queensland vie for the market
The region is so far inland that transporting the fuel would require a 307 - mile rail link , additional port developments and an investment of $ 4.7 billion , according to a release by Waratah Coal .
Over the next three to five years , the companies hope to bring their coal deposits into production .
Together , the four major developments could yield up to 130 million tonnes of steam coal every year starting in 2015 if plans laid by the companies go ahead , according to Bart Lucarelli , an independent consultant with experience in the coal supply and Asian power industries .
But there is so much coal in Queensland that the competition to become the primary supplier to the Asian market is immense among the four companies .
" Each of these developers is likely to engage in a war of attrition , using press releases , such as the ones recently released by [ Resourcehouse Chairman ]
Clive Palmer , to trumpet the virtues and inevitability of its project as a means of creating investor doubts in the remaining projects , " said Lucarelli .
Conflicting reports flew last week after Palmer announced the deal with China Power International Development .
The Chinese firm first denied any such dealings , and then Palmer acknowledged he had gotten the name of the company wrong .
It was , in fact , China Power International Holdings , which said that it had not yet signed a deal , but had only instituted a framework .
Considering the huge capital investments necessary to develop infrastructure in Queensland , the willingness of an anchor buyer like China to commit to huge orders is helpful , according to Lucarelli .
" Except for the Chinese , where there is a lot of state involvement and ability to make big moves , it 'll be difficult to tie up 20 or 30 million tons of coal , " he said .
Since the Chinese government decontrolled the coal market , prices within the country have soared .
This has made it cheaper for power producers in southern China to import .
Meanwhile , countries will continue to grapple with the question of who bears responsibility for rising emissions , said David Pumphrey , deputy director of the energy and national security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
The problem , he said , is that " everybody " is in some sense responsible , adding , " We still have tension between drivers of economic activity and economic growth , and how we deal with climate change . "

Unseen images of a lost London ( when it really was a capital place to live ! )
Advertisement
They are a remarkable window onto a bygone age .
A snapshot of a city in transition - with horse - drawn carts and cobbled streets replaced by a booming industrial revolution .
Lost in the archives of English Heritage for 25 years , these never - before published images have now been compiled into a book .
From Victorian London to the devastation of two world wars , they provide a unique record of a vanishing way of life in the capital .
Here , CLAIRE COHEN compares the London of a century ago with photographs taken at the same locations today .
Earlham Street , Seven Dials , circa 1905 , left , and now , right
EARLHAM STREET
THEN : Street life consisted of men in flat caps standing outside a pub in an area that was a byword for poverty .
NOW : Part of London 's commercial West End , Earlham Street attracts theatre - goers and shoppers from nearby Covent Garden .
On the site of the pub is a designer clothes shop .
Borough High Street , circa 1903 , left , and now
BOROUGH HIGH STREET
THEN : 17th century timber - framed shops fronted the slums which were home to London 's poorest .
NOW : Although the area has been gentrified , the old - fashioned shops of the past have been replaced by a faceless office block .
Bush House , Aldwych circa 1932 , left , and now
BUSH HOUSE , ALDWYCH
THEN : Bush House , at the foot of Kingsway and a symbol of Anglo - American co-operation , was declared the most expensive building ever when it opened , in 1929 , having cost £ 2 million .
NOW : Home to the BBC World Service and HM Revenue and Customs , it appears largely unchanged - and many of the original buildings around it still stand .
Tower Bridge , circa 1893 , left , and now
TOWER BRIDGE
THEN : The bridge , in its latter stages of construction , was designed to allow ships to pass into the Pool of London .
Its gothic style was meant to fit in with the Tower of London and it cost £ 1.2 million ( £ 96.6 million today ) .
NOW : A busy thoroughfare for traffic , it is crossed by 40,000 people a day : a speed limit of 20 mph and weight limit of 18 tons helps to preserve the structure from damage .
River traffic still takes priority , but the bridge is raised only 1,000 times a year ( compared to 50 times a day in its heyday ) .
Oxford Circus , October 19 , 1910 , left , and now
OXFORD CIRCUS
THEN : This view of Oxford Street shows just how much London has changed in a century .
Motorised vehicles drive alongside horse - drawn carriages , and a policeman stands in the middle of the junction , directing the traffic and pedestrians .
NOW : Buses and taxis still dominate , a Tube station has been built , and traffic lights have replaced the lone policeman .
The Peter Robinson department store has since been replaced by chain stores .
Pool Of London , circa 1914 , left , and now
POOL OF LONDON
THEN : A panorama of sails and steam depicts this crowded shipping district .
Warehouses and factories sit in chaotic jumble , out of which rises the spire of the Church of St Magnus the Martyr ( centre ) and the Monument ( right ) .
St Paul 's can just be seen on the far left .
NOW : Trade is no longer the focus - the boats carry only tourists .
St Paul 's is clearer , and St Magnus the Martyr and the Monument are still visible , poking out from the glass skyscrapers .
Regent Street , 1910 , left , and now
REGENT ST
THEN : Advertising was fashionable in Victorian London , with illuminated lettering on Piccadilly Circus .
Mellin's Pharmacy at No 48 Regent Street was probably the first such sign .
Other still - familar brands include Perrier and Bovril .
NOW : Piccadilly Circus is world - famous for its vast flashing hoardings .
The concentration of shops and restaurants make this one of London 's busiest areas .
John Mayer is at the center of a racial controversy -- and it's all because he compared his penis to a white supremacist .
It 's all over an interview Mayer just gave to Playboy Magazine -- in which he was asked , " Do black women throw themselves at you ? "
Mayer 's response : " I do n't think I open myself to it .
My d*ck is sort of like a white supremacist .
I 've got a Benetton heart and a f*ckin ' David Duke c*ck .
I 'm going to start dating separately from my d*ck . "

By Hwang Eui-gakThe Seoul - based Yonhap News Agency reported on March 18 that Pak Nam - gi , director of planning and finance of the North 's ruling Workers ' Party , was recently executed near Pyongyang as a scapegoat for his failed currency revaluation adopted last November drastically reducing people 's assets .
The news came amid an unconfirmed report that China , a long ally of North Korea , is preparing a contingency plan for the uncertain odds of a big bang in the isolated North .
Apparently , the currency revaluation ( at the rate of 100 to one for the new currency ) was believed to have been aimed at forfeiting excessive money hoarded by those families who have benevolent relatives abroad .
But it has turned out be a serious blunder hurting people 's daily lives in the overall short - supply economy .
North Korea has attempted to introduce partial but various economic reforms and opening policies to overcome its economic hardship but only without success due to ``faulty implementation " rather than ``bad intentions .
" Many North Korean technocrats do not understand both economic principles and markets .
One of the major causes of the North 's economic policy failures could be traced to its excessive overinvestment in its military sector , not to mention the leader 's lack of understanding of human economic incentive and motive .
To make matters worse , the leadership is obsessed with the lingering worries about how its power structure will be affected once the society changes .
As long as a nation remains divided in mutual hostility , a large diversion of scarce national resources to the military is inevitable .
But a serious unbalance between the economic sector and the military sector is dangerous .
The heavy military sector at the sacrifice of economic investment will slacken the economy while its fat military tends to be more provocative .
This reflects today 's picture of North Korea , which often threatens its southern rival with ``a sea of fire . "
The risk is in fact made far worse by the virtual certainty of the North 's possession of nuclear weapons coupled with its enhanced missile deployment in the vicinity of the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) .
For over more than a decade , the communist regime has not been able to provide enough food for its people , despite its repeated slogan of building a socialist paradise .
Many in the North know through either ear - to - ear hearsay or increasing outside contacts about the affluent life which their southern brethrens are enjoying across the DMZ .
Officials as well as grassroots in the North know well that frequent stealing and extorting farm produce by the North 's hungry soldiers is hurting the income of farmers and that rampant corruption amid widespread hunger is contributing to eroding the legitimacy of the North 's leadership .
Despite the tight controls , people are continuing to eke out a meager living by selling and buying scarce and necessary goods in underground markets .
People should be able to generate food and income the state is no longer able to provide .
Even bureaucrats , knowing that the state is in short supply of resources to reward their zeal , are increasingly looking for secondary market opportunities which inbreed both legal and illegal trading .
The underground economy fosters corruption , making possible many things that were unthinkable in the past , such as bribery and human trafficking .
All these phenomena ring a death knell .
As is possibly the case of executed Pak Nam - gi , the North 's leadership can use its reckless power by victimizing some surrogate persons on charge of policy failures , but such an illegitimate power will have to assume its ultimate responsibility , and more importantly , it will unavoidably invite its own implosion .
Indeed , with the leadership of the North Korean regime in flux , the political and economic relationship between the North and the South , and between the Korean Peninsula and the world , is uncertain .
What would be the implications if the current North Korean government were to fall ?
A big bang in the form of either implosion or explosion will not be the end of the story for the peninsula .
Just as the DMZ lies largely in the hands of surrounding powers , so is the destiny of Korea likely dependent on its neighbors .
A unified Korea could be established if its four neighboring powers are assured of their security and interests in the region .
This must be an urgent contingency task that all Koreans have to prepare for from now on .
To flip through the latest draft of the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , in the works for seven years now , is to see the discipline 's floundering writ large .
Psychiatry seems to have lost its way in a forest of poorly verified diagnoses and ineffectual medications .
Patients who seek psychiatric help today for mood disorders stand a good chance of being diagnosed with a disease that does n't exist and treated with a medication little more effective than a placebo .

I ’ve been helping would be entrepreneurs for nearly eight years now and one thing I ’ve discovered is that you ca n’t really push someone to take the entrepreneurial plunge .
Either you have the desire to start your own business or you do n’t and most people ca n’t get over the uncertainty that ’s involved with how to become an entrepreneur .
A while back , I went through several months worth of email for MyWifeQuitHerJob.com and came to the conclusion that most people get stuck on 2 main things when starting their business .
One , they ca n’t come up with a good business idea and two , they are n’t confident that they can succeed .

I Ca n’t Come Up With An Idea
In fact , one commonality I found interesting is that most would be entrepreneurs are self - deprecating .
“ I ’m not that creative .
How am I going to come up with something unique ? ”
“ The market is saturated already with what I want to do .
Should I even bother ? ” .
“ I do n’t think I have the skills to take on the competition . ”
If you fall into this category , then I highly recommend that you go and read Seth Godin ’s book “ The Purple Cow ” for some inspiration .
Here ’s the thing that most people do n’t realize .
As long as there is demand in your niche and customers with money to spend , what you ultimately decide to sell does n’t really matter as long as you make your business “ remarkable ” in some way .
Choose products that you are interested in and put your own unique spin on it .
I ’ve personally sold many different things in the past and the one thing that I ’ve found is that you can sell almost anything if you position it correctly for a specific audience .
Even if your niche is already crowded , the amount of competition does n’t matter as long as you can stand out .
If you take a closer look at our wedding linens business , my wife and I essentially sell wedding favors on our online store which is a saturated and competitive market .
One quick browse on Etsy instantly reveals thousands of competing products .
Not only that , but many of these items are listed at substantially lower prices too !
In fact , I often get emails from readers wondering how we can make so much selling such a small niche product .
But despite the competition , we ’ve managed to carve out a healthy 6 figure profit which has been growing in the double and triple digits every single year since 2007 .
I also want to emphasize that everyone is creative .
Maybe you ’ve gotten too used to working a day job where your boss simply tells you what to do and you do n’t have to think that much .
Maybe you are simply out of practice .
Set aside some time to brainstorm and exercise those muscles instead of complaining about it .
Solve Your Own Problems
If you often struggle with finding business ideas , the best way to move forward is to simply look at your own everyday problems .
My friend Albert Lee wanted to lose weight and discovered that it was really difficult to keep track of his calorie consumption from the foods that he ate .
So he started the most comprehensive nutrition database online at MyFitnessPal which later sold for over 400 million dollars .

When my wife knew that she was going to cry like a baby at our wedding but could n’t find a place to buy handkerchiefs , we knew that we were onto something .
Click here to listen to our story
When my buddy Greg Mercer had difficulty with his product research on Amazon , he created Jungle Scout for his own personal use and later decided to release it as a product .
In my post on how to find the best products to sell online , I discuss various tools that you can use to discover profitable niches to sell into if you are stuck .
But often times , the best products to sell online are the ones that you personally need the most and do n’t require ANY tools .
The simpler the better !
In a recent podcast episode , my friend Chris Boerner started selling pill holders online because she wanted a fashionable way to carry her medicine .
Pill holders !!!
That ’s almost as silly as selling handkerchiefs !
Remember , you are never alone .
If you have a problem , then chances are other people do too so scratch your own itch !
I ’m Not Sure That I Can Succeed
Overcoming doubt is huge part of the entrepreneurial process but doing research will only take you so far .
Having confidence in your business idea is largely based on knowledge but at some point you need to just take a chance and go for it .
The good thing about running a business online is that it does n’t cost very much money at all to begin .
So why not just throw something up and see what happens ?
This is n’t like the old days when you had to take out a business loan to start a brick and mortar store .
We ’re talking hundreds of dollars , not tens of thousands .
There really is no excuse .
If you do n’t succeed , tweak your idea or start something else .
My wife and I started with $ 630 dollars and turned it into a six figure profit in a year .
My student Jen Depaoli started her online store for less than $ 100 and now makes over $ 50 k / month .

Starting an online business often involves taking a small risk for the potential of an oversized payout .
The expected value calculations are almost always in your favor .
How To Become And Entrepreneur
Early on when my wife and I were brainstorming business ideas , that ’s essentially all we did for a very long time …. we talked about it .
We got stuck in an endless loop of research and could n’t push ourselves to take the plunge for the same reasons outlined above .
But then something miraculous happened .
For starters , my wife became pregnant which put us under time pressure and gave us a sense of urgency .
But the real key to our behavorial change occurred when we started talking to other entrepreneurs and shop owners .
In fact , I remember having a very specific conversation with a former college classmate of mine from Stanford about some of my ingenious business ideas .
Looking back every idea I came up with was kind of silly , the kind of business ideas that would never make more than some weekend spending cash .
When it was my friend ’s turn to talk about what he was up to , he casually told me that his side business was on track to make over 500K in profit this year .
And I was completely flabbergasted .
This whole time , I had thought that his online business was just a pet project that made no money but here he was spouting out numbers that seemed way beyond what I believed that I could ever make .
In fact , his business success made me uncomfortable and I did n’t know what to say because he seemed like he was in another league .
What particularly resonated with me was that my friend was a classmate , a peer of mine , and someone who I considered an equal .
If he could start a website on the side while working a full time job , then I could as well .
Once I realized this , I got a huge boost of confidence and started asking my friend a flood of questions about his business .
And after hanging out with him some more , I came to the conclusion that I needed to think about my future business on a much grander scale .
Your Environment Is Important
What ’s interesting to point out here is that your perception of business success and money are all based on your current context .
Your goals and your potential are largely determined by the people you spend the most time with and how you were brought up .
If I had n’t spoken with my friend that day , I might still be wasting time on ideas that would only make me a few hundred bucks a month .
In fact , the secret to behavioral change is to hang out with the right people , people who will inspire you to try new things and who will push you harder .
Your mindset and your limits are all relative to your environment .
If all of your friends work in dead end day jobs , then chances are you will too .
Instead of making excuses and self - deprecating comments , start talking to people who start businesses all the time .
I guarantee you that you will get inspired and start believing that what was once an impossible task will now be within your grasp .
Initially , you might feel inferior or uncomfortable but getting over these feelings is the only way to grow .

Perspective and tasks of the Socialist Equality Party in 2010
By David North and Joseph Kishore
1 February 2010
The following is an amended version of a report submitted to a national aggregate meeting of the Socialist Equality Party in Ann Arbor , Michigan on January 9 , 2010 .
David North is the national chairman of the SEP .
Joseph Kishore is the national secretary of the SEP .
1. World capitalism enters the second decade of the 21st century in the midst of a deepening economic and geopolitical crisis .
In January 2009 , in the aftermath of the financial meltdown that had begun in September 2008 , the Socialist Equality Party explained that the economic crisis signaled a turning point in the protracted decline in the global position of American capitalism .
The SEP warned that economic restabilization on a capitalist basis could “ be achieved only through … a catastrophic lowering of the living standards of the working class .... ”
We insisted that there could be no “ socially neutral ” resolution to the crisis , and that “ the improvisational responses of the American ruling class to the economic upheaval will solve nothing . ”
On the eve of the inauguration of Barack Obama , the SEP predicted that he would seek a “ solution to the crisis that does not touch the foundations of capitalism and the interests of the financial elite . ”
2 . This evaluation has proven correct .
None of the fundamental causes of the crisis have been addressed .
The contrast between the scale of the disaster that struck in September 2008 and the feckless character of the Obama administration ’s response could not be more striking .
Despite the criminally reckless speculation that wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of workers within the United States and billions of people internationally , Obama avoided any action that impinged on the wealth and interests of Wall Street .
The first priority of the Obama administration was to reassure the financial elite that their wealth would be protected , and that there would be no re-imposition of “ New Deal ” - style restraints on Wall Street gambling .
In fact , the opposite has taken place .
The massive infusion of cash into the world financial system has led , predictably , to a new round of reckless speculation on Wall Street .
Share values have soared , enriching rich speculators while the government does nothing to address the deep distress of the overwhelming majority of the working population .
3 . The conditions confronting the global working class are dire .
A substantial portion of the world ’s population lives in desperate poverty .
The January 12 earthquake in Haiti , which killed 200,000 people , has shocked the entire world .
But the suffering of the Haitian people is unique only in the suddenness of the catastrophe .
Countless thousands die each day of malnutrition , disease and the myriad consequences of global poverty .
Moreover , the staggering dimensions of the Haitian tragedy are rooted in economic and political conditions created by nearly a century of brutal exploitation by American corporations .
Now , the American government views the catastrophe as an opportunity to send in the military and restructure the Haitian economy even more directly in the interests of American capitalism .
The US has blocked desperately needed aid while preventing refugees from fleeing to the United States .
As a result , tens of thousands more Haitians have needlessly died .
As was the case with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Asian tsunami of 2004 , the earthquake in Haiti has revealed the ugly reality of capitalism .
4 . In the United States , the working class faces double - digit unemployment and a relentless assault on jobs , wages and social programs .
The structural imbalances in the world economy — including balance of trade and fiscal deficits , currency conflicts , and the threat of trade wars — have intensified during the past year , contributing to the growing tensions between the major powers .
Whatever the short - term fluctuations in the markets and other economic indices , there will be no return to the status quo that existed before the September 15 , 2008 meltdown .
The crisis marks the breakdown in the global structure of world capitalism as it emerged from the Second World War under the political and economic leadership of the United States .
5 . One hundred years ago , in 1910 , the world capitalist system stood on the brink of the most devastating crisis in history .
Apart from the most perceptive and far - sighted Marxist theoreticians of that period — particularly Lenin , Trotsky and Luxemburg — there was hardly to be found a political thinker who imagined that the second decade of the new 20th century would witness the upheavals of war and revolution .
And yet , the accumulating contradictions of world capitalism and the imperialist system that it had fostered were leading inexorably toward catastrophe .
The global political system , in which the British Empire occupied the leading position , was being undermined by the emergence of powerful capitalist nation states : in Europe , Germany ; in Asia , Japan ; and in North America , the United States .
The mounting geopolitical tensions arose out of and intensified contradictions in the world economic system .
Financial crises such as that which erupted in 1907 signaled the end of a long period of capitalist expansion .
Above all , class tensions were on the rise throughout the world .
Between 1911 and 1913 , a series of war scares and bloody regional conflicts ( especially in the Balkans ) revealed the instability of the world capitalist system .
Finally , in July - August 1914 , World War I broke out .
Less than three years later , in March 1917 , the Russian Revolution began , setting the stage for the Bolshevik conquest of power in October of that year .
These historic events marked the opening stages of an extended period of economic and political breakdown that persisted until the end of World War II in 1945 .
6 . In certain critical respects , the world of 2010 resembles the conditions that existed on the eve of World War I and World War II .
Economic crisis , geopolitical tensions and social instability are greater today than at any time since 1945 .
One essential fact imparts to the existing situation an historically unprecedented character : the position of the United States is fundamentally different today than it was in earlier periods of global instability .
In the earlier periods of crisis , the US was a rising economic power .
In the aftermath of World War I , it replaced Europe as the center of world capitalism .
By the end of World War II , America ’s economic and political dominance over all its capitalist rivals was unchallenged .
Its vast resources proved decisive in establishing a new foundation for the restabilization of world capitalism .
7 . The era of American economic dominance is over .
Despite the immense military resources at its disposal , the United States is , within the framework of world economy , a rapidly declining power .
This profound shift in the economic and political position of the United States has the most far - reaching implications not only for itself , but for the entire world .
The ever more aggressive efforts of the United States to fend off challenges to its global dominance and to shift the burden of its economic decline onto the backs of its competitors are increasingly the most disruptive factors in international economics and politics .
8 . The crash of 2007 - 2008 set into motion a massive restructuring of global geopolitical , economic and social relations .
The crisis arising from this convulsive process will be resolved in one of two ways .
The capitalist solution requires a drastic lowering of the living standards of the American and international working class , internal repression , the destruction of the democratic rights of the working class , and the unleashing of military violence on a scale not seen since World War II .
The only alternative to this capitalist scenario is the socialist solution : that is , the taking of political power by the American and international working class , the establishment of popular democratic control of industrial , financial and natural resources , and the development of a scientifically planned global economy dedicated to the satisfaction of the needs of society as a whole , rather than the destructive pursuit of profit and personal wealth .
The decade in review
9 . On New Year ’s Eve 2000 , billions of people across the globe hoped that the new century would see the birth of a better world — with less violence , poverty and suffering than had existed in the 20th century .
The hope that inspired the international celebration of the new millennium was sincere and deeply felt .
Ten years later , little remains of these naïve hopes .
There is a general sense that conditions of life for masses of people are only getting worse , and that society is turning backwards .
10 .
Among the ruling elites and their political representatives , the new century was greeted with ambitions of an entirely different character .
They believed that the crises and revolutionary upheavals that had threatened the very survival of capitalism in the 20th century belonged to the past , that history — the record of human progress on the basis of class struggle — had come to an end .
The specters of socialism , of the striving of the masses for equality , had been finally exorcised .
Nowhere was the hubris of unbridled power as unrestrained as in the United States .
The American ruling class had convinced itself — in the aftermath of the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union — that its own particularly rapacious form of free - market capitalism had been triumphantly vindicated , that the global hegemony of the United States — as the world ’s “ only superpower ” — was unchallengeable , and that the booming stock market guaranteed the accumulation of ever greater sums of personal wealth .
In the 21st century , the more audacious economists predicted , even the business cycle would cease to exist !
11 . But then , more quickly than they either imagined or feared , reality intervened .
The last decade has dealt heavy blows to the boasting self - confidence of the ruling class .
The change in sentiment — from euphoria to gloom — is reflected in the many demoralized commentaries appearing in the press .
In its cover story on “ The Decade from Hell , ” Time magazine comments , “ Bookended by 9/11 at the start and a financial wipeout at the end , the first 10 years of this century will very likely go down as the most dispiriting and disillusioning decade Americans have lived through in the post - World War II era . ”
The German magazine Der Spiegel writes , “ It was a decade filled with crisis years : the 9/11 crisis , the climate crisis , the financial crisis and the crisis of democracy .
Taken together , they represent a general crisis for the West .
Things could hardly have gone any worse over the course of the decade . ”
The British Financial Times adds , “ Comparing the America that began the 21st century with the America of today is to witness a country that has in some ways quite radically altered its view of itself and its relationship to the world .
In short , the metallic rust of decline has crept into the American soul . ”
12 . The first decade of the 21st century witnessed the descent of American capitalism into criminality in all spheres of its activities , both within and beyond the borders of the United States .
In foreign policy , the American ruling class seized on the events of September 11 , 2001 — whose shadowy provenance has never been adequately investigated or explained — to pursue global objectives that had long been under intense discussion within the highest levels of the government , the military and the intelligence agencies .
The United States government , abetted by the media , lied to justify its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
In violation of international law , the “ war on terror ” became a catchphrase used cynically to legitimize the ever - expanding deployment of military forces in Central Asia , the Middle East , and , most recently , the Horn of Africa .
The American ruling class is determined to defend its global position by asserting control over the key geostrategic regions of the world .
This military aggression has continued with the Obama administration ’s “ surge ” in Afghanistan in 2009 , and the addition of a new country — Yemen — to the list of existing and potential targets .
13 . Imperialism , as Lenin wrote nearly a century ago , “ is reaction all down the line . ”
The “ war on terror ” unleashed a war on human rights .
The nation that was born with the proclamation of man ’s “ inalienable rights ” has become the remorseless perpetrator of violence , mass terror and brutality against individuals .
During the past decade , the US government and its accomplices introduced words and phrases into common usage that have become synonymous with state - sponsored sadism and inhumanity : Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Blackwater , enemy combatant , enhanced interrogation , water - boarding , rendition , Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld .
14 .
In economics , the boundaries between legitimate business , speculation and outright fraud were effaced .
A decade that began with the deflation of the dot.com stock market bubble in 2000 , followed by the bankruptcy of Enron in late 2001 , ended with the collapse of the bubble in mortgage - backed securities , a worldwide financial panic , and a multitrillion - dollar bailout of the banks .
Amidst the concentration of staggering levels of wealth in the hands of a few , social inequality in the United States assumed obscene dimensions .
For some time it had been argued by apologists for capitalism that the immense growth of inequality was a temporary phenomenon , bound up with new technologies and the transition from an industrial to an “ information - based ” society .
Developments during the past decade have made all too clear that extreme levels of inequality are irreversible within the framework of the profit system , and are likely to grow even worse .
American society has degenerated into an oligarchy , controlled by financial and corporate parasites whose interests and desires are politically reactionary , economically irrational , culturally backward and harmful in every conceivable way to the health and progress of society .
15 .
The state of democratic institutions within the United States reflects the pressures of unrestrained militarism , financial parasitism and social inequality .
The last decade began with the theft of the 2000 presidential election .
A 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision to halt the recount in Florida placed in power the candidate who had a half - million fewer votes than his opponent and who had clearly lost the election .
In subsequent elections , the American people sought to express their opposition to the war policies of the US government , but in every case mass sentiment was suppressed , deflected and ignored , a process in which the Democratic Party and its various liberal and middle - class supporters played a critical role .
16 .
After eight years of Bush , who left office the most hated president in US history , the American people elected Barack Obama .
Appealing to widespread discontent and marketing himself as the candidate of “ hope ” and “ change , ” Obama became the first African - American president .
But during his first year in office it has become patently clear that nothing of any real importance will change — at least , not for the better .
Having elected a man whose ethnic background , it was widely hoped , would make him more sensitive to the cares of ordinary people , working people have discovered , instead , a cold - hearted president who empathizes only with the rich .
The obvious continuity with the Bush administration , on every aspect of policy , has rapidly alienated public opinion , resulting in the stunning defeat for the Democratic Party in the recent Massachusetts Senate election .
The “ candidate of change ” is proving to millions of people that change is impossible through the existing political institutions .
The only change that people “ can believe in ” is that which emerges out of the revolutionary political struggle of the working class for socialism .
The world situation in 2010
17 .
The crisis of world capitalism is rooted in the contradictions of the capitalist system : between socialized production and private ownership of the means of production , and between a global economy and the nation - state system .
Today , they find their most concentrated expression in the United States , which is ruled by an elite determined to defend its interests through war abroad and intensified exploitation at home .
In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in December , Obama made clear that the aggressive expansion of American imperialism will continue unabated under the new administration .
Coming only a week after the escalation of the war in Afghanistan , Obama insisted in his speech that the US had the right to “ act unilaterally if necessary ” and to launch wars whose purpose “ extends beyond self - defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor . ”
In other words , the US , which the president emphasized was “ the world ’s sole military superpower , ” proclaims the right to invade any country on virtually any pretext .
18 . Whatever the hopes of the American ruling class , however , the belief that it can counteract its economic decline through military force is a reactionary delusion whose consequences , unless stopped by the conscious political intervention of the working class , can lead only to catastrophe .
In Iraq , after slaughtering over a million people and destroying what was once a modern society , the US has succeeded in establishing an unstable puppet regime , balancing atop various competing sectarian interests that continually threaten to erupt into civil war .
In Afghanistan , more than eight years of war have produced for the US an equally unstable regime and a situation for American imperialism that increasingly resembles Vietnam .
19 .
Beyond these wars , the US confronts a host of rising regional and even global powers that threaten its position — including Iran , India , Brazil and , above all , China — as well as the old powers in Europe and Russia .
US attempts to dominate smaller powers increasingly threaten to spark a broader conflagration .
It would not be difficult to write down one or two dozen scenarios for the outbreak of a new world war .
20 .
The US relationship with China is among the most volatile elements in the world geopolitical situation today .
China is a challenger to the US not only in East Asia , where it is working on setting up regional trade organizations , but also Central Asia , the Middle East , Africa and even Latin America .
The decline of the United States has been accompanied by the enormous economic growth of China , which now has the world ’s second largest economy and just surpassed Germany as the largest exporter .
As the US has been transformed from the principal creditor into the principal debtor nation , China , which owns nearly $ 1 trillion in American debt , has accumulated the world ’s largest current account surplus .
21 . Under conditions of crisis , the economic interdependence between the US and China is fraught with tension .
The Copenhagen Climate Change summit in December highlighted the strains in relations between the two countries , as well as between the United States and Europe .
Early in the New Year , China reacted bitterly to US plans to approve new arms sales to Taiwan , along with Obama ’s preparations to meet the Dalai Lama .
The US has raised persistent demands that China allow the value of its currency to rise , while China has warned that the easy money policy of the US Federal Reserve threatens to undermine the value of the dollar and destabilize the entire world currency market .
There is a very real possibility of a currency or trade war .
The United States has already slapped tariffs on a number of Chinese exports , including steel and tires .
Liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ended the year with a bellicose column directed against China ( “ Chinese New Year , ” December 31 ) .
Charging that China ’s economic and trade policy was “ predatory , ” Krugman warned , “ Chinese mercantilism is a growing problem , and the victims of that mercantilism have little to lose from a trade confrontation .
So I ’d urge China ’s government to reconsider its stubbornness .
Otherwise , the very mild protectionism it ’s currently complaining about will be the start of something much bigger . ”
In an earlier column , Financial Times commentator Martin Wolf had Obama speak what Wolf felt should be said to Chinese President Hu Jintao : “ What you may fail to understand is the speed with which democracies can shift their attitude from the open hand to the clenched fist . ”
22 . The economic growth of China , India , Brazil and other countries is superimposed on societies riven by desperate poverty and staggeringly high levels of inequality .
Their political structures are highly vulnerable to popular discontent .
One of the principal factors behind China ’s refusal to accede to American demands that it increase the value of its currency is the fear that the resulting drop in exports will lead to a surge in unemployment that could completely destabilize the regime .
23 .
There are other major points of geopolitical conflict .
The end of the Soviet Union was seen as an opportunity by the US to intervene in regions — including Central Asia , Eastern Europe and the Caucasus — traditionally considered Russia ’s backyard .
The US backed a series of “ color revolutions , ” particularly in Georgia and Ukraine , in an attempt to place in power regimes more amenable to its interests .
Tensions between the US and Russia came close to taking an open form when Georgia , backed by the United States , invaded the pro-Russian autonomous republic of South Ossetia in the summer of 2008 .
24 .
As for US relations with Europe , the tensions that were exposed in the run-up to the Iraq war continue to fester .
During the Cold War period , the United States emphasized the importance of an alliance with Western Europe .
The rebuilding of Europe and the promotion of international institutions were part of the attempt by the American ruling class to contain the Soviet Union and prevent socialist revolution in Europe itself .
Now , the more basic tendency in the US - Europe relationship , in which American power comes at the expense of Europe , is reasserting itself .
Hopes among European powers that the election of Obama would mark a return to “ multilateralism ” have been shattered .
The social crisis in America
25 . Many decades ago , Leon Trotsky described the United States as the most frightened country in the world .
This ironic observation , written when the United States was the greatest industrial power , is timelier than ever .
The American ruling class sees challenges , threats and mortal danger in every corner of the globe .
And yet , the greatest threat to its dominance lies in the mounting social tensions within the United States itself .
The extraordinary degree to which massive wealth is concentrated in a very small percentage of the American population is not compatible with social stability .
The ever - more obvious fact that gross inequality is a basic feature of American society is leading to profound and enduring changes in social consciousness among broad masses of workers .
The ability of the reactionary trade unions to suppress working class resistance to exploitation and injustice is reaching its outermost limits .
A new period of explosive social struggles is rapidly approaching .
26 . Conditions for the broad mass of the population in the US continue to deteriorate .
Some 40 million people now live in poverty , while 6 million people ( or 2 percent of the population ) have no income , subsisting on food stamps alone .
By the end of the decade , official unemployment in the US had reached 10 percent , with some 4.2 million jobs wiped out in 2009 .
The latest figures released on January 8 show that the US lost another 85,000 jobs in December .
The official unemployment rate remained steady largely due to the fact that tens of thousands more people have simply given up looking for work .
The official labor force — those the government considers to be looking for work — actually contracted by 661,000 in the month , contributing to a rise in the broader measure of unemployment to 17.3 percent , which also includes millions of people who are involuntarily working part - time .
27 .
In some states and cities , the crisis has already reached Depression - like conditions .
In Michigan , unemployment is officially 14.7 percent .
In the state ’s largest city , Detroit , real unemployment is about 50 percent .
California , the country ’s most populous state , has an official unemployment rate of 12.3 percent .
Long - term unemployment is becoming a common aspect of American life , with nearly 40 percent of the unemployed having been out of work for 27 weeks or longer .
The collapse of housing prices beginning in 2007 has led to a surge of home foreclosures , reaching a record 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Another 3 million Americans are expected to lose their homes this year .
28 . The decade was one of the worst for jobs in US history .
The Washington Post recently noted : “ There has been zero net job creation since December 1999 .
No previous decade going back to the 1940s had job growth of less than 20 percent .
Economic output rose at its slowest rate of any decade since the 1930s as well . ”
29 . Incomes for American workers have declined , as has the net worth of American households .
In real terms , average weekly wages fell by 1 percent in 2009 , even as productivity soared .
An article in the Los Angeles Times , comments : “ All the triumphalist rhetoric emanating from Wall Street and the White House notwithstanding , this was — materially speaking — a disastrous decade for US families .
For the first time since World War II , according to the Departments of Commerce and Labor , an average American ’s net worth actually fell — by a whopping 13 percent . ”
This contrasts with a growth in net worth of 44 percent in the 1990s ; 35 percent in the 1980s ; 12 percent in the 1970s ; 25 percent in the 1960s ; and 26 percent in the 1950s .
The Obama administration
30 . Barack Obama has proved an immense disappointment to the millions of workers who voted him into office .
They realize that his campaign promises were empty and dishonest .
In every element of its policy , the Obama administration has confirmed its allegiance to the super - rich .
In its domestic policy , the administration ’s single - minded aim has been to rescue the financial aristocracy and place the full burden of the crisis on the working class .
Barely a year after the onset of a financial meltdown that has had such devastating implications worldwide , the American financial aristocracy is doing better than ever , thanks to the trillions of dollars provided by Obama .
The administration refused to place any serious constraints on executive compensation , and as a result some of the largest Wall Street firms handed out record pay and bonuses at the end of 2009 .
Obama is now leading a campaign to reduce consumption , but this applies only to the working class .
The signal for a national campaign of wage - cutting was given early in the administration with the forced bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler , which was used as an opportunity to impose , with the support of the union leadership , a new round of draconian concessions on auto workers .
31 . In decades past , workers looked to the federal government as an instrument for implementing social reforms and expanding democratic rights .
In the 1930s , in response to the Great Depression and the growth of class tensions , President Roosevelt oversaw a series of New Deal reforms , including Social Security , the Tennessee Valley Authority and new bank regulations .
Later , in the 1960s , the federal government oversaw civil rights legislation and the creation of Medicare and Medicaid .
In both circumstances , the bourgeoisie was responding to the social crisis and an upsurge in class conflict by putting in place reform measures designed to save the capitalist system .
The ultimate basis of these reforms was the economic strength of the United States .
This now belongs to distant history .
For four decades , the federal government has spearheaded a massive attack on the working class , beginning in the early 1970s , when the administration of Richard Nixon first attempted to impose wage controls .
32 . The actions of the government call into question the very structure of the United States .
Every instrument of the federal state — Congress , the judiciary and the executive branch — is under the stranglehold of a financial aristocracy .
Washington is consuming ever - greater resources to finance the military and bank bailouts .
The Obama administration has refused aid to the states , which are facing a new round of budget deficits this year .
The financial and corporate elite ’s junior partners in state governments are responding by slashing spending on health care , education and other social services .
The meager scale of funds made available as part of the “ Race to the Top ” education program , conditioned on the implementation of right - wing education policies , underscores the administration ’s determination to force states to eliminate budget deficits on the backs of the working class .
Opposition will emerge in different states and regions to this attack .
New forms of political organization , spearheaded by the development of a revolutionary socialist movement , will be required to unify workers throughout the country in a common struggle .
33 .
The principal “ reform ” sought by the Obama administration — the health care overhaul — demonstrates the determination of the financial elite to slash spending on social programs .
The primary purpose of this essentially reactionary initiative is to cut government spending on entitlement programs , particularly Medicare .
The response of the ruling class to an aging population and rising life expectancy , combined with the availability of new tests and procedures to treat illness , is to enforce a more class - based system of health care .
Obama has focused on health care cuts as the key to addressing the growing fiscal deficit in the US , enormously increased by the bank bailouts .
He declared in a speech in September , “ our health care problem is our deficit problem .
Nothing else comes close . ”
In the wake of the Democratic defeat in Massachusetts , the Obama administration is moving even further to the right , quickly moving to abandon even the pretense of reform and “ universal coverage ” contained in the health care overhaul .
34 .
The provision of decent health care , education and social services to the working class is simply incompatible with the conditions of mass exploitation that the financial aristocracy is determined to impose .
In a recent article in Foreign Affairs , C. Fred Bergsten , head of the Peterson Institute , a highly influential think tank run by Democratic Party strategists , lays out some of the plans of the ruling class .
To slash federal deficits , Bergsten insists that the most important step is “ containing long - term medical costs , an integral component of overall health - care reform , that could save several percentage points ’ worth of GDP . ”
Other proposals supported by Bergsten include “ comprehensive Social Security reform , including gradual increases in the retirement age and an alteration of the benefits formula to reflect increases in prices rather than in wages , ” and “ raising taxes on consumption , which would both generate needed revenue and provide new incentives for private saving … ”
The resurgence of class struggle and the tasks of the Socialist Equality Party
35 .
The world capitalist system is entering a new period of revolutionary upheaval .
The continuation of capitalism must lead not only to the impoverishment of the working class , but also to a global imperialist war that threatens the very future of human civilization .
However , there is a way out of this crisis .
The objective conditions for socialist revolution — both in terms of technology and personnel — are far more developed now than ever before .
The social weight of the working class has increased enormously over the past century , while revolutionary advances in communication and technology have created the conditions for coordinated action on a world scale .
36 .
As the crisis intensifies , the sclerotic character of the political structures becomes more and more evident .
The traditional political parties and institutions provide no means by which the working class can defend itself against the capitalist onslaught .
Within the United States , the Democratic and Republican parties represent the same class interests .
They jointly constitute a “ bipartisan ” system of political and social reaction .
Notwithstanding the differences in political traditions and history , the same situation prevails internationally .
The old political labels of “ labor , ” “ socialist , ” and “ communist ” that various parties still affix to themselves in Europe , Asia , Latin America and Australia no longer signify any form of genuine opposition to capitalism — or even politically significant differences with the main right - wing bourgeois parties .
37 .
As for the trade unions , the analysis that was made by the International Committee of the Fourth International more than 20 years ago — that if workers are to resist the corporate attack on jobs and wages , they must first of all break free of the shackles of these organizations — has proven absolutely correct .
In the US , the AFL - CIO and the Change to Win Coalition are not “ working class organizations , ” but auxiliary organs of the state and secondary instruments in the exploitation of the working class , presided over by upper - middle - class executives for whom the “ labor movement ” is a business , a means of expanding their own personal wealth .
Not one of these organizations has engaged in a significant social struggle in more than a generation .
They see their primary responsibility as enforcing concessions , often in exchange for lucrative payoffs to the union executives — as in the UAW ’s VEBA program .
38 .
The absence of organized forms for the expression of mass protest creates a deceptive appearance of political stability .
But beneath the surface , popular discontent grows steadily and seeks an outlet .
The time is approaching when this opposition will erupt outside of the existing and discredited framework of official political life .
It will develop in direct conflict with the Democratic and Republican parties , with the Obama administration , with the trade unions and with the capitalist system .
The Socialist Equality Party will do everything in its power to encourage the formation of new and independent organizations of popular struggle , and to assist in the development of their program and tactics .
The deepening social crisis will provoke innumerable struggles and forms of popular resistance .
But the decisive issue remains the question of revolutionary leadership .
The task of organizing an international socialist movement of the working class , of educating a new generation of workers and youth in the perspectives and history of Marxism , falls on the Socialist Equality Party and our sister parties in the International Committee of the Fourth International .
This post will outline the steps you can use to build xmonad cleanly on a Snow Leopard system .
This is a follow - up post to our prior post on minimalist X window managers on OS X which addressed xmonad and ratpoison on OS X Leopard .
The rationale and benefits of a simple and clean X11 window manager on OS X are outlined clearly in that post .
Thanks to baconpiggypiggy for testing and sharing test patches for making this work on Snow Leopard , in the interest of more efficient desktops everywhere .
It was previously possible by bootstrapping binaries from previous OS X builds , various source patches , etc. , but it is quite exciting to have it available for simple and easy setup .
These steps should work whether you are booting into 32 - bit or 64 - bit mode .
The steps are as follows :
1 . Be running a relatively vanilla Snow Leopard installation .
2. Run the “ Optional Installs ” installer from the Snow Leopard media .
Under “ Applications ” , find “ X11 ” and install it on your system .
3. Install Xcode from the Snow Leopard media .
4. Run Software Update to address any Xcode updates .
5. Download and run through the installer for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler ( GHC ) ( latest is version 6.12.1 as of posting ) .
6. Launch Terminal.app and run this script to install the Haskell X11 library
cd /tmp
umask 022
curl - O http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/X11/1.5.0.0/X11-1.5.0.0.tar.gz
tar xfz X11-1.5.0.0.tar.gz
cd X11-1.5.0.0
runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install
7 . Run this script to install the Haskell MTL library :
cd /tmp
umask 022
curl - O http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/mtl/1.1.0.2/mtl-1.1.0.2.tar.gz
tar xfz mtl-1.1.0.2.tar.gz
cd mtl-1.1.0.2
runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install
8 . Run this script to install xmonad :
cd /tmp
umask 022
curl - O http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/xmonad/0.9.1/xmonad-0.9.1.tar.gz
tar xfz xmonad-0.9.1.tar.gz
cd xmonad-0.9.1
runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
runhaskell Setup.lhs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install
9. Launch X11 , and set a few settings in preferences .
On the “ Input ” tab , ensure that only the following two options are checked : “ Emulate three - button mouse ” , and “ Enable key equivalents under X11 ” .
Close X11 .
10 .
Pull down awesome X11 fonts from proggyclean .
11 . Save them in ~/ Desktop / fonts / or a directory of your choice .
Gunzip the PCF files .
11 . Run mkfontdir in the directory to create a fonts dir file .
12 . Copy over the stock xinitrc : cp /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc
~/.xinitrc
13 .
In ~/.xinitrc , comment out the if / for loop that runs the stuff in / usr / X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ twm , clock , and the xterms .
14 . Append to ~/.xinitc :
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/10-fontdir.sh
xset fp+ ~/ Desktop / fonts
xset fp rehash
cd
quartz - wm -- only - proxy &
/usr/local/bin/xmonad &
xterm
15 . Create ~/.Xmodmap with the following contents :
clear Mod1
clear Mod2
keycode 63 = Mode_switch
keycode 66 = Meta_L
add Mod1 = Meta_L
add Mod2 = Mode_switch
16 . Create ~/. Xdefaults with the following contents ( adjust the font name if you selected a font other than ProggyTiny with slashed zero ) :
XTerm*font : -*-proggytinysz-medium-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
XTerm*reverseVideo : on
*VT100*reverseVideo : on
17 . Launch X11 .
Enjoy !
A couple of notes :
Cut and pasting : within X11 only , you can highlight text and it will be placed on the clipboard to put it on the clipboard for aqua apps , hit command -c as usual with aqua apps to paste within X11 ( from either X11 or aqua ) , just use option - click or middle - click
window and virtual desktop layout : ctrl -n – new xterm option - 1 through option - 9 will take you through different workspaces in xmonad , which are independent of OS X “ spaces ” option -. and option - , will rotate and redo tiling of windows
This setup and tmux are a winning combination for maximum OS X command line efficiency .
This set of images , where the Star Wars scenes appear so realistic , is called “ StArt Wars ” .
The shooting of the photos happened in Dubai and is directed by photographer Cedric Delsaux from France .
The project shows how Star Wars would look if it took place on the earth instead of the space .

Fosamax : Is Long Term Use of Bone Strengthening Drug Linked to Fractures ?
A popular class of osteoporosis drugs may have opposite effect , experts say .
March 9 , 2010  -- Sandy Potter , 59 of Queens , New York , was jumping rope with neighborhood children when she felt her thigh bone snap .
" I went up in the air and I came straight down to the ground , " Potter said .
" The pain was excruciating . "
Potter , who was diagnosed with osteoporosis at age 48 , had been taking the popular osteoporosis drug Fosamax for eight years before her femur literally snapped in two .
Fosamax , one in a class of drugs called bisphosphonates , is supposed to make bones stronger .
But now there 's mounting evidence that for some women , taking Fosamax or its generic alendronate for more than five years could cause spontaneous fractures .
" We are seeing people just walking , walking down the steps , patients who are doing low - energy exercise , " said Dr. Kenneth Egol , professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center .
" Very unusual , the femur is one of the strongest bones in the body . "
Egol said X - rays of some of his patients look more like an injury endured by a car accident than an otherwise minimal fall .
" Over the last 18 months we are seeing this more frequently , " he said .
Sue Heller , 60 , of Castle Rock , Colo. , had been on Fosamax for almost 10 years .
She broke both of her femur bones .
" I 'm sure there are a lot of women who have brittle bones right now that maybe are ready to break , and they 're not aware of it , " said Heller .
" And my heart aches for them . "
Sales of the popular drug increased when doctors began prescribing it not only to women showing signs of osteoporosis , but also those who were osteopenic , and thus , at risk for the disease .
Now some doctors worry that staying on the drug for more than five years can cause some women 's bones to become more brittle .
Weighing the Risks
This is not the first time that many doctors have reported an opposite effect for many people taking the drug .
Fosamax has already been linked to severe musculoskeletal pain , as well as to a serious bone - related jaw disease called osteonecrosis .
" In worldwide post - marketing experience with FOSAMAX / FOSAMAX Plus D , rare reports consistent with osteonecrosis of the jaw have been received .
Many of these reports lack sufficient clinical details to make definitive assessments and / or are confounded , particularly since a generally accepted definition of ONJ in the general population is unknown , " responded Merck in a written response to the suggested link .
" Rare cases of ONJ have also been reported in patients who do not have osteoporosis and who have not taken any bisphosphonate medicines . "
In 2008 , the Food and Drug Administration reached out to the pharmaceutical company Merck about the reports of femur fractures .
After 16 months , Merck added patients ' reports of femur fractures to the list of possible side effects reported by patients included in the drug 's package insert .
" It took Merck an entire year to respond , " said ABC News senior health and medical editor , Dr. Richard Besser .
" Just six words : ' low energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures . ' "
The FDA has also never made an effort to inform the public or doctors across the country who prescribe bisphosphonates of the possible side effect , said Besser .
Both the FDA and Merck declined ABC News ' request for an interview .
The FDA said they are looking into reports of fractures .
" Nothing is more important to Merck than the safety of its medicines , " according to a written statement by Merck to ABC News .
A causal relationship between Fosamax and these fractures has not been established , according to Merck .
" The drug companies have to recognize when there is a problem , they have to be up front with the public .
If there 's a concern , they have to voice it and at least give everybody a fair chance to look at this carefully , " said Dr. Joseph Lane , orthopedic trauma surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City .
How Much for How Long
Many studies suggest an overall benefit from taking the medication for women who are at risk for osteoperosis .
In fact , bisphosphonates can help prevent hip and spine fractures , which for many women may lead to death .
" Normally your bone is constantly being remade , " said Dr. Joseph Lane , chief of metabolic bone disease at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City .
" These patients do n't remake their bone and they acquire damage , microdamage , the collagen gets altered and we need to rejuvenate the skeleton . "
In 2008 , bisphosphonate sales exceeded $ 3.5 billion according to data from IMS Health .
In 2008 , over 37 million prescriptions were written for the osteoporosis medications .
While some physicians use bone density scans to help drive their decisions , doctors generally prescribe them to women who are at an increased risk for either osteoporosis or fractures from osteoporosis they already have .
A new tool developed by the World Health Organization can determine the risk of having fractures and can help doctors determine which women with osteoporosis should be treated with medications .
Although bisphosphonates are generally recommended for postmenopausal women , research does not indicate how long women should be on the drug .
Many doctors now recommend a five - year limit .
" When they are on it for five , six , seven or eight years , they lost their ability to remodel and regenerate their skeleton , " said Lane .
" [ Some women ] are very vulnerable and they will then develop problems of brittle bone . "
Additional time on the medication depends on doctors ' orders , said Besser .

When it comes to awards ceremonies in America , this perfect acceptable :
But this is offensive and inappropriate :
It does n’t make a bit of sense .
Here in graphical form is the season - to - season NHL history of the Edmonton Oilers .
Since the old standard of .500 no longer means what it used to in Gary Bettman 's NHL , I have expressed Oilers points as a percentage of league average ; for example , through 44 games in 2009 - 10 , Oilers have a Pts % of .420 against a league average Pts % of .563 , so they currently rank in the 75th percentile .
This is not quite as bad as the 1992 - 93 Oilers ( 72nd percentile ) in terms of relative badness ; that said the current season has a long way to go and current trends are , shall we say , not promising .
The larger squares represent seasons where the team made the playoffs ; the smaller diamonds are missed playoffs .
With another idle postseason all but written in stone -- Oilers would have to go something like 32 - 6 to overtake the pace of the 8th place team -- the obvious comparison of the current team is with the 1992 - 96 Oilers , who also missed the playoffs four consecutive seasons .
One similarity is that both the 1992 conference finalists and 2006 Stanley Cup finalists fell off a cliff the following season .
A key difference , however , is that the ' 92 - 96 teams showed steady if incrementally small improvement year over year before finally making a push in the fifth year .
The current Oilers , on the other hand , made something of a resurgence in 2007 - 08 with the improbable and ultimately unsuccessful stretch drive , only to fall back a little the next year and a whole lot this year .
Incremental improvement would be a whole lot easier to accept than what has happened over the past season and a half .
One area where the '09 - 10 Oil is poised to make history is its overall finish in the standings .
Currently the Oilers rank 29th in the 30 - team NHL , second - worst in the league .
In their previous proud 30 - year , 29 - season NHL history , the Oilers have never once finished in the bottom 3 of the league .
Moreover , the Oilers have never once " earned " on their own ( de ) merits , a draft pick that was even in the top 5 in the NHL .
The only time Oilers ever drafted top 5 was when they picked up a 4th overall selection from Winnipeg in the Dave Manson for Boris Mironov , Mats Lindgren and the first rounder from the second - last place Jets .
The Oilers bottomed out at fourth - last that same year of 1993 - 94 , however both picks got bumped down two spots due to expansion .
After the jump in tabular form is the Oilers finish , draft order , and what they did with their first round picks since 1979 .
Significant players are shown in bold , with the jury still out on the last few seasons .
Note : you may have to set your screen on the " wide " setting ( located to the immediate right on this page ) to read the right hand column .

Claiming illegal disfranchisement , the American Civil Liberties Uunion filed a lawsuit this week in U.S. District Court in South Dakota on behalf of a group of Native American voters who were denied the right to vote in the 2008 election .
According to a statement from the ACLU , Kim Colhoff , Eileen Janis and others were denied the right to vote after they were improperly removed from the voter rolls because of felony convictions .
Both women were denied their right to vote illegally because South Dakota allows only for disfranchisement while a person is in prison , the civil liberties organization explained .
According to Robert Doody , executive director of the ACLU ’s South Dakota chapter , the South Dakota law disproportionately impacts American Indians in that state .
Further , he said , the law creates situations like this case where voters are unlawfully denied the right to vote because of improper execution of election laws .
“ It ’s clear , ” Doody added , “ that confusion regarding the South Dakota felony disfranchisement laws has resulted in legitimate voters , even those who have n’t been incarcerated for felony convictions , being purged from the rolls or denied the ability to register to vote or cast their ballots . ”
According to the ACLU , the voters whom they represent voted for the first time more than 25 years ago and remained on the voter rolls until this incident in 2008 .
Both Colhoff and Janis were convicted of felonies and sentenced to probation but served no prison time .
The lawsuit also charges that the disfranchisement created a humiliating experience at the polling place for Colhoff and Janis , both residents of Pine Ridge , S.D. .
Neither person had been informed that they had been removed from the voter rolls until they tried to vote .
In front of other voters , election officials denied them the right to vote .
The ACLU lawsuit aims to get the courts to strike down the South Dakota law under the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment as well as provisions of the Help America Vote Act , the National Voter Registration Act and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
“ I will never get the chance to go back and make my voice heard , ” said Janis .
“ No one should be denied a ballot just because election workers do n’t understand the rules .
It ’s really hard not feeling like a second - class citizen when one of my most fundamental rights has been stolen from me . ”
ACLU staff attorneys stated that the law is confusing , targets a group of people unfairly and robbed voters of their legitimate right to participate in the historic 2008 election .

It seemed to be a medical miracle : the car crash victim assumed for 23 years to be in a coma who was suddenly found to be conscious and able to communicate by tapping on a computer .
The sceptics said it was impossible – and it was .
The story of Rom Houben of Belgium , which made headlines worldwide last November when he was shown to be " talking " , was today revealed to have been nothing of the sort .
Dr Steven Laureys , one of the doctors treating him , acknowledged that his patient could not make himself understood after all .
Facilitated communication , the technique said to have made Houben 's apparent contact with the outside world possible , did not work , Laureys declared .
" We did not have all the facts before , " he said .
" To me , it 's enough to say that this method does n't work . "
Just three months ago the doctor was proclaiming that Houben had been trapped in his own body , the victim of a horrendous ­misdiagnosis , and only rescued from his terrible plight thanks to medical advances .
At that time Houben was pictured using the technology , which involves a speech therapist being guided by a patient to write words using a keyboard .
A basic test appeared to prove it was indeed Houben who was communicating .
" I shall never forget the day when they discovered what was truly wrong with me , " Houben apparently tapped .
" It was my second birth .
I want to read , talk with my friends via the computer and enjoy my life now that people know I am not dead . "
" Just imagine , " he purportedly typed .
" You hear , see , feel and think , but no one can see that . "
Laureys , leader of the coma science group and department of neurology at Liege University hospital , said a study he had done of three speech therapists working with minimally - conscious patients showed that in two cases , including Houben 's , facilitated communication failed .
" From the start , I did not prescribe this technique .
But it is important not to make judgments .
His family and care­givers acted out of love and compassion , " he said .
The turnaround vindicates those doctors who had doubted Houben 's apparent ability .
" It 's like using an Ouija board , " said Arthur Caplan , a professor of bio­ethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
" It was too good to be true , and we should n't have believed it . "
Facilitated communication can be used with some patients but should be avoided with patients such as Houben who are severely brain injured , said Tom McMillan , a professor of neuropsychology at Glasgow University .
" It has an inter­mediary who can exert control and that can affect the outcome , " he said .
Phimuemue , in a recent post ( at the time of writing , anyway ) present his variation on sorting floating point values using radix sort .
His implementation was n’t dealing with the pesky sign bit so I offered a slight modification to his algorithm as a comment on his blog .
But for some reason , he did not allow to post it .
So I ’ll present my solution here .
So this is the verbatim text I sent as a comment :
I am a big fan of Radix Sort myself .
Using on float always have bugged me because it ’s rather hard to get an implementation that is completely safe .
The C standard does n’t enforce floats to be IEEE754 in the first place , although I know of no compiler nor modern CPU that are n’t IEEE754 ( and those who are n’t probably use integer - like fixed point , so it should still work correctly ) .
To make things even more troublesome , the standard does n’t guaranty at all that sizeof ( int ) ==sizeof ( float ) .
Int should be replaced by int32_t or uint32_t from the C99 standard header < stdint.h > , after testing the actual size of floats ( although I ’m not sure how to do that cleanly ) .
Dealing with negatives is not that hard , since the array would be mostly sorted ( small to big positive numbers , then large to small negative numbers … something like 1 2 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 ) .
If we have negative numbers , we just swap the top and bottom part of the array , and we ’re done * .
My code looks like : // 32 - bits version !
void radix_sort_3 ( float array [ ] , size_t count ) { int zeroes=0 ; float temp_array [ count ] ; // c99 only float * warray = temp_array ; for ( uint32_t radix=1 ; radix ; radix < < =1 ) { uint32_t * iarray = ( uint32 _t *) array ; int count0=0 ; int count1=0 ; zeroes=0 ; for ( int j=0 ; j<count ; ++j ) zeroes += !( iarray [ j ] &radix ) ; count1=zeroes ; for ( int j=0 ; j < count ; ++j ) if ( iarray [ j ] &radix ) { warray [ count1 ] =array[j ] ; ++ count1 ; } else { warray [ count0 ] =array[j ] ; ++ count0 ; } // we wo n't copy that // each time !
swap ( ( float **) &warray , &array ) ; } // here ' array ' is restored to // its original value .
// are there negatives ? // if ( zeroes < count ) { // oh noes !
we must swap parts // before leaving ! memcpy ( warray +( count - zeroes ) , array , zeroes * sizeof ( float ) ) ; for ( int d=0 , j=count-1 ;j> =zeroes ;j--,d++) warray [ d ] =array[j ] ; memcpy ( array , warray , count * sizeof ( float ) ) ; } } I changed the copy in each iteration by a swap - buffers - by - pointers operation .
My version is a bit more type - safe , but not completely .
In particular , it ’s not endian - safe .
If integers and float have different endians on the target machine ( I do n’t think there ’s such a machine , but then again … ) the code wo n’t work .
* that ’s not an entirely accurate description of what the algorithm does .
In fact , it does swap top and bottom parts of the array , but does a reverse copy in the lower part , ensuring we list numbers from smallest to largest in all cases .
My solution is n’t that bad , actually .
At least it prevents the toggling of the sign bit ( and can been seen as a variation on this solution , which I discovered a bit later ) .
*
* *
The problem with all solutions is that they suppose IEEE 754 floating points , which neither of the C nor C++ standards guaranty .
You may or may n’t have IEEE 754 floats .
So , in theory , this poses a portability problem .
In practice , I ca n’t think of a non-legacy system where the floating point numbers for C and C++ were n’t in IEEE 754 .
It still however poses the problem of endians .
Endianness determines how larger data types are stored in memory .
For example , in a small endian system , the least significant bytes of a multi - byte integer are found at the lower addresses , while on a big endian system , the most significant byte is stored first , at the lower address .
This means that the bits you ’re looking for may not exactly be were you think it is .
Endianness is indirectly taken care of if int and float have the same storage order — both big or both small endian — but that ’s not always the case .
For example , on a MIPS R10000 CPU ( which was in SGI ’s Oxygen workstations ) , floats were stored in “ normal order ” and integers were stored in big endian order … if I remember correctly .
*
* *
Of course , I am kind of familiar with sorting in general , and I ’ve done a number of things with radix sort before .
I ’ve done a paper on this in Dr. Dobb ’s Journal quite a while ago and revisited the results and techniques recently here and here

White House economic adviser Paul Volcker recommends euthanasia for non-bank financial institutions that threaten the financial system .
“ If a big , non - bank institution gets in trouble and threatens the whole system , there ought to be some authority that can step in , take over that organization and liquidate it or merge it – not save it , ” the former Federal Reserve chairman said .
“ It 's what I call euthanasia , not a rescue , ” he told CNN .
That would be a solution to “ moral hazard , ” the idea that big financial companies will take excessive risks , knowing that the government will bail them out if things turn sour .
“ This is what we pushed , what the president has accepted , ” Volcker said .
He was referring to President Barack Obama ’s proposal to prohibit banks from proprietary trading – trading for their own accounts .
“ They should n't be doing highly speculative activity , ” Volcker said .
“ They should n't be doing so - called proprietary activity , where they 're off there trading for their own interest .
They 're trading to make money . ”
The problem now is that financial company executives earn huge bonuses by taking outsized risks .
“ That ’s fine if you 're not being protected by the government , ” Volcker said .
But that ’s not the case now .
Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson criticizes the Volcker rule for being too narrow .
It “ would not have prevented the collapse of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers , American International Group , Washington Mutual , Wachovia or other institutions whose failure contributed to the crisis , ” he wrote in The New York Times .

According to a new cross-cultural study , … people living in communities most like those of Stone Age hunter - gatherers — small in numbers and lacking a “ moralizing god ” — made the most unfair offers to strangers and were least likely to punish stingy partners .
More here .
This confirms that moralizing Gods function to encourage cooperation in large societies , and adds moralizing gods , and fairness to strangers , to the many innovations that came with farming , such as war , slavery , marriage as property , class hierarchies and large wealth inequalities .
The strength of modern attachment to moralizing gods was emphasized to me twice recently .
First , I was reminded the [ US ] public hates atheists :
Mosaic Project researchers asked survey questions to determine Americans ’ reactions to situations involving members of various out - groups ( e.g. a person ’s feeling about one their children marrying a Jewish or Muslim or Catholic or atheist person ) .
… ‘ Atheist ’ was by far the ‘ lightning rod ’ category on multiple queries and atheists were even described as “ evil and immoral ” .
Second , I attended a lecture by famed philosopher of science Philip Kitcher , on “ Militant Modern Atheism ” :
Religious scholars who criticize the militant atheists often view religion as centered in social practices that inform and enrich human lives .
…
Doctrines that atheists might subject to epistemic evaluation … are … pieces of scaffolding , that are , in principle , dispensable .
…
Militant modern atheism is incomplete ( and likely counter - productive ) so long as it fails to attend systematically to the roles religion fulfills in human lives . …
The challenge is to develop a well - articulated and convincing version of secular humanism .
Kitcher was vague on how religion “ enriches , ” mentioning identity , community , and “ giving meaning . ”
He likes folks to start from core values and pick a religion to match , and not take anything transcendent beings say too literally .
I asked the last question of the evening : what if we ca n’t reform religion much ; which would he choose between atheism and the today ’s distribution of religious styles ?
He refused to answer that question , insisting we can reform religion .
Apparently some choices are morally repugnant to consider , and even to a famed analytic philosopher , “ what if we ca n’t take crazy beliefs out of religion ? ” is one of them .

The Life and Times of a Make - Believe Mormon
I was reading an article last night , “ The Untold Story of the Cuban 5 , ” by Ricardo Alarcon , president of Cuba ’s National Assembly .
His detailed history of the travails of the Cuban 5 reminded me once again that these Cuban men are victims of both a failed U.S. policy of hostility toward Cuba and a criminal justice system that turned reality on its head .
The only “ crime ” of these Cuban patriots was to expose the activities of terrorists hoping to destroy socialist Cuba .
For that , the five were handed punishingly long jail sentences , including life sentences for some .
Anti-Cuba terrorists , operating out of Miami with a wink from U.S. authorities , have organized violent attacks against Cuba ’s citizens and property for five decades , including assassination attempts against Fidel Castro .
At the same time , these hoodlums have threatened and intimidated dissenters who wanted to see better relations with Cuba .
Many hoped that the election of President Obama would inaugurate a new era of better relations with Cuba .
And early on the president signaled a desire to melt the ice .
But not much has happened since .
In fact , in some instances U.S. actions have been at loggerheads with those stated intentions .
In the case of the Cuban 5 , the administration filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court contesting a lower court ’s decision throwing out the convictions of the five because of the biased atmosphere and proceedings of the Miami trial where they were initially convicted .
Then , the State Department vetoed the applications of the wives and other family members of the five simply to visit their loved ones in prison .
This is no way to reset Cuban - American relations .
Whose interests are served by these vindictive actions and , more generally , by the policy of hostility toward Cuba ?
Not the Cuban or American people !
Not even major corporate interests who would like to trade and invest in Cuba !
Not our national security !
Not our international reputation !
Not our relations with Latin America !
It ’s true that constructive overtures toward Cuba will be bitterly opposed by right - wing extremists and the anti-Castro Cuban mafia , but I ’m not persuaded that it is only fear of their influence on public opinion and elections that constrains the president from making good on his rhetorical commitment to improved relations .
What else then hampers a change in our policy of blockade and hostility toward Cuba , of which the frameup of the Cuban 5 is an inextricable part ?
My suspicion is that some in the president ’s inner circle and institutions of our “ national security state ” – the Pentagon , CIA , State Department , etc. – insist that Cuban leaders bow down to the U.S. and pledge major changes , if not a complete overhaul , in their political system .
In other words , the foreign policy establishment is ready to improve relations , but only as long as Cuba accepts a subordinate status and makes concessions in its internal life .
But this negotiating stance is badly flawed .
The Cubans have long shown that they wo n’t grovel and trade away their independence .
They are asking for peace and justice , not favors , and they will negotiate only as equals , not supplicants .
More broadly , the administration ’s foreign policy positions though better than those of the previous occupants of the White House are still not completely in sync with new world realities – one of which is that the U.S. can no longer rule the world , by fiat or sword .
A unipolar world with the U.S. at its apex is a thing of the past .
The U.S. has to yield ( or be compelled to yield ) its dominant status in the global theater , in its own interests as well as the interests of the world ’s peoples and countries .
It has to become another member of the world community with no special rights or privileges .
The reorienting of our foreign policy in this way ( strategic rather than tactical ) will require enormous courage and skill , especially given the sure opposition of the extreme right and powerful corporate and state interests .
It will also require the vigorous support of the American people , especially our working class .
But can we do anything less ?
Not in my opinion .
The Obama administration , as mentioned above , has made some ( tactical ) moves toward a more realistic foreign policy and they should be welcomed .
But it still maneuvers ( Afghanistan , Honduras , Taiwan , Israeli - Palestinian conflict , etc. ) to maintain its dominant position in world politics , thereby laying the ground for continued and aggravated insecurity , instability and violence , in a period that begs for an easing of tensions and a new era of cooperation and joint action .
Humankind can solve global challenges ( climate change and environmental degradation , food insufficiency , poverty , endemic diseases , terrorism , nuclear weapons , and so forth ) , but only on the basis of mutual interests and equality between states and peoples worldwide .
That brings me back to Cuba and the Cuban 5 .
One positive step in that direction would be to lift the U.S. blockade on Cuba and restore normal relations .
As a gesture of good faith , President Obama should release the Cuban 5 , who have exhausted all legal remedies , from their unjust and punitive incarceration .
It will be good for America , and the world will celebrate .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 20 October 2009
The column below stated that lawyers representing Trafigura – the oil - trading company involved in a toxic waste dumping scandal in west Africa – had secured a fresh injunction to ban reporting of a parliamentary question on the subject .
This was inaccurate : rather , the company 's lawyers , the firm of Carter - Ruck , claimed that an existing injunction prevented reporting of a parliamentary question .
As you may have noticed , there was a bit of a kerfuffle last week involving this newspaper , the House of Commons , the oil - trading company Trafigura , law firm Carter - Ruck , Private Eye , toxic waste , Twitter , and a mysterious alien entity known as a " super- injunction " .
What may have struck anyone with zero interest in media law or basic human rights as a bafflingly dry story was in fact a significant victory for freedom of speech .
The irony is that , having won the freedom to explain what happened , " explaining what happened " stretches language itself to its limit , thanks to the presence of the aforementioned " super- injunction " – a legal weapon so profoundly confusing it has the power to warp reality itself .
A super - injunction is an injunction that prevents you from telling anyone that an injunction exists .
If taking out a regular injunction is like putting a gag round someone 's mouth , whipping out a super - injunction is the equivalent of putting a gag round someone 's mouth , then pulling a bag over their head , tying them to a chair and stealing their phone so they can't text for help .
Or to put it another way : if a tree lands in the forest and there 's no one there to hear it , does it make a sound ?
No one knows , because thanks to a super - injunction we 're not allowed to report the existence of the forest .
Super - injunctions are supposed to protect the privacy of an individual .
Let 's assume , entirely hypothetically , that someone steals a laptop containing mucky candid photographs of Rodney Bewes and tries to flog them to the tabloids .
Before they can print them , an understandably furious Bewes slaps the papers with an injunction preventing publication .
Now , at this point it would still be possible for a paper to run a story explaining that Bewes was taking legal action to prevent the publication of racy private pictures – which is still extremely embarrassing for poor Bewes , a much - loved and respected comic actor who does n't deserve this kind of leering intrusion , even in a hypothetical scenario .
Wish I 'd picked Kelvin MacKenzie instead , to be honest .
Anyway , all is not lost if at this point Bewes takes out a super - injunction preventing anyone from alluding to the details of the first injunction .
This makes the story effectively disappear altogether , thus maintaining Bewes 's dignity , not to mention the sanity of the picture desk .
The very most the press can do is run a nonsensical story saying : " There 's something we 're not allowed to tell you , but we can't tell you why . "
That 's effectively what the Guardian did last week , except that there was no beloved actor , but rather a whopping great multinational company accused of dumping toxic waste off the Ivory Coast , following which a lot of people got rather sick and more than a little upset .
In an apparent bid to save face , the company instructed its lawyers ( Carter - Ruck ) to sail up and down the media coastline , knowingly dumping toxic injunctions .
Eventually they went completely berserk and issued a super - injunction preventing the Guardian from reporting a parliamentary question about one of their previous super - injunctions .
This was too much for common sense or modern technology to bear .
Private Eye printed the question , the Twittersphere went bonkers ; soon everyone knew about it , and Trafigura 's name was toxic mud .
In terms of corporate PR , it was about as effective as appearing on the GMTV sofa to carve your brand name on to the face of a live baby .
Anyway , the Trafigura debacle is one of the very few occasions where the cloaking device of the super - injunction has actually malfunctioned , leaving the hovering mothership visible , which raises a worrying question : what else do n't we know about ?
Literally anything could be going on .
Like the mysterious " dark matter " that scientists believe makes up a huge percentage of the universe , an entire alternative reality could be thriving just over our shoulders .
Dean Gaffney might be made of staples .
Hitler could be alive and well and currently in negotiations to present the Radio 1 breakfast show .
Kellogg 's could be raising an army of the damned and declaring war on Norwich .
How many other " invisible " stories are out there , shrouded by thick legal mist ?
God knows .
But he 's not allowed to tell you .
And never mind super - injunctions – are there other kinds of injunction we do n't know about ?
If you slap a super - injunction on top of another super - injunction , do you get a " hyper- injunction " that makes it illegal to even think about protesting ?
Can someone get an injunction that prevents your eyes from accurately telling your brain what they 're looking at , so half your field of vision is pixelated out ?
Can you ban reporters from using the alphabet ?
Come to think of it , are there any additional letters of the alphabet we 're not allowed to know about ?
There could be hundreds .
Millions .
What worries me is that all this meddlesome injunctioneering could soon threaten the fabric of reason itself , causing a black hole of logic that sucks everything in the universe through to neverwhere .
For the sake of all mankind , I sincerely hope that in future , any corporations trying to cover something up would do the decent thing and simply start strangling journalists and bombing their offices .
Same results , less paperwork .
Dead men tell no tales .
And even if they try , Carter - Ruck can probably issue a gagging order that follows them into the afterlife and kicks their larynx off its hinges .
Square Enix 's anticipated title , Final Fantasy XIII , is just around the corner , and today marks the first day that U.S. online media is allowed to review the game .
Unfortunately , due to the global PSN error that crippled PS3s everywhere ( including our debug systems ) and other factors , I was n't able to beat the game before today .
Yes , even after more than 30 hours with Final Fantasy XIII
Rather than attempt a review without completing the full experience , I decided to delay the review until Monday and instead provide you readers with my impressions so far -- especially for those of you that are debating whether or not to pre-order the game this weekend .
Although Final Fantasy XIII is extremely different from the other members of the franchise and it has its fair share of problems , it 's still an excellent Japanese role - playing game .
I 've discussed the game 's premise and story in the past , so I wo n't do so at length here .
All you need to know is that the game stars Lightning , a stoic officer in the military , and a group of individuals connected to her in one way or another .
The opening of the game will be familiar to those who tried out ( or saw footage of ) the Japanese demo , as it 's essentially the same .
Lightning and Sazh are aboard a government train and things get crazy real fast .
Final Fantasy XIII is primarily about the dynamic between two worlds : Cocoon and Pulse .
Cocoon is a spherical moon that hangs above the savage world of Pulse .
The narrative also includes a fascinating take on the West 's perception of the divine , as there are powerful beings known as the fal ' Cie that watch over humans .
Humans branded by the fal ' Cie are called l'Cie , and they are given a specific " Focus , " or task , that must be completed , lest they transform into monsters upon failure .
This mythology plays an extremely important role in the game 's story and it 's been great so far .
The criticisms that have circulated the internet regarding Final Fantasy XIII are mostly true .
The first 25 to 30 hours are extremely linear .
This is not an exaggeration -- the game is almost on rails during these segments , as there is usually only a single path that you travel down , with occasional side paths that might tease you with treasure .
This first section of the game ( and arguably three quarters of the experience ) is not only linear , but also restrictive .
Players are not allowed to choose their party or party leader -- these selections are dictated by the story progression .
Although this might be a tremendous pain to some gamers , I actually enjoyed the linearity and restrictions , because it forced me to experiment with all the characters and their various battle roles .
Of course , players that are n't aware of Final Fantasy XIII 's open - world conclusion might be much less enthusiastic , especially if they believe that the entire game is completely linear .
Another seemingly universal complaint is the fact that there are " no towns " in Final Fantasy XIII , but this claim can be somewhat misleading .
There absolutely are towns in the game -- just not in the traditional JRPG sense .
During your journey , you do pass through different cities and locales , but they 're just as linear as the game 's dungeons .
So while it 's initially disappointing to not have peaceful areas to explore and take a break from battle , there are plenty of beautiful , fantastic environments to marvel at as you continue through the story .
It 's safe to say that Final Fantasy XIII is very different than the other Final Fantasy titles , but it 's a lot of fun .
The battle system is surprisingly complex and -- perhaps even more startling -- extremely difficult .
Although players only control one character at a time , there is plenty of micromanagement to be found .
While in the neutral position , your main character 's turn gauge charges up .
This gauge is segmented , so when it 's full , there are actually three full segments contained within it .
Executing a single command requires a certain number of segments .
For example , a basic attack requires one segment , so players can queue up three at a time .
A Blitz attack , alternatively , costs two segments of the gauge .
As characters grow , their turn gauges will expand , enabling players to select a more complex series of actions .
The most important element of battle outside of this basic command selection is the Paradigm system , which controls the battle roles of each character .
There are six different roles that a character can train in and each character is particularly capable in three of those roles .
Some roles are better suited for attacking , while others are designed for defense or restoration .
By selecting a custom " Paradigm , " or grouping of several roles , players can freely switch the roles of their characters anytime during battle .
This might sound like a gameplay design afterthought , but it 's absolutely critical to survive in Final Fantasy XIII .
This game requires constant micromanagement and changing Paradigms in order to come out victorious , and I really appreciated that challenge -- even when things got frustrating .
So the question remains : do you put down money for a pre-order ?
I say " yes , you do . "
Although Final Fantasy XIII is incredibly far removed from its predecessors , it 's still a breath - taking JRPG with an extremely interesting story and a realized game world .
The voice acting is generally top - notch , the presentation is off the charts and there are chocobos to be ridden .
It might not be the best Final Fantasy out there , but that does n't stop it from being enjoyable .
As a quick note for owners of multiple platforms , I strongly recommend getting this game on the PS3 .
The 360 version seems to run well enough , but it 's noticeably less sharp and is spread across three discs .
Check back Monday for my full review .
Islamabad , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A teacher and his 9 - year - old son were killed Sunday night by a suspected U.S. drone , a Pakistani administration official and an intelligence official told CNN .
The incident occurred in the village of Musaki in the North Waziristan district .
The suspected U.S. drone fired two guided missiles at the compound of local resident Sadiq Noor , the officials said .
There were reports
Noor 's home was used by local and foreign militants .
There was no immediate U.S. confirmation of the report .
Earlier Sunday , four people were killed and one injured when a remote - controlled roadside bomb struck a vehicle in the Hangu district of North West Frontier Province , officials said .
Among the dead was Ghani Ur- Rehman , the former provincial minister , and three others who were traveling with him in the same car , according to Khalid Umar Zai , commissioner of the province 's Kohat division .
The car was carrying five people , said Abdul Rashid , police chief of Hangu district .
The remote control bomb was placed under a small bridge just south of Hangu City , Rashid said .
On Friday , a suicide car bomb exploded in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball in the Lakki Marwat district of northwest Pakistan , officials said .
As of Sunday , the death toll from that bombing stood at 99 , with 36 people still hospitalized , police said .
It 's only a small grave , a rectangle of cheap concrete marking it out , blessed by a flourish of wild yellow lilies .
Inside are the powdered bones and skulls and bits of femur of up to 300 children , Armenian orphans of the great 1915 genocide who died of cholera and starvation as the Turkish authorities tried to " Turkify " them in a converted Catholic college high above Beirut .
But for once , it is the almost unknown story of the surviving 1,200 children – between three and 15 years old – who lived in the crowded dormitory of this ironically beautiful cut - stone school that proves that the Turks did indeed commit genocide against the Armenians in 1915 .
Barack Obama and his pliant Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton – who are now campaigning so pitifully to prevent the US Congress acknowledging that the Ottoman Turkish massacre of 1.5 million Armenians was a genocide – should come here to this Lebanese hilltop village and hang their heads in shame .
For this is a tragic , appalling tale of brutality against small and defenceless children whose families had already been murdered by Turkish forces at the height of the First World War , some of whom were to recall how they were forced to grind up and eat the skeletons of their dead fellow child orphans in order to survive starvation .
Jemal Pasha , one of the architects of the 1915 genocide , and – alas – Turkey 's first feminist , Halide Edip Adivar , helped to run this orphanage of terror in which Armenian children were systematically deprived of their Armenian identity and given new Turkish names , forced to become Muslims and beaten savagely if they were heard to speak Armenian .
The Antoura Lazarist college priests have recorded how its original Lazarist teachers were expelled by the Turks and how Jemal Pasha presented himself at the front door with his German bodyguard after a muezzin began calling for Muslim prayers once the statue of the Virgin Mary had been taken from the belfry .
Hitherto , the argument that Armenians suffered a genocide has rested on the deliberate nature of the slaughter .
But Article II of the 1951 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide specifically states that the definition of genocide – " to destroy in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " – includes " forcibly transferring children of the group to another group " .
This is exactly what the Turks did in Lebanon .
Photographs still exist of hundreds of near - naked Armenian children performing physical exercises in the college grounds .
One even shows Jemal Pasha standing on the steps in 1916 , next to the young and beautiful Halide Adivar who – after some reluctance – agreed to run the orphanage .
Before he died in 1989 , Karnig Panian – who was six years old when he arrived at Antoura in 1916 – recorded in Armenian how his own name was changed and how he was given a number , 551 , as his identity .
" At every sunset in the presence of over 1,000 orphans , when the Turkish flag was lowered , ' Long Live General Pasha ! ' was recited .
That was the first part of the ceremony .
Then it was time for punishment for the wrongdoers of the day .
They beat us with the falakha [ a rod used to beat the soles of the feet ] , and the top - rank punishment was for speaking Armenian . "
Panian described how , after cruel treatment or through physical weakness , many children died .
They were buried behind the old college chapel .
" At night , the jackals and wild dogs would dig them up and throw their bones here and there ... at night , kids would run out to the nearby forest to get apples or any fruits they could find – and their feet would hit bones .
They would take these bones back to their rooms and secretly grind them to make soup , or mix them with grain so they could eat them as there was not enough food at the orphanage .
They were eating the bones of their dead friends . "
Using college records , Emile Joppin , the head priest at the Lazarite Antoura college , wrote in the school 's magazine in 1947 that " the Armenian orphans were Islamicised , circumcised and given new Arab or Turkish names .
Their new names always kept the initials of the names in which they were baptised .
Thus Haroutioun Nadjarian was given the name Hamed Nazih , Boghos Merdanian became Bekir Mohamed , to Sarkis Safarian was given the name Safouad Sulieman . "
Lebanese - born Armenian - American electrical engineer Missak Kelechian researches Armenian history as a hobby and hunted down a privately printed and very rare 1918 report by an American Red Cross officer , Major Stephen Trowbridge , who arrived at the Antoura college after its liberation by British and French troops and who spoke to the surviving orphans .
His much earlier account entirely supports that of Father Joppin 's 1949 research .
" Every vestige , and as far as possible every memory , of the children 's Armenian or Kurdish origin was to be done away with .
Turkish names were assigned and the children were compelled to undergo the rites prescribed by Islamic law and tradition ...
Not a word of Armenian or Kurdish was allowed .
The teachers and overseers were carefully trained to impress Turkish ideas and customs upon the lives of the children and to catechize [ sic ] them regularly on ... the prestige of the Turkish race . "
Halide Adivar , later to be lauded by The New York Times as " the Turkish Joan of Arc " – a description that Armenians obviously questioned – was born in Constantinople in 1884 and attended an American college in the Ottoman capital .
She was twice married and wrote nine novels – even Trowbridge was to admit that she was " a lady of remarkable literary ability " – and served as a woman officer in Mustafa Ataturk 's Turkish army of liberation after the First World War .
She later lived in both Britain and France .
And it was Kelechian yet again who found Adivar 's long - forgotten and self - serving memoirs , published in New York in 1926 , in which she recalls how Jemal Pasha , commander of the Turkish 4th Army in Damascus , toured Antoura orphanage with her .
" I said : ' You have been as good to Armenians as it is possible to be in these hard days .
Why do you allow Armenian children to be called by Moslim [ sic ] names ?
It looks like turning the Armenians into Moslims , and history some day will revenge it on the coming generation of Turks . '
' You are an idealist , ' he answered gravely and like all idealists lack a sense of reality ...
This is a Moslem orphanage and only Moslem orphans are allowed . ' "
According to Adivar , Jemal Pasha said that he " cannot bear to see them die in the streets " and promised they would go " back to their people " after the war .
Adivar says she told the general that : " I will never have anything to do with such an orphanage " but claims that Jemal Pasha replied : " You will if you see them in misery and suffering , you will go to them and not think for a moment about their names and religion . "
Which is exactly what she did .
Later in the war , however , Adivar spoke to Talaat Pasha , the architect of the 20th century 's first holocaust , and recalled how he almost lost his temper when discussing the Armenian " deportations " ( as she put it ) , saying : " Look here , Halide ... I have a heart as good as yours , and it keeps me awake at night to think of the human suffering .
But that is a personal thing , and I am here on this earth to think of my people and not of my sensibilities ...
There was an equal number of Turks and Moslems massacred during the [ 1912 ]
Balkan war , yet the world kept a criminal silence .
I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interests , and succeeds , the world admires it and thinks it moral .
I am ready to die for what I have done , and I know that I shall die for it . "
The suffering of which Talaat Pasha spoke so chillingly was all too evident to Trowbridge when he himself met the orphans of Antoura .
Many had seen their parents murdered and their sisters raped .
Levon , who came from Malgara , was driven from his home with his sisters aged 12 and 14 .
The girls were taken by Kurds – allied to the Turks – as " concubines " and the boy was tortured and starved , Trowbridge records .
He was eventually forced by his captors into the Antoura orphanage .
Ten - year - old Takhouhi – her name means " queen " in Armenian and she was from a rich background – from Rodosto on the Sea of Marmara was put with her family on a freight train to Konia .
Two of her two brothers died in the truck , both parents caught typhus – they died in the arms of Takhouhi and her oldest brother in Aleppo – and she was eventually taken from him by a Turkish officer , given the Muslim name of Muzeyyan and ended up in Antoura .
When Trowbridge suggested that he would try to find someone in Rodosto and return her family 's property to her , he said she replied : " I do n't want any of those things if I cannot find my brother again . "
Her brother was later reported to have died in Damascus .
Trowbridge records many other tragedies from the children he found at Antoura , commenting acidly that Halide " and Djemal [ sic ]
Pasha delighted in having their photographs taken on the steps of the orphanage ... posing as the leaders of Ottoman modernism .
Did they realise what the outside world would think of those photographs ? "
According to Trowbridge 's account , only 669 of the children finally survived , 456 of them Armenian , 184 of them Kurds , along with 29 Syrians .
Talaat Pasha did indeed die for his sins .
He was assassinated by an Armenian in Berlin in 1922 – his body was later returned to Turkey on the express orders of Adolf Hitler .
Jemal Pasha was murdered in the Turkish town of Tiflis .
Halide Edip Adivar lived in England until 1939 when she returned to Turkey , became a professor of English literature , was elected to the Turkish parliament and died in 1964 at the age of 80 .
Picture an elephant in the wild , making its stately progress across the ­savannah , tall grass bending ­beneath its feet .
Now ­transplant that image to the American prairie .
In one of the most startling new ideas to emerge about ­climate change , a leading conservation biologist is calling for plants and wildlife facing extinction to be saved simply by picking them up and moving them .
Camille Parmesan , a butterfly ­biologist at the University of Texas at Austin , has been monitoring the effects of rapid climate change on ­species – particularly those threatened because they cannot adapt to or ­escape from rising temperatures – for more than a decade now .
But her idea for a modern day 's Noah 's ark remains hugely controversial .
" The idea is that , for certain ­species at very high risk of extinction due to climate change , we should actively pick them up and move them to ­suitable locations that are outside their historic range , " she tells me in her ­office at the university campus , near the biology laboratory in which she and her ­husband keep myriad caterpillar samples in the cold store .
Her proposals , once confined to a handful of scientists , are now getting a broader airing as governments begin to grapple with the enormous problem of how to insulate animal and plant life from a warming climate .
Shortly after appearing in the Atlantic magazine 's list of " brave thinkers of the age " , ­Parmesan ­lobbied negotiators , ­environmental ­activists and scientists at last ­December 's climate change summit in Copenhagen to start drawing up plans to move animals that are most at risk .
She is , not ­surprisingly , frustrated and angry with the failure of governments to cut the ­emissions that cause climate change .
After the ­subsequent ­discovery of a false claim about melting Himalayan ­glaciers by the UN 's climate body the IPCC , Parmesan also stresses that conservationists should not fall into a pattern of reflexively blaming climate change for each and every decline in wildlife .
However , she ­remains convinced of the dangers to the world 's animals from a rapidly warming atmosphere .
Scientists have long believed that 20 % to 30 % of all known ­species of land animal , bird and fish could become extinct because of climate change .
But recent studies , based on more elevated temperature ­projections , have suggested an even greater rate of die - off – 40 % to 70 % – as heatwaves , drought and the increasing acidification of the oceans drive animals from their native ­habitats and destroy their food supply .
The sheer scale of threatened ­extinctions have forced conservationists to rethink what was once dismissed as an outlandish notion .
And it 's got Parmesan thinking about elephants . . .
To date , there is little evidence about how climate change – rather than traditional threats such as poaching or growing urbanisation – is affecting the grasslands where these majestic creatures live in the wild .
" But at some point , I think we might want to think about moving them around , " ­Parmesan says .
She has already been pushing for efforts to regenerate America 's prairie grasslands in parts of Texas and the mid-west , by bringing in big grazing animals .
There are fossils to suggest there were elephants in North America tens of thousands of years ago .
So why not transplant African elephants to North America ?
" With climate change , I am starting to think that , if we do get a massive reduction of Africa 's grassland , then as I am advocating restoration of the US prairie anyway , we can use the large herbivores from ­Africa to help that process because they are already co-adapted .
I would n't be opposed to that . "
Parmesan can see her way to ­moving other big herbivores too , such as ­giraffes .
She can even justify finding new homes for pandas .
However , she concedes that most of the planet 's iconic large animals would still have to find their own way out from climate change – it would be impractical to move carnivores , for example .
" What we are advocating is not moving tigers to Africa , nor moving polar bears to Antarctica – nothing as dramatic as that – but [ on the whole ] to take species that are fairly innocuous , including a lot of plants and insects , " she says .
" We know enough about their competitive abilities and their behaviour , and we have no expectation that they are going to be able to take over an eco-system . "
Climate studies since 2000 reveal a growing threat to animal life far ­beyond the polar regions that have been feeling its early impacts .
A review of ­recent scientific literature showed 52 % of species striking out for more temperate areas as their traditional habitats became unsuitable , migrating from 50 km to as far as 1,600 km away when geography and human settlements allowed .
Climate change is also altering their way of life : some 62 % of ­species , for example , are mating earlier in the spring .
The studies noted huge ­varieties in response to climate change except for one fatal trait : no species was exhibiting the kind of large - scale evolutionary changes needed to adapt to warming temperatures in its existing habitat .
" Evolution is not going to save the polar bear , " says Parmesan simply .
If it were up to her , the evacuation would start now – perhaps with a ­variety of the ephemeral Checker­spot butterfly which started her on this ­unlikely career path .
Now 48 , she did not set out to become a campaigner – or even a lepidopterist , for that ­matter .
The youngest ( and smallest ) of six daughters , she grew up in a solidly Republican family with deep roots in the Texas oil industry .
Her mother , a geologist , worked for an oil company , as does one of her sisters .
Initially , Parmesan wanted to study primates , but she did not have the stomach to work with caged animals .
She claims she is uncomfortable even describing herself as an environmentalist – although she does drive a blue Prius , and watches her carbon footprint .
It was fieldwork that set Parmesan on her more public trajectory , ­after she published her first paper on the plight of Edith 's Checkerspot .
In the early 1990s , she spent more than four years rattling across the Pacific Northwest in an old Toyota pickup truck , tracking these butterflies from Mexico to Alberta .
Earlier researchers – including her husband , Singer – had established that the Checkerspot was sensitive to temperature .
The trek convinced Parmesan that it was dying out ­because of climate change : rising ­temperatures in California were ­drying up the plant that was its main food source , although the butterfly continued to do fine in northern ­latitudes .
And yet Parmesan admits she was , at first , sceptical about ­projections of the broader impacts of climate change on the animal world .
" I have to admit that 10 years ago , I thought they were a bit too extreme , " she says .
But now she fears the scientific community is under -estimating the risk of extinction , and is frustrated with conservation organisations for failing to grasp the urgency of this situation .
When Parmesan first began talking about moving species , or " assisted ­colonisation " , at academic conferences , her fellow biologists erupted .
They accused her of playing God ; of tampering with nature in ways that carry enormous risk .
They warned that her approach would set off a whole new chain of problems .
How did Parmesan know the transplants would take to their new surroundings ?
How did she know they would not stage a hostile takeover , chasing out the native species ?
" I was surprised at how angry ­people got – how emotional , " she says .
" They were just horrified that I advocated playing God .
They thought I was advocating an engineering ­approach to conservation . "
Which , Parmesan concedes , she is .
But she argues that her approach may be the only way left to save some ­species whose escape routes are blocked by urban sprawl or punishing desert , or which can not adapt in time .
Unlike traditional threats to wildlife , Parmesan says there is no prospect of recovery from climate change .
Loss of habitat and poaching can be reversed , given enough money .
Threatened animals can be coaxed back to healthy numbers – as in the case of the wolf in the Rocky Mountain West region of the US .
Degraded landscapes can be ­restored .
But climate change is ­irreversible , at least on a human timescale .
And besides , it 's not as if there has n't been transportation of animal or plant life in the past .
" It does n't make any sense to say it 's OK for the shipping industry and the transport industry to accidentally move stuff around , for the aquarium trade to move stuff around , for the garden trade to move stuff all over the place , but that it 's not OK for a conservation biologist who is desperately trying to save a species from extinction to move it 100 miles .
Come on , we have mucked around with Earth to such a degree that I think it 's a ridiculous argument . "
In recent years , Parmesan and a handful of other scientists have ­ begun work on a blueprint for ­moving plants and wildlife on the verge of extinction .
She argues it would be far more effective to ­transplant entire communities of plants and animals , rather than a few token species .
" If we move individual ­species , it will just be : ' Let 's save a few cool things for our grandkids . '
But if we can get people to think about it on a grander scale , it could save some significant percentage of species . "
Their idea is to start small – with plants , butterflies , birds , small rodents , and mammals – and to restrict the relocation plan to isolated spots that are immediately threatened by climate change .
That is , high - altitude species that are being forced to migrate higher and higher up mountains to find cooler temperatures .
Parmesan would shift those populations to ­another , higher mountain within close range .
It is too soon to say if she is winning the argument .
Her ideas are still considered ­outside the mainstream of conservationists , and undertaking any kind of mass animal rescue will require rewriting existing international laws on transporting animals , as well as huge infusions of cash .
But some of the bigger wildlife NGOs are beginning to listen more seriously to what was seen only a decade ago as an outlandish idea .
" We need to have as many potential tools as possible in our tool boxes , " agrees Thomas Brooks of Conservation International .
" It is not very easy and it is not very cheap , but I do see this as an option that needs to be explored when cheaper and easier options are n't working .
But this is a more difficult and expensive approach , and needs to be evaluated carefully in that light . "
Even with temperature rises of 0.7C , some animals have already been lost – such as the golden toad that lives in the cool mountains of Costa Rica ­( biologists there have warned that more than a dozen amphibian species have disappeared from the ­jungles ­because of climate change ) .
And last year , researchers in Australia ­reported what would be the world 's first ­mammalian extinction of modern times : the lemuroid ringtail possum .
These animals drop out of trees and die if the temperature rises above 30 C – ­although subsequent reports suggest a number have since been sighted .
Many other species are under a death ­sentence .
In the American west , ­researchers have charted a sharp ­decline in the pika , a small , furry brown animal that lives in the Rocky mountains .
As for the polar bear , its natural hunting grounds are fast disappearing with the melting sea ice .
Some studies suggest the Arctic 's summer sea ice could disappear entirely by 2020 , and with it the seals that are the bears ' main food supply .
Recently , Canadian biologists reported at least seven cases of male polar bears eating their young because they were going hungry .
But while it's too late for the ­polar bear , Parmesan believes there is a chance of saving other animals – ­provided governments and conservation organisations overcome their ­reservations and act now .
" Otherwise , we are going to see a whole slew of species go extinct that we could have saved , if only we'd been willing to think a little bit more outside the box . "

JavaScript animations are a key aspect of dynamic Web Sites and Application development .
Moreover , most JavaScript Frameworks or Libraries provide APIs for dealing with at least three main things :
When developing Web Sites most JavaScript effects involve rendered DOM Elements , but sometimes JavaScript animations are used in other contexts , like when using the Canvas .
In the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit the main target of my animations are Graphs , and in the next version also Nodes and Edges as separate entities .
Today I 'd like to describe how to create a generic animation class that can be used or extended for any purpose .
I 'll try to be minimalistic and to present only the needed code for making animations .
Then you might find useful to add some code to perform specific animation tasks targeting for example specific style properties of a DOM Element .
Before creating an Animation class we might want to consider what to expose as options to the user .
The options I thought of are : Additionally we'd like to add a couple of controllers , one when a step of the animation is executed and one when the animation has completed : delta gives us an idea of the progress of the animation .
When the animation starts delta will be equal to zero .
When the animation ends it 'll be equal to one .
We will also need a start method to trigger the animation and a step method that will compute delta at each step .
Now that we defined our options we can start thinking about our implementation .
Our Animation class will be a class constructor that sets all the options and properties that we defined before and a prototype with the methods start and step .
The class could be used like this :
Here 's the code I came up with , inspired by the MooTools Framework :
One very common operation to do with delta is to change the interval [ 0 , 1 ] of delta to our desired from and to values that we want to compute for our element .
A clever thing to do would be to declare this method as a class method for Effect .
We 'll call it compute : Now
If we wanted for example to animate an element 's width style from 0 to 10 px we could do :
The animation code defined above could be extended in different ways .
For example , this class could be slightly modified to accept a DOM element in its constructor and modify style properties of that element when performing an animation .
The code could look like this :
The code would now look more or less like this :
Other extensions might involve normalizing style keywords , adding effect transitions , adding pause resume methods , and / or using more OO JS idioms when coding these classes .
I hope you got to know a little bit more about animation internals and please if you have any advice on this code , which as I told before is just for demonstration , I 'll be pleased to hear you !
As was the trend throughout most of 2009 , the US retail market for games was humbled in January , slipping 13 percent to $ 1.17 billion , according to the NPD Group .
One segment to see growth , however , was accessories , which actually gained 2 percent over January 2009 with sales of $ 217 million .
The sales climb represented the second consecutive month of year - over - year growth for accessories , having spiked 15 percent to $ 760.2 million in December .
The controller would use an LCD touch screen …
Sony may be making a move to better capitalize on that growth , were it to proceed to the manufacturing and distribution phase for a new controller patent application .
The concept , which surfaced in the US Patent & Trademark Office 's online database yesterday , details a " Universal Game Console Controller " that could " emulate the controllers of popular game consoles , such as …the PlayStation , a controller made by Nintendo , Xbox game controllers made by Microsoft , Amiga CD - 32 controllers , Atari Jaguar controllers , Gravis Gamepad controllers , Sega controllers , and Turbographics [ sic ] controllers . "
To do this , Sony 's universal controller would incorporate a touch - screen LCD display that would lay out the button configurations of the various game pads .
The filing notes that the controller 's LCD display could only show one type of control scheme at a time , though up to three types of schemes could be stored in the controller .
As could be guessed by the aforementioned controller list , consoles would n't need to be current to be compatible with the universal gamepad .
… and could work with the PS3 , 360 , and Wii .
" It may now be appreciated that among other advantages , the controller provides for backward compatibility so that it may be programmed to emulate the key layout of an older controller that may no longer be available , " the filing reads .
Sony 's patent also notes that the LCD could be used as an alpha-numeric keyboard .
Controller data would be passed by way of a special receiver .
The filing notes that the device could be loaded out with rumble functionality , as well as speakers .
It could also be powered either by battery for wireless gameplay or by way of the communication receiver .
Our approach , policies , and practices
There is an opportunity and an obligation to help address the issues facing this world , and this belief is reflected in our approach , policies , and practices across the following focus areas .
Congratulations to anti-Fed , libertarian Congressman Ron Paul , who just won the first " primary " of the 2012 election !
Well , technically it was n't a primary , it was a straw poll held at CPAC , the huge conservative convention that 's been going on the last few days .
In the straw poll , Paul easily whipped second - place finisher Mitt Romney -- the former PE chief and liberal Massachusetts governor , who 's trying to ride Scott Brown 's coattails to a second chance at his party 's Presidential nomination .
Of course , this was a narrow field -- only CPAC attendees were eligible for the vote ( no Sarah Palin this year ) -- and only 25 % of attendees voted .
But still !
Meanwhile , the 2012 re-election is in full swing on the Democratic side .
Already there 's chatter about someone from the left trying to primary Barack Obama , and on this morning 's Chris Matthews show , he even asked whether Obama is 100 % running for re-election ( frankly that seems to absurd to contemplate , though it makes for good TV ) .
Here we go .
The world revolves around Lindsay .
Lindsay Lohan is suing the financial company E - Trade , insisting that a boyfriend - stealing , “ milkaholic ” baby in its latest commercial — who happens to be named Lindsay — was modeled after her .
And she wants $ 100 million for her pain and suffering , The Post has learned .
The actress filed a lawsuit yesterday in Nassau County Supreme Court over the commercial that debuted during the Super Bowl this year .
The ad — part of a series starring babies who play the stock market — features a boy apologizing to his girlfriend via video chat for not calling her the night before .
“ And that milkaholic Lindsay was n’t over ? ” the baby girl asks him suspiciously .
“ Lindsay ? ” the boy replies , just before a baby girl sticks her head into the frame and slurs , “ Milk - a - what ? ”
Lohan ’s lawyer , Stephanie Ovadia , said the actress has the same single - name recognition as Oprah or Madonna .
“ Many celebrities are known by one name only , and E - Trade is using that knowledge to profit , ” Ovadia said .
“ They used the name Lindsay , ” Ovadia said .
“ They ’re using her name as a parody of her life .
Why did n’t they use the name Susan ?
This is a subliminal message .
Everybody ’s talking about it and saying it ’s Lindsay Lohan . ”
Ovadia wants an injunction to force the spot off the air , and the Lindsay camp wants every last copy of the commercial .
Chris Brown , a spokesman for Grey Group , which produced the spot , is throwing cold milk on the controversy , saying it “ just used a popular baby name that happened to be the name of someone on the account team . ”
Ovadia said E - Trade has violated Lohan ’s rights under New York state civil - rights law and used her “ name and characterization ” in business without paying her or getting her approval .
The lawyer said that since the spot was seen by hundreds of millions of people watching the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics finals , the firm has garnered great profits .
She says Lohan is owed $ 50 million in exemplary damages , plus another $ 50 million in compensatory damages .
E - Trade could not be reached for comment .

Michael 's Dispatches SEVEN
Details Published : Wednesday , 10 February 2010 12:03
Left seat Pilot Thomas Sonne ; Right seat : Major Bill Tice .
Kandahar , Afghanistan
10 February 2010
American forces are stationed at bases far and wide around Afghanistan .
Some bases are like towns , such as Camp Bastion , Kandahar Airfield , and Bagram Airfield .
But mostly they are small , often occupied by only a handful of troops .
Logistics into Afghanistan is a nightmare , and it only gets worse after you cross the border from the North or from Pakistan .
By comparison , Iraq “ logs ” was like a run to a convenience store down the road .
Afghan logs are more like driving from Miami to Seattle for grocery shopping , and then driving the groceries back to Miami while under threat of attack .
Not a speck of exaggeration in that statement .
Enemy logs interdiction was a large constituent of the Soviet defeat , despite that the Soviet Union comprised the entire northern border of Afghanistan .
When the Soviet hammer tried to crack the Afghan rock , the hammer shattered .
The Soviets can easily put people in space and keep them there , but they could n’t handle backdoor logistics during their Afghan war .
It ’s easier to keep people in space than to supply our war here .
Our Coalition is stunningly more effective at logistics than were the Soviets .
For instance , when the British were resupplying small FOBs near Sangin last year — just a short drive from the origin at Camp Bastion — the monthly convoys were major operations that drained needed combat power , and still vehicles were destroyed with casualties .
So powerful are some of the bombs that they can launch the ultra- armored American MRAPs into the air , flipping them like turtles , often breaking the backs of soldiers .
Even today , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is making moves to facilitate allies to get more counter - IED gear , such as MRAPs , which seems like a good move because some allies are risk - averse to the point of being ineffective ( not that MRAPs are going to save them ) .
By air , when a civilian helicopter was trying to resupply at Sangin , it was shot down just outside the base , killing the crew and at least one child on the ground .
Make no mistake : this is a worthy enemy .
Without the U.S. Air Force , we would need thousands more troops here just to run convoys , and bringing in those troops would require more convoys to supply their needs .
It ’s okay to use contractors to bring supplies in from Pakistan or from the north , but driving up into those mountains and other remote locations would be suicidal .
The United States Air Force invited me on a resupply mission , and when I showed up at 0400 to the trailer where the crew lives , one of their doors had been blown off the night before , leaving all else intact .
Nobody knows what caused the door - ripping , though SSG Michael Jeffries was outside and said he got pounded in the face by gravel .
Michael Jeffries said the winds were at least 60MPH and lasted only a few seconds .
The pilots inside hit the deck .
Anyway , Afghan mysteries aside , we drove to a chow hall , got breakfast to - go , and drove to the flightline .
The 772 Expetionary Airlift Squadron ( EAS ) , from Little Rock , is comprised of elements from the 19th Airlift Wing , which they call the “ Black Knights . ”
During January 2010 the 772 EAS conducted 119 missions in Afghanistan that comprised 454 sorties .
That ’s a lot of convoys saved .
Today ’s mission would consist of six sorties .
A sortie consists of a takeoff and landing , and hopefully the landing was controlled .
We would fly from KAF to Shindand to unload supplies , pick up passengers , then fly back to KAF .
That would be two sorties .
The crew would pick up more supplies and passengers and fly to a small base in Farah Province , then back to KAF to pick up another load , then fly to Camp Bastion , then back to KAF — mission complete — for a total of six sorties .
Arguably this could be called three missions , but the Air Force is conservative and calls it one mission .
The pilots would not shut down the engines which would be running all day .
Before starting engines , Captain Thomas Sonne , the pilot , adjusted an oxygen mask and showed me how to use it .
He handed over a Bose noise - cancellation headset , then plugged it into the comms and demonstrated how to adjust volume on several radios and the internal .
I asked Captain Sonne if we have enough C - 130 lift in Afghanistan ( knowing we do n’t have enough helicopters ) .
Captain Sonne said we had enough C - 130 lift — not extra capacity , but enough , which coincides with what others have said .
“ Is the Haiti relief hurting us here ? ” Captain Sonne confirmed what others have said : no , they ca n’t feel the Haiti mission affecting our effort .
Captain Sonne explained we are short on ramp space to park the aircraft , so they are busy building more ramp .
This coincides with something General Petraeus told me in late 2008 .
The pilot and copilot started through the strange checklist .
The instrument panel showed we had 24,590 pounds of fuel .
The weather was looking dicey for the landings on the rough airstrips , but takeoff would be easy , the pilots said .
There were eight passengers and eight crew ; three of the crew were FAST personnel ( Flyaway Security Team ) with body armor and weapons , and they would disembark on landing to guard the aircraft .
Was good to have them along .
Finally the crew got to the pre-taxi checklist .
I understood a few words on this one :
“ Brakes . ”
“ Brakes clear . ”
“ Copy . ”
Captain Sonne was wearing night vision goggles while Major Tice , copilot , was going without .
Captain Sonne ’s voice came over : “ We ’ve got a 135,000 - pound airplane , ” and then he looked back over his right shoulder at me , saying , “ If you have any questions , go ahead and I ’ll alert you if we are busy . ”
“ Roger , ” I say in the microphone .
And now they are talking to each other again , “ We ’ll try to get up to 265 tactical , ” says Captain Sonne .
My pen was too slow , especially in the dark cockpit , but I got some snippets :
“ Pre - flight checks complete , ” says Major Tice .
“ Pressurized . ”
“ Roger . ”
They talk quickly , succinctly , all business , and rumble down the dark runaway and lift away , “ Gear ’s up . ” “ Gear ’s up . ”
The flight computer has a female voice that commands attention , and she kept saying , “ Altitude , altitude , altitude , altitude , ” and then much later , the computer woman says , “ Thousand to go . ”
This has to be about one of the coolest jobs in the military .
As we roar into the sky , it occurs to me that a young person with brains and a sense of adventure would be crazy not to consider joining the Air Force .
This is fun !
I ask through the headset if the HUDs are classified and if it ’s permissible to make photos so people at home can see .
Captain Sonne and Major Tice said there is nothing classified .
Have at it .
We descend into Shindand by first coming over the base , and doing a hard corkscrew down , wings sometimes tipped at 45 degrees , to avoid ground fire .
The cockpit is armored against SAFIRE , but there are people in the back and it ’s never a good idea to get your airplane shot .
We come down to the skinny runway , apparently made for Russian figthers , some of which were sitting near the runway .
The Taliban had gotten their hands on old aircraft years ago , and somehow got them flying .
Today , Taliban Air Force consists of kites and carrier pigeons .
I ’ve photographed a kite in downtown Kandahar that was flying in the dark with a dim strobe .
Was it a signal ?
The pilots intended to land at about 120 knots .
We landed and the pallets were removed by forklift , followed by the “ pax ” ( passengers ) .
The crew had a couple of flags hanging in the back .
The pilots said they fly flags on missions for people at home , and send each flag back with a little certificate .
More passengers were loaded up and we rumbled away at about 0730 , and someone said from the back that a flock of birds was off to our right .
After we were safely airborne , and the pilots finished their checklists , I asked about bird strikes .
“ How high do bird strikes happen in Afghanistan ? ” Major
Tice had heard of a strike that occurred at over 20,000 feet .
Everyone seems to have high regard for the C-130J .
The pilots explain that older variants required six crew members , but the “ J ” only needs four .
The Navigator and Engineer no longer are needed , and so this cuts one officer and one NCO , both of whom require much expensive training .
A four - man crew beats a hundred - man convoy .
And that was it ; we landed back at KAF , the first two sorties complete .
KAF doubles as a civilian airport with traffic including 747s .
This is the civilian side of the terminal .
We ca n’t do a lot of top secret stuff on the airfield because civilian planes land every day and everyone can take photos .
Captain Sonne and Major
Tice parked the airplane , left the motors running without the props turning , and while loadmasters re-loaded the C - 130J , I got coffee .
We loaded back up and taxied to the runway for the second part of the mission : take supplies and pax to Farah Province .
On the taxiway , we waited for this 747 to take off .
ATC ( Air Traffic Control ) said something about a 747 “ heavy ” taking off .
I asked the pilots what “ heavy ” means , and they answered that any aircraft weighing more than 250,000 pounds is considered “ heavy , ” and there are special rules at KAF for heavy .
For instance , after he takes off , a truck must drive the runway to clear debris that the giant engines often blow onto the runway .
The debris will not damage the C - 130 ( after all , they land on gravel airstrips ) , but a rock sucked inside an F - 16 engine is a bad thing , and we do n’t want to see pilots ejecting off the end of the runway while one of our jets crashes in the desert .
Another rule is that we have to wait for three minutes after a “ heavy ” takes off because the giant airplanes leave dangerous vortices that can cause us to crash .
While we rumbled toward the FOB in Farah , the pilots were curious about the ground war and I offered a few vignettes .
There are thousands of wars going on here .
Everyone ’s war is a snowflake .
As we approached the airstrip , the pilots put the nose down and we dived into the soup of clouds .
The biggest threat in Afghanistan for fixed - wing pilots is terrain .
It ’s easy to eat a huge mountain over here .
“ Flaps 50 % please . ”
“ Roger . ”
Now over Farah and approaching the strip , we kept going down , down , down and the clouds were looking brown .
Occasionally the clouds winked and we could spot the earth momentarily , until the instruments said we were a thousand feet up .
The pilots could not see the ground .
The ATC said visibility was less than two miles , and Captain Sonne said he could not see a half - mile ahead .
A loadmaster called up saying he could barely see the ground at 1,000 feet .
I just kept saying to myself , “ They know what they are doing .
They know what they are doing .
They know what they are doing . ”
Captain Sonne reported we were getting some rain , and finally , at four miles out , he said “ Abort , ” and I drew a breath of relief and we climbed away .
As we climbed out , Captain Sonne said , “ A little bit of rain , I ’m going to switch back to weather . ”
We continued to climb away , when on another channel a pilot was talking to the ATC behind us .
ATC crackled to the pilot , “ Runway unsafe to land .
Report your intentions . ”
Captain Sonne explained that the ATC can advise the pilot about unsafe conditions , but the decision to land rests with the pilot .
The other pilot aborted .
ATC called saying it could be 2 - 3 days before the sloppy runway was dry enough for safe landing .
The computer issued an alert about a fuel imbalance .
Captain Sonne explained that in older C - 130 variants , the flight engineer would have been aboard to monitor this , and then he explained some details about fuel balancing and why it ’s important to stay within constraints to maintain stability .
He reached around to his left and pulled out a book , explaining the different sections .
Some alarms were critical and could mean life and death , but this was just an alert to take care of some housekeeping .
He read the procedure , which he probably already had memorized , and dialed four overhead knobs to redistribute the fuel , explaining each step .
We landed back at KAF and prepared for the sortie to Camp Bastion , but got a report that an aircraft had a problem on the runway , and so the Bastion runway was shut down and there was a delay .
Meanwhile , a rocket attack occurred and so we ended up on the ground , and there was a nearby boom ( maybe a few hundred meters or more ) .
We wasted time in the bunker ( somebody ’s rule up top ) and the senior officer took inventory of his people , and finally the all - clear was sounded .
We learned that the runway at Bastion was still closed .
That was it .
Mission was over .
Not every mission goes perfectly , but then you ca n’t control the weather , or acts of God .
And in any case , this was seven doing the job of a hundred .
Birmingham - based Glynn Wilson , writing at truthout.org , says Shelby long has been a puppet for defense contractors :
Shelby has been trying to get a new FBI crime lab opened in Alabama , and he has been trying for months to strong arm the Air Force into reversing a legitimate bid of $ 35 billion as part of a $ 100 billion contract granted to Boeing to build refueling tankers for the military .
Shelby wanted the contract to go to Northrop Grumman / EADs , a company which has given heavily to finance his campaigns and would have assembled the tankers in his home state .
According to Dave Levinthal , a spokesman for Center for Responsive Politics , campaign finance research indicated that Shelby has a close relationship with the defense industry , to put it mildly .
" During the past 20 years , the defense aerospace , defense electronics and miscellaneous defense industries all rank among his top 15 campaign donors by industry , " Levinthal said .
" Together , employees and political action committees associated with these industries have contributed more than $ 1.2 million to Sen. Shelby . "
Shelby also has been a steadfast friend to the financial - services sector and other corporate interests .
Writes Wilson :
According to files publicly available at OpenSecrets .
Org , Shelby is backed by not only the military - industrial complex , but also by the big banks , which benefit from Shelby 's support for deregulation on the powerful Senate Banking Committee .
He is also heavily supported by power companies , coal companies , telecommunication giants such as AT&T and the big insurance companies which obtained billions of dollars in government bailout money under both the Bush and Obama administrations .
Paul Krugman , of The New York Times , says Shelby 's antics are symbolic of a government that has grown dysfunctional :
The truth is that given the state of American politics , the way the Senate works is no longer consistent with a functioning government .
Senators themselves should recognize this fact and push through changes in those rules , including eliminating or at least limiting the filibuster .
This is something they could and should do , by majority vote , on the first day of the next Senate session .
That , however , is not likely to happen , Krugman writes :
Do n’t hold your breath .
As it is , Democrats do n’t even seem able to score political points by highlighting their opponents ’ obstructionism .
It should be a simple message ( and it should have been the central message in Massachusetts ) : a vote for a Republican , no matter what you think of him as a person , is a vote for paralysis .
But by now , we know how the Obama administration deals with those who would destroy it : it goes straight for the capillaries .
Sure enough , Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , accused Mr. Shelby of " silliness . "
Yep , that will really resonate with voters .
Keith Olbermann , of MSNBC , notes that Shelby is a world - class hypocrite .
Shelby decried obstructionist tactics when a Republican , George W. Bush , was in the White House .
But now that a Democrat resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. , Shelby is leading the obstructionist charge .
Says Olbermann :
The senator who is deliberately keeping American intelligence understaffed so he can get $ 35 billion to go to a foreign company from whose teat he sucks is . . .
Richard Shelby , of Alabama .
Ganging up on Richard Shelby , it turns out , is great sport .
And we are proud to be in some fine company .
You can check out the full Olbermann comment here :
A tiny island claimed for years by India and Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal has disappeared beneath the rising seas , scientists in India say .
The uninhabited territory south of the Hariabhanga river was known as New Moore Island to the Indians and South Talpatti Island to the Bangladeshis .
Recent satellites images show the whole island under water , says the School of Oceanographic Studies in Calcutta .
Its scientists say other nearby islands could also vanish as sea levels rise .
Beneath the waves
The BBC's Chris Morris in Delhi says there has never been a permanent settlement on the now - vanished island , which even in its heyday was never more than two metres ( about six feet ) above sea level .
Loss of land is an annual reality for many Bangladeshis
In the past , however , the territorial dispute led to visits by Indian naval vessels and the temporary deployment of a contingent from the country 's Border Security Force .
" What these two countries could not achieve from years of talking , has been resolved by global warming , " said Professor Sugata Hazra of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University in Calcutta .
Anyone wishing to visit now , he observed , would have to think of travelling by submarine .
Professor Hazra said his studies revealed that sea levels in this part of the Bay of Bengal have risen much faster over the past decade than they had done in the previous 15 years .
And he predicts that in the coming decade other islands in the Sundarbans delta region will follow New Moore , or South Talpatti , beneath the waves .
" We will have ever larger numbers of people displaced from the Sunderbans as more island areas come under water , " Prof Hazra said .

Tiny generators developed at the University of Michigan could produce enough electricity from random , ambient vibrations to power a wristwatch , pacemaker or wireless sensor .
The energy - harvesting devices , created at U - M's Engineering Research Center for Wireless Integrated Microsystems , are highly efficient at providing renewable electrical power from arbitrary , non-periodic vibrations .
This type of vibration is a byproduct of traffic driving on bridges , machinery operating in factories and humans moving their limbs , for example .
The Parametric Frequency Increased Generators ( PFIGs ) were created by Khalil Najafi , chair of electrical and computer engineering , and Tzeno Galchev , a doctoral student in the same department .
Most similar devices have more limited abilities because they rely on regular , predictable energy sources , said Najafi , who is the Schlumberger Professor of Engineering and also a professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering .
" The vast majority of environmental kinetic energy surrounding us everyday does not occur in periodic , repeatable patterns .
Energy from traffic on a busy street or bridge or in a tunnel , and people walking up and down stairs , for example , cause vibrations that are non-periodic and occur at low frequencies , " Najafi said .
" Our parametric generators are more efficient in these environments . "
The researchers have built three prototypes and a fourth is forthcoming .
In two of the generators , the energy conversion is performed through electromagnetic induction , in which a coil is subjected to a varying magnetic field .
This is a process similar to how large - scale generators in big power plants operate .

The latest and smallest device , which measures one cubic centimeter , uses a piezoelectric material , which is a type of material that produces charge when it is stressed .
This version has applications in infrastructure health monitoring .
The generators could one day power bridge sensors that would warn inspectors of cracks or corrosion before human eyes could discern problems .
The generators have demonstrated that they can produce up to 0.5 milliwatts ( or 500 microwatts ) from typical vibration amplitudes found on the human body .
That 's more than enough energy to run a wristwatch , which needs between one and 10 microwatts , or a pacemaker , which needs between 10 and 50 .
A milliwatt is 1,000 microwatts .
" The ultimate goal is to enable various applications like remote wireless sensors and surgically implanted medical devices , " Galchev said .
" These are long lifetime applications where it is very costly to replace depleted batteries or , worse , to have to wire the sensors to a power source . "
Batteries are often an inefficient way to power the growing array of wireless sensors being created today , Najafi said .
Energy scavenging can provide a better option .
" There is a fundamental question that needs to be answered about how to power wireless electronic devices , which are becoming ubiquitous and at the same time very efficient , " Najafi said .
" There is plenty of energy surrounding these systems in the form of vibrations , heat , solar , and wind . "
These generators could also power wireless sensors deployed in buildings to make them more energy efficient , or throughout large public spaces to monitor for toxins or pollutants .
The research is funded by the National Science Foundation , Sandia National Laboratories , and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
The university is pursuing patent protection for the intellectual property .
Galchev and a team of engineering and business students are working to commercialize the technology through their company , Enertia .
Enertia recently won first place in the DTE / U- M Clean Energy Prize business plan competition and second place in the U - M Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies ' Michigan Business Challenge .
Other members of the team are Erkan Aktakka , and Adam Carver .
Aktakka is an electrical engineering doctoral student .
Carver is an MBA student at the Ross School of Business .

Form validation is one of the most important aspect on any web application .
More the form is secure more secure will be the application .
So as to validate form using jquery , is really simple and can be highly customize .
.
Here is the DEMO how it looks .
How it works ?
Simple , in this plugin we have to set three parameters for every required class .
User can set his own class and define rule .
Moreover , user can also set events onError and OnValid for a particular class thus giving user high customization , he / she can add their own effects , may be jquery animate ( ) .
required : { //required is a class rule : function ( ) { // define some rule } , onError : function ( ) { // do something on error } , onValid : function ( ) { // do something on valid } } , . . . . . .
someNewClass : { //someNewClass is a class rule : function ( ) { // define some rule } , onError : function ( ) { // do something on error } , onValid : function ( ) { // do something on valid } } , submitHandler : function ( ) { // do something on submit form return false ; // remove this line if you need to refresh page on valid form }
.
Using this function I have created this DEMO

For example , in the early days , they ignored advice to close the Mexican border and pre-emptively shut school systems .
They released part of the national Tamiflu stockpile , but did not give it to millions of healthy people prophylactically , as Britain did .
They ordered vaccine made with a 50 - year - old egg technology rather than experimental methods .
They bought adjuvants  chemical “ boosters ”  that could have stretched the first 25 million vaccine doses into 100 million , but did not use them for fear of triggering a backlash among Americans made nervous by the messages of the antivaccine movement .
To alert the public without alarming it , a stream of officials  from doctors in the navy blue and scrambled - eggs gold of the Public Health Service to a somber President Obama in the White House  offered updates , at least twice a week for months .
It is now clear that this is the least lethal modern pandemic .
The flu appears to kill about one of every 2,000 people who get it , American researchers say .
( British researchers found half that death rate . )
By contrast , the Spanish flu of 1918 killed about 50 of every 2,000 , and the 1957 and 1968 pandemics killed about 4 of every 2,000 .
The flu has reached more than 200 countries and is still peaking in places like Eastern Europe and Russia .
Even though there was no vaccine yet , it killed fewer than expected during the Southern Hemisphere ’s winter , June through August .
Officials in the United States conceded that some mistakes were made .
For example , they could have spotted the new virus earlier if there had been better cooperation with Mexico .
In late April , the United States isolated it in samples from Texas and California just as Canadian officials were testing Mexican ones .
The outbreak probably began in rural Mexico in January , but was spotted only when thousands fell ill in late March or early April in Mexico City .
The C.D.C. tests viruses in Southeast Asia , where new flus are usually born .
“ This time , ” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden , the C.D.C. director , “ one happened to emerge in a place where we do n’t have a surveillance system . ”
The Liverpool winger Albert Riera has been suspended by the club for his outspoken attack on the manager , Rafael Benítez , and the club .
The Spain international has been disciplined by Benítez and told not to return to the Merseysiders ' Melwood training ground until Monday , it is understood .
Other reports suggest the player will also been placed on the transfer list and will be fined two weeks ' wages .
Riera launched a critical broadside at Benítez , claiming he did not speak to him , and described Liverpool as a " sinking ship " .
Benítez is believed to be fuming about the timing of the interview , which was broadcast less than 24 hours before tonight 's Europa League last - 16 second leg at home to Lille , which Liverpool won 3 - 0 ( 3 - 1 on aggregate ) , and he has taken swift action to discipline the player .
The suspension means Riera , who came on as a substitute in Lille last week but was not on the bench for Monday 's Premier League victory over Portsmouth , missed the Europa League second leg tie and will be missing from Sunday 's trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United .
In his interview Riera told Radio Marca : " When the coach says nothing to you and you are well , with no physical problems and training well , you cannot help but think it must be something personal . "
He also went on to say he felt Liverpool were a " sinking ship " after a poor season which has seen early exits from the title race , Champions League and FA Cup .
However , the former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann strongly criticised the 27 - year - old for looking to shift the blame from some mediocre personal performances in the current campaign .
" I did n't read too much into the comments because he 's a player who has not played too much football over the last six to eight months , " said the former Germany international .
" He is clearly frustrated but you have to say since he signed for Liverpool [ in the summer of 2008 ] he has not done enough to really have an opinion on the manager .
" If Riera is not in the team , it is probably because he is not doing enough in training or in games .
The first question you have to ask when you are not playing is have you done enough to be in the team .
" It happens too often with players who can't get in the team and the first thing they do is blame the manager .
They should look at themselves .
" I can honestly say I have never had a problem with a manager in 15 years of my career and I would never blame a manager for my not playing . "
126 workers a day join public payroll ... while private employers axe 1,440 jobs
About 1,440 private sector workers lost their jobs every day last year - but the number of state employees rose by 126 a day , official figures revealed yesterday .
The data from the Office for National Statistics shows how those employed at private firms have paid the price of the recession while a record 6.09 million now work in the ballooning private sector - equal to more than 20 per cent of the entire workforce .
The unemployment figures paint a mixed picture for the economy .
Given up :
More than one in five people of working age are out of work but have stopped trying to find job
The number who are out of work has fallen by 33,000 in the last quarter to 2.45 million , the lowest for almost a year and the biggest three - monthly fall for almost three years .
The pound rose by more than 0.8 per cent against the dollar to $ 1.536 on the news .
But Yvette Cooper , the Work and Pensions Secretary , said of the unemployment statistics : ' We 're not out of the woods yet . '
U - TURN ON JOBCENTRES
The Government has been forced to reopen four jobcentres that cost more than £ 1 million to close because of the pressure to deal with unemployment , it emerged today .
A Parliamentary question revealed the Government spent £ 336,000 closing a centre in South Northfield , Birmingham , and £ 758,000 closing another in Bexleyheath , south east London .
Further centres in Bolton and Erdington , Birmingham , also had to be reopened .
The LibDems accused Labour of performing a U - turn because of unemployment has ' wreaked havoc ' during the recession .
Work and pensions spokesman Steve Webb said : ' Jobseekers need all the help they can get and should n't have to travel miles to get it .
' The Government was arrogant and short - sighted to close more than 500 jobcentres at a great cost to taxpayers .
It is a shame they did n't realise their mistake sooner . '
The data also revealed how the economic downturn has triggered a series of dire changes for workers and those who have lost their jobs .
They show :
Long - term unemployment is soaring , with a rise of nearly 50 per cent in the number out of work for at least 12 months ;
Those over the age of 50 - the most difficult age to get a job - are the most vulnerable , with nearly 398,000 unemployed , the largest number for 15 years ;
One in five of working age do not have a job , with the number of ' economically inactive ' soaring to 8.1 million , the highest since records began in 1971 ;
More than one million employees - another record - are being forced to work parttime because they cannot get a full - time job ;
The employment rate is just 72.2 per cent , the lowest percentage of the working - age population to be in employment since 1996 .
REGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT
North East - 9.5 %
120,000 unemployed , down 1,000
North West - 8.6 %
290,000 up 3,000

In a further blow for private sector workers , it shows public sector employees get paid more money , and enjoyed an average inflation - busting pay rise of 4.1 per cent .
Private sector workers got a pay cut of - 0.7 per cent , fuelling an ' employment apartheid ' .
Dr John Philpott , chief economic adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development , said the jobs market is being ' propped up ' by the public sector .
Tory work spokesman , Theresa May , said : ' With fewer people in work and fewer jobs in the economy there is now a real fear of a jobless recovery under Labour . '
A separate note from the Bank of England raised its fears about the chances of people getting another job .
Its research showed most redundancy programmes have been ' largely completed ' , but bosses are using temporary staff or reinstating ' normal ' working hours , rather than recruiting new workers .
Overall , the figures show the number of employed people dropped 54,000 between November and January , compared to the previous quarter , to 28.9 million .
The number of people claiming Jobseeker 's Allowance , known as the claimant count , fell by 32,300 to 1.58 million , the sharpest monthly fall since 1997 .
Students swell jobless ranks
One in four people of working - age do not have a job - and most are not even looking for one , the ONS figures revealed .
The number of those who are ' economically inactive ' has soared to 8.15 million , the highest since records began in 1971 .
Soaring numbers of students have helped fuel the rise , with the biggest quarterly increase in students ever recorded .
' Economic inactivity ' means someone either does not want a job , such as a housewife or somebody who is longterm sick , or wants a job but has not looked for one in the last four weeks .
If the number of unemployed is included , the jobless total rises to 10.6 million , 28 per cent of the workingage population .
Between November and January , nearly 100,000 started studying , with many saying they had no choice after failing to get a job .
Tory work spokesman , Theresa May , said : ' The record levels of economic inactivity ' suggest ' hidden levels of unemployment ' .
Yvette Cooper , Secretary of State for Work , said : ' As the country pulls out of recession the more skills and qualifications people have the easier they will find it to get back into work . '
SWAT team breaks into home , fires seven rounds at family 's pit bull and corgi (?! ) as a seven - year - old looks on .
They found a " small amount " of marijuana , enough for a misdemeanor charge .
The parents were then charged with child endangerment .
So smoking pot = " child endangerment . "
Storming a home with guns , then firing bullets into the family pets as a child looks on = necessary police procedures to ensure everyone 's safety .
Just so we 're clear .

About 20,000 people sign up for food stamps every day , and college students across the country are the newest demographic being encouraged to enlist .
Portland State University devotes a page on its
Web site to explaining the ease with which students can receive benefits , along with instructions on how to apply .
The school says food stamps are not charity but rather a benefit all honest taxpaying citizens can afford .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture renamed food stamps the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program ( SNAP ) in 2008 , instituted electronic debit cards instead of coupons , and began an aggressive push to expand eligibility .
This is from the school ’s site :
Here are some additional SNAP facts :
• Over half of all U.S. citizens will use SNAP at least once during their lifetime .
• SNAP is not a charity .
As a taxpayer , you are paying into this program and , when needed , you can reap the benefits .
• There are enough SNAP dollars for everyone that needs them .
As a matter of fact , about 20 percent of Oregonians who are eligible for SNAP do not apply .
• Students receiving SNAP can defer their student loans while they are receiving benefits .
• Applying for SNAP is easy .
In most cases , you will not have to apply more than once a year .
Traditionally food stamps are for the working poor and single parents , but colleges are trying to make it as easy as possible for students to obtain federal assistance , no matter their socio-economic background .
Oregon has a state - wide non-profit which includes a special focus on food stamps for students :
Being a college student is hard work !
Not just academically , but financially too .
Many students are surprised to learn they may be eligible for SNAP ( food stamps ) .
Students who meet income guidelines may qualify if they meet at least one of the following criteria :
Full - time student who works at least 20 hours per week .
Full - time single student who is caring for children younger than the age of 12 .
Full - time married student who is caring for children younger than the age of 6 .
At least a half - time student who is actively working any hours in a work - study program .
Note : federal financial aid including Pell grants , Perkins loans , Stafford loans and most work - study is not counted as income against student eligibility .
In addition , the school notes that the federal government is working to eliminate the stigma associated with taking the government coupons to the checkout line :
Your EBT card looks and works like a debit card .
You swipe it as you would a debit card , select “ EBT ” as the payment method , and enter the pin # that was assigned to you .
No one except the cashier will know that it is an EBT card .
The Grand Views , a college newspaper from Grand View University in Des Moines , Iowa , featured a story on students who apply for food stamps because they claim they do n’t have time to hold down a job between classes and basketball practices .
The paper wrote :
Once you show up , you sign in on a computer , answer a few questions and then they tell you if you qualify .
It ’s pretty simple .
Massachusetts has several state - wide nonprofits that specifically help college students get food stamps .
The Web site details the caveats associated with eligibility :
Q4 : Can I get benefits if I still live with my parents ?
If you are 22 or older , and if you buy and prepare more than half your meals separately from your parents , you can still apply for SNAP / Food Stamps for yourself .
Adam Sylvain , a sophomore at Virginia ’s George Mason University , recounted a recent conversation with friends in his dorm room .
“ My roommate told me he applied for food stamps , and they told him he qualified for $ 200 a month in benefits , ” Sylvain said .
“ He ’s here on scholarship and he saves over $ 5,000 each summer in cash . ”
“ A few of our other friends who were in the room also said if there were able to , they would get food stamps …
They think that if they ’re eligible it ’s the government ’s fault , so they might as well , ” Sylvain said .
Students at GMU can buy a meal plan for $ 1,275 that provides 10 meals a week for the semester — that ’s $ 71 a week .
As previously reported by The Daily Caller , The USDA is pushing to regional SNAP offices to ease eligibility requirements and forgo checking people ’s financial situations before providing benefits .
President Obama ’s latest budget included $ 72.5 billion for food stamps — nearly double the amount from 2008 .
Approximately 38 million people , or 13 percent of the U.S. population is on food stamps .
It ’s a trend that seems on the rise — Salon recently reported on young , broke hipsters using federal assistance to buy high - end organic food :
“ I ’m sort of a foodie , and I ’m not going to do the ‘ living off ramen ’ thing , ” one young man said , fondly remembering a recent meal he ’d prepared of roasted rabbit with butter , tarragon and sweet potatoes .
“ I used to think that you could only get processed food and government cheese on food stamps , but it ’s great that you can get anything . ”
The USDA ’s Food and Nutrition Service did not respond to request for comment .

Reverse Engineering the iPod Shuffle 3G headphone remote protocol David Carne Background On March 11th , 2009 , Apple introduced the third generation iPod shuffle .
Shortly thereafter , criticism [ 1 ] was raised regarding the presence of a proprietary chip inside the shuffle headphones , said by some to be an authentication , or DRM measure .
The " DRM " argument was unsupported by the facts , given that the shuffle would simply start playing with a non-remote headphone connected , albeit with no remote functionality .
The " authentication " argument was dismissed shortly thereafter by reports that the chip was simply a " Dual Mode Modulator . " [ 2 ]
I purchased an iPod shuffle in June of 2009 to use while running , since my old iPod was a bit bulky for the task .
However , the first time I took the shuffle with me , the headphone remote died halfway through the run because the remote module was not designed to deal with sweat , or moisture of any kind .
Some would argue that this is a fatal design flaw for a product advertised for use during exercise .
Now that I had a flaky / semi - broken pair of headphones , what else was there to do but hack them !
I only got around to finishing and writing up the hack in February 2010 , hence the delayed creation of this report .
Figure 1 - Button side of the Remote Figure 2 - Circuit side of the Remote Figure 3 - Remote connection Diagram Figure 4 - Tracing of visible remote tracks Disassembly and Hardware Overview Disassembly of the shuffle headphones is simple - the enclosure snaps together , and the remote control board sits within .
No photos were taken of this stage of the process , but a disassembly photo can be found at iFixit .
Once disassembled , the remote board can be desoldered from the two wires attached to it .
Figures 1 and 2 show the button side and the circuit side [ hereafter referred to as " Top " and " Bottom " ] of the remote .
The Top of the remote contains 3 sets of pads , each composed of an outer ring , and a centre contact .
Over each pad a metal dome held down with an adhesive pad is placed , and the dome , when pressed , makes contact between the outer ring and the central pad .
On the bottom of the board there is an integrated circuit , a diode for reverse polarity protection and 7 passive components .
Two connection pads can be found on the bottom of the board , and the headphone cable is soldered to these pads .
See Figure 3 for a connection diagram .
Fig. 4 is a colorized image of the tracks and components , as viewed through the bottom of the board .
By following the tracks , it becomes apparent that the play / pause button simply shorts the CTL line and the GND line .
The Volume up and Volume down buttons are connected to the proprietary IC and functionality cannot be determined from simply looking at the hardware .
Figure 5 - Volume Up / Down Signals Figure 6 - Basic Test Circuit Investigating the Signalling
To figure out the behaviour of the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons , we must look at the signalling as it is on the control line .
The control line is driven from the shuffle with a known impedance , such that if a load is placed on it , the voltage on the control line will drop .
See Figure 5 for captured waveforms of up / down button presses .
Volume up was measured to cause voltage droop from a nominal 2.08 V down to 1.68 V .
Volume Down was measured to cause a voltage droop to 1.52 V .
The voltage droop was present for the entire duration of the button push .
At this point , the meaning and source of the 4.8 millisecond grounding of the signal was unknown .
To verify the behaviour gathered so far , I built a test circuit , described in Figure 6 .
I left the shuffle remote in - circuit so it could generate the " power - up " signalling [ described later ] .
This circuit worked as expected , and it even worked perfectly with the original remote removed , as long as the remote was attached at powerup to identify the remote to the shuffle .
Interestingly , the 4.8 ms low - pulse was still present , with only the pushbutton / resistor circuit connected , without the original remote .
That indicated that the shuffle was actually generating the low pulse , not the remote .
This may serve as an acknowledgement of some kind .
From now on , this kind of low pulse will be termed an " ACK " pulse .
Figure 7 - Power on signals Figure 8 - Power - on waveform mimic Power - On signalling Given that the remote signalling works after power - on authentication , the next logical step was to look at the power on signalling .
Figure 7 is two captures of the Shuffle power - on behaviour .
The upper signal [ in grey ] is a successful authentication of a remote , and power is kept on to the remote , from the shuffle .
At bottom is the same power on behaviour , except without a remote connected .
The waveform seemed fairly simple , and I figured that in this case , the " low " pulse was likely generated by the remote , as I could n't see any other distinguishing features in the waveform .
I proceeded to build increasingly complex circuitry to accurately mimic the waveforms seen in a successful authentication [ RC circuits to get rise times right ] culminating in the waveform in Figure 8 .
Figure 8 is the emulated waveform in black overlapping the original remote waveform in grey .
The circuits worked by switching in and out different impedances , with timing controlled by a microcontroller .
None of these attempts successfully authenticated as a remote , despite the high level of similarity between the original and emulated waveforms .
To determine where the low pulse was coming from , I monitored the current flowing to the device - a simple 1 K resistor works as a current sensor .
This confirmed my suspicions that the low pulse was actually another " ack " , and was generated by the shuffle .
So the question then was - what the heck is the shuffle seeing in the signal ?
Figure 9 - ID / Auth chirp Power - On signalling - take 2
After digging around a bunch , and building an amplified current sensor , I found the power - on detection was actually a 100 mV / 10 uA ultrasonic chirp occurring 8.1 msec after power up .
This would seem to coincide with the mention of " ultrasonic " by iLounge .
Figure 9 has a blown up view of the chirp .
In figure 9 , the upper signal is voltage , and the lower is current .
The current signal , measured with a 1 k resistor , was run through a 5 x preamp made from a precision op - amp to bring it up to the level seen in the figure .
The ultrasonic chirp is actually a dual - frequency chirp , consisting of 1.5msec of 280 khz , followed by 4.6msec of 244khz .
[ Doing a binary - search by hand using the scope trigger to find the transition point is no fun ] .
There is a configurable pulldown applied by the remote during the period between the rising edge of CTL and the ack pulse .
The shuffle expects this pull to be gone after the ack pulse , and operation is unreliable if the pullup is left on .
The shuffle will not recognize the remote without the presence of this pulldown
The shuffle changes the power supply after the ack pulse .
During the power - on phase , the power supply floats to around 2.72V , and rests at 2.4V with the expected pulldown .
After the power - on phase , the CTL power supply floats at 2.08 V .
[ See Fig. 8 for detail ] .
Figure 10 - Test prototype schematic Figure 11 - Filter response Figure 12 - Test prototype Figure 13 - Good working waveforms Emulating the Remote Now that I knew how to successfully authenticate , I could extend the circuit in Figure 6 to add the power - on chirp , and power - on pulldown .
For initial testing , I used an ATmega88 microcontroller to generate the chirp and control the pulldown , as I had a bunch kicking around in my parts drawers .
The downside of using that part is that it wo n't run on the voltage or current the shuffle can supply , meaning for this test , I used an external power supply .
First off - the microcontroller had to detect when the power came on from the shuffle .
Vih for the ATmega88 operating at 5V is ~ 2.6V , so I could n't use a regular IO pin to watch the line .
The ATmega88 has a handy internal analog comparator , and it also has a convenient 1.1V reference .
The 1.1V ref can be connected internally to the positive side of the comparator , so I connected the CTL line to AIN1 , Pin 13 , which is the negative input to the comparator .
To watch for the rising edge , the firmware polls bit AC0 of the ACSR register , watching for it to go low [ to indicate the input has risen above 1.1V ] .
At this point the firmware starts timing to the start of the chirp + enables the pulldown .
The controllable pulldown is simple - a 17.2 k resistor is connected from CTL to the drain of a 2n7002 mosfet , which in turn , has its source tied to GND .
[ See Fig 10 for more detail ] .
The 2n7002 is driven via a 100 ohm resistor by pin PC5 of the ATmega88 .
Driving PC5 high will enable the pulldown , and driving PC5 low will disable it .
Creating the chirp is slightly more complex , but the onboard PWM hardware can be used as a starting point .
I used the Fast PWM mode , and OCR0A + OCR0B as a frequency generator , and then filtered out the high frequency components .
A quick thrown - together bandpass filter is shown in the schematic .
The base frequency is not in the middle of the filter response [ See Figure 11 ] , but the filter suffices because we only care about eliminating DC and the higher harmonics , and attenuating the generated frequency to match the original chirp .
At 276 khz , the filter attenuates the fundamental frequency to 186 m Vp - p , and the 3rd harmonic is down at 24 m Vp - p which is sufficient for my purposes .
I created a quick test prototype - Figure 12 , which ran the code in Listing 1 . # define F_CPU 8000000 # include < avr / io.h > # include < util / delay.h >
# define CTL_PIN ( 1< <5 ) # define CTL_HI (!( ACSR & ( 1< < ACO ) ) ) void main ( ) { CLKPR = 0x80 ; CLKPR = 0x0 ; ADCSRB &= ~ ( 1 << ACME ) ; ACSR |= ( 1 << ACBG ) ; TCCR0A = 0x03 ; TCCR0B = 0x09 ; OCR0B = 7 ; DDRC = CTL_PIN ; while ( 1 ) { PORTC = 0 ; while ( ! CTL_HI ) ; _delay_ms ( 4.1 ) ; PORTC |= CTL_PIN ; _delay_ms ( 4.2 ) ; // 280 khz burst TCCR0A = 0x23 ; TCNT0 = 0x0 ; OCR0A = 27 ; DDRD |= 1 << 5 ; _delay_ms ( 1.5 ) ; // 245 khz burst OCR0A = 33 ; TCNT0 = 0x0 ; _delay_ms ( 4.6 ) ; // burst off TCCR0A = 0x03 ; DDRD &= ~ ( 1 << 5 ) ; // wait for ack pulse while ( CTL_HI ) ; // kill init pulldown PORTC &= ~ CTL_PIN ; //
Just hang around and // wait for loss - of - signal while ( 1 ) { while ( CTL_HI ) ; _delay_ms ( 100 ) ; if ( ! CTL_HI ) break ; } } } Listing 1 - ATmega88 demo source .
After a bit of frequency + timing tweaking , the replacement remote reliably emulated the original shuffle remote .
Volume controls , play pause , and power on detection all worked .
Conclusion
So , is that chip a " DRM " or " Authentication " chip ?
Well , the jury is still out on that one .
The ultrasonic chirp at startup is a bit suspicious , but it may be to indicate the remote type to allow for future remote expansions , or so it can behave differently when connected to a phone type device .
Given the simplicity of the chirp - my thoughts are that it is purely an identifier , and less an authentication method .
Any manufacturer that wanted to design a compatible accessory without Apple 's permission would be able to reverse engineer the chirp just as I did .
Future Plans
At some point in the future when I have time , I plan to build a low power MSP430 based replacement , that can run solely off the power supply generated by the shuffle .
I 'd like to investigate building a capacitive touch sensor remote , since that could be made completely waterproof .

Microsoft's Aaron Woodman just pulled off a little surprise here at The Engadget Show : he brought out LG's Windows Phone 7 Series pre-production prototype !
The QWERTY slider is the first branded Windows Phone 7 Series device the world 's ever seen , and while the hardware and software are both obviously early , we can tell you a few things about it : it 's just a hair thicker than an iPhone or Nexus One , there are dedicated hardware camera , volume , and power buttons in addition to the back , home , and search buttons dictated by Windows Phone 7 Series , and we noticed a five megapixel camera with a flash on the back , along with a headphone jack .
Ca n't say much apart from that right now , since things are so early and everything is subject to change , but things are certainly moving along .
It 's all going down on the show right now -- see it on video after the break !
Come getta Q - Tip ..
You know you need a Q - tip C'mon ..

The moon could have been born from a blob of the Earth 's mantle , blasted outward by the explosion of a runaway nuclear geo-reactor , a new study claims .
If correct , it would replace the scientifically accepted model for the origins of the moon , known as the " giant impact theory . "
That theory suggests a Mars - sized planet called Theia slammed into the early proto - Earth about 62 million years after the solar system 's birth — 4.6 billion years ago .
The iron and nickel core of both planets coalesced to form the Earth , while the lighter silicate mantle and crust was ejected into space to form the moon — explaining why the moon is n't as dense as Earth .
Computer simulations suggest about 80 per cent of the moon came from the impactor and 20 per cent from the proto - Earth .
But Rob de Meijer at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa and Wim van Westrenen of VU University in Amsterdam believe the theory has a problem .
" Both moon and Earth rocks have almost the same isotopic content , which is put down to debris mixing in orbit as the moon formed , " they write in a paper published on the electronic preprint website arXiv .
" While that works for lighter elements , it can't easily account for the identical ratio of heavier elements such as chromium , neodymium and tungsten . "
According to the paper , the Earth was once a rapidly spinning mass of molten rock with gravity only just preventing it from spinning apart .
" Just a slight kick would have been enough to eject a blob into orbit , eventually forming the moon , " they write .
Nuclear kickstart
The idea has been around for ages , but rejected because nobody could work out where the energy to kick a lunar - sized blob into orbit could have come from .
De Meijer and van Westrenen believe the energy could have come from a nuclear explosion deep in the Earth 's mantle .
" High concentrations of radioactive elements like uranium and thorium near the Earth 's surface could have caused a runaway nuclear chain reaction going supercritical , " they write .
" The explosion blasted material into orbit eventually forming the moon . "
Natural nuclear fission reactors are known to have existed on Earth .
In 1972 , French physicist Francis Perrin discovered evidence of nuclear chain reactions having taken place two billion years ago in uranium deposits in Gabon , in West Africa .
But planetary scientist Simon O'Toole of the Anglo Australian Observatory said that " while it 's an interesting idea , the science is n't strong . "
" It 's based around the disputed hypothesis of a naturally occurring georeactor going super critical . "
O'Toole said , " the assumptions required for their idea to work are so large compared to the generally accepted theory , that if you apply Ockham 's Razor and ask what 's most likely , well , this is n't it ! "
" The idea of the Earth spewing out the moon is great for science fiction , but a bit hairy for science fact . "
He said : " Vegas is I feel the most surreal place in the world .
In the middle of the desert you have this huge neon - lit metropolis , which is bizarre in itself .
Everywhere you look when you are on The Strip or Downtown there are flashing lights to mesmerise you .
I found myself trying to give my eyes a rest from the chaos by looking at the floor , but there is no respite even there .
I noticed the carpets were as loud as everything else out there and I was really blown away by the detail and effort that had gone into them .
They are like carpets you see nowhere else .
Only in Vegas , as the saying goes "

By the way , all that bitchin ’ great stuff that Carly Fiorina has done ( vaguely alluded to right there at the end of the Fellini Faillini epic ) ?
Best we can tell they have to be referring to her memorable stint as CEO of HP .
How ’d that go , you ask ?
“ When Fiorina became CEO in July , 1999 , HP ’s stock price was $ 52 per share , and when she left 5 years later in February , 2005 , it was $ 21 per share — a loss of over 60 % of the stock ’s value .
During this same time period , HP competitor Dell ’s stock price increased from $ 37 to $ 40 per share . ”
All of which led the folks at Portfolio to name her the 19th worst CEO of all time .
A consummate self - promoter , Fiorina was busy pontificating on the lecture circuit and posing for magazine covers while her company floundered .
She paid herself handsome bonuses and perks while laying off thousands of employees to cut costs .
The merger Fiorina orchestrated with Compaq in 2002 was widely seen as a failure .
She was ousted in 2005 .
I guess they do n’t call her “ Carly Failorina ” for nothing , huh ?
But hey , what do I care ?
I live in Colorado and Carly ’s in Cali .
Even better , that vid features GOP - on - GOP action , which any aficionado of fine poli-porn can tell you is the hottest kind .
You know , hot in a “ Jesus H. Tebow , now I have to go scour my fucking eyeballs with Comet and steel wool ” way .
One thing ’s for sure , though – the 2012 Republican prez primary between Carly and Sarah Palin is gonna be a hoot .
Here ’s hoping they can get past their differences and give us political comedy fans the Carly / Sarah or Sarah / Carly ticket I know we ’ve all been dreaming of …
I love the self - titled record to death but it was difficult to make .
But that point is so over for us .
I do n't think we 've ever really entered this territory of just feeling amazing about everything like it is right now .
Pitchfork : After working in Toronto with producer Dave Newfeld on You Forgot It In People and Broken Social Scene , you decided to go to Chicago with Tortoise 's John McEntire for the new album .
How did that come about ?
KD : It goes back to when [ Stars bassist ]
Evan Cranley was trying to figure out where to record their album In Our Bedroom After the War , and -- knowing that I was a massive fan -- he just casually said to me , " I spoke to your boy John and he seemed like he was into producing the new Stars album , but we 're going to Vancouver . "
I just kind of spit my cigarette out and was like , " What do you mean ?
You can work with John McEntire ? ! "
Then , in October 2008 , we fooled around and had a session in John 's studio .
It was so much fun , and that 's when the wheels started turning .
So we had to start figuring out what we were going to do in terms of Newf , because there were still issues that I had n't worked out with him .
A bunch of us did n't know how we were going to do this record without Newfeld because he played such a massive , massive role in all our success .
He was very involved -- I mean , he used to come on the talkback and suggest lyric changes [ laughs ] .
So we were quite scared to take a lot of it on ourselves .
I called Newf up and told him what was going on and he gave his blessing , and that actually was a catalyst for him and I getting back on the same page , which I 'm really grateful for because he is one of my favorite people in the world .
Then I suddenly I found myself in a whole different world .
Johnny is very , very different .
Very quiet .
He lets you figure it out .
Sometimes we would bust into tunes and be like , [ takes deep breath ]
" OK , let 's see what he thinks about this one . "
We did n't really know how he was feeling about everything for a little while .
Then one night a couple of us went out for drinks with him and at about the fourth drink in he started opening up and telling us what he thought about the songs .
It became a trend .
And then it became sort of a joke -- a band member would come up to me and be like , " I 'm really tired and I can't go out tonight but would you ask John how he felt about my part in this song ? " [ laughs ]
I consider John a good friend now and I 'm happy to say he 's joining the band .
Obviously , he 's still got Sea and Cake and Tortoise -- but when he 's free , he 's going to come out and play with us .
I 'm just trying to live my teenage dreams over here , and this was definitely one of them .
Pitchfork : Was it tough to get people like Feist , and members of Stars and Metric involved this time around ?
KD : Well , there was a point where it looked like it was going to be a core - member record and we were n't going to get those people because they were so busy ;
Stars were making a record , Metric was on the road .
We thought , " It 's OK , we can do this without them .
We can move on .
It 's not like that anymore . "
But when we brought Johnny to Toronto and set up it was immediately like old times .
So , right at the end , everybody made it on .

Darryl Williams died Sunday .
Toughest guy I ever knew .
Darryl had every reason to complain and hate .
And yet he never complained and he never hated .
Our city was five years into school desegregation and tensions were still running high when Williams and his all - black Jamaica Plain teammates went to Charlestown for a high school football game Sept. 28 , 1979 .
Darryl , a sophomore , had just caught his first varsity pass and was standing in the end zone with his teammates at halftime when he was felled by a bullet in the back of the neck .
The shot came from a projects rooftop across the street .
Three beered - up white teens later said they were shooting at pigeons , but everybody knew what they were really doing .
Mayor Kevin
White immediately said the crime was racially motivated .
Three days later , Pope John Paul II prayed for Darryl on Boston Common .
The bullet changed everything for Williams .
It made him a quadriplegic .
It put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life  a life that ended unexpectedly of respiratory failure at his home south of Boston yesterday morning .
What a life .
Darryl was a motivational speaker , spreading the message of forgiveness and compassion .
He also had a job with the Massachusetts State Lottery and served as an outreach specialist for Northeasterns Center for the Study of Sport in Society .
He earned a bachelors degree in human resources management from Northeastern .
He was forever speaking to young people , and in 2008 accepted The Sports Museums Special Achievement Award at the Tradition at the Garden .
 I made peace with my situation long ago ,  Darryl said .
 I understand where hostility and ignorance come from and I m able to rise above it .
Ultimately it has a lot to do with knowing that other people look to me for inspiration .
They get inspiration and strength from me and that makes me feel honored .
People who heard Williams speak generally came away ... speechless .
They wondered how a victim of a hate crime could be filled with so much love and compassion .
They wondered how he could be so peaceful and optimistic after the bad hand hed been dealt .
That was just Darryl .
It was his nature .
He reasoned that the bullet had given him more time to think .
He put all that extra thinking to good use and dedicated his life to making the rest of us think .
I first met Williams in 1990 when I saw him in his wheelchair in the Chicago Bulls locker room .
He was there to meet Michael Jordan .
He had his picture taken with the superstar .
A mutual friend introduced us and Darryl gave me his number .
He said it would be OK to call .
I called , then went to his house with a tape recorder and we talked for a couple of hours for a Globe magazine story .
For the cover photo , he agreed to go back to the field where hed been shot .
This is the last place I felt the shirt on my back ,  he said that day .
It was the first and only time he went back .
A year later , Darryl had surgery to have the bullet removed from his neck .
He was amused when the Boston Police immediately confiscated the bullet .
Twelve - year - old evidence , I guess .
We became friends .
He called a lot .
He e-mailed a lot .
The word unique was part of his e-mail address .
He ended every message with Peace .
I was always amazed at Darryls technological and communication skills .
He had a little movement in his left arm , but most of his work was accomplished with a voice - activated computer and environmental control system .
Like most guys , Darryl liked watching sports on television .
He had a lot of opinions about everything and he loved to share those opinions .
He knew as much about the Patriots and Celtics as any fan .
He got his hair cut every week and wore great clothes .
He liked the ladies .
He had friends in all the front offices of the local teams and they did their best to take care of his ticket requests .
Darryls mom , Shirley Simmons , was there for him every day of his 46 years .
He is survived by one sister , Karmel .
He also had a posse of friends  cops , firefighters , entertainers  who would accompany him to concerts and ballgames .
He wrote a book and was trying to get it published .
He wanted Denzel Washington to play the lead when the book was made into a movie .
The book hasnt been published , the movie hasnt been made , and Darryl and his family never received true justice in the decades after the crime .
But those of us who knew him and loved him are changed forever because Darryl was here .
A fund has been established to assist the Williams family with the cost of the funeral services .

There ’s a new paper out by Dr. Edward Long that does some interesting comparisons to NCDC ’s raw data ( prior to adjustments ) that compares rural and urban station data , both raw and adjusted in the CONUS .
The paper is titled Contiguous U.S. Temperature Trends Using NCDC Raw and Adjusted Data for One - Per - State Rural and Urban Station Sets .
In it , Dr. Edward Long states :
“ The problem would seem to be the methodologies engendered in treatment for a mix of urban and rural locations ; that the ‘ adjustment ’ protocol appears to accent to a warming effect rather than eliminate it .
This , if correct , leaves serious doubt for whether the rate of increase in temperature found from the adjusted data is due to natural warming trends or warming because of another reason , such as erroneous consideration of the effects of urban warming . ”
Here is the comparison of raw rural and urban data :
And here is the comparison of adjusted rural and urban data :
Note that even adjusted urban data has as much as a 0.2 offset from adjusted rural data .
Dr. Long suggests that NCDC ’s adjustments eradicated the difference between rural and urban environments , thus hiding urban heating .
The consequence :
“ …is a five - fold increase in the rural temperature rate of increase and a slight decrease in the rate of increase of the urban temperature . ”
The analysis concludes that NCDC “ …has taken liberty to alter the actual rural measured values ” .
Thus the adjusted rural values are a systematic increase from the raw values , more and more back into time and a decrease for the more current years .
At the same time the urban temperatures were little , or not , adjusted from their raw values .
The results is an implication of warming that has not occurred in nature , but indeed has occurred in urban surroundings as people gathered more into cities and cities grew in size and became more industrial in nature .
So , in recognizing this aspect , one has to say there has been warming due to man , but it is an urban warming .
The temperatures due to nature itself , at least within the Contiguous U. S. , have increased at a non-significant rate and do not appear to have any correspondence to the presence or lack of presence of carbon dioxide .
The paper ’s summary reads :
Both raw and adjusted data from the NCDC has been examined for a selected Contiguous U. S. set of rural and urban stations , 48 each or one per State .
The raw data provides 0.13 and 0.79 oC / century temperature increase for the rural and urban environments .
The adjusted data provides 0.64 and 0.77 oC / century respectively .
The rates for the raw data appear to correspond to the historical change of rural and urban U. S. populations and indicate warming is due to urban warming .
Comparison of the adjusted data for the rural set to that of the raw data shows a systematic treatment that causes the rural adjusted set ’s temperature rate of increase to be 5 - fold more than that of the raw data .
The adjusted urban data set ’s and raw urban data set ’s rates of temperature increase are the same .
This suggests the consequence of the NCDC ’s protocol for adjusting the data is to cause historical data to take on the time - line characteristics of urban data .
The consequence intended or not , is to report a false rate of temperature increase for the Contiguous U. S .
The full paper may be found here : Contiguous U.S. Temperature Trends Using NCDC Raw and Adjusted Data for One - Per -State Rural and Urban Station Sets ( PDF ) and is freely available for viewing and distribution .
Dr. Long also recently wrote a column for The American Thinker titled : A Pending American Temperaturegate
As he points out in that column , Joe D’Aleo and I raised similar concerns in : Surface Temperature Records : Policy Driven Deception ?
( PDF )
UPDATE : A reader asked why divergence started in 1960 .
Urban growth could be one factor , but given that the paper is about NCDC adjustments , this graph from NOAA is likely germane :

February 3 , 2010 — The vampire squid can turn itself " inside out " to avoid predators — as seen in a video just released by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute to emphasize the need to protect deep - sea species from the effects of human activities .

Unedited Transcript
This menacing looking squid is just one of many species “ out of sight and out of mind ” that could be threatened by human activities far away from the part of the ocean in which they live .
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has released this video of the vampire squid to emphasize a report that raises a red flag about the earth ’s oceans .
Vampyroteuthis infernalis is a type of living fossil , meaning that it has seen very little change since it first appeared , before dinosaurs , about 300 million years ago .
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ’s Dr. Bruce Robison , who authored the report published in Conservation Biology , narrates the institute ’s video :
“ Vampyroteuthis has very large eyes , because it lives about a half a mile deep in the ocean , where the light is very dim .
We took these pictures from a deep diving robotic submarine .
And you can see the reflection of our lights in that beautiful blue eye . ”
The vampire squid has 8 long arms , and a long curly strand that serves as a sensory filament .
It has a unique ability to react when it is startled .
It can curl its web and arms around the rest of its body — turning sort of ‘ inside out . ’
This change in appearance may help it avoid being attacked by predators .
These cephalopods -- they ’re technically not squids -- live in the deep ocean with millions of other species , some of which are little - known and on which little study has been done .
Robison says human activities threaten all of these .
“ They are threatened by ocean warming , decreasing oxygen , pollution , overfishing , industrialization and dozens of other changes taking place in the deep .
We have a responsibility to learn all we can about these amazing animals and to protect them from the greatest danger to life in the deep : the human species . ”
Robison ’s focus is on the oceans ’ “ deep pelagic zones ” which extend down from about 330 feet below the surface to just above the deep seafloor — up to six miles below the surface .
While the sea floor has had significant study , he points out little exploration has been done on this water above the deep floor .
This zone is home to species eaten by fish that humans eat , such as tuna and salmon .
Many whales , turtles and giant squid also rely on this zone for their food .
East India Company coming to India again : Report Top Stories »

East India Company , whose forces once ruled over much of India , is coming to India again but under Indian ownership this time around , a British newspaper reported Monday .
Indian entrepreneur Sanjiv Mehta , who has bought all the shares in the company , will launch the East India Company 's store in the upmarket Mayfair neighbourhood of London in the spring , with plans to open a second by the year - end , The Times reported .
This will be followed by stores in India and the Middle East , with concessions in Japanese department stores and franchises in Russia , and finally the US .
The stores will sell teas , coffee and spices - in keeping with the company 's 400 - year history - but also chocolates , furniture , leather goods , fabrics , homewares , fruit pickles and sushi among 500 planned lines .
" In my lifetime I could not possibly create a brand like this .
Nobody could , " Mehta told The Times .
" This company has huge potential .
What makes this more special is that I am Indian , so there is a huge feeling of redemption for me .
It is buying back a company that owned India .
" It would be nice to go back to my motherland as the owner .
It is very personal to me , " said Mehta , who has invested 10 million pounds into developing the company with the help of wealthy investors .

what are u talking about sir , all Indian can't take part in Indian serious activities because , the talented student are studying from low level colleges & due to cast partition students having less marks getting the best college to study , after that , talented student can't get job easily because , companies need basically marks , approach .. they do not offer to show our talent ... in the last there is no way to getting good in govt job because there are 59 % part for other than generals & just 41 % for general students like us , , , i want to know if the same class people getting the same study , , then why they can't show there talent in study ..
they firstly enjoy in study & after that enjoyed on govt .. job as well ..
i want to know where should we go .. we not any property that we can start our own business .. so that is the reason that India is behind the another companies ...

John Burns Real Estate Consulting released a much - cited study this week arguing that the country has a " shadow inventory " of 5 million houses that will hit the market over the next few years .
Another startling assumption here : 80 % of homeowners who are currently delinquent on their mortgages will end up losing their houses .
Mortgage mods , meanwhile , will just delay the inevitable .
( From the perspective of the homeowners , it 's probably best to get the inevitable out of the way sooner rather than later , before throwing more money down the negative - equity rat hole . )
Below , John Collins of the O.C. Register interviews an author of the study , Wayne Yamano of John Burns Consulting :
Us : Your study says that five million of the 7.7 million delinquent homes will go through foreclosure or a “ foreclosure - related procedure . ”
How is this likely to occur ?
Wayne :
Most shadow inventory will get out onto the market as an REO or short sale .
In any event , it results in the homeowner losing their home , and that home being added to the supply of homes available for sale .
Us : Do the remaining 2.7 million borrowers get their loan payments caught up ?
Wayne :
Of the 7.7 million delinquent homeowners , we actually think that only about 1.6 million will be able avoid losing their homes , and that the remaining 6.1 million will lose their homes .
We say that there is 5 million units of shadow inventory because we estimate that about 1.1 million delinquent homeowners already have their homes listed for sale , and we would not classify those homes as “ shadow . ”
Us : When will this wave of foreclosures hit , and how will this shadow inventory affect home prices ?
Wayne :
We do n’t believe that the shadow inventory will be dumped onto the market all at once .
Although we do n’t believe modification efforts will truly save a lot of homeowners from losing their homes , we do believe that these programs are effective in delaying foreclosures and pushing out the additional supply to later years .
In terms of pricing , as long as the economic recovery continues and mortgage rates remain low , we do NOT expect another leg down in pricing , despite the looming shadow inventory problem .
However , if the economy takes another dip and mortgage rates spike , we ’re certain to see another decline in prices .

ST . LOUIS -- Detroit Red Wings forward Johan Franzen did n't look like someone coming off major knee surgery and playing his first game in four months .
He had jump in his legs , he had zip in his shot and he did n't hesitate to get involved physically during
on Tuesday night .
" When you only played ( three ) games all year , I did n't even know if he'd get through the game , so I was thrilled with that , '' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" Good for him . ''
Said Franzen : " Felt like the last game I played .
I felt good . ''
Franzen , who tore his left anterior cruciate ligament Oct. 8 , had four shots on goal and did n't shy from contact .
He nearly deposited David Backes into the Blues bench with a check in the first period and delivered an open-ice hit on Alexander Steen in the second period .
" I tried to get into that as quickly as possible , '' Franzen said .
" I have to play that way to play good . ''
Franzen started the game on a line with Valtteri Filppula and Dan Cleary .
Babcock moved Franzen to the top line , with Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg , in the third period .
Franzen assisted on Datsyuk 's goal .
" I thought he looked great for not having played for four months .
He looked real solid , '' Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" He did n't look like he was tired , either .
Looked like he had jump in his legs the whole 60 minutes .
" It 's going to help us on the first two lines -- you have different options .
If we want , we can split Hank and Pav up as well .
It gives us another dimension up front with another big body . ''
Franzen faces a bigger test in his next two games , Thursday and Saturday , before the Olympic break .
" I thought it was going to be worse today so , hopefully , it 'll feel good the next game , '' Franzen said .
Olympics still possible for Franzen
Swedish Olympic coach Bengt - Ake Gustafsson has contacted Franzen to determine how he feels in case he needs to replace an injured player .
Peter Forsberg might pull out of the Olympics .
And now , Tomas Holmstrom 's status is uncertain because of a bruised knee .
" I am going to call him after the games ( this week ) and tell him how I am feeling , '' Franzen said .
Franzen said Gustafsson did not indicate whether he would be the coach 's first choice as a replacement , although that seems logical .
" He did n't say that , but he 's trying to decide if he should put me on the ( replacement ) list or not , '' Franzen said .
Franzen said he is not sure if three games will prepare him for the Olympics .
But he said he has no hard feelings about not being originally selected for the team or about Swedish team officials ' assertions that the Red Wings were rushing him back too soon .
Kronwall sits again
Defenseman Niklas Kronwall ( left knee ) missed his third consecutive game .
He expects to return Thursday against San Jose .
When to use du and Sie
Anyone learning the German language whose native language , e.g. - English , lacks the notion of second person formal and informal has surely felt the pain of trying to figure out when to use du or Sie in conversation .
Even those of us who have done this for nearly 30 years struggle with this weighty decision on at least a weekly basis .
I thought it was high time for me to take my accumulated ‘ wisdom ’ and put it into a simple , easy - to - follow chart that you can print out , place in your wallet or purse , and whip out when the need arises .

Budgeting Your Freelance Income
For the last few years , I have earned a living for my family as a freelance writer .
I really feel blessed that I can do this from home , providing for my family ’s needs and many of our wants .
When you live on a freelance income , though , you need to carefully manage your finances because they can change from month to month .
Clearly , the best option is to try and find regular , long - term gigs that can provide a relatively stable income base each month ( although those can end abruptly ) , while short - term projects can make up a larger bulk of your income .
Creating a Budget
I do n’t have a particularly strict budget , but I do have a general idea of my regular income and expenses .
I know which expenses need to be paid each month , and roughly what my average monthly income is .
One of the ways you can budget for the coming year is to take last year ’s yearly income , and divide it by 12 .
Then figure your monthly expenses ( dividing quarterly estimated taxes , insurance and other periodic expenses appropriately to get monthly amounts ) .
You can get a general idea of where you are at .
Make sure that you have enough income to cover your expenses each month .
And realize that a freelance budget has to be somewhat flexible .
Chances are that some months you will make more than your average income , and some months you will make less .
On months that you make more than your average , save the excess to help you make up the shortfall on months that your income is lower than you expect .
Diversifying Your Projects
Diversification is one of the cardinal rules of investing , and it applies when investing in yourself as a freelancer .
At one time , I relied on one client for half of my monthly income .
When the recession forced that client to make big cuts , I found my workload — and my monthly income — much smaller .
I still work for that client , but earning a fraction of what I did before .
I was fortunate enough to find replacement gigs rather quickly , but that experience taught me a valuable lesson :
Do n’t rely too much on one client for your freelance income .
Diversify your clients so that no one client has a disproportionate hold over your monthly earnings .
Regular Financial Assessments
Even though you have a budget for your freelance income , it is still important to regularly assess your situation .
This can be done every month or so .
It does n’t take very long , and you should base your assessment on these five areas :
Current Income : Income that you made in the last month .
This is income that came directly into your bank account — income you received from freelance projects and that you have right now .
Living Expenses :
These are the personal expenses that you incur , that do n’t have to do with your business .
These are your bills and entertainment costs and savings .
You want to make sure that your current income is covering your living expenses .
Operating Expenses : Because I ’m a writer , my operating expenses are relatively low .
I need a fast , reliable Internet connection .
Every two or three years , my computer , used daily as a workhorse , needs to be replaced .
Other freelancers have more operating costs , for supplies , equipment and even travel .
Make sure that you arrange your budget so that you can pay to keep your freelance business going .
Outstanding Income :
This is always a depressing figure .
You should add up how much you are owed for work you have already completed .
Send reminders to those who owe you money , reminding them of their obligation to pay you .
Unfortunately , especially if the payment is more than 30 days late , this is not income you can really rely on to help you .
Future Income :
You can get an idea of how you will do going forward by considering the work that you have lined up for the future .
There should be a cushion here , since future income can so easily become outstanding income .
If I agree to do a large project for someone , I require at least half the money up front , and I refuse to start until I receive that deposit .
That way , I get at least partial compensation for my time and effort .
Freelance income requires that you make provisions for what could happen if you lose a client , or if you have a really bad month .
It is possible to live on a freelance income , but it requires vigilance and planning .

Best of all , the game is completely free , and it's a small download , so just try it out !
Band monikers can range from sublime to ridiculous .
Take The Beatles for instance .
Is that a cool name for the greatest foursome in the history of rock / pop ?
Not really .
It ’s memorable , but for Pete ’s sake , they ’re named after insects .
Just imagine if they were “ The Frogs ” or “ The Pigeons . ” Kinda stupid , huh ?
Of course if the guys and or gals can play it makes no difference what they ’re called .
Some bands choose to go the intimidating route when selecting a handle .
This usually applies to hard rock , heavy metal and speed metal groups , but any genre of music can adopt a foreboding label .
The following 15 musical gangs fall into the category of ominous .
For the most part , we decided to keep this list limited to famous bands .
We may know who Cannibal Corpse is , but that does n’t mean Joe Lunch Box and Bob Business Suit does .
However , a couple were just too damn wicked to exclude .
Also , they are not ranked in order of industry success , but rather the deadliness of their names .
15 ) Dire Straits
If you find yourself in dire straits , you ’re in a world of hurt .
The kind of mess that could get you killed .
Nobody wants that .
Luckily , Mark Knopfler and Co. created a catalog of music that is pretty darn good .
14 ) Arcade Fire
If you ’ve ever spent time in an arcade , you know it ’s hardly the setting for a five - alarm blaze .
A small , confined space packed with kids and geeks .
You ’re asking for a bunch of crispy corpses .
Anyone on the verge of a Donkey Kong kill screen is n’t about leave just because of some stupid fire .
13 ) Megadeth
Death by itself really sucks , but MEGA death has got to be all kinds of painful .
Making it extra spooky is the fact that death is spelled “ deth . ” Either Dave Mustaine is illiterate , or he ’s pure evil .
We ’re thinking the latter .
12 ) Alice in Chains
What the fuck is Alice doing in chains ?
Was she bad ?
Is it a sex thing ?
Are we looking at a serial killer who likes to kidnap chicks named Alice and shackle them up before savagely murdering them ?
We need answers .
11 ) Rancid
Ever eat rancid meat ?
Rest assured , it ’s not too appetizing .
Anything rancid is downright offensive .
It smells like shit and is in general very uncool .
Like when a mouse dies in the wall and you have to sit there and wait for it to fully decompose before the foul odor dissipates .
Yuck .
10 ) Massive Attack
Suppose someone tells you they ’re going to stage a massive attack on your face .
Might get the lil’ hairs on you arms and neck to stand at attention .
The military ’s idea of a massive attack does n’t involve smoke grenades and rubber bullets .
It ’s all about destruction .
9 ) Death Cab for Cutie
Let ’s say you ’re cutie climbed into a death cab .
Unless you hate her stinking guts , you ’d probably be a bit worried .
Is a death cab anything like a rape van ?
If so , you do n’t want your cutie anywhere near that thing , no matter how cheap the fare .
8 ) Suicidal Tendencies
If you have suicidal tendencies , therapy might be something to consider .
Life is full of pain and disappointment , but eating pills or a shotgun barrel is n’t the answer .
Besides , you ’ll look like a silly goose when the cleaning lady stumbles upon your lifeless remains .
7 ) Slayer
No , not Buffy .
This Slayer is n’t near as pretty .
At any rate , a slayer is all about slaying and killing and blood and death , which is all fine and dandy , unless you ’re in line to be the next victim .
We would n’t feel comfortable hanging with slayers .
They seem like they ’d have short fuses .
6 ) Poison
Anyway you slice it , poison is bad news .
Be it downing a bottle of Drano or getting bitten by a Black Mamba , the results will not be particularly satisfying .
There ’s a very sane reason why a skull and crossbones symbolizes poison .
It ’ll kill ya !
( Just like the band ’s awful music . )
5 ) Black Sabbath
Whether you acknowledge Saturday or Sunday as the Sabbath , a black Sabbath reeks of the Devil ’s handiwork .
It ’s meant to be a day of rest and remembrance ; a day to chill with the Lord .
A giant black cloud parked overhead could put a serious damper on your plans .
4 ) Iron Maiden
Have you seen an actual iron maiden ?
Damn thing will make your skin crawl .
What with all those pointy steel spikes just waiting to pierce your supple skin .
Blood is crucial to life .
Keeping it inside the body is advisable .
3 ) The Killers
This really does n’t require an explanation .
Killers .
C’mon , people !
We would prefer The Pacifists .
Those clowns are much easier to beat up .
Ya know , cause they wo n’t fight back .
Wussies .
2 ) Anthrax
Yikes !
When something is the weapon of choice by terrorists , it ’s gotta be nasty .
Inhaling these deadly spores will do more than make you sneeze .
Makes us wanna slip on one of those creepy masks all the Asians like to wear .
1 ) Napalm Death
We debated , but Napalm Death , although not immensely famous , had to make the cut and top the list .
Why ?
Because after viewing archive news footage from the Vietnam War we determined that death by napalm is most unpleasant , not to mention terrifying .
Again , we ’re not ranking the band ’s musical abilities .
It ’s all about the names .

The head of the Church in Ireland handed out copies of the papal letter
In an unusual Vatican document , Pope Benedict has issued a heartfelt personal apology to the people of Ireland and to thousands of victims of sexual abuse in past decades by Roman Catholic priests there .
He has also rebuked Irish bishops for " grave errors of judgement " in dealing with the problem .
" I can only share in the dismay and sense of betrayal that so many of you have experienced on learning of these sinful and criminal acts , " the Pope wrote .
About 15,000 Irish people who attended church - run schools and institutions when they were children and claim to have been abused by priests and teachers have received so far over one billion euros in compensation from a state redress board .
The final number of victims and of the sums of money paid out by the Church and the Irish government could be much higher .
" You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry , " Pope Benedict wrote .
Having already met victims of predator Catholic priests during visits to America and Australia , the Pope provided a rare personal insight into the ordeals suffered by children who were sexually abused .
" I know some of you even find it difficult to enter the doors of a church after all that has occurred , " he wrote .
The pope 's unprecedented eight - page pastoral letter devoted exclusively to the scandal and crisis in the Irish Church has broken a Vatican taboo .
I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel
Pope Benedict
Pope 's letter : Key excerpts
Most Vatican documents relating to the scandal have hitherto been classified as confidential and have been marked only for the eyes of bishops .
The Pope announced that he is sending teams of inspectors to some Irish dioceses , to seminaries and to Irish religious orders to investigate how far they have strayed from the new rules laid down by Rome to try to curb the flood of cases of alleged priest paedophilia reaching the desks of Vatican officials during the past decade .
But the Pope admits that no - one imagines that what he calls " this painful situation " will be swiftly resolved .
The letter has not been welcomed by Ireland 's main group of clerical abuse victims , One in Four .
They expressed deep disappointment that the Pope accepted no blame for what they call " a deliberate policy of the Catholic Church to protect sex offenders , thereby endangering children " .
In Germany - where more than 250 cases of sexual abuse by priests have been reported to the Vatican - Archbishop Robert Zollitsch , who briefed the Pope recently on the situation in his homeland , commented that the scandal was not just an Irish problem .
The Pope 's criticism of the sluggish reaction of the Irish hierarchy to the scandal was applicable in Germany also .
Celibacy question
What the Pope 's letter does not mention is also worth pointing out .
There is no indication of any sanctions being adopted against Ireland 's 28 bishops for their " grave errors of judgement " .
There is no mention either of the word " celibacy " .
The rule - which forbids Catholic priests from marrying , and which dates not from early Christian times , but which became mandatory only during the Middle Ages - is being publicly questioned for the first time by some church heavyweights , such as the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna , Christoph Schoenborn .
The taboo on any discussion at official level of the celibacy rule imposed by the late Pope John Paul II has been maintained by his successor , but increasingly a connection is being seen in some church quarters between celibacy and the psychological problems suffered by many priest paedophiles .
The Vatican has moved into full damage control mode , making wide use of new media outlets to put over its point of view during the latest revelations concerning sexual abuse scandals in the Netherlands , Austria , Germany , Italy and the world 's most populous Catholic country , Brazil .
The Pope 's pastoral letter , together with background information about the Catholic Church 's plans to try to counter the blows inflicted by the scandals on its reputation as guardian of morals , has been posted on Twitter and also video - sharing site YouTube .

Dubbed The Boneyard , but officially known as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group ( AMARG ) facility , this sprawling US airbase is reputed to be the world 's largest military aircraft cemetery .
Spread across the huge 2,600 acre site , equivalent in size to 1,430 football pitches , is a collection of over 4,000 retired aircraft including nearly every plane the US armed forces have flown since World War II .
Now , for the first time , a series of high resolution satellite images of the four square mile - site have been released by Google Earth .
They show in incredible detail the full range of aircraft found at the site .
To see the enhanced content on this page , you need to have JavaScript turned on .
Click on the image to see the large version .
Among the aircraft are B - 52 Cold War-era bombers that were retired in the 1990s under the the terms of the SALT disarmament treaties signed between the US and the Soviet Union .
Also , on show are dozens of F - 14 fighter planes which were retired from the US Navy in 2006 and featured in the Hollywood movie , Top Gun .
The Boneyard has also featured in a series of films , the most recent being Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
Located in Tucson , Arizona , on the Davis - Monthan Air Force Base , the facility was first set up shortly after World War II .
It was chosen for its high altitude and arid conditions , that mean the aircraft can be left outdoors without deteriorating too quickly .
A major industrial centre , AMARG manages an inventory of more than 4,200 aircraft and 40 aerospace vehicles .
In addition to being a massive plane park , AMARG also refurbishes aircraft , returning them to flying status or preparing them to be transported overland .
Officials at the base say that the parts reclaimed and aircraft withdrawn turns every tax dollar spent into 11 dollars in return .

WASHINGTON — Google Inc. said European antitrust authorities have opened a preliminary inquiry into complaints about its tactics made by three European Internet companies .
The inquiry , disclosed late Tuesday , appears to focus largely on complaints that Google unfairly ranks the sites of the Internet competitors , in effect lowering their rank in search results that appear on Google sites .

As it happens , demand for petroleum has gone down in the wake of JD 's rant ; how does it compare to the shortfall of 3 decades ago ?
This post will examine what happened in the late 70s to demand for the various petroleum products , and compare their rate of downturn to what has transpired since their corresponding recent peaks .
This will be about US demand , using EIA data , as it is by far the most comprehensive to be had .
The general situation in other regions of the world will be covered briefly at the end .
So what did the world look like in 1983 , after oil production had collapsed by 15 % ?
I 'll tell you what .
Go out to your local freeway , and look at it during rush hour , when it 's totally crammed with cars .
That 's exactly what 1983 looked like .
I was gassing up as usual , totally oblivious .
The " crisis " had such a minor impact on daily life , that I did n't even realize anything out of the ordinary was happening , let alone a liquid fuels armageddon that was wholly shattering the oil dependent economy and reducing the citizenry to poverty .
I could be wrong about this , but I 'm pretty sure that no one was forced by starvation to eat their Flock of Seagulls albums .
So what really does happen when global oil production drops by 15 % ?
Well , it turns out we know the answer to that one because it actually happened once before , in the early 1980's .
Production hit a high of 66 mbd in 1979 , and over the course of 4 years dropped by 14 % to 56.6 mbd in 1983 .
In fact , oil production did n't surpass the 1979 high until 1993 , 14 years later .
A collapse in demand for petroleum products happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
JD , proprietor of the blog Peak Oil Debunked , examined this briefly in this 2007 post about what he termed ” The Big Glitch ” :
CERA 's Current View of Peak Demand
To move from bloggers to think tanks , CERA made their first pronouncement about US peak demand on June 19 , 2008 , claiming that a long - term shift in consumer behavior , spurred on by increased penetration of the market by higher efficiency vehicles and higher volumes of biofuels displacing petroleum products , would mean 2007 would be the all time high for US gasoline demand .
As it happens , 2008 and 2009 average volumes of gasoline supplied were at 96.80 % and 96.75 % of the 2007 value , so this initial forecast is n't exactly playing out .
A year after CERA issued their report their Managing Director Jim Burkhard stated at a presentation that " Peak Oil is Here , " referring of course to their notion of peak demand , not a peak in supply .
In response Dave Cohen served up his trademark brand of caustic derision in Peak oil = peak demand ?
CERA must have been thinking really hard in the first half of 2008 about how to spin the fact that global demand was growing but supply could barely rise to meet it .
And then it must have come to them like a bolt from the blue — peak demand !
This is an ingenious solution .
The oil supply does n’t have to grow anymore because we do n’t need it to .
World oil production capacity does n’t matter anyway .
We can acknowledge peak oil without acknowledging peak oil .
And so in June , 2008 when things looked bleak for the oil supply , CERA issued its report , " Drivers Turn the Corner in the United States " .
CERA knew , as many of us did , that demand would surely collapse with prices over $ 140 / barrel and stay down for a long , long time .
As Dave subsequently points out , that has n't exactly transpired , is far from accounting for the world as a whole , and also looks like a lame way of covering for a peak in supply .
Others have commented on this topic ; Sam Foucher posted a detailed article here in the fall on peak demand in the OECD ; and in the last month a pair of additional excellent critiques of peak demand have been published by Kurt Cobb and Chris Nelder .
Chris references a Deutsche Bank paper from last fall which is worth reading as well ; I will comment briefly on one of its cornerstone assumptions later in this post .
While CERA are n't specifically citing historical examples of demand troughs as JD did - although they are more than happy to bring up failed historic peak oil forecasts , as well as deigning to mention failed past attempts at bringing unconventional oil to market in their uberbullish supply projections - this article will cover the major demand contraction of the late 70s / early 80s , which , as JD points out , restrained production for about 13 years worldwide , and compare them to how things are currently unfolding .
Overview of Demand Destruction in 70s / early 80s
To give a general overview of how the previous phase of demand destruction unfolded , here is a pertinent excerpt from pgs 717-718 of CERA chairman Daniel Yergin 's Pulitzer Prize winning history of the oil industry , " The Prize " :
Significant changes were also taking place in demand .
The massive twentieth - century march toward higher and higher dependence on oil within the total energy mix was reversed by higher prices , security considerations , and government policies .
Coal staged a massive comeback in electricity generation and industry .
Nuclear power also made a rapid entry into electricity generation .
In Japan , liquefied natural gas increased its share in the energy economy and in electricity generation .
All this meant , around the world , that oil was being ejected from some of its most important markets and was rapidly losing ground .
Its share of the market for total energy in the industrial countries declined from 53 percent in 1978 to 43 percent by 1985 .
Not only was petroleum experiencing a declining share of the energy pie , but the pie itself was shrinking , reflecting the profound impact of increased energy efficiency , otherwise known as conservation .
Though often dismissed or even ridiculed , conservation had turned out to have massive impact .
Energy conservation in modern industrial society meant , for the most part , not deprivation , not " small is beautiful , " but greater efficiency and technological innovation .
The 1975 legislation that mandated a doubling of the average fuel efficiency of new automobile fleets to 27.5 miles per gallon by 1985 would reduce United States oil consumption by 2 million barrels per day from what it would otherwise have been — just about equivalent to the 2 million barrels per day of additional oil production provided by Alaska .
Altogether , by 1985 , the United States was 25 percent more energy efficient and 32 percent more oil efficient than it had been in 1973 .
If the United States had stayed at the 1973 levels of efficiency , it would have used the equivalent of 13 million barrels of oil more than it actually did in 1985 .
The savings were huge .
Other countries made their own dramatic savings .
Japan over the same period became 31 percent more energy efficient and 51 percent more oil efficient .
By 1983 , the first year of economic recovery , the impact of conservation and fuel switching was clear .
Oil consumption in the noncommunist world was 45.7 million barrels per day , about 6 million barrels less than the 51.6 - million barrel - per - day level of 1979 , which had been the high point .
So , while demand had fallen 6 million barrels per day between 1979 and 1983 , non-OPEC production had increased by 4 million barrels per day .
On top of that , the oil companies eagerly sought to dispose of the tremendous inventories they had built up in anticipation of a demand level that never materialized .
Those three trends — the collapse in demand , the relentless buildup of non- OPEC supply , and the Great Inventory Dump — reduced the call on OPEC by something like 13 million barrels per day , a fall of 43 percent from the levels of 1979 !
The Iranian Revolution and then the Iran - Iraq War had crippled the exporting capacity of those two countries .
Yet suddenly , instead of the feared shortage , there was a large surplus of production capacity over market demand in short , the makings of a massive glut .
Recent Drop in Demand vs Drop in Demand in 1970s
This article will examine that collapse in demand .
These peaks happened at different times ; a problem with building a complete data series is that monthly numbers for the 70s are n't included for many minor products such as ethane - ethylene or petroleum coke , with data only going back to January 1981 , a few years after the local peak had arrived .
Another shortcoming in the EIA data is that the " Finished Petroleum Products Supplied " series also only begins in January 1981 ; luckily a monthly series for " Crude Oil and Petroleum Products " does go back to 1973 , when the data also begins for products such as Liquified Petroleum Gases and Propane and Propylene .
By summing the product series which are included I 've derived numbers for monthly Finished Products sans crude oil , which look to be accurate enough ; when the series begins the difference between the last summed value and the first EIA number is 93 kb/d , a wholly negligible difference , so I feel confident in using the summed values here .
I should explain that Crude Oil itself was a product supplied , presumably for power generation or industrial applications .
It peaked at 66 kb/d in 1983 , and had hit 0 kb/d in 1999 , where it has stayed ever since .
Here are the local peaks for 1973 - 1979 , all values in kb/d :
Crude Oil and Finished Finished Distillate Liquified Petroleum Products Petroleum Products Motor Gasoline Fuel Oil Petroleum Gases Feb -1979 Feb -1979 Jun-1978 Jan-1977 Jan-1979 21287 19794 7913 5103 2086 Kerosene - Type Propane Residual Jet Fuel and Propylene Fuel Oil Feb -1979 Jan-1977 Feb -1978 951 1354 3974
The actual peak for Propane / Propylene was Jan 1973 , at 1376 kb/d ; to this day Propane / Propylene is a very seasonal product , with winter numbers exceeding those of summer by some 40 % , so I have taken the liberty of using the above figure from Jan 1979 , which is only 22 kb/d short of the 1973 number .
By calculating percentage values of these product streams from their local peak value we can see how much demand had contracted over the years .
I 've built up monthly series for 6 years after each 70s local peak , which can be matched with the local peaks from the last 6 years .
In most cases these are the absolute peak for the past decade , with a couple of exceptions .
The recent peaks in 2004 - 2009 for these products were as follows :
Crude Oil and Finished Finished Distillate Liquified Petroleum Products Petroleum Products Motor Gasoline Fuel Oil Petroleum Gases Aug-2005 Aug-2005 Jul - 2007 Feb -2007 Jan-2004 21666 19473 9640 4582 2596 Kerosene - Type Propane Residual Jet Fuel and Propylene Fuel Oil Dec -2005 Feb -2007 Aug-2005 1756 1798 1051
Some of the absolute peaks for the past decade were previous to these dates , so after this section I will conduct the same analysis using annual figures .
But first , here are what the December 2009 product supplied numbers would have been , if the decline had followed the same pattern as obtained in the late 70s / early 80s , along with the difference between actual values and what they would have been following the percentage pattern which obtained in the late 70s :
To clarify , here is an example : Dec 09 is 53 months from the modern Aug 05 peak for Crude Oil and Petroleum Products ; the equivalent local peak happened in the 70s in Feb 79 , and 53 months later was at 71.82 % of that peak value .
The " Actual Product Supplied " is what was actually brought to market in Dec 09 ; the next column is what it would have been at 71.82 % of that Aug 05 value .
Clearly the current contraction in demand is far less steep than what obtained previously ; note that the majority of the peaks in each instance occurred on the cusp of severe economic downturns , beginning in the US in December of 1980 and 2007 respectively .
The current recession is by almost all measures proving to be more severe than that of 1980 - 83 , but is having less effect on petroleum demand .
To be sure demand destruction has occurred , but if CERA 's projections are going to come to pass the rate of contraction will have to show a sizable uptick soon .
Here are tables contrasting the two local eras of peaking , this time on an annual basis :
Starting with the peak values from each era and subtracting the current percentages from the 70s numbers , we get :
To clarify once more : positive numbers indicate steeper declines in the past , negative numbers mean the current values are steeper .
The averages for these numbers are :
CO&PP FPP FMG DFO LPG KTJF P/P RFO 6.83 % 10.11 % 4.95 % 0.30 % 2.11 % - 0.28 % 1.11 % - 15.59 %
As can be seen resid is contracting faster now than it did previously , but not to the same volumetric effect :
Note as well that LPG and jet fuel quickly exceeded their local peaks ; the number of years for each product to exceed its 70s peak were as follows :
CO&PP FPP FMG DFO LPG KTJF P/P RFO 21 n/a 16 20 8 7 8 n/a
But this is misleading to an extent ; many streams were back up to ca. 95 % within shorter spans of time .
Gasoline , for instance , bottomed out at 88.22 % in 1982 , rising to 98.97 % in 1988 , before declining again for a few years .
Years to hit bottom :
CO&PP FPP FMG DFO LPG KTJF P/P RFO 7 7 6 6 6 4 3 n/
a
Those who wish to examine this in further detail may download my " Product Supplied - Annual " spreadsheet linked at the end of this essay .
CERA 's call of course is for demand to never exceed 2007 , not for it to decline at comparable rates to historic precedents .
But can demand be said to have permanently peaked now ?
After all , the more sharp declines from the 70s hit bottom fairly quickly ; Crude Oil and Petroleum Products only declined for 5 years before beginning its subsequent rise .
And for any domestic declines to have meaningful significance in the first place they must be balanced against fast rising demand from developing nations .
The current demand destruction is much milder than those of the past .
Are we wrong to assume the pace of decline wo n't pick up ?
As Yergin points out , an inflexible attitude about strong future demand took many by surprise 30 years ago , with investors placing faith in bullish forecasts which failed to pan out in spectacular fashion .
What are the qualitative differences between then and now ?
Do low hanging fruit remain to be picked ?
I will delve deeper into two examples : finished motor gasoline and residual fuel oil .
Finished Motor Gasoline - Potential for Improvement
Gasoline is the sector of the petroleum industry with which we are all familiar ; why did demand for it fall so sharply in 1978 - 1980 ?
The price spike in the wake of revolution in Iran shutting down its petroleum industry had an obvious effect , as can be seen in this graph :
CAFE standards were meanwhile bringing vehicles to market with much higher fuel economy standards ; past figures are followed by tentative present goals set by the White House / EPA :
Model Passenger Percent Year car MPG Improvement 1978 18.00 5.26 % 1979 19.00 5.00 % 1980 20.00 9.09 % 1981 22.00 8.33 % 1982 24.00 7.69 % 1983 26.00 3.70 % 2011 30.20 8.94 % 2012 31.96 5.51 % 2013 33.72 5.22 % 2014 35.48 4.96 % 2015 37.24 4.73 % 2016 39.00 4.51 %
This would firm up the CERA scenario of efficiency curbing demand , if these goals were actually met ; however , Dave Cohen explained in his article Obama Tackles the Liquid Fuels Problem that whether this will happen is actually a surprisingly open question .
In addition we are going through the worst downturn in vehicle purchases in history ; while 1980 sales were down - 18.6 % , subsequent years showed milder contractions followed by vigorous rebounds , with an - 8.67 % average for years of decline ; 2006 - 2009 is - 11.09 % average :
Total car / YOY Total Vehicle Sales as % LDV sales Sales Registrations of fleet 1978 15,122,000 3.4 % 142,049,000 10.65 % 1979 13,984,000 - 7.5 % 145,451,000 9.61 % 1980 11,389,000 - 18.6 % 149,477,000 7.62 % 1981 10,678,000 - 6.2 % 152,026,000 7.02 % 1982 10,426,000 - 2.4 % 153,494,000 6.79 % 1983 12,132,000 14.1 % 157,658,000 7.70 % 1984 14,187,000 14.5 % 160,264,000 8.85 % 2003 16,548,000 - 1.6 % 222,857,000 7.43 % 2004 16,906,000 2.1 % 228,276,000 7.41 % 2005 17,001,000 0.6 % 231,905,000 7.33 % 2006 16,505,000 - 2.9 % 234,525,000 7.04 % 2007 16,089,000 - 2.5 % 237,403,000 6.78 % 2008 13,260,747 -17.6 % 246,000,000 5.39 % 2009 10,429,553 - 21.4 % 250,000,000 4.17 %
While January auto sales were up 2.6 % , suggesting 2010 sales will rebound to some extent , it is questionable that they will improve to any great degree .
Toyota 's stuck accelerator woes have impacted sales of hybrids as well , undercutting another of CERA 's precepts , as Prii account for no less than 48.12 % of US hybrid sales .
In the 70s the size of the vehicle fleet was smaller in the first place as well , allowing new vehicles with greater MPG to have a proportionately larger effect on fleet fuel economy , as can be seen in the above chart .
Counting on hybrids to negate demand for gasoline in the short term is on shaky ground in the first place , since , while their total sales volume has climbed up to a whopping 2.71 % of yearly totals , as a percentage of the total US fleet all hybrid sales from 2005 - 2009 amount to .6568 % of the total , a rather insignificant amount ; if these had been pure EVs by 2009 they would have negated about 60 kb/d of demand , to give an idea of what an upper bound for their savings would be .
Not all of the fleet is in daily use , of course ; a general number I use for calcs is the percentage of the US labor force which drives to work solo , that is , 76.1 % of ca. 154 million workers = ca. 117 million vehicles , assuming there is a 1:1 correspondence between workers and vehicles , which of course is n't the case ; this is a subject of ongoing research for me .
But with this lower bound figure ( useful for estimating how long it will take to replace the essential part of the vehicle fleet ) as a static number cumulative 2005 - 2009 hybrid sales still only account for 1.38 % of the total fleet .
The Deutsch Bank study somehow proposes that total US hybrid sales for 2010 will be 4.2 % of " light vehicles , " that is , " cars , personal light trucks , commercial light trucks , hybrids , plug - in hybrids and pure electric vehicles . "
My sources for sales are the Hybrid Dashboard ( the Toyota article linked above ) and the Hybrid Car Review , both of which do capital work in compiling sales figures .
I have n't fully explored the inroad of hybrid commercial vehicles here ; PHEVs are n't on the US market yet , or much of anywhere else for that matter ; the lone example marketed in Happy Motoring China has proven to be an utter flop ; BYD , the company that builds that PHEV and who plan to be the world 's # 1 automaker by 2020 , have delayed selling it outside of China from 2010 to 2011 , and only ca. 10 k
Volts are slated to be in showrooms at the end of the year ; thus the DB forecast for 2010 is quite the question mark , barring total sales contracting sharply enough for it to come about , which I assume is n't what they 're talking about .
DB consider PHEVs to be a " game changer , " comparable in their effect on petroleum demand to how kerosene shouldered aside whale oil in the 19th century .
As the evidence above suggests , the net effect to date is very minor .
This is n't US - centric on my behalf either , the US and Japan respectively account for 47.53 % and 44.68 % of global hybrid sales .
CERA also consider biofuels to be a major factor in future demand destruction ; those interested in this should seek out Robert Rapier 's articles , both here and on his R - Squared Energy Blog .
Savings in Residual Fuel Oil for Power Generation and Heating in the 1970s
The other sector I will focus on is residual fuel oil , used for " the production of electric power , space heating , vessel bunkering , and various industrial purposes . "
Note that it accounted for 16.65 % of total US demand in 1977 , declining over the decades to 3.13 % in 2009 .
As can be seen in this chart of post - peak YOY differences in amount supplied , the cumulative short term savings from phasing out residual fuel oil amounted to around twice that from either gasoline or distillates :
Much of these savings came from declining use of resid for electrical generation ; the EIA 's Annual Energy Review includes data on use of petroleum in the electric power sector from 1949 - 2008 ; in 1977 this amounted to 1,575 kb/d , 51.3 % of 3071 kb/d total ; for 1982 it was 642 kb/d , 37.4 % of a total 1716 kb/d .
The sum of YOY Diffs for resid 1973 - 2009 amounts to - 2300.5 kb/d , almost completely obviating the 2310.58 kb/d accounted for by gasoline .
Potential for Savings in Petroleum for Power Generation and Heating Now
Other nations are strongly dependent on petroleum for power generation ; JD also had a post on this topic in March 2008 .
In North America resid was displaced primarily by natural gas ; in Europe nuclear and hydro served the same function .
Various regions have changed their mix of petroleum consumption over the years ; as a preliminary example , here is BP data on OECD demand , broken down into 4 general sectors :
OECD ( 1978 ) OECD ( 2008 ) Light distillates 31.89 % 36.25 % Middle distillates 29.36 % 36.13 % Fuel oil 23.47 % 7.43 % Others 15.28 % 20.19 %
Other examples may be seen in the BP Stat Review .
My worksheet version has more percentage figures like the above ( link at bottom ) .
JD 's preliminary figure for 2004 use of petroleum in power generation worldwide was 3.58 mb/d ; using a newer edition of the same data source ( the World Bank 's World Development Indicators ( WDI ) ) I get 3.82 mb/d for 2006 , a slight increase .
Both of our figures were for 620 kwH / bbl or 35 % efficiency , which I 've subsequently discovered is likely to be a bit on the high end , given what this 2000 EIA paper suggests :
The national average thermal efficiency of power generation from fossil fuels in 1999 was estimated to be 32.54 percent , slightly higher than the previous year 's average of 32.42 percent .
This refers to the US .
Perhaps efficiency improved 2 % in the interim ; JD gives no source for his figure .
Numbers like the EIA 's are common in other articles I 've come across , as well as being in use by knowledgeable commentators such as Engineer - Poet .
JD also includes this very intriguing bit of information from veteran oil industry analyst Henry Groppe :
[ Henry Groppe ] believes that something like 20 mbpd of the current 84 mbpd of oil demand is going for heat and power generation primarily in developing countries .
He thinks that with oil in the $ 50 - $ 60 range , all of this will get converted to coal or natural gas , and that , along with vehicle fuel efficiency , will be the main initial responses to peaking , and will keep us out of serious economic pain for a decade or so .
This is from Stuart Staniford , relating what various speakers had to say at the 2005 ASPO - USA Denver Conference .
Whether he subsequently examined this in depth I 'm not sure ; my intuition is that efficiencies in developing countries are often likely much lower than the EIA figure for the US , as Groppe 's comment might suggest ; either that , or a sizable amount of demand worldwide is for domestic heating .
What is more , these same countries which are heavily dependent on oil for power are often major producers of that oil in the first place .
According to the WDI data no less than 19082 kb/d of production is coming from oil producing nations who also are > 50 % dependent on oil for their power generation .
Here are some preliminary numbers ( using the 35 % efficiency figure ) , all values in kb/d :
2006 cons for elec 2006 Total generation Consumption % of Total Iraq 138.85 532.99 26.05 % Kuwait 152.50 266.87 57.14 % Iran 152.77 1,693.04 9.02 % Indonesia 171.15 1,172.91 14.59 % Italy 202.60 1,812.59 11.18 % China 227.82 7,381.77 3.09 % Mexico 238.24 1,969.95 12.09 % United States 358.87 20,687.42 1.73 % Japan 409.60 5,213.11 7.86 % Saudi Arabia 415.53 1,841.44 22.57 %
The choice of countries here is dictated simply by their being those which used the highest volumes of oil for power generation in 2006 .
As Groppe suggests these numbers could in many instances be much higher , especially in countries with antiquated / dilapidated infrastructure such as Iran or Iraq .
If 23.8 % of world demand is accounted for by power and heat , a staggering amount of low hanging fruit is waiting to be plucked , and the substitutes in many important cases need n't necessarily be other fossil fuels or nuclear ; as has been observed , Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabia Of Solar Energy , and they are making preliminary noises about going renewable , with possible assistance from EU members , too .
This could potentially be a major growth sector for renewable companies , freeing up oil exports in the process ; whether the OECD example of shifting away from petroleum for power generation can be ported successfully to developing nations will be the subject of a future article , along with a closer examination of how global petroleum demand has changed .
What May Be Ahead
In conclusion to this article , here is the following paragraph from Stuart 's 2005 piece excerpted above :
I need to research it , but that story made a lot of sense to me .
Fuel switching in heat and power was exactly what the US and Europe did back in the late 70s and early eighties , so it 's believable that developing countries would do that this time around .
Combine that with a lot of OECD fuel efficiency improvements ( which have already begun ) and we can probably maintain economic growth through quite a bit of the early post - peak era ( except for geo- political shocks ) .
That also buys us more time to start doing the harder things that will need to be done down the road .

Playing online casino games – or other forms of online gambling – is entirely legal for players .
There are no laws that prohibit Australian citizens from playing in online casinos , so players have nothing to worry about in that regard .
Operating an online casino in Australia is another story .
In 2001 , the Interactive Gambling Act made it illegal to open any new online gambling sites in Australia .
The word “ new ” should n’t be ignored there ; at the time , existing online casinos were exempt from the law , allowing them to continue operating inside the country .
However , after 2008 , the last of the Australia - based online casinos closed shop , leaving only foreign operators to accept wagers from Australians .
Technically , the Interactive Gambling
Act also made it illegal for foreign operators to take bets from Australians , but that has n’t stopped more than a handful of operators from freely taking bets from Aussies .
Issues with Depositing to Online Casinos from Australia
There are essentially no issues with depositing to online casinos from Australia .
Sure , the fact that local operators do n’t exist means you ca n’t just walk to your local gambling shop and hand over some cash for your account , but other than that , you ’ll find no problems depositing or withdrawing from an online casino account .
Current Deposit Methods Available
Australians have a wide range of deposit methods available to them , rivaling the kinds of options that are available in major European nations .
Credit and debit cards are generally accepted , bank transfers and wires are generally available , and checks and e-checks are also viable options .
In addition , many e-wallets operate in the Australian market , including Neteller and Moneybookers .
Some sites also allow you to fund your account through the use of prepaid cards .
Taxes on Online Casino Winnings
For the vast majority of players – and in a practical sense , probably for all players – there are no taxes taken out of online casino winnings in Australia .
Gambling winnings are generally not taxed , meaning that you wo n’t have to worry about the government asking for anything if you hit a jackpot on a slot machine or have a hot run at the blackjack tables .
There is one minor caveat we should mention , however .
If you are a professional gambler who runs your gambling operations as a business , complete with everything that goes along with making it your main business activity , then your gambling winnings would count as income .
Try now the best online casions and compare Bitcoin Casino .
However , this is a definition that does n’t even apply to most professional poker players , let alone other gamblers ; Australians who win money in online casinos should have absolutely no tax liability .
Future Outlook
Right now , online gambling is something of an afterthought in Australia .
While a fierce battle rages over the future of poker machines and combating problem gambling , there is little attention being paid to the online casino industry .
While this means that there ’s unlikely to be a push to allow native Australian online casinos to flourish once again , it ’s also an encouraging sign that Australian players can expect to retain access to online casinos in the future .
This year is big for new generations of gaming tech , with new consoles on the way .
Now Nvidia has revealed its new generation of GPUs with the GeForce RTX 30 series , the beefiest of which can play games in 8 K resolution at 60 frames per second ( fps ) .

Swaths of white , dark orange , and charcoal gray dance across the surface of Pluto in the sharpest view yet of the dwarf planet , made possible by pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope .
The new Hubble shots , taken from 2002 to 2003 , show rapid changes on Pluto 's surface driven by the world 's extreme seasons , lead investigator Marc Buie , of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , said today at a press briefing .
In a project that took four years and 20 computers running simultaneously , Buie and colleagues combined 384 Hubble pictures of Pluto to create what he calls " my best guess at a true - color appearance " for the tiny world .
" If you were sitting in a spacecraft puttering around Pluto and looking out the window , this is what you 'd see , but in higher resolution . "
The pictures reveal that Pluto is a much more dynamic body than commonly thought , and they offer astronomers ideas of what to focus on when the New Horizons spacecraft reaches the dwarf planet in 2015 .
Pluto at Its Most Extreme
As seen in the new pictures , Pluto 's orange and gray hues could be the result of methane on the surface being broken down by sunlight , leaving a carbon - rich residue , the scientists say .
( Related : " Pluto Has ' Upside Down ' Atmosphere . " )
While the Hubble pictures are n't detailed enough to make out surface features , the striking differences in dark and bright regions suggest that Pluto has highly diversified terrain .
And by comparing the new pictures to previous images , astronomers can tell that some parts of Pluto , including the southern hemisphere , became significantly darker and redder between 2000 and 2002 , while the northern hemisphere got brighter .
It 's likely these changes are due to ice melting and refreezing as Pluto 's seasons change , astronomer Mike Brown , of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , said at the briefing .
Pluto takes about 248 years to make a full orbit around the sun , traveling on an extremely elliptical path in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt .
Pluto 's elongated orbit means that at its closest , the tiny world gets about 2.7 billion miles ( 4.4 billion kilometers ) from the sun , while at its farthest Pluto is about 4.5 billion miles ( 7.3 billion kilometers ) .
Such extreme swings cause Pluto 's surface to undergo the most dramatic changes of any known body in the solar system , Brown said .
" Places that have weather change dramatically , because it 's easy to blow things around , " Brown said , referring to the constant changes seen on planets with atmospheres , such as Jupiter and Saturn .
" But rapid surface changes are more rare . "
When Pluto goes from spring to fall , " it 's as if on Earth you had a nice springtime day of 60 or 70 degrees [ Fahrenheit , or 15.5 to 21 degrees Celsius ] and in the fall ... it dropped to something like - 90 degrees [ Fahrenheit , or - 67.7 degrees Celsius ] , " he said .
" It 's a ridiculously extreme place to be . "
New Horizons Getting Closer to Pluto
Hubble 's latest Pluto pictures were actually taken by older cameras on the recently upgraded space telescope .
Following the installation of the Wide Field Camera 3 in 2009 , Hubble can now be used to take even more detailed pictures of Pluto .
( See some of the first pictures taken by the newly upgraded Hubble . )
But the best Pluto portraits are likely to come from New Horizons .
Launched in 2006 , the probe is more than halfway to Pluto and is due to be the first spacecraft to orbit the dwarf planet , offering new insights into the largely mysterious objects that exist in the Kuiper belt .
" Pluto is n't the biggest thing out there , " Brown noted .

Feb. 25 , 2010  -- A Senate committee Wednesday lambasted the private military company formerly known as Blackwater , accusing the firm of engaging in " reckless use of weapons , " hiding its identity to score government contracts , and harming America 's war effort in Afghanistan .
Investigators for the Senate Armed Services Committee say they also found that Blackwater contractors in Afghanistan secured more than 500 weapons from the U.S. military , even though company employees were not authorized to carry weapons there , and that the military signed over some of the weapons to a contractor who used a fake name borrowed from a character in the TV cartoon " South Park . "
The hearing was part of an on - going investigation by the Armed Services Committee into the role of contractors in Afghanistan , and focused on a shooting incident involving two Blackwater security trainers .
The trainers , Justin Cannon and Scott Drotleff , who were working for Paravant , a subsidiary of Blackwater 's successor company , Xe Services , are accused of killing two Afghan civilians in May 2009 .
Both face federal charges of murder , but maintain their innocence .
Both Paravant and Xe are owned by Erik Prince , the owner and founder of Blackwater .
Blackwater changed its name to Xe in early 2009 after the company was involved in a series of deadly incidents in Iraq .
In Afghanistan , Xe offshoot Paravant was operating as a subcontractor to Raytheon , providing weapons training to the Afghan National Army .
During Wednesday 's hearing , committee chairman Carl Levin , D. - Mich. , reported that a Paravant executive who acted as point man with Raytheon after the May 2009 shooting incident had told Senate investigators that Paravant routinely disregarded policies and rules in Afghanistan .
" Paravant had no regard for policies , rules , or adherence to regulations in country , " said Sen. Levin , quoting James Sierawski of Paravant and Xe. Sierawski , who was interviewed by investigators after his name turned up on internal emails connected to the shooting , is apparently still employed by Paravant and Xe .
' Eric Cartman ' Signs for Weapons
In the months before the deadly incident , Paravant employees in Afghanistan obtained more than 500 AK - 47s and other weapons from the U.S. military , despite knowing that they have been denied permission to carry weapons on several occasions .
Investigators released documents showing that the military handed out hundreds of rifles and handguns , even allowing a Paravant employee to sign for some using the name " Eric Cartman . "
Cartman is a character on the cable series " South Park , " known for its crude humor .
The weapons had been intended for the Afghan National Army .
In an internal email released by the committee , a Paravant manager who supervised the two accused shooters in Afghanistan told a colleague that he " got sidearms for everyone . "
" We have not yet received formal permission from the Army to carry weapons , " read the email from Brian McCracken , " but I will take my chances . "
McCracken was called as a witness at the hearing , where he asserted that Blackwater had been given verbal permission by the military to carry the weapons .
Two days after Paravant diverted several hundred weapons away from the Afghan National Army , one of its contractors was shot in the head by a second Paravant contractor , after his AK - 47 accidentally discharged .
Paravant fired the contractor who discharged the weapon , and the victim survived , but a military official today acknowledged that the incident was not investigated .
The committee faulted the Pentagon with exercising little oversight over contractors operating in Afghanistan .
Sen .
Levin pointed out that both men accused in the civilian shooting incident , Drotleff and Cannon , had unsatisfactory military records that should have disqualified them from employment with Paravant .
Paravant , Levin said , was arming contractors who never should have had weapons in the first place .
Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Mark Begich of Alaska both accused Blackwater of hiding its identity by setting up new companies when securing government contracts .
Begich called Paravant a " scam company , " and a " shell " for Blackwater .

In a statement to ABC News , Sen .
Levin echoed the charge that Paravant was a " shell , " " set up to avoid the ' baggage ' that the name Blackwater carried . "
Levin said the name change had fooled an Army contracting officer who approved Paravant 's subcontract with Raytheon .
" The deception here is deeply troubling , " said Levin , " because the Department of State said in 2008 that it had lost ' confidence in ( Blackwater 's ) credibility and management ability . ' "
Blackwater lost a security contract with the State Department after a 2007 shooting incident that cost the lives of 17 Iraqi civilians .
At the hearing , Blackwater executive vice president Fred Roitz testified that it was Raytheon that asked Blackwater to change names .
" Raytheon requested that a company name be other than Blackwater .
It was at Raytheon 's request , " Roitz told the committee .
Roitz also acknowledged that Blackwater intentionally used the name Paravant to deceive Pentagon 's contracting office , in an effort to secure the contract .
In a sharp exchange , Sen. Levin asked Mr. Roitz if he was bothered that he had " made statements that were n't accurate , in order to cover - up the fact it was a Blackwater operation instead of Paravant ? "
" I'm troubled today , " Mr. Roitz replied .

Why is Doctor Who always a Time Lord and not a Lady ?
Journeys to the centre of the Earth ;
The meaning of a hiding to nothing
Why is Doctor Who always regenerated as a Time Lord , not a Time Lady ?
In Doctor Who the process of regeneration is the renewing of every cell in a Time Lord 's dying , damaged or unwanted body .
Since Time Lords ( and Time Ladies , and perhaps even Time Tots , as the children of Gallifrey are known ) can change species when they regenerate , there is presumably no reason why they can't also swap sex .
There 's certainly nothing in the TV series ' history to contradict this theory and indeed no way of telling whether the Master , the Doctor 's sworn enemy , spent one or more of his 13 wasted lives as a femme fatale called the Mistress .
Kieran Grant , London N22
Time Lords can be male or female .
One of Tom Baker 's companions was actually a female Time Lord called Romana who regenerated between seasons and I also understand that one of his recurring enemies was another female of the species called The Rani .
Apparently , the only way a Time Lord can regenerate as a member of the opposite sex is to commit suicide .
This has happened at least once to my knowledge , in a Doctor Who Unbound audiobook called Exile , where he commits suicide and becomes Arabella Weir in order to hide from pursuers .

Why the Doctor has never managed to exchange his Y chromosome for a second X is one of the universe 's great unsolved mysteries .
Had he managed to do so , we might have been fortunate enough to experience the doctorly delights of the likes of Honor Blackman , Judi Dench , Sheila Hancock , Maggie Smith or Kathy Burke .
Whatever the reasons for such rigid gender typecasting , lack of available talent is n't one of them .

The world 's tallest building is the 828 m Burj Dubai , but what is the world 's deepest man-made structure ?
Various mines and deep geological repositories for nuclear waste approach one kilometre .
At 24.5 km , Norway 's Laerdal tunnel is the longest road tunnel in the world , and also up to 1400 metres deep .
However , the record for the deepest hole is held by the Russians , who started drilling the Kola Superdeep Borehole in 1970 and reached the depth of 12,261 metres in 1989 .
The purpose of this hole is to study the continental crust .
However , this represents only about 0.2 % of the journey to the centre of the Earth .
In a tongue - in - cheek paper published in the science journal Nature , David Stevenson , professor of planetary science at Caltech , explains how a grapefruit - sized unmanned probe could reach the centre of the earth in a week or so .
The first step would be to detonate a nuclear bomb to generate a crack in the Earth 's crust 30 cm wide and several hundred metres long and deep .
Molten iron containing the probe would need to be poured into the crack the instant it formed .
Being denser , the iron would sink , which would lead to the release of gravitational potential energy , melting the underlying rock .
Once the glob of iron had passed , the rock would close up again .
Data would be sent to the surface as vibrations .
But the £ 6.5 bn price tag means it will not be happening any time soon .

" A hiding to nothing " – I know what it implies but it does n't make sense .
Can anyone explain ?
It refers to a situation where one has everything to lose and nothing to gain .
It is used ( often in football ) to describe a contest against supposedly inferior opposition where winning would be expected and produce little credit , while losing would be a calamity .
The hiding refers not so much to the other team 's performance but to the public outcry and humiliation .
The meaning of " hiding " is from the association of corporal punishment with the tanning of skins .
Hence , " I 'll tan your hide " and " give you a good hiding " .
So winning the uneven contest would be " nothing " , while losing would be a " hiding " .

Why are there no female Formula One drivers ?
Due to their ancestors ' roles as ( respectively ) hunters and nurturers , men's and women 's brains evolved different pathways to help them make decisions .
Women specialised in more nuanced , longer - term decisions , while men learned how to make good instant decisions .
It 's a bit of a generalisation , and there are obviously exceptions – the female Red Arrow , for instance , and the men who work in caring professions – but together with their numerical advantage , it explains why men become ( and want to become ) racing drivers and fighter pilots .

Apple has been dealt a severe blow having been told that it no longer has a monopoly on the letter " i " as part of the name for its products .
A trademarks tribunal has knocked back Apple 's bid to stop a small company from trademarking the name DOPi for use on its laptop bags and cases for Apple products .
Apple argued that the DOPi name - which is iPod spelt backwards - was too similar to its own popular portable music player , which has sold in excess of 100 million units worldwide .

And you could write this off as just a few nuts on the Internet , except that new GOP Senator Scott Brown said tonight that the same anger that convinced this man to crash a plane into an IRS office , 9/11 style , was the same anger that got Brown elected last month .
Perhaps not such an aberration after all .
Mike Signorile turned me on to this .
He was reading the comments on the air on his radio show .
The initial page was taken down by Facebook – and I do n’t blame them from what Mike tells me .
But a new page is up .
It ’s pretty hideous .
The page has the “ Do n’t Tread On Me ” flag that Tea party teabaggers like to use , and it has a wonderful Thomas Jefferson quote that domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh used .
A lot of the nastiest stuff got deleted the first time around .
Including a number of anti-Obama comments .
Here are some examples of the comments on the page ( now that the page is getting discovered , some negative comments are coming in , finally ) :
This is Emily Walters .
We were the original ones who started this group .
It grew to about 300 members and was deleted .
They deleted my profile also .
This is my boyfriends profile he made just to put it back on there because its sad when you do n’t have the right to freedom of speech or expression anymore .
Do we as americans have our head buried in the sand ?
is it time to pull it out ?
what will we really see …..?
Abolish the IRS , lets go with a sales tax …. ooohhh yea , how would big brother keep us in check … .
it is time
I would call him a hero !!!
I.m sure they will call him a terrorists .
WE DON’T HAVE REPRESENTATION IN GOVERNMENT WHATSOEVER
I ’m sick and tired of our tax dollars supporting lazy old people with their free social security .
Get a job or get out of our country !
They are not screwing with “ Andrew Joseph Stack III is not a Hero ” group .
Mr. Stack is a true American hero
JOSEPH STACK AN AMERICAN HERO !
There only deleting comments becouse there too true …
The IRS planned to eat him anyway , might as well serve a gourmet meal .
when does terrorism become patriotism ??? were the minutemen and anybody who revolted against king george terrorists or patriots ??
im sure they were also perceived as terrorists
this country was founded on rebellion .
history repeats itself .
common sense .
Obviously you have n’t heard Patrick Henry ’s quote , “ Give me the politicians I want or give everyone else death ”
So we should just sit there and take what Uncle Sam gives us in the ass ?
Joe Stack had the balls to make a point - and his point certainly received international attention .
sad thing for the folks who think this is going to be the only time we hear about something like this .
this is not the way americans act UNLESS YOUVE FALLEN VICTOM OF THE IRS AND THEYRE UNBALENCED POLICIES !!!!. so get used to it–nuff said
It ’s not about who he killed or who he could have killed .
It ’s about the undeniable identification of the common American with his letter and his frustration with our out of touch , detached government .
This poor man was hunted to insanity .
I pray for his family .
This building did not contain any important files , I believe this might be the building were that S.O.B. worked that Joe thought was on his side and would help him save his ass yet he turned out to be on the gov ’s side instead .
I dont know about you all but , if I were in that building when Joe struck it I would have been honored to die for a good cause that would finaly atleast open up some eyes .
I hear that there was already a hazmat team across the street before the plane stuck , how did they know to be there at that exact time ???????????????????????????
I am watching CNN , and they keep bringing on Pyshc experts that keep painting this guy as paranoid , and deranged .
I ca n’t help but think that behind the scenes even psych professionals can understand this guy ’s frustration with our bloated , intrusive government , but yet on the air they say what ’s politically correct , and what ’s best for their careers .
In no way do I condone killing innocent people , but I understand Joe ’s logic and frustration .
Personally , I think he would be pleased that he was able to get our attention without causing a single death .
His name was Joseph Andrew Stack .
He died serving project mayhem .
In death we are all Joseph Stack .
D id Prime Minister Stephen Harper put a condom instead of a thinking cap on his head when , two months ago , he announced his now internationally ridiculed policy on " maternal and child health " that he 's going to promote at the coming G8 summit ?
How else to explain his intransigence on women 's access to family planning – as if a mother 's ability to have no more babies than she can feed , clothe and protect has nothing to do with either 's health ?
Has he never heard the expression AIDS orphan ?
Obstetric fistula ?
High - risk pregnancy ?
And we 're not even talking about abortion here .
This is about the pill , IUDs , diaphragms – and education .
Sure Harper appeared to flip - flop Thursday by saying he 's not " closing doors " but so far they 've been slammed shut .
For all the statistics Harper has spouted on the 2 million women and children who die every year due to lack of proper care during pregnancy and delivery , has he not looked at a medical book instead of the Good Book ?
Because , make no mistake , his dismissal of good maternal health practice is purely ideological , not gynecological .
Consider the support this contraception - free initiative has received from religious groups that are anti-reproductive rights .
For example , both the hardline LifeSiteNews and R.E.A.L. Women of Canada , which back every anti-choice move any Conservative MP makes , no matter how unscientific or misogynistic , are cheering on this " maternal health " policy .
Never mind that doctors and medical groups , not to mention health workers in the field , contradict the HarperCon position .
On Thursday , the Ottawa - based Federation of Medical Women of Canada , was the latest to denounce the government on this issue .
" By excluding family planning , there will be even more pressures on already vulnerable health systems , devastating consequences on any attempts to implement maternal health programs , and tragic loss of millions of lives that could otherwise have been saved , " its member physicians said in a statement .
They were reacting to what Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said Tuesday during a meeting of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee , in response to questions on the direct correlation between access to contraception and women 's deaths .
" This ( policy ) does not deal in any way , shape , or form with family planning , " said Cannon .
" Indeed , the purpose of this is to be able to save lives . "
What 's worse is that , as Cannon would later suggest to reporters , he personally is pro-choice .
Then there are International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda and Status Of Women Minister Helena Guergis – neither of who has ever practised birth control , right ?
– who also parrot the party line .
Said Guergis in the status of women committee Monday , in reply to a question on what she will do for maternal and child health care , both here and abroad : " I will play whatever role it is that the Prime Minister is defining for me in this process , happily , and I 'm very proud and honoured to be a part of that process . "
Talk about A Handmaid 's Tale .
As for Oda , on Wednesday she told the House that the government will be " providing clean water , vaccinations , better nutrition , as well as the most effective way ( in ) the training of health care workers and improving access for those women , that is what we are going to do . "
Sure all that is important , but as one friend cracked on Facebook , " Dead women ca n't drink clean water . "
Besides , research shows that when it comes to health care in impoverished nations , women – as they often are in everything else – are second - class citizens , always at the back of the line .
So , while improving the medical infrastructure will definitely help these societies as a whole , it may not do that much more for mothers and newborns .
Nice try , PM Harper .

" What Harry and Sally went through is awful , but they are dogs .
I do n't think they think of it the same way we do , " she added .
Celebrations have begun in Rome and Australia after the announcement of Australia 's first Roman Catholic saint , Sister Mary MacKillop .
Pope Benedict the 16th has announced the canonisation at a meeting of cardinals at the Vatican .
The official ceremony will be held on the October 17 .
It has been a long road to sainthood for the Melbourne - born nun , with calls for her beatification starting in the 1920s .
The announcement brought excitement and relief for Sister Maria Casey .
Calls for Blessed Mary 's beatification started even before Sister Maria was born .
But the Sister of St Joseph has become one of the loudest voices of the campaign , as the postulator for Mary MacKillop 's cause .
" The announcement was made in the middle of a formal prayer session , so it was a very subdued church - like environment , if you like , " she said .
" So we were n't allowed to cheer and stamp and clap or anything like that . "
Sister Maria says the fact the sainthood has been 85 years in the making , demonstrates just how thorough the process is .
" It shows that it 's a process with integrity because it was n't rushed ; it was n't hurried , " she said .
In 1861 , Blessed Mary was credited with curing a woman with terminal leukaemia , and last year the Vatican decreed she has cured a woman with inoperable cancer , giving her the second miracle she needed for canonisation .
In the meantime though , says Sister Maria , there were medical documents to chase down and testimonies to record .
" [ We had to wait ] for scientific experts to examine them and to come to a conclusion whether the cure could be explained by scientific means , " she said .
" And then after that the theologians also had to do their search .
" So this all has happened in the last two years , which is remarkably quick in Roman times . "
Determined and dedicated
Mary MacKillop died just over a century ago , and is best remembered for her work with children and the needy .
She opened her first school in a disused stable at the age of 24 .
Australian Ambassador to the Holy See , Tim Fischer , says her work laid the foundations for education of the disadvantaged in many country areas .
" Mary MacKillop flogged herself around outback Australia ; lived for periods in places like Numurka and Penola , Coonawarra South Australia , " he said .
And he says she bravely fought her excommunication in 1871 when she fell out with other members of the clergy over educational practices .
" Certainly , she stood determined and dedicated and , as Rome ruled , as the Holy See of the Vatican ruled - the Popes of yesteryear ruled - she was correct .
" It would make a great plot for an Italian grand opera , dare I say . "
He says the canonisation in October will be a big event and will include a vigil concert and service , the actual canonisation on the Sunday and the subsequent follow up on the Monday .
Mr Fischer says visitors can expect lots of tourism vendors setting up around October with badges and tea towels depicting the newly canonised saint .
" Rome will be Rome , " he said .
The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney , Cardinal George Pell , has encouraged young Australian catholics to travel to Rome for the canonisation of Mary Mackillop .
" Mary MacKillop [ has ] got very important lessons for young Australians , the usefulness of faith and goodness and hard work and service , " he said .
" If you see a need , try and do something about it . "
' A practical person '
Historian and Catholic Commentator Paul Collins told ABC1's Lateline she recognised and then met the needs of others .
" I have described her as a great Australian sheila , " he said .
" Now , that 's perhaps a rather crude phrase , but nevertheless , I think it sums up the type of person that she is .
" A practical person , a person who saw a real social need , who saw the children in the bush particularly needed education and culture and she organised a group of sisters to be able to meet that need . "
Sister Maria
Casey says the canonisation will mean very different things for different people .
" For Catholics this will mean that the church has recognised that Mary was a holy woman and she died , but she was a saint , " she said .
Catholics in the South Australian town of Penola are expecting an influx of visitors interested in Mary MacKillop 's legacy , with church bells marking her upcoming canonisation .
In 1866 , the young teacher set up a school and the Sisters of Saint Joseph in the country town in the South Australian south east .
Claire Larkin from the Mary MacKillop Penola Centre says Penola is where Mary MacKillop 's life 's work began .
" Mary was n't here for a long time , " she said .
" But this is where she met Father Woods , this is where they had the dream , this is where they founded that order and the Sisters of Saint Joseph all look on Penola as being the beginning .
" It 's the type of place that Mary and the Sisters of Saint Joseph went to , they were outback and remote places and they brought education to the poor and isolated children . "
Yes , slowly but surely it is happening .
In a federal notice filed earlier , the DOL and Treasury are soliciting a response on what has been on many investors ' mind , namely the process of converting 401 ( k ) s into annuity - like products .
To wit :
The Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury ( the " Agencies " ) are currently reviewing the rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) and the plan qualification rules under the Internal Revenue Code ( Code ) to determine whether , and , if so , how , the Agencies could or should enhance , by regulation or otherwise , the retirement security of participants in employer - sponsored retirement plans and in individual retirement arrangements ( IRAs ) by facilitating access to , and use of , lifetime income or other arrangements designed to provide a lifetime stream of income after retirement .
The purpose of this request for information is to solicit views , suggestions and comments from plan participants , employers and other plan sponsors , plan service providers , and members of the financial community , as well as the general public , on this important issue .
A cursory read of the document does not seem to ask about a flat out regulatory requirement for annuitization .
We point your attention to item 13 :
13 . Should some form of lifetime income distribution option be required for defined contribution plans ( in addition to money purchase pension plans ) ?
If so , should that option be the default distribution option , and should it apply to the entire account balance ?
To what extent would such a requirement encourage or discourage plan sponsorship ?
For readers who feel compelled to respond to this increasignly socialistic and ludicrous development , we suggest you voice your anger at the following address :

GIF , H.264 , and Patents
Arthur Wyatt , in a post on MetaFilter regarding the battle over HTML5 video codecs :
A few readers have emailed me expressing a similar sentiment — more or less that GIF serves as an example showing why Mozilla should continue to refuse to support H.264 .
The GIF story in a nut : the file format was introduced by CompuServe in 1987 .
It was relatively simple and could produce files that were decent - looking at remarkably small file sizes — file size being the most important aspect of a graphics format at a time when online access was via modems .
( You can argue that every kilobyte still matters today , but in the ’80s and even ’90s , every byte counted . )
Because of its relative simplicity and small file sizes , GIF was the first major image format of the web .
GIF uses LZW compression , however , and LZW compression was covered by a patent held by Unisys .
After the format became widespread , Unisys attempted — in various ways and with various ( but not much ) success — to extract licensing fees for it .
The main result of Unisys ’s effort was to drive the creation and adoption of the PNG format — which not only was unencumbered by patents but was also technically superior .
The analogy some people are drawing between H.264 and GIF is that the MPEG LA — the industry consortium that controls the rights and licensing for the patent pool behind H.264 — could pull a similar bait - and - switch type trick : give H.264 a few years to become ever more popular , and then , boom , come 2016 ( when the current license expires ) , begin requiring web publishers to pay a licensing fee for distributing H.264 - encoded video .
I disagree .
I do n’t know what the MPEG LA will do come 2016 .
Perhaps they will attempt to charge web publishers for licenses to distribute H.264 video .
But if they do , web publishers will react the way they did to Unisys ’s GIF threats : by switching to another format .
Switching to another format would be an expensive time - consuming pain in the ass , but that ’s how I think publishers will react if the MPEG LA pulls the rug out from under them .
Other than adding to the pile of evidence that software patents suck and are a drain on the industry , there is n’t that much similarity between the GIF and H.264 situations .
Unisys did n’t invent or hold the rights to the GIF format , they held the rights to a compression algorithm patent that the GIF format was deemed to violate after the format was created and in widespread use .
Unisys was a single entity that attempted to profit from a patent that it held .
H.264 ’s rights and patents are held by MPEG LA , which is not a company like Unisys , but an industry consortium .
MPEG LA licenses patent pools for a variety of technologies , not just H.264 .
It seems to me it ’s in their interests to behave consistently and predictably , not capriciously and opportunistically .
Again , perhaps I ’m naive .
We ’ll find out in a few years .
But web site publishers are clearly betting on H.264 remaining free to use for freely distributed web video .
I do n’t think anyone is arguing that Mozilla should drop Ogg Theora .
What some of us would like them to do is follow Google ’s lead with Chrome by supporting both H.264 and Ogg Theora .
( The same goes for Apple with Safari . )
But if anything , I ’d say it ’s Ogg Theora that more resembles GIF , patent - wise .
Prior to Unisys ’s assertion of its LZW patent , GIF was considered a free file format .
( According to Wikipedia , CompuServe developed the format in the 1980s without knowledge of Unisys ’s LZW patent . )
The developers of Ogg Theora have released the format and implementations freely , and claim no patent rights to it .
But that does n’t mean someone else does n’t hold patents — or wo n’t be granted patents — that they believe or will claim Ogg Theora violates .
For one example , consider this interview by Jan Ozer with MPEG LA ’s Larry Horn , where Horn states :
Horn :
In addition , no one in the market should be under the misimpression that other codecs such as Theora are patent - free .
Virtually all codecs are based on patented technology , and many of the essential patents may be the same as those that are essential to AVC / H.264 .
Therefore , users should be aware that a license and payment of applicable royalties is likely required to use these technologies developed by others , too . [… ]
Ozer :
It sounds like you are saying that some of your patent holders own patents that are used in Ogg .
Is that correct ?
Horn :
We believe that there are patent holders who do .
In short , using Ogg Theora is no guarantee that the MPEG LA is n’t going to pursue you for licensing fees .
This uncertain patent landscape is reportedly one reason Apple does n’t support Ogg Theora .
If some patent troll decides H.264 violates a patent , they must go to court with MPEG LA , not individual licensees .
If a patent troll decides Ogg Theora violates a patent , they might sue those who are using it .
I bring this up not to say browsers should not support Ogg Theora — I ’m just saying Ogg is a lot closer to being in GIF ’s boat than H.264 is .
I do n’t like the idea that the standard format for web video is n’t a free , open standard like PNG or JPEG are for graphics .
But that ’s the way it is .
H.264 is popular and growing , and while Mozilla ’s refusal to support it directly in Firefox may temper that , it ’s not going to drive web publishers to use Ogg Theora instead or even in addition to H.264 .
It just means Firefox users will continue to be served video using Flash — often encoded as H.264 .
The idealist perspective is expressed here by Thom Holwerda at OSNews :
Now that Internet Explorer 9 has been let out its cage , we all know a great deal more about Microsoft ’s position towards the video codec situation with the HTML5 video tag .
Microsoft has chosen for H264 , a codec it already includes in Windows by default anyway .
This means that apart from Firefox and Opera , every other major browser will support H264 .
Some are seeing this as a reason for Mozilla to give in to their ideals and include support for H.264 as well — I say : Mozilla , stick to your ideals .
The last people you should be listening to in matters like this are web developers .
This presents a sort of chicken - or - egg scenario .
Should browser makers support the formats being used by web publishers ?
Or should web publishers use the formats supported by browser makers ?
( Sort of like the descriptivism / prescriptivism divide in the world of language and usage . )
I come down on the side of web publishers , but , admittedly , even though I do n’t publish much video content , I ’m clearly biased insofar as that I am a web publisher .
But I think history shows that practical concerns , not idealism , is what drives web publishers to adopt new formats .
But if Mozilla ’s position were really about idealism — tough love for the good of the web in the name of free , open file formats — then in addition to not supporting H.264 , they ’d drop support for plugins like Flash Player .
I believe such a move would just drive Firefox users to Chrome and Safari ( or even back to IE ) , and I suspect Mozilla knows this , too , which is why dropping plugin support is n’t being discussed .
But they ca n’t say Firefox only supports free and open video formats while still supporting Flash .
I had the neat experience yesterday of talking to a class about scientific illustration , from my point of view as a scientist who does a lot of illustrating my own work .
The students ’ questions ranged widely .
Some were very technical – what tools do I use , why do I hatch in a particular style ?
Others were more conceptual – how do artists put flesh onto bones in their reconstructions ?
In that light , Carl Zimmer has a nice article in the Science Times today about the work of artist reconstructors of fossils : “ Artists Mine Scientific Clues to Paint Intricate Portraits of the Past ” .
I get asked about artist reconstructions every so often – “ How accurate are they ?
Are they scientific ?
Are they just made up ? ”
Zimmer discusses many kinds of fossils , from dinosaurs to humans .
For ancient humans , one new aspect is that we have details from their genomes about possible phenotypes , based on associations in living human populations .
This came into play for the reconstruction of the “ Paleo - Eskimo ” individual whose genome was published in Nature last month :
Mr. Godtfredsens picture is plausible , rather than photographic .
Its impossible to pick out an individual from a police lineup based on nothing but a genome .
Dark hair , brown eyes and a stocky build could describe thousands of people who live in the Arctic today .
Its also important to bear in mind that genes rarely guarantee any particular traits ; instead , they tend to be associated with them .
So we cant know for sure that having a so - called baldness gene meant that Inuk actually ended up bald .
Its certainly possible that he died too soon to find out .
Zimmer also discusses Jay Matternes ’ reconstruction of Ardi :
Mr. Matternes worked for years with the scientists on his reconstruction of Ardipithecus .
First he drew its skeleton .
Onto the skeleton he added muscles , and finally skin and hair .
Mr. Matternes infused the picture with a deep artistic understanding of anatomy .
But it is also a scientific hypothesis .
This is the point I try to emphasize – an artistic reconstruction is a hypothesis .
It is communicated visually , unlike hypotheses that are expressed verbally or mathematically .
Elements of it are testable – they can be refuted by making further observations .
I was explaining this to my introductory anthropology students yesterday as well – that Matternes reconstruction of Ardi is a hypothesis about posture and locomotor mode .
Looking at the reconstruction helps to frame further tests of that hypothesis in a way that complements the verbal description of the anatomy , although it does n’t supersede or substitute for the anatomical description .
But there is another aspect to the artistic representation of fossils :
It conveys the reality of the objects .
I find that these two aspects of artistic representation are in tension .
Clearly communicating about the anatomy of a fossil requires a representation that highlights some anatomical aspects and glosses those that are irrelevant .
Having the experience of the reality of an object requires a different kind of representation .
On a surface level , for example , one may consider that fossils are broken and discolored in various ways .
A true - to - life rendering of the discolorations will accurately convey something about the objects , but may obfuscate the anatomy .
The very act of representing a fossil in a way that corrects for breakage and distortion is a kind of reconstruction – a kind of hypothesis , in other words .
It conveys information about the way the artist or scientist conceives of the object ’s relation to other objects .
Likewise , an artist ’s fleshed - out reconstruction of a fossil skull communicates the artist ’s hypothesis about the relation of the skull to ancient flesh and the living flesh that the artist knows through study and observation .
It obfuscates some details of the fossil , and highlights others .
All art has this tension .
We understand that an artistic representation of a living person is a kind of fiction – it can never capture the person herself , only some aspect of the person .
It may exaggerate some and gloss others .
So it is natural for some viewers to see an artistic representation of a fossil with suspicion .
The agency of the artist is apparent , and we may not trust that the artist is an appropriately skeptical observer .
When we look at multiple reconstructions of the same fossil , the power of convention is apparent .
Just think – how many reconstructions of Neandertals have you seen in the last few years that were n’t red-headed ?
Gurche ’s new one is n’t , but almost all have been .
The red - headed Neandertal clearly conveys the information about the genomics of MC1R , and yet the color itself is just a hypothesis .
As I discussed upon the discovery , even if the variant has the postulated functional effect on melanocortin reception by melanocytes , there may well have been modifier genes that made Neandertal hair blonde .
The convention of the red- headed Neandertal follows the needs of museums and textbook authors , all of whom need to tell the story about genetics .
But in that sense , it ’s rather like the convention of a bearded Jesus – making the Neandertal iconic triggers our recognition , but may subtract the need to scrutinize closely , to experience the form anew .
I have some more to write about this topic , using Jay Matternes ’ Ardi reconstruction as case study – so check back later !
UPDATE ( 2010-03 - 24 ) : I ’m reminded of a post from last year , “ Paleo- artists in the spotlight ” , which pointed to a well - illustrated Michael Balter profile of several artists in Science last July .

So are any of the Lost stars going to stick with their TV presence after Lost comes to a close this May ?
A certain man you know as Jim LaFleur , aka Sawyer , aka Josh Holloway , will .
Though he admitted in season one that he considered quitting amidst all the life - changing pressure a hit show like Lost can bring , Josh now tells me he 'll be moving to Los Angeles and looking for his next acting job :
" I 'm enjoying being an actor now ... I love the craft , and I have gotten somewhat seasoned on this show , working consistently every day .
I 've gotten to really love what I do . "
Thank God .
I was starting to think that the Island 's latest mythical power was to make all of our favorite actors disappear .
One of the President 's jobs is to present a budget to Congress every year .
President Obama 's budget was submitted this week , and much to the LGBT community 's surprise , the costs for the State of the Union promised repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell were not included .
All things cost money , even the implementation of new rules that would repeal the outdated and completely unfair Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ( DADT ) policy that prevents gays and lesbians from servicing openly in the military .
" The President was very clear in the [ The State of the Union ] that he will work with the Secretary of Defense and military leadership to repeal this policy .
This initiative entails a policy change and has very little budgetary impact and that is why it 's not represented in the Budget . "
That seems simple enough on the surface .
OMB Director Peter Orszag made a similar statement to reporters on Sunday , " I do n't think there 's any direct funding -- there 's no direct -- that 's not something that would be reflected in the budget because there 's not a direct funding implication . "
However , there should be costs implementing a repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell .
The Military is all about training .
Everyone is trained in every new policy or order handed down .
Training costs money , but perhaps not very much money .
Most of the training will likely be handed down via PowerPoint presentations and lumped together with other training .
Perhaps that explains the " no direct funding " logic .
However there are additional costs to a repeal of Do n't Ask Don't tell that would cost significant enough money to show up in the budget , and since those costs are not in this proposed budget it leads me to wonder if there will still be serious inequalities in the ways Gay and Lesbian soldiers are treated in a post DADT military or if anyone seriously believes this Congress has the will to repeal DADT ?
Most military heterosexual families have access to a plethora of services and benefits .
Basics like health insurance , death benefits , housing and moving costs , are provided to military families .
For example , in the President 's proposed budget , there would be a projected decrease in military spending for Housing by hundreds of millions of dollars by 2011 .
Does that decrease take into account the housing needs of same sex partners and their children ?
It is n't clear since the repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell 's costs are not outlined specifically in the budget .
The Department of Defense Budget Proposal Summary ( .pdf ) says :
The strength of our troops relies on the strength and stability of the families that support them , and the Budget supports these military families as our servicemembers answer our country 's call to service .
Overall , family support programs grow over 3 percent above the 2010 enacted level .
What 's not clear at this point is how the military would define family if there was a repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell .
Would legal domestic partners and / or married same sex spouses be included in that definition ?
Presumably , the Obama Administration would have to use the same excuses it used to deny 9th Circuit Court employees access to same sex family benefits -- DOMA .
Is DOMA the real reason we do n't see more detail on the repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell in the 2011 budget ?
Is DOMA the reason Congress is pushing back and lowering expectations about how quickly we will see a repeal ?
Will the Federal government be prevented from recognizing the families of gay and lesbian soldiers ?
Will the widow (s ) or widower (s ) of our lost soldiers be any better post repeal ?
Or will the costs of the repeal " have very little budgetary impact ? "
Will our families be left without the benefits they need to support our troops ?
I 'm not the only one to come to this conclusion .
In fact , an anonymous source from the Department of Justice told Reuters , the DOD is planning a year long review of the repeal of DADT and " their review is expected to look at several sensitive issues , including whether the military should extend marriage and bereavement benefits to the partners of gay soldiers . "
Judging by Tuesdays 's Senate hearing on how to repeal Do n't Ask Don't Tell , I 'm not expecting any miracles from this Congress .
I do not think our conservative Democratic majority is willing to take the steps they need to to give our soldiers the equality they deserve .
Certainly not before an election where their majority is potentially under threat .
Ironically the voters are way ahead of Congress on this issue .
Unfortunately the legislative branch , both Democrats and Republicans are bitterly out of touch with the American people on this and most issues .
Despite the leadership shown by the Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff who testified that he thought allowing gays to serve openly in the military was " the right thing to do , " Senator McCain insisted a repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell was a bad idea .
Joe Lieberman chimed in with the suggestion that 60 votes would be necessary to pass a repeal .
Will the repeal of Do n't Ask Don't Tell actually happen ?
Can our Congress catch up with the voting public who has long been on the side of our gay and lesbian soldiers ?
I 'm not holding my breath because the big issue no one wants to address is staring us all right in the face .
The Defense of Marriage
Act must be repealed for our military to treat all soldiers equally .
Sure , we can baby step our way to equality by first repealing Do n't Ask Don't Tell and ignoring DOMA .
But if we do , our military -- our country will by hypocritical .
We would ask our soldiers to defend " freedom " without actually giving them access to the most fundamental of those freedoms -- to love whom you choose with the legal protections most heterosexual couples enjoy .
If anyone believes this Congress is willing to take that step , they are kidding themselves .
With the Senate 's tired 60 vote excuse , we know the Senate wo n't act in any meaningful way any time soon .
Meanwhile we all know Congress does not need 60 votes , they just need a spine and a budget that supports gay and lesbian soldiers and their families .
I have to at least applaud the President for stepping up and advocating for the LGBT community as he promised .
He 's certainly moving in the direction I hoped he would when I voted for him .
He has inspired a national conversation that is long over due .
I only hope he has the political power to move our nation 's most disappointing majority in history in the right direction , because if he can't move them the people should .
We should move each and every one of them right out of Washington , and get some people in there who can actually mover our progressive agenda forward .
UPDATE : I 'm told the military may not be bound by DOMA because they operate under their their own set of rules and are not governed by the Justice Department , but that may not preclude the legislative branch for using that excuse as a political out .
We should not let them .
Google Inc.'s search sites in China abruptly stopped working Tuesday , but the explanation for the outage shifted as the day wore on .
The Internet giant first blamed itself , citing a technical change , but later reversed course and pointed to the heavy hand of China 's " Great Firewall " — even as service appeared to be back to normal .
The evolving explanation whipsawed Google watchers and showed how fraught with confusion the relationship between China and Google remains .
The episode risks escalating their battle a week after Google ...
Tony Ray is making cards with toddlers Lizzie , Alex and Maya – none of them his own .
Gary Collins is comforting James , whose dad has just popped out to feed the meter .
Rufus is playing with the dolls ' house , and Joe , Violet and Barnaby are creating a den .
It 's Friday morning at Dads and Littl'uns , the bi-weekly playgroup in Wimbledon , set up and run by dads .
More fathers are taking responsibility for childcare .
Traditional roles are changing and , from necessity or preference , fathers are taking flexible working hours , spending more time with their children and adopting the role of primary carers .
" This is post - feminist gender disorder , " says Robert Bagley , father of three - year - old Lizzie .
" Following the women 's movement of the Seventies and Eighties , women have moved into senior positions in the workplace and become high wage earners .
Many men have wives with good salaries who carry them at home so they can be full or part - time home dads . "
Two little girls who made a beeline for the fancy dress rack , are dancing about as fairies .
Others are on the trampoline .
Boys are shoving cars and buggies across the floor .
Peter Balderstone is standing with his back to the children counting to 20 in a booming voice as toddlers scurry off to hide .
Robert is stirring coffee , other fathers are chatting about last night 's football match .
There is n't a woman in sight .
" We welcome mums , " says David Carr , who has taken over as organiser .
" And we arrange events for the whole family , but this is a primarily a place for dads . "
And fathers have come from near and far .
Peter has travelled from Notting Hill Gate .
" I go to women 's groups locally but here we talk about more interesting things !
Last week we were discussing late Marxist theory .
Mothers ' groups are fine but there can be a lot of carers and au pairs , who form different groups with different kinds of support . "
Now in its eighth year , Dads and Little 'uns has no institutional connections and is not beholden to any organisation .
Men pay £ 3 per session and £ 4 if they come twice .
There are sessions every Monday and Friday morning from 10 am to noon and some fathers bring a packed lunch and stay until 1 pm .
There are social functions once a week , a football team and outings in the summer .
The group stays open in the holidays when children need entertaining most ; some members have moved away and formed groups in Dulwich and Exeter .
The baton of organiser passes from father to father as the children grow up and new men join .
The founding fathers set up the group because most playgroups were run by mothers for mothers .
" Mothers form relationships before their babies are born , at antenatal groups and in the hospital , " says Robert .
" The relationships continue when the children are born and become toddlers .
Fathers who stay at home have none of that support .
Mothers ' groups welcome them but the bonds are different when dads get together . "
Some fathers have part - time jobs in industry , teaching , the arts and media .
They 've discovered that being a home - based father can be a mixed blessing ; it can be boring , monotonous and repetitive .
There can be tensions too as mothers feel they are missing out .
Peter says his wife would definitely prefer to bring up their daughter : " The traditional route would have worked fine for us .
Of course , we could change our lifestyle and move somewhere else but to afford our house , one of us has to earn a good salary .
I always knew I would be the main carer and I like it as it is .
My wife 's work maintains the life we want to live collectively .
She thinks I 'm the more cheerful and optimistic one and this is good for our daughter Scarlett .
But she does feel regret . "
Robert agrees : " My wife is happy to know Lizzie is looked after by me but she also wants to be at home .
She feels the need to perform the traditional role at the weekend .
I love cooking .
She does n't .
On Saturdays she rearranges the kitchen , I put everything back again on Monday . "
Ideally , most couples would like to share childminding : " We 're all driven by money and few men have the luxury to opt to be full - time dads , " says Gary .
" And when you 've been a home dad for a few years , it 's difficult to get back into the workplace .
You need to network and you can't do that looking after children . "
As a full - time father , you can feel a lack of control because you are not earning .
It can be frustrating and isolating .
Martin Eason believes that , if it were n't for the group , he might have been more inclined to want to go back to work .
" But economically we 're better off than if we hired a full - time carer , and it 's definitely rewarding spending time with the children . "
" You miss a lot by going out to work , " Andrew Lawford confirms .
" You gain a lot by being with the children .
You have time and the freedom to see the changing seasons .
Sometimes when I worked full - time , a year would pass and I 'd realise I had n't even noticed we 'd gone from winter to summer and back again . "
Mark Chester , family officer with Liverpool Football Club and chairman of Who Let the Dads Out ? , a Christian organisation that runs a string of fathers ' groups , has seen a huge change in attitude and opportunity for fathers , since the group began in Chester in 2003 : " Dads ' toddler groups did n't exist then .
The Community Church parent and toddler group wanted to give mums a break and get dads involved . "
One Saturday morning , 23 fathers turned up at the church hall with their children : " This was very unusual .
It showed there was a need and desire for this kind of group .
As a result we ran monthly Saturday dads ' playgroups , which still continue today . "
Mark began doing antenatal work with fathers - to - be , exploring the emotional aspects of fatherhood .
" Having a baby is a shock for everyone .
There is less social life , less sex life , less money and less time with your partner or wife .
Men can experience negative feelings .
We looked at how they felt and the changes that were likely to occur in their lives . "
He carried out a survey with a small group of fathers to assess their satisfaction levels .
" Generally , men 's satisfaction was lower [ than women 's ] when the children were babies , though they were happy to be fathers .
When the youngest child reached four or five , men 's satisfaction began to improve .
Our aim was to encourage dads to stick with it because the benefits are there in the long run . "
Mark feels that there has always been a willingness in men to become involved in caring for their children , " but over the last few years there has been a change in opportunity and in society 's expectations " .
Today there are 21 groups registered on the Who Let the Dads Out ? website .
Adrienne Burgess , the head of research at the Fatherhood Institute , confirms that over the last 30 years there has been a rapid increase in the time men spend with their children .
Time spent with children has risen by more than 800 per cent and fathers are far more likely to look after children on their own .
Fathers take on about a quarter of parental childcare and this goes up to one - third when mothers work full - time .
" In the past , there was no need for this because mothers were at home doing it all .
Now , half the mothers of children under the age of one are in the paid workforce . "
Work has also become more flexible : more fathers work from home and this leads to more sharing of childcare .
Research shows that children who have a close and positive relationship with fathers as well as mothers , whether they live together or not , have more empathy and form more positive friendships ; they are less likely to commit crimes or get into trouble with the police ; they are happier and do better at school .
" The importance of the father 's role is now recognised right from the beginning , " Adrienne continues .
" Couples are more stable when both partners are sharing .
The role of childminder is n't a glamorous one but it has many advantages : it promotes patience and makes individuals more aware . "
Men who have been involved with their children from an early age are likely to have grown emotionally : " These are pioneering fathers , creating a space for dads and children , where it is the norm for dads to be involved .
It can be very invigorating and empowering because they get to see other fathers benefiting too .
The more skilled the men become at looking after the children , the more rewarding it is . "
Back at Dads and Littl'uns , it 's time to start packing up .
Paul , who is here for the first time , has a happy smile on his face .
" I 'm disorientated , " he says .
" I 'm used to being the only guy with a group of women .
Sometimes the single mums want to flirt with you .
This is refreshing and safe . "
" You have male company but the common factor is the children , " says Paul Rawbottom , an early member of the group , whose children have now moved on to school but who still comes regularly to the sessions .
" The group fulfils the role of teamwork , which you find in the workplace but lose when you become a full - time parent . "
Teamwork is definitely in action now as everyone helps stack tables and chairs , wash coffee cups and clear the hall .
It 's obvious the children are happy and the fathers are , too .
And if that 's the case , the mothers must surely be happy as well .
Fathers ' playgroups :
Tips for success
* Keep the group relaxed and with few formalities – the dads are the group .
* Serve good refreshments : you need fresh coffee and a large cafetière .
At Who Let the Dads Out ?
there 's a giant grilling machine for making bacon butties .
* Arrange social functions once a week such as drinks in the pub ; it does n't matter whether two or 22 dads turn up .
* Organise a football team and matches .
* Arrange family events and outings in the summer .
* Stay open in the holidays , when children need entertaining most .
* Keep the website up - to - date to attract more dads .
Some benefits of an all - dads group :
* Same - sex conversations tend to be more relaxed , though you can have good conversations with women , too .
* Women are more competitive about child development .
They talk a lot about what their children can do and achieve .
* Blokes talk about blokes ' stuff : music , football , beer , women , politics , technology .
* Women form bonds through antenatal clinics , giving birth and breastfeeding .
Men just stick a bottle in the baby 's mouth .
Mums have less of a need to let you into the circle .
* Everyone has a vested interest in helping to run the group .
Police drones are grounded for breaking the law
When they first took off , the drones were hailed as the latest weapon in the war against crime .
But after police celebrated their first arrest thanks to one of the miniature remote - controlled helicopters , it emerged it was not only a suspected car thief who was potentially breaking the law .
Merseyside Police has been forced to ground its drones for flying them without the appropriate licence .
Scroll down for video of the ' Hexacopter '
The £ 40,000 remote control drones , which have heat seeking technology , were recently hailed as a success after they helped catch a suspected car thief
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority last night confirmed it was investigating the alleged breach of an Air Navigation Order .
The Air Robot was deployed in January after officers lost a suspect in thick fog .
Using an on - board camera and thermal - imaging technology , the operator was able to direct officers to a 16 - year - old hiding in bushes alongside the Leeds - Liverpool canal .
The drone , which measures 3ft between the tips of its four carbon fibre rotor blades , uses unmanned aerial vehicle technology originally designed for military reconnaissance .
Merseyside Police is one of three forces trying out the £ 40,000 devices which are far cheaper to use than a conventional helicopter .
In August Derbyshire police used a similar drone to monitor protests at a BNP festival in Condor .
But the police seem to have been unaware of a change of legislation on January 1 , following concerns over the safety of flying unmanned aircraft in inhabited areas .
A spokesman for Merseyside Police said : ' The force has written to the CAA requesting they visit the force and inspect our UAV and its working procedures with a view of securing the licence at the earliest opportunity . '
Despite it being one of the toughest economic periods for many years , 2009 proved to be another strong year for Suzuki GB , as the Japanese firm ’s motorcycle division finished as the best selling large capacity manufacturer ( 126 cc and above ) , taking the accolade for an impressive seventh year in succession .
In spite of an inevitable drop in overall sales , Suzuki continued to dominate the large capacity motorcycle market , finishing the year as number one , while maintaining a 15.1 % market share in the category too .
Suzuki GB general manager , sales , Paul de Lusignan , commented , “ It ’s extremely encouraging to finish such a difficult year in top spot .
Obviously we saw a drop in sales , but with a strong product range and the continuation of value - busting offers , we ’ve managed to maintain our market position for the seventh year in succession , with a total of 9,767 motorcycles sold in the 126cc and above sector . ”
In 2009 , Suzuki ’s best selling single model was the all - new GSX - R1000 , closely followed by the Bandit 1250SA , with the iconic GSX - R750 coming home in third spot .
And with the GSX - R range celebrating its 25th birthday this year , combined with the brand ’s 50th anniversary of International racing , Suzuki will look to make 2010 another year at the top .
Well , the snow continues to fall here in the Linux blogosphere , and Linux Girl is beginning to wonder if it will ever end .
Bread and milk are still in short supply at the local FOSS -y - Mart ; children are getting cabin fever ; and the snow drifts are getting taller than many netizens .
Down at the Broken Windows Lounge , in fact , the snow now blocks out most of the light that would be shining through , making it seem as if there are no windows there at all .
‘ What Would Life Be Like ? ’
Such , perhaps , was the inspiration behind a recent conversation that ’s come close to fisticuffs among bloggers determined to relieve the tedium .
“ It ’s the thought experiment we all like to engage in , ” began InfoWorld ’s Randall Kennedy , who had clearly been staring at the snow - covered glass for a very long time .
“ What would life be like without Microsoft Windows ? ”
FOSS advocates , Kennedy asserts , would argue that the demise of Windows “ would signal a kind of rebirth for information technology .
Software would finally be free of the corporate shackles that have stifled innovation and dragged down the best and brightest among us , ” he said .
However , “ such thinking is naive , at best , ” he hastened to add .
‘ An Apocalyptic Tailspin of Biblical Proportions ’
“ Rather than freeing IT , the demise of Microsoft would plunge the industry into an apocalyptic tailspin of biblical proportions — no visions of hippie utopia here , ” Randall opined .
No indeed !
“ The withdrawal of the Redmond giant ’s steady hand would cause today ’s computing landscape to tear itself apart at the seams , with application and device compatibility and interoperability devolving into the kind of Wild West chaos unseen since the days of the DOS big three : Lotus , WordPerfect and Ashton - Tate , ” he said .
The din of the resulting commotion came as a splash of icy water tossed over Linux Girl ’s slumped form , breaking the concentration she had been focusing on her next Peppermint Penguin .
‘ Reminds Me of a Story … ‘
“ I think the picture you painted is far too grim , ” retorted DaveLindhout in the InfoWorld comments .
“ Actually , you paint too rosy a picture of where Microsoft has taken us today .
Much of the chaos you describe is exactly what is wrong with Microsoft today . ”
Even more so : “ Rather than freeing you from your history of M$FT bashing , this piece serves only to cement your reputation for illogical rants that swing from one extreme to another [ in ] search of flames to bolster your hit rates , ” added Gray_Hair .
And again : “ Reminds me very much of a story where the Church has to maintain the Devil or risk becoming irrelevant , ” chimed in jprigot .
‘ Very , Very Patronizing ’
It did n’t take long for the LXer crowd , who had been sitting a few tables away , to join in .
“ If this is satirical , it ’s not obvious ! ” exclaimed tuxchick , for example .
“ Randall C. Kennedy is always like this , ” charged phsolide .
“ He ’s always got N ( N > 10 ) years of experience in Subject X , and gosh darn it , he ’s always just naturally hungered and thirsted after the Microsoft Approach To It All .
” Very , very patronizing , Big Brother Knows Best , Microsoft Is Here to Help , ” phsolide added .
When the rough - and - tumble crowds from Computerworld and PC World showed up , Linux Girl knew an outright brawl was imminent .
She turned to her barmates for help .
‘ A Collection of GeoCities Pages From 1995 ’
“ Mr. Kennedy seems to think that without Windows , the rest of the technology we currently have would immediately devolve into a collection of GeoCities pages from 1995 , ” Slashdot blogger Mhall119 charged .
“ Not only is he quite obviously unaware of the amount of cooperation and collaboration in the free software ecosystem today , he seems to be equally unaware of the capabilities of the Web standards of today — all of which exist , I might add , not because of Windows ’ dominance but in spite of it , ” Mhall119 added .
“ I can only conclude that Mr. Kennedy has spent the last decade secluded in a mountain cabin working offline with Windows 98 , ” he told LinuxInsider .
‘ Open Standards and Protocols ’
What would life after Windows really look like , then ?
“ Worst case scenario , if Windows disappeared tomorrow , a few companies would hire a few developers to finish Wine ’s compatibility with 50 percent of existing software , the other 50 percent having already been replaced with better alternatives , ” Mhall119 predicted .
“ Best case scenario , we would instantly live in a world where the vast majority of software supported open standards and protocols , ” he asserted .
“ I could use the software that I like best , you can use the software you like best , and we can still communicate easily and efficiently with each other . ”
‘ A Viable FUD of the Year Award Entry ’
“ Wow , it ’s January and we already have a viable FUD of the Year Award entry that will be hard to beat , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack agreed .
“ What ’s a more likely scenario ?
Not everything will be cloud - based ; some things will still be local , ” Mack predicted .
“ The FOSS operating systems will copy each other ’s drivers and any closed source OS will use them as a reference . ”
If any player is dominant , meanwhile , “ they will most likely demand a consistent hardware interface to work with , ” he added .
“ The world learned from the old chaotic days , and now even other platforms will take standard USB and probably even PCI addons . ”
‘ It Was Like the Tower of Babel ’
Just what lessons should be learned from the past , however , is n’t entirely clear .
“ I came of age in the ’80s ( yes I ’m a greybeard ) and remember what it was like pre-MSFT , and it was like the tower of Babel , ” Slashdot blogger hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
“ My Commodore would n’t talk to my Uncle ’s Atari , which would n’t talk to my dad ’s Tandy , and nobody could share anything !
Not files , not printers , not anything at all , it was a mess ! ”
When Microsoft and Compaq made “ x86 IBM compatible PCs the standard , that made it easy for others to come along later and build upon the platform , ” hairyfeet explained .
‘ Once a Shill , Always a Shill ’
Kennedy “ does n’t get it , ” opined Barbara Hudson , a blogger on Slashdot who goes by “ Tom ” on the site .
“ Then again , once a Microsoft shill , always a Microsoft shill … ”
The arguments Kennedy presents “ do n’t make any sense , ” Hudson told LinuxInsider .
On the first one , for example — “ kiss consistency goodbye ” —
“ Microsoft is the worst offender here , ” Hudson asserted .
“ Just look at the MS - Office ribbon .
Then again , Microsoft has always had Apple Envy ; they just confuse ‘ change ’ with ‘ trend - setting . ' ”
‘ Is There Life With Windows ? ’
The real question , Hudson said , is , “ Is there life with Windows ? ”
“ So many Windows PCs are zombies , ” she noted .
“ What ’s worse , every time Microsoft releases a new operating system , it gives people a reason to re-evaluate their choices , and more and more people are saying ‘ Well , if I have to buy a new computer anyway …' ”
That , in turn , “ explains why Apple has more money in the bank than Microsoft , ” she charged .
Linux , meanwhile , “ will also gain more users as time goes on , ” Hudson predicted .
“ That ’s pretty much inevitable given that people will not want to spend the money on hardware upgrades when their current machine becomes unusable due to bloat , bit -rot , and ever - more - resource - hogging anti-spyware / anti-virus / anti - whatever , and as applications get more platform independence , either by running in a browser , or via Java . ”
‘ A Plague of Epidemic Proportions ’
Indeed , “ that other OS should be considered a plague of epidemic proportions , ” blogger Robert Pogson agreed .
“ Fortunately , it is past its peak and dwindling rapidly .
The latest quarterly report shows M$ has had to cut prices to sell . ”
Many computer users already have a great life without Windows , Pogson told LinuxInsider : “ I have fewer re-re-reboots , no malware , better response , higher load capacity and the right to do what I want with hardware and software . ”
Ultimately , the bad news is that life without Windows “ is n’t going to happen anytime soon , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ Not in our lifetimes , ” he asserted .
“ Sheer inertia and a death grip on market share keeps Microsoft fat and happy for years to come . ”
‘ Mostly a Veneer ’
The good news , however , is that life with Windows is “ mostly a veneer these days , ” yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ Everyday computer users continue their migration from desktop - anchoredapplications and documents towards more mobile access and management of theirdigital lives . ”
From online photo management and documentation tools to communication channels , “ they no longer need PCs to be Windows - centric — as long as the computer has a browser , they ’re happy , ” yagu pointed out .
“ An Internet tapestry of tools and repositories provide more transparency and mobility than ever , ” he concluded .
“ The notion that Windows is part of that is mostly artifact . ”
It appears that this time China 's posturing is for real .
Following up on our earlier post that Chinese military officials want to " punish " America by selling Treasuries , Asia Times Online is reporting that an explicit directive by the Chinese government has notified reserve managers to sell all risky US assets , including asset backed and corporates , and just hold on to explicitly guaranteed Treasuries and Agency debt .
And from following TIC data we know that China 's enthusiasm for MBS / Agencies over the past year has been matched solely by that of one Bill Gross .
From Asia Times :
Dollar - denominated risk assets , including asset - backed securities and corporates , are no longer wanted at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) , nor at China ’s large commercial banks .
The Chinese government has ordered its reserve managers to divest itself of riskier securities and hold only Treasuries and US agency debt with an implicit or explicit government guarantee .
This already has been communicated to American securities dealers , according to market participants with direct knowledge of the events .
It is not clear whether China ’s motive is simple risk aversion in the wake of a sharp widening of corporate and mortgage spreads during the past two weeks , or whether there also is a political dimension .
With the expected termination of the Federal Reserve ’s special facility to purchase mortgage - backed securities next month , some asset - backed spreads already have blown out , and the Chinese institutions may simply be trying to get out of the way of a widening .
There is some speculation that China ’s action has to do with the recent deterioration of US - Chinese relations over arm sales to Taiwan and other issues .
That would be an unusual action for the Chinese to take–Beijing does not mix investment and strategic policy–and would be hard to substantiate in any event .
Furthermore , demonstrating just how seriously China is approaching a populist - driven adversarial stance with the US , was earlier speculation that instead of unpegging its currency ( a move much desired by the US administration in its goal to further weaken the dollar and make China less competitive in the export market ) , China would reduce its trade balance not by the traditional way of currency inflation , but by the economic textbook footnote approach of raising salaries .
Higher labor costs would cut Chinese export competitiveness while boosting domestic spending power and sustaining economic growth , according to the bank .
Premier Wen Jiabao ’s government has been pressed by U.S. and European officials to end a 19 - month yuan peg to the dollar to help diminish trade and investment imbalances that contributed to the credit crisis .
“ Wage increases are a better option because they largely benefit Chinese workers , ” Tao Dong , a Credit Suisse economist in Hong Kong who has covered the Chinese and Asian economies for more than 15 years , said in an interview yesterday .
“ Currency appreciation will only result in Chinese exporters losing out to competitors in countries such as Malaysia and Mexico . ”
The strategy may limit gains in the yuan to 3 percent this year , according to Tao .
This month ’s 13 percent increase in minimum wage in eastern China ’s Jiangsu province indicates that higher pay will play an important role in officials ’ efforts to rebalance growth in the fastest - growing major economy , Tao said .
The wage decision “ argues against a large one - off yuan revaluation , ” Ben Simpfendorfer , an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong , wrote in a note this week .
One thing is certain - China will now focus on doing precisely the opposite of what America would urge Chinese authorities to do , in order to establish itself as the focal point of negotiating leverage and increasingly humiliate the Obama regime .
If this involves selling USTs or corporates ( both fixed income and equities ) so be it .
This is further confirmed by carefully worded disclosure in today 's copy of China Securities Journal :
The China Securities Journal , a government - backed daily , accused the U.S. in a tough - worded front page editorial of playing the " exchange rate card . "
It said that , just as China did n't interfere with Federal Reserve purchases of U.S. Treasuries , " the U.S. has no right to interfere in China 's exchange rate policy . "
" Whether or not to appreciate is our own business , " the newspaper said .
" Whether it will appreciate , when and by how much is an integral part of China 's monetary policy . "
It is not clear when the asset divestiture directive takes place or if it is already being enforced .
Juding by the afterhours action in futures and the currency markets , some dumping may already be taking place .
Alternatively , we now know just who it is that sell into every rally ( yes , even in this market , every buyer is matched with a seller ) .
Another day , another Android tablet render .
This one , the imaginatively titled WePad , is as ambitious as its name might suggest .
( You know , because " we " is plural of " I " ?
Yeah , it 's a stretch . )
Dwarfing the iPad with its 11.6 - inch ( 1366 x 768 ) display , a 1.66 GHz Intel Atom N450 processor , GMA 3150 graphics , webcam , two USB ports , flash card reader , UMTS modem , and a mooted six hours of battery life , we could see ourselves picking one up -- provided the price point is decent .
But that 's just the beginning !
The manufacturer , Neofonie , also has designs on a WePad app store and , if all goes according to plan , this thing'll sport genuine Google Android and the Android Market .
The company also mentions something called the " WeMagazine publishing ecosystem , " the basis of a turn - key operation for getting your own branded device out on the e-reader market , so if you 're looking to get into the biz just hit the source link to begin your adventure .
As for us , we 'll wait to see a final product before we jump to any conclusions .

Blogging has become an essential tool for campaigners , activists , and social commentators , especially in countries that have n’t traditionally encouraged outspokenness .
People who once struggled to get a chance to speak now have a voice .
Or at least a platform from which they can shout .
But that does n’t mean the authorities have to like it , and in countries where public protest is actively discouraged , so too is digital dissent .
Some , like North Korea , Kazakhstan , and Cuba , have suppressed bloggers by restricting access to the Internet .
While that might make them the most difficult places to be a dissident blogger , it does n’t necessarily make them the worst .
Here are five dangerous places to be a blogger .
CHINA
Hardly renowned as a vigorous defender of free speech , China has almost 300 million Internet users and has few qualms about prosecuting bloggers , usually on charges of ‘ subversion ’ .
The Committee to Protect Journalists reported at least 24 bloggers were serving sentences in 2009 for putting online thoughts that did n’t align with those of the leaders of the People ’s Republic .
Prison sentences in China are also generally much longer than elsewhere – averaging between three to ten years .
Meanwhile , the authorities monitor emails and block websites via the so - called Great Firewall of China , recognized as one of the most effective attempts at state control of the Internet .
If that was n’t enough , last year China announced it would be requiring a program called Green Dam to be installed on computers , which would aid its Internet censorship efforts by blocking sites and collecting information on what users have been browsing .
Security vulnerabilities appear to have so far delayed the roll out of this program .
IRAN
While not holding nearly as many bloggers in prison as China , the Islamic Republic has the dubious honor of being the first place where a blogger has died while in incarceration .
Omidreza Mirsayafi died in March last year , apparently after being refused medical treatment .
He was being held in Tehran ’s Evin Prison , notorious in the wake of Iran ’s recent political unrest for reports of regular beatings and rapes by prison guards .
However , the Iranian blogosphere as a whole is one of the most active , helped mainly by the large number of dissident Iranians living abroad .
And with professional journalists coming under severe restrictions since Iran ’s disputed June 2009 presidential election , opposition websites have ended up being the starting point for most foreign media coverage .
MYANMAR
Very few people in what was formerly known as Burma have access to the Internet so those who want it need to use cybercafes .
This provides the authorities with a much more cost effective way to crack down on digital dissidents since the cafes are heavily regulated and their users can be easily monitored .
Myanmar also appears to have taken a leaf out of China ’s book on disproportionate sentencing – blogger Maung Thura is currently serving a 45 - year jail sentence for disseminating video of the aftermath of 2008 Cyclone Nargis .
The government also appears to have no qualms about simply turning off the country ’s Internet access when they really do n’t want things getting out .
EGYPT
Among Middle Eastern nations , Egypt wins media freedom points for the fact it blocks very little online content .
However , that is of little comfort to political bloggers who are regularly harassed by the authorities .
One , known online as Karim Amer , is currently serving a four year sentence for insulting the president , and many others are periodically rounded up and jailed .
Several have been tortured while in prison .
Egypt ’s bloggers have themselves documented the near endemic use of torture in jails by posting footage of it on the Internet .
Two policemen were jailed in 2007 after bloggers posted mobile phone footage of them sodomizing Emad al - Kebir , a 22 - year - old bus driver , with a stick .
SAUDI ARABIA
Religious authorities in Saudi Arabia have several times advocated punishments such as flogging and death for bloggers who have touched on Islam .
They have yet to get their way , but the government has been willing to sling bloggers in jail without charge on several occasions .
Perhaps the real problem for dissident bloggers in Saudi Arabia , though , is not the punishment , but the fact there is just so much you ca n’t talk about .
Hamoud Ben Saleh was arrested in January last year for writing online about his conversion to Christianity .
Besides religion and politics , authorities take a dim view of anything they consider vaguely ‘ indecent ’ , a lose turn of phrase covering a multitude of sins .
To compound the problem , since sites are blocked using key - word filters , that can include potentially beneficial content such as information on sexual health or breast cancer .
Despite the best efforts of their governments , though , blogging in countries that take a strong line on dissent has thrived and there are many projects designed to help keep it that way .
Media rights group Reporters Without Borders , which last year published a list of 11 countries it branded “ Internet enemies , ” offers a downloadable Handbook for Cyberdissidents , available from its website .

A 28 - year - old Alvin man remained in jail Friday , charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child after officials said DNA tests confirmed he fathered a baby with his 11 - year - old stepdaughter .
“ In our office , there is a sense of deep sorrow , ” said Lisa Jolly , executive director of the Brazoria County Alliance for Children , a nonprofit that provides a range of services to abused children .
“ To the general population , it is very shocking . ”
The stepfather , whom the Houston Chronicle is not identifying because it indirectly could identify the victim , was arrested Wednesday and remained in the Brazoria County Jail in lieu of $ 200,000 bail Friday , the Brazoria County Sheriff 's Office said .
If convicted of the first - degree felony child sex charge , the stepfather faces five to 99 years in prison .
He works as a driver and does not have a criminal record , investigators said .
Sheriff 's investigator Jeff Dandeneau said the man denied having sex with his stepdaughter and refused to provide a DNA sample .
Officials with Texas Child Protective Services said the 11 - year - old and her 7 - year - old sister were removed from the home in late November , about three weeks before she gave birth on Dec. 12 .
The girl 's advanced pregnancy was noticed by teachers at her Alvin Independent School District elementary school in late September , and tests and medical examinations confirmed she was expecting .
“ I can confirm we took her and her sibling into custody , and she is living with relatives , ” said CPS spokeswoman Gwen Carter .
“ They 're doing as best as can be expected .
They 're with some wonderful relatives who are protective and making sure they have everything they need . ”
The young mother , her sister and the infant are living with an adult cousin , according to court papers .
Carter said the mother of the abused girl did not shield her daughter from the abuse , but she declined to elaborate .
“ What I will tell you is , the child 's mother was not protective , and that 's why we went to court to take custody , ” Carter said .
According to the probable cause affidavit filed with the charges , the 11 - year - old told a relative that her stepfather had been having frequent sex with her since she was 6 .
Dandeneau would not comment on whether the child 's mother would face charges , saying any other charges would be decided by the district attorney 's office .
Jolly said it would be very difficult to predict how the young mother will do in the future .
“ It depends on the resiliency of the child , the support systems she has in place as far as someone encouraged her to obtain help , ” Jolly said .
“ Our hope is she will receive all the support services she needs — legal , emotional and spiritual support from her family . ”

Science & Exploration To Mars and back – as real as it gets
23/03/2010 1843 views 1 likes
A crew of six , including two Europeans , will soon begin a simulated mission to Mars in a mockup that includes an interplanetary spaceship , Mars lander and martian landscape .
The Mars500 experiment , as long as a real journey to Mars , is a test of human endurance .
Their mission is to mimic a full mission to Mars and back as accurately as possible without actually going there : Mars500 will be the first full - duration simulated mission to Mars , starting in a special facility in Moscow next summer .
250 days for the trip to Mars , 30 days on the surface and 240 days for the return journey , totalling 520 days .
There was n’t much isolation yesterday on Monday 22 March though , when the four European candidates for Mars500 were presented to the press at ESA ’s Technology Centre ESTEC in Noordwijk , the Netherlands .
Belgian Jerome Clevers , Arc’hanmael Gaillard , Romain Charles from France and Colombian - Italian Diego Urbina took a break from their mission training that began on 24 February in Russia , to meet the press .
Two of the four will take part in the final 520 - day ’ mission ’ , along with three Russians and one Chinese participant .
Simonetta Di Pippo and Martin Zell at the press conference “ Mars is the ultimate goal of the global human exploration programme ” , said Simonetta Di Pippo , ESA Director of Human Spaceflight .
“ In addition to developing the necessary space infrastructure for exploration missions , ESA ’s Directorate of Human Spaceflight also has an ongoing programme of ground - based analogues and ISS research activities to make sure that our astronauts are as prepared as possible in the future for the physical and mental demands of long - duration exploration missions , and to develop countermeasures against any adverse effects of such a mission .
Mars500 isolation study is a major milestone in this .
The cooperation between ESA and Russia in this experiment is also an asset . ”
Candidates Romain Charles ( born 1979 ) is from France and is working as a Quality Manager for Sotira , which produces composite panels .
Born in 1979 , Charles lives in Saint Malo , France , and is – as his colleagues – highly motivated to participate in the study .
“ If I can help in going to Mars , I ’m happy to sacrifice this time of my life for that . ”
Jerome Clevers from Belgium is a Technical Support Engineer at the Turbomeca Safran Group in charge of global technical support for the helicopter engines .
Born in 1981 , Clevers lives in Bayonne , France .
“ The most difficult in the isolation study will surely be separation from my girlfriend and family , and the fact that you ca n’t open the window , feel the breeze and see the Sun . ”
Arc'hanmael Gaillard from France was a member of the backup crew for the 105 - day isolation period of the Mars500 study .
He is a study and development engineer at Thomson R&D France working with the research and development of technologies for flat panel displays .
Born in 1976 , Gaillard lives in Rennes , France .
“ This is a real experiment , very much like a real spaceflight , and I ’m just happy to participate . ”
Diego Urbina , born in May 1983 , has a joint Italian - Colombian nationality has a wide experience in space - related activities ranging from being a crewmember at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah , USA in January 2010 , to an outreach and educational activity organiser in the developing world .
Prior to this he was an operations and astronaut training intern at the Neutral Buoyancy Facility of ESA ’s European Astronaut Centre in Cologne , Germany .
“ This study is not useful only for Mars , but also for life on Earth . ”
Well - prepared experiment Mars500 experiment facility in Moscow
The 520 - day isolation test is the last and core part of the Mars500 experiment that began back in 2007 .
The first phase in November 2007 was a 14 - day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures .
The second phase followed in 2009 , when four Russian and two European crewmembers were shut into the facility for 105 days on 31 March .
Mars500 is being conducted by Russia ’s Institute of Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) , with extensive participation by ESA as part of its European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences ( ELIPS ) to prepare for future human missions to the Moon and Mars .
During the experiment , the crew will be hermetically isolated in confined space with limited consumables and communication only via the Internet , occasionally disrupted and with a 20 - minute delay , as for a real Mars mission , due to the distance between the spacecraft and Earth .
Testing a ' martianised '
Orlan spacesuit
The crew will be monitored and their psychological , medical and physical signs recorded throughout the mission .
During the ‘ surface operations ’ after 250 days , the crew will be divided in half , three will move to the martian surface simulator and three will remain in the ‘ spacecraft ’ .
The crew will have all the food needed from the beginning of the experiment and they will have to ration out their supplies for the entire time .
The diet will be similar to that of the crews on the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Tasks performed by the crew will be comparable to those of the ISS astronauts , but for a much longer time : maintenance , scientific experiments and daily exercise .
They will follow a seven - day week with two days off , except when special and emergency situations are simulated .
This mission might lack some of the glory and feeling of the real spaceflight , but it will be just as tough .
The first humans to walk on Mars will surely remember these pioneers .
Past and present ruminations about what is and is n’t a photograph have been a source of frustration for me .
For one , people can draw whatever lines they wish to determine the point at which manipulation tricks out a photograph and thus qualifies it as photo - illustration .
And for another , as Errol Morris keeps banging on about , ALL photography is lies ( and manipulation ) .
These debates are not about truth .
Interventions – power relations , habit , photographic custom , complicity among subjects , props , political agendas ( and framing ) , cropping , tweaking of exposure levels before and after development , digital alterations – mean that photography can never be , will never be truthful .
People forget that often it is the ingenious tricks that have spurred the largest wonder among viewing public – think Oscar Rejlander ’s Two Ways of Life , Spirit Photography and – in a different sense – Ansel Adams ’ Zone System .
It is therefore , with some relief that an artist like Azzarella comes along using photo - manipulation as the tactic and purpose for his work .
Last week , I questioned Anton Kratochvil ’s Homage to Abu Ghraib , mainly because I think it makes little contribution to the discourse on the political aesthetics of Abu Ghraib .
The blurry references to torture in Kratochvil ’s images are in response only to a personal , conscious and willing point of view .
I understand that Kratochvil ’s work was an exercise in self - therapy but that should n’t stop me comparing it to Azzarella ’s broader concerns about more general and unconscious reactions to well - circulated images .
If I w re to wr t th s sent nce wi h lette s m ss ng , you can still read it .
The human brain is a wonderful instrument drawing on past experience to quickly filter out the non-possibilities .
Just as the brain instantaneously deciphers gaps in text so it does with gaps in images .
With every passing hour the Spectacle suffuses itself further .
It is n’t so much us reading images but images reading us .
Our involuntary responses to images are predictable , predicted , precoded .
The redacted action of violence in Azzarella ’s pictures plays second fiddle to the original image , for it is the original image we drooled over and devoured .
The hooded detainee , dead student , wailing child or falling soldier need n’t even be present ; our internal , emotional feedback spun by these images will forever be the same .
We fill in the gaps and short circuit to prescribed disgust , sadness and politics , thus confirming our prevailing bias .
Azzarella ’s works expose the fraud in us all … and our cheapened , robotic response to image .

They ’re Wearing Green in Dubai
Dubai may be possibly the closest thing to being in Iran itself .
In five days here I ’ve met with nearly three dozen Iranians from different walks of life to try to get a better impression of what ’s happening inside the country .
Part of the United Arab Emirates , Dubai is the city - state that until recently glittered as the Middle East ’s pre-eminent financial center and served as a mecca for European sunbirds desperate for a warm break from bleak northern winters .
The economy has ground to a standstill , Dubai having proven no more resistant to the global recession than anyplace else .
The sun still blazes , of course — a toasty 80 - plus degrees Fahrenheit most January afternoons .
The Disney - style hotels , skyscrapers , and over - the - top shopping malls — one of them boasts an indoor ski slope — reminds one of Las Vegas .
And no matter where you go , Dubai retains a strong , distinctly Iranian flavor .
Estimates put the size of the Iranian expat community at 400,000 , nearly a third of a 1.3 million population .
Iranians work everywhere in Dubai : in the financial sector and in the construction , transportation , and hospitality industries .
Daily flights connect Tehran and Dubai ( it ’s an hour and 40 minutes flying time ) , with 200 weekly flights between Iran and the United Arab Emirates , most of them to Dubai .
According to Iran ’s Consulate , a million Iranians pass through Dubai each year .
Some come for business .
Regime members and well - heeled loyalists are said to maintain luxurious weekend homes here .
Young people come to let their hair down , the women literally .
Roughly 60 percent of Iran ’s population is under 30 .
Not surprisingly , Dubai ’s bling offers a seductive break from the dreary and increasingly repressive life afforded under the Islamic Republic .
What do the Iranians I ’ve met think about current developments in their country ?
The first part of the answer is easy .
Those I ’ve met here loathe and despise the regime .
I could n’t find an exception .
A mother visiting from Isfahan and her daughter who now resides here recounted for me how the two quarreled last summer before the June 12 election .
In the face of her daughter ’s objections , the mother had contemplated casting her vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but not because she favors the current Iranian president .
On the contrary .
Her reasoning was :
Vote for the thug ; the situation has to become worse before it can become better .
By all accounts , the regime has made two big mistakes .
First , there was the fraud — or at least the widespread presumption of mass fraud — in June ’s election .
The regime ’s steadfast refusal to deal with public concern quickly led to public outrage .
I ’ve heard , time and again here , that the regime ’s brazen lying is an " insult , " an unforgivable " humiliation . "
Second , the viciousness with which the regime has cracked down on dissent has shocked people , including those who thought they could no longer be shocked .
The Iranians I ’ve met include a retired high school teacher , a musician , an engineer , several business executives , journalists , students , a lawyer , a dissident cleric , representatives from the travel and entertainment industries , two activists in the opposition " green movement , " a church pastor , and an architect .
In virtually every conversation I ’ve had , the given is that Iran is ruled by lunatics .
That ’s the simple part .
The other pieces of a rather complicated mosaic then start to fall into place .
A young miniskirt - clad woman from Tehran tells me her grandmother , a deeply religious woman , fears for the end of the regime .
As violent and corrupt as it is , she reasons , what comes after might not be Islamic , and that could be only worse .
Parts of Iran remain religious , traditional , and conservative .
How strong are these segments of Iranian society today ?
How would they respond to an attempt to transform Iranian theocracy to a Western - style democracy , if that is indeed what happens ?
It ’s not surprising that so many of the Iranians I ’ve spoken to — educated , professional , largely from urban centers — concede they ’re concerned by the prospect of another bloody revolution or a post - clerical moment that could lead to civil war .
As one young businessman told me , it ’s one thing to reject the regime , but no one wants Iran to look like Lebanon .
Cooperation between moderate secularists and religious Iranians is important now and will be crucial once the current regime eventually expires .
Religion is surely still a powerful factor in Iranian politics and society .
It ’s a force to reckon with .
So is nationalism .
It ’s closely related to the ambivalence many Iranians feel about the United States .
Another 20 - something woman from the Iranian capital , contemptuous in her views of the regime , was equally agitated about a potentially more assertive U.S. policy .
Dressed in fashionable jeans with long wavy hair and high heels , she wanted to know why the Americans always feel obliged to meddle .
" This is a matter between the Iranian government and the Iranian people , " she kept telling me , adding that if the United States attacked Iran , she would be proud to see her husband fight the invaders .
She may sound like a cliché , but one cannot escape the feeling that she represents something real and important .
Likewise , a gentleman in his 40s , a professional from Shiraz who ’s no fan of the regime either , sees America as a menacing military - industrial complex , interested in arms sales and oil but certainly not democracy for Iran .
Others — the clear majority I ’ve spoken with , in fact — have professed enthusiasm for the United States .
Many have been to the States ; some have plans to study or live there .
Whenever it comes to the question of whether the United States should support Iran ’s democracy movement , though , even the pro-Americans tend to agree on two opposing propositions : first , that U.S. assistance would be problematic , if not outright counterproductive ; second , that Iran ’s opposition wo n’t make it without outside support , notably from the United States .
History has made its mark .
The 1953 coup d’état engineered by Dwight Eisenhower ’s administration , which unseated an elected Iranian prime minister , and subsequent U.S. support for the shah created distrust that many Iranians have never been able to shake .
Today , it ’s hard to gauge precisely just how the mood inside the country is really evolving .
It ’s true the men in power have the guns and money .
The opposition movement still lacks a real leader .
Everyone confirms there ’s a dreadful lack of coordination , tactics , and strategy .
And the green movement has become a catchall for a variety of groups .
Some are desperate for political freedom .
Others are infuriated over the regime ’s mismanagement of the economy .
Still others think the ruling clerics have betrayed the revolution ’s religious values .
This movement ’s diversity is its challenge , its charm and potential strength .
Here in Dubai , there ’s no sign that the green movement is fading .
At the airport , one of my first impressions was a family coming through the arrivals hall .
The mother wore a bright green veil , the father a solid green T - shirt , their teenage son a green wristband .
At a Persian restaurant in central Dubai , I listened to a female singer who donned a bright green dress .
Our young Lebanese waiter volunteered :
It ’s probably her " call for freedom . "
Iranians here gather on beaches to talk politics , sometimes lighting candles .
The groups , often of 20 to 30 people , are invariably broken up by authorities or , even more troublingly , videotaped by Dubai ’s police and security services .
Still , these Iranians persist .
Predicting political change , let alone revolutions , is tricky business .
The United States got it spectacularly wrong in 1979 .
If you ’re looking for guideposts , the next big date to watch should be Feb. 11 , the revolution ’s anniversary .
Both sides are busy preparing .
The opposition promises a strong show of support in the streets , while Ahmadinejad has vowed to strike a harsh blow against " global arrogance " ( his term for the United States ) .
Meanwhile , his government is adding even more flights to Dubai .
The logic ?
Better to occupy the rabble - rousers with shopping across the gulf than to have them at home , crowding the streets with their slogans and shouts of discontent .
Eastern European communists tried similar techniques , pushing troublemakers into Western Europe .
It worked .
For a while .
Washington
Why should there be any significant opposition to the creation of an independent agency with strong powers of enforcement to protect consumers from exploitation by banks , mortgage companies , auto dealers and other purveyors of credit ?
The dragons lurking in the fine print of some credit agreements are enough to give you heart failure .
Payday loans , for example , typically carry annual interest rates in the vicinity of 400 percent .
Or look at the lineup of fees , penalties and interest rates on your credit cards and overdraft privileges .
Do n’t even start on mortgage abuses .
That would take too long , and it ’s too depressing .
We ’re talking here about exploitation run wild .
The Mob , which used to have a stranglehold on loan - sharking , can only look on with envy .
So I guess it ’s understandable that the financial industry and other big - money interests are all but hysterical in their opposition to the Consumer Financial Protection Agency that has been proposed by the Obama administration as part of its overall reform of financial regulations .
You ’d hardly expect the people rifling the pockets of middle - class Americans and the poor to be happy about an agency with oversight and enforcement authority homing in on their nefarious and wildly profitable activities .
Biofuel production in the US has met with fairly mixed success , as the cost and fossil fuel use of corn - based ethanol has severely cut into the benefits provided by avoiding the use of fossil fuels .
It 's been a somewhat different story in Brazil , which has embraced ethanol derived from sugarcane and seen more promising results .
The government has set aggressive targets for both ethanol and biodiesel production , but a study that will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science later this week urges caution : unless the goals are met through an integrated agricultural strategy , they 'll drive deforestation that will offset most of the benefits .
The study looked at the expansion of the two crops that are expected to drive biofuels growth in Brazil : sugarcane for ethanol , and soy beans for biodiesel .
To reach the country 's 2020 goals , there will have to be a major increase in the production of both of those crops .
Even assuming major increases in the efficiency of their production ( the authors assume an increase at double the rate of the past 20 years ) , there 's simply no way to get there without expanding the amount of land devoted to farming them , and there 's no way to do that without secondary consequences .
To examine the consequences , the authors built a linked model that incorporated Brazilian land use , an economic model of its agricultural economy , and a global agricultural and vegetation productivity model .
The model allowed them to determine both the direct land use changes caused by the focus on sugarcane and soy , as well as the indirect changes caused by the accompanying alterations in the Brazilian agricultural system .
They were also able to estimate a carbon payback time , the number of years that it would take before the carbon footprint of the land use changes were equal to the reduced carbon emissions from the transportation sector .
To reach Brazil 's 2020 targets , both crops would have to be radically expanded .
Sugarcane would need an extra 57,000 square kilometers devoted to growing it , while soybeans would need nearly 110,000 new square kilometers .
But those radical changes would n't require new land ; projecting the trends of recent years into the future , almost 90 percent of this expanded cropland would be placed on areas currently used for cattle .
Converting the rangeland to crops would have a minimal impact on the carbon sequestered there , so sugarcane would have a payback time of only four years .
Soy , which can't be converted to biofuels as efficiently , would require 35 years .
So far , not so bad .
Unfortunately , the cattle that were previously on that rangeland would n't simply disappear .
Instead , the authors project that over 160,000 square kilometers of native habitat ( over 120,000 of that forest ) would be converted into rangeland .
That process would liberate lots of carbon currently sequestered by those habitats .
As a result , with these indirect land use changes incorporated , the payback times recede into the future .
For sugarcane , the figure would be 44 years , while for soybeans it would be nearly 250 years .
There seems to be a reasonable chance that we wo n't be relying on internal combustion engines in 250 years .
Given how problematic soybeans are , the authors consider alternative crops , and find that the oil palm provides some significant improvements to those numbers .
Although the use of oil palms is associated with deforestation in many countries , it 's possible to convert rangelands to oil palm plantations with a minimal impact , and the the high efficiency of these plants means that relatively little land would be required : just 4,200 square kilometers , only about four percent of the land needed for soybeans .
The payback time for direct land use changes would only be seven years .
The researchers suggest that it might be possible to head off land use changes entirely , however .
They argue that certain aspects of Brazilian agricultural law promote ranching at a low cattle population density , and it may be possible to both increase that density and manage the rangeland in a way that limits the carbon emissions .
Under the oil palm scenario , the density of cattle would have to be increased by only 0.1 heads per hectare in order to eliminate indirect land use changes .
There are a lot of assumptions built in to this analysis , such as increased agricultural efficiency and continued growth of local agriculture , so the specifics should be interpreted cautiously .
Nevertheless , the general outlines of the findings highlight important issues : it 's easy for land - use changes to swamp the carbon impact of biofuel production , and any planning for biofuel production needs to consider them as part of the larger agricultural economy .
Those are lessons that have been appearing pretty consistently in studies that consider a variety of crops and countries .

Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama tore into the Republican opposition on Capitol Hill Wednesday , blaming the GOP for what he called politically motivated opposition on virtually every issue .
Democrats have been willing to incorporate Republican ideas on health care and other issues , he said , but Republicans have not been willing to do the same .
Addressing a gathering of Senate Democrats , Obama promised to " call ( Republicans ) out when ( Democrats ) extend a hand and get a fist in return . "
Several Democrats facing tough election fights this November were given time to ask the president questions on high - profile issues such as trade and deficit reduction .
Much of the president 's time , however , was used to lash out at GOP tactics .
Senate Republicans , he said , have tried to employ the filibuster more over the past year than in all of the 1950s and 1960s combined .
The GOP 's strategy has been " 20 years of obstruction packed into one , " he said .
" If you want to govern , you ca n't just say no , " he argued .
" It ca n't be about just scoring points . "
The filibuster , he added , only works as intended if there is a " genuine spirit of compromise . "
The president 's tough rhetoric was part of a more aggressive -- and frequently populist -- White House strategy in the wake of the Democrats ' recent upset loss in the Massachusetts Senate race .
GOP Sen.- elect Scott Brown 's victory stripped Democrats of their 60 - seat Senate supermajority and raised fears among many congressional Democrats about a potential GOP landslide in the upcoming midterm elections .
The Democratic answer to the Massachusetts Senate race should not be " to do nothing " in Congress , he said .
Nervous constituents want to see legislative progress , he asserted .
" We should do more , and we should do so without delay , " he said .
In recent days -- during a meeting with House Republicans in Maryland and in town hall forums in Florida and New Hampshire -- Obama has repeatedly offered to work with GOP leaders .
At the same time , he has been ratcheting up his own partisan rhetoric .
" By extending an olive branch to Republicans , the president appears to be attempting to appeal to independent voters who have flocked to the GOP over the past several months , " CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser said .
" But the president also needs to rally a deflated and angry Democratic base , which accounts in part for his tougher attacks against GOP leaders . "
Obama cited several examples of what he said was GOP legislative maneuvering motivated purely by political considerations .
Among other things , he raised the recent example of seven GOP senators who backed a bill establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission , but then turned against it when the proposal came to a vote .
He also noted that a large number of bills have been subjected to Republican - led filibusters , only to receive 85 or 90 votes once the filibuster is broken and the legislation is allowed to move to a final vote .
I 'm " not open to switches " solely " because it 's good short - term politics , " he said .
I wo n't tolerate an " if you lose , I win " mentality .
Obama urged Senate Democrats to stop listening to what he called politically oriented cable television shows on networks such as Fox News , CNN and MSNBC , and instead get out of the Washington " echo chamber . "
Most people " do n't care about majorities and minorities and process , " he said .
They just want to know if their elected representatives are " delivering for me . "
The president warned fellow Democrats that the public is often misinformed on key issues such as budget deficits .
Many constituents will cite foreign aid or legislative earmarks when discussing ways to reduce spending , he said , when in reality those items constitute a minuscule share of federal spending .
Balancing the budget while refusing to raise taxes and exempting entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare would require 60 percent cuts in virtually every other program , and " that 's just not going to happen , " he said .
Noting that Bill Clinton left office with budget surpluses , Obama asserted that Democrats " should have credibility " on the deficit issue .
But the party is " still haunted " by debates from the 1960s and ' 70s when the party was stuck with the " tax and spend " label , he said .

A Reut Institute presentation calls on Israel to “ attack catalysts ” — global peace and justice activists .
An extraordinary series of articles , reports and presentations by Israel ’s influential Reut Institute has identified the global movement for justice , equality and peace as an “ existential threat ” to Israel and called on the Israeli government to direct substantial resources to “ attack ” and possibly engage in criminal “ sabotage ” of this movement in what Reut believes are its various international “ hubs ” in London , Madrid , Toronto , the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond .
The Reut Institute ’s analyses hold that Israel ’s traditional strategic doctrine — which views threats to the state ’s existence in primarily military terms , to be met with a military response — is badly out of date .
Rather , what Israel faces today is a combined threat from a “ Resistance Network ” and a “ Delegitimization Network . ”
The Resistance Network is comprised of political and armed groups such as Hamas and Hizballah who “ rel[y ] on military means to sabotage every move directed at affecting separation between Israel and the Palestinians or securing a two - state solution ” ( “ The Delegitimization Challenge : Creating a Political Firewall , Reut Institute , 14 February 2010 ) .
Furthermore , the “ Resistance Network ” allegedly aims to cause Israel ’s political “ implosion ” — a la South Africa , East Germany or the Soviet Union — rather than bring about military defeat through direct confrontation on the battlefield .
The “ Delegitimization Network ” — which Reut Institute president and former Israeli government advisor Gidi Grinstein provocatively claims is in an “ unholy alliance ” with the Resistance Network — is made up of the broad , decentralized and informal movement of peace and justice , human rights , and BDS ( boycott , divestment and sanctions ) activists all over the world .
Its manifestations include protests against Israeli officials visiting universities , Israeli Apartheid Week , faith - based and trade union - based activism , and “ lawfare ” — the use of universal jurisdiction to bring legal accountability for alleged Israeli war criminals .
The Reut Institute even cited my speech to the student conference on BDS held at Hampshire College last November as a guide to how the “ delegitimization ” strategy supposedly works ( “ Eroding Israel ’s Legitimacy in the International Arena , ” Reut Institute , 28 January 2010 ) .
The combined “ attack ” from “ resisters ” and “ delegitimizers , ” Reut says , “ possesses strategic significance , and may develop into a comprehensive existential threat within a few years . ”
It further warns that a “ harbinger of such a threat would be the collapse of the two - state solution as an agreed framework for resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and the coalescence behind a ‘ one - state solution ’ as a new alternative framework . ”
At a basic level , Reut ’s analysis represents an advance over the most primitive and hitherto dominant layers of Israeli strategic thinking ; it reflects an understanding , as I put it in my speech at Hampshire , that “ Zionism simply cannot bomb , kidnap , assassinate , expel , demolish , settle and lie its way to legitimacy and acceptance . ”
But underlying the Reut Institute ’s analysis is a complete inability to disentangle cause and effect .
It seems to assume that the dramatic erosion in Israel ’s international standing since its wars on Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2009 is a result of the prowess of the “ delegitimization network ” to which it imputes wholly nefarious , devious and unwholesome goals — effectively the “ destruction of Israel . ”
It blames “ delegitimizers ” and “ resisters ” for frustrating the two - state solution but ignores Israel ’s relentless and ongoing settlement - building drive — supported by virtually every state organ — calculated and intended to make Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank impossible .
It never considers for a moment that the mounting criticism of Israel ’s actions might be justified , or that the growing ranks of people ready to commit their time and efforts to opposing Israel ’s actions are motivated by genuine outrage and a desire to see justice , equality and an end to bloodshed .
In other words , Israel is delegitimizing itself .
Reut does not recommend to the Israeli cabinet — which recently held a special session to hear a presentation of the think tank ’s findings — that Israel should actually change its behavior toward Palestinians and Lebanese .
It misses the point that apartheid South Africa also once faced a global “ delegitimization network ” but that this has now completely disappeared .
South Africa , however , still exists .
Once the cause motivating the movement disappeared — the rank injustice of formal apartheid — people packed up their signs and their BDS campaigns and went home .
Instead , Reut recommends to the Israeli government an aggressive and possibly criminal counter - offensive .
A powerpoint presentation Grinstein made to the recent Herzliya Conference on Israeli national security actually calls on Israel ’s “ intelligence agencies to focus ” on the named and unnamed “ hubs ” of the “ delegitimization network ” and to engage in “ attacking catalysts ” of this network .
In its “ The Delegitimization Challenge : Creating a Political Firewall ” document , Reut recommends that “ Israel should sabotage network catalysts . ”
The use of the word “ sabotage ” is particularly striking and should draw the attention of governments , law enforcement agencies and university officials concerned about the safety and welfare of their students and citizens .
The only definition of “ sabotage ” in United States law deems it to be an act of war on a par with treason , when carried out against the United States .
In addition , in common usage , the American Heritage Dictionary defines sabotage as “ Treacherous action to defeat or hinder a cause or an endeavor ; deliberate subversion . ”
It is difficult to think of a legitimate use of this term in a political or advocacy context .
At the very least , Reut seems to be calling for Israel ’s spy agencies to engage in covert activity to interfere with the exercise of legal free speech , association and advocacy rights in the United States , Canada and European Union countries , and possibly to cause harm to individuals and organizations .
These warnings of Israel ’s possible intent — especially in light of its long history of criminal activity on foreign soil — should not be taken lightly .
The Reut Institute , based in Tel Aviv , raises a significant amount of tax - exempt funds in the United States through a nonprofit arm called American Friends of the Reut Institute ( AFRI ) .
According to its public filings , AFRI sent almost $ 2 million to the Reut Institute in 2006 and 2007 .
In addition to a state - sponsored international “ sabotage ” campaign , Reut also recommends a “ soft ” policy .
This specifically involves better hasbara or state propaganda to greenwash Israel as a high - tech haven for environmental technologies and high culture — what it terms “ Brand Israel . ”
Other elements include “ maintain[ing ] thousands of personal relationships with political , cultural , media and security - related elites and influentials ” around the world , and “ harnessing Jewish and Israeli diaspora communities ” even more tightly to its cause .
It even emphasizes that Israel should use “ international aid ” to boost its image ( its perfunctory foray into earthquake - devastated Haiti was an example of this tactic ) .
What ties together all these strategies is that they are aimed at frustrating , delaying and distracting attention from the fundamental issue : that Israel — despite its claims to be a liberal and democratic state — is an ultranationalist ethnocracy that relies on the violent suppression of the most fundamental rights of millions of Palestinians , soon to be a demographic majority , to maintain the status quo .
There is no “ game changer ” in Reut ’s new strategy .
Reut is apparently unaware even of the irony of trying to reform “ Brand Israel ” as something cuddly , while at the same time publicly recommending that Israel ’s notorious spies “ sabotage ” peace groups on foreign soil .
But there are two lessons we must heed : Reut ’s analysis vindicates the effectiveness of the BDS strategy , and as Israeli elites increasingly fear for the long - term prospects of the Zionist project they are likely to be more ruthless , unscrupulous and desperate than ever .
Editor ’s note : Following publication of this article , the Reut Institute appears to have substantially altered one of the documents on its website which EI ’s article quotes ( “ The Delegitimization Challenge : Creating a Political Firewall ” ) .
Among other substantial changes , the Reut Institute removed references to “ sabotage ” and “ attack ” in an apparent attempt to sanitize the document following widespread publicity in the wake of EI ’s expose .
EI has therefore appended to this article a PDF copy of the original document which appeared on the Reut website before these alterations were made .

Alexandre Bilodeau , on his way to a gold medal on Sunday .
( ( Adrian Dennis / Getty Images ) )
Alexandre Bilodeau carved his way into Canadian history Sunday at the Vancouver Winter Olympics .
The 22 - year - old from Rosemère , Que. , became the first Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal at home , finishing first in the men 's moguls skiing final at Cypress Mountain .
No Canadians won gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal , and the country was shut out again at the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary .
Over 500 Canadian athletes had missed reaching the podium 's peak on home soil and Canada had been the only multiple Olympic host never to win gold at home .
Until Bilodeau .
" It 's just the beginning , I think , " Bilodeau said .
" There are so many Canadians coming up in the other sports . …
I 'll be in the stands cheering for them .
I do n't think I really realize it .
It 's too good to be true . "
Bilodeau 's gold follows the valiant silver - medal efforts of Jennifer Heil in the women 's moguls Saturday night .
Long - track speedskater Kristina Groves won bronze earlier in the day .
A suspenseful final
On his final run , Bilodeau stood high above a sea of red as the cheers of " Canada ! Canada ! " rose at Cypress Mountain .
Skiing second last in the finals , he needed a near - perfect run to knock off Australia 's Dale Begg - Smith , the reigning Olympic champion , who was in first place .
With his country 's hopes and prayers behind him , Bilodeau was ready .
On his 23.17 - second run into history , Bilodeau pulled off a perfect back - flip , knifed through the moguls and rocketed to the finish line .
His score of 26.76 points catapulted him into first place , pushing aside Begg - Smith , a Canadian ex-patriate who grew up in B.C .
Only Guilbault Colas of France stood a chance of dethroning him , skiing last after winning the qualifying round .
We held our breath , waiting for Colas 's score to come : 25.74 .
Bilodeau jumped , throwing his arms in the air , as the Cypress crowd roared .
Bilodeau 's older brother Frederic , who has cerebral palsy , soaked in the moment from the stands with other family members .
Through tears later , Bilodeau called his brother " my inspiration . "
On the podium , Begg - Smith , who won the silver , stared straight ahead frowning as the cameras flashed .
The wealthy internet entrepreneur marched past reporters after the competition but said en route : " I skied the way I wanted to ski . "
American Bryon Wilson claimed the bronze , narrowly edging out Canada 's Vincent Marquis , 25 , of Quebec City .
Pierre - Alexandre Rousseau of Drummondville , Que. , finished fifth .
The 30 - year - old was skiing in his first Olympics after 13 years with the national team , after a series of disappointments and injuries delayed his dream at the previous three Winter Games .
Maxime Gingras , 24 , of St - Hippolyte , Que. , rounded out an incredible Canadian performance , finishing 11th .

A consistent champion
Since his Olympic debut in 2006 , Bilodeau 's career has taken off .
He finished the 2005 - 06 season ranked second in the world and was named FIS rookie of the year .
The following season he finished No. 3 , and in 2007 - 08 he was No. 4 .
Last season , he exploded on the World Cup hills , winning five golds and three silvers in nine starts en route to the overall championship .
Coming into Sunday 's freestyle competition , Bilodeau was ranked fourth .
Bilodeau 's men's moguls gold is the first for a Canadian since Jean - Luc Brassard won at the Lillehammer Olympics in 1994 .
' The party 's just getting started '
As expected , the first gold medal ignited the spirit of Canada 's Olympians .
Many showed their support through Twitter .
" I 'm all about Bilodeau tonight .
That guy is a CAT !
It 's the first of many for Canada ! " wrote alpine skier Mike Janyk .
" 1st gold medal on Canadian soil .
Amazing !!
Lets keep getting those medals ! " wrote Jesse Lumsden , a Canadian bobsledder and CFL running back .
" It 's an amazing feeling to watch a fellow Canadian win gold !
Especially the first one , congrats Alex , " wrote alpine skier Ryan Semple .
But Canada 's newest hero said it best .
Asked what his victory meant for the nation , he replied : " The party 's just starting for Canada . "
Hey there , time traveller !

Winnipeg police say the recent collapse of the Hells Angels has created a toxic environment that has the city on the verge of a dangerous biker war .
" Tensions are extremely high ... violence is imminent , " a veteran Winnipeg police officer with extensive knowledge of the organized crime scene wrote last month in newly released court documents the Free Press obtained Monday .
Police explain in detail why they believe the relative calm of the past few months is about to be broken -- including evidence of gang members stockpiling weapons in preparation to take out their rival " by any means necessary . "
The document was used to obtain a search warrant for an East Kildonan home in which a loaded handgun was found hidden in a backyard last month .
Police say a pair of newly arrived gangs are at the centre of the brewing battle as they try to fill the " vacuum " created by a major undercover sting operation dubbed " Project Divide " that ended last December .
Police used a career criminal - turned secret agent to infiltrate the Hells Angels , resulting in the arrests of 34 high - ranking members and associates .
Police say every member of the Zig Zag Crew , the Hells Angels ' so - called puppet club , was put behind bars while only a handful of Hells Angels remain free .
With the demand for drugs as high as ever , the criminal underworld was thrown into turmoil .
Police say two major events this winter have set the stage for an ugly spring .
" The Rock Machine has been attempting to establish a foothold in the province of Manitoba due to the arrests in Divide .
Members of the Rock Machine have been capitalizing on the fact the Hells Angels members and supporters are low in number and have been ' flying ' their colours throughout the city of Winnipeg , enraging members of the Manitoba Hells Angels , " police wrote in their court affidavit .
The Rock Machine has a long history with the Hells Angels in Quebec , especially during the 1990s when dozens of gang members were killed .
But they are new to Winnipeg .
The Hells Angels responded quickly despite their diminished state , according to police .
Two longtime members of the gang assembled a new group in January to stand up to Rock Machine members trying to take over Winnipeg 's drug scene .
The Redlined Support Crew is comprised entirely of imposing young men who are free in the community and have previously shown their allegiance to the Hells Angels , at least informally .
The Redlined Support Crew made their first big impression in mid-January when they allegedly lured a Rock Machine member to an auto repair shop on St. Mary 's Road that has connections to the Hells Angels .
" He was attacked by several members of the Redlined Support Crew and suffered a vicious beating .
Two members of the Hells Angels were also present , " police wrote .
The victim was rushed to hospital in serious condition and required emergency surgery .
He has not been co-operative with police and the case remains under investigation with no charges laid .
" As a result of this altercation , members of the Hells Angels , Redlined Support Crew and Rock Machine have all armed themselves as retribution is expected from both sides , " police wrote .
" There is imminent violence being planned ... it is unknown at what time or place this violence could or would occur . "
Police used the search warrant they were granted to raid a home on Feb. 3 on Mighton Avenue .
Members of the heavily armed tactical support team found a loaded , nine - millimetre gun hidden under some snow in a dog run protected by a large , angry animal .
" The dog was going buck , " a Winnipeg Crown attorney told court last Friday at a bail hearing for the homeowner , Justin MacLeod .
MacLeod -- described by police as six feet tall and 300 pounds -- is allegedly one of the men the Hells Angels recruited for the Redlined Support Crew .
Police seized several items from inside his home , including a Redlined Winnipeg vest and tuque , a gold ring with the gang 's name on it and a framed picture of the Hells Angels Manitoba chapter , taken in British Columbia last summer .
MacLeod was charged with numerous weapons offences , along with his girlfriend and another man .
He had also been free on bail from a November 2009 arrest for an alleged sexual assault and forcible confinement of a woman who police say was forced to strip naked and dance for several hours during a party at another East Kildonan residence .
Police also claim MacLeod was one of the Redlined members who participated in the January attack on the Rock Machine member .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- China is planning high - speed rail networks in the next decade between China , Europe , the UK , Asia and India , with trains running at over 320 kph .
Train passengers will be able to travel to Beijing from London 's King 's Cross station in only two days .
Passengers boarding in London could travel to Singapore ( 10,800 km away ) via Beijing in only three days .
Wang Mengshu , a senior consultant on domestic railways in China , and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering , said their goal was for trains to be running almost as fast as planes .
The plans are for three networks .
One would connect London and Beijing , traveling via the Channel Tunnel , then continuing on to Singapore , while the second would include Malaysia , Burma , Vietnam , and Thailand .
The third would connect China to Russia , Germany and the European rail networks .
Wang said they hoped all three networks could be completed within the next ten years , and that negotiations have already started with 17 nations affected by the projected networks , which would be the biggest infrastructure project in history .
The rail networks would carry raw materials and other goods as well as passengers .
Wang said the idea first came from other countries , particularly India , that wanted high - speed trains and hoped to benefit from China ’s experience and technology .
China is rapidly expanding its own railway network , building almost 30,500 kilometers of tracks over the next five years , and connecting all major cities in China with high - speed railways .
The Harmony Express , the fastest train in the world , running at almost 400 kph , was unveiled last year to link Guangzhou and Wuhan .
The train uses Kawasaki and Siemens technology , but was built entirely in China .
Construction of the Asian network has already begun in the southern Yunnan province , and Burma is soon to start construction of its section of the network .
China has offered to pay for the Burmese section in return for Burma ’s rich lithium reserves .
Prospecting and survey work has already been done for the European network , and there is already an agreement for a high - speed rail link across Siberia .
The biggest issue in the project is money , which would be partly government money , partly bank loans , and the rest raised by the railways from private sector financing or the host countries .
Wang said they would prefer host countries to pay in natural resources , as the Burmese are doing , rather than through capital investment .

⚃ Rolling Dice with JS and Unicode ⚂
I recently discovered the unicode xscreensaver hack , and have had it running on my secondary monitor for the heck of it .
I found out that there are dice face symbols , and I was inspired to do something with them .
So , I made a simple Unicode - dice roller in JavaScript .
I know the same thing could be done in JS , but this way you can roll some numbers to paste into Twitter or something , if you feel like it .
Enter number of Dice to roll :
Result :
The code is extremely simple , calling Math. floor on the result of Math. random n times , then using a small table of the codepoints from U+2680 to U+2685 to build a string .

2 – New Urbanism – Can it include gardening ?
Yes , and not your garden variety gardening , either !
Wikipedia explains : “ The Garden city movement is an approach to urban planning that was founded in 1898 by Sir Ebenezer Howard in the United Kingdom .
Garden cities were intended to be planned , self - contained , communities surrounded by greenbelts , containing carefully balanced areas of residences , industry , and agriculture . ”

After lot of time spent to learn the cinelerra code , I want to move an other step on the opensource contribute .
I 'm started from tangolerra project made by Franco Iacomella and after an hard job with svg I made my personal mochup of Cinelerra called Cutiehd .
But when I started to work on the mochup of Cinelerra 2.1cv I tryed to enable again the support of font antialias ( xft ) , write a draft of Utf - 8 support , rewrite some parts of titler code and adapt the svg plugin from the Cinelerrasv by " Simeon Völkel " .
I know that these features can generate instability , so I decided to make a new package with it 's name and icon called Cinecutie , that can be consider more as " mochup " than a real " fork " .
In order to make possible the installation with cinelerra I had to rename not only name but also libraries and settings dir ( from ~/.bcast to ~/.ccutie ) .
Project home page :- http://akiradproject.net/cinecutie
Install Cinecutie in Ubuntu
First you need to download and install developer repository . deb file from here or using the following command .
This package detects your version of ubuntu , installs and keeps akirad repository updated .
wget -c http://akirad.cinelerra.org/pool/addakirad.deb
Install downloaded .deb package using the following command
sudo dpkg - i addakirad.deb
Now update the source list
sudo apt - get update
Install Cinecutie using the following command

Well , we knew the National Tea Party Convention this week was going to be a real festival of outrageous wingnuttery , but Tom Tancredo 's speech to kick things off will already be hard to top :
Tancredo : Every year , the liberal Dems and the RINO Republicans turned up the temperature ever so slightly .
It seemed after awhile that we'd all be boiled to death in a cauldron of the nanny state .
And then something really odd happened -- mostly because we do not have a civics literacy test before people can vote in this country .
[ Applause ]
People who cannot even spell the word " vote , " or say it in English -- [ applause ] -- put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House .
Name is Barack Hussein Obama .
It 's hard to say which was more disturbing : Tancredo's apparent call for reinstituting laws that , as John Byrne at Raw Story points out , were a fundamental component of Jim Crow in the post - Reconstruction South , or the massive round of applause he received for saying it .
( The New York Daily News has more on the literacy tests . )
Yes , these people really are nuts .
Witness , for instance , the applause Tancredo got for saying he was glad McCain lost -- because , after all , McCain was for " amnesty " too :
If McCain had been elected , the neocons would be writing flattering editorials in the Weekly Standard and the Wall Street Journal .
Congressman Gutierrez and President McCain would have been posing in the Rose Garden with big smiles as they received accolades from La Raza for having finally passed an amnesty .
Of course , most of the speech was just Tancredo channeling Glenn Beck .
( The boiled frog metaphor was the giveaway , along with the " committed socialist ideologue " bit .
As well as lines like this :
So the race for America is on , right now .
The President and his left - wing allies in Congress are going to look at every opportunity to destroy the Constitution before we have a chance to save it .
But as always with Tancredo -- as with his audience -- the real motivation comes down to defending white culture :
Some things we can deal with in just a political way -- which is , you know , by the votes we cast .
Other things will require a commitment to passing on our culture -- and we really do have one , you know , it is based on Judeo - Christian principles whether people like it or they do n't !
[ Applause ]
That 's who we are !
That is who we are !
And if you do n't like it , do n't come here !
And if you 're here and you do n't like it , go home !
Go someplace else !
As the editors at Imagine 2050 observed :
It is obvious that Beck and Tancredo are trying to push the issue of immigration to the forefront of the tea party movement , something that was explicitly clear during Tancredo ’s speech .
The acts that followed paled in comparison to Tancredo , who definitely stole the first night spotlight of the three day event .
Indeed .
If you thought the Tea Partiers went nuts at those town - hall forums on health care , wait till immigration reform is the issue .
It 's going to be very ugly .
Tom Tancredo , of course , will be leading the way , pitchfork in hand .
As Beijing restricts online dissent and Urumqi clamps down on separatists , Shanghai is cracking down on … ( wait for it ) … pajama - wearing in public .
The wearing of colorful , boldly - printed pajamas in public has been popular in the city for years , and well - documented on Flickr as well as National Geographic .
But with the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai just three months away , city officials have launched a public etiquette clampdown targeting the unseemly practice .
The South China Morning
Post reports that the city 's Qiba neigborhood " has mobilized neighborhood committee officials and volunteers since July to talk people out of the habit of wearing pajamas in public . "
The article also consults Chinese sociologist Zhang Jiehai , who says pajama - wearing in public began " as a matter of practicality because people lived in cramped conditions with no clear line between public space and private place . "

Alexei Morozov will carry Russian flag at the Olympics opening ceremony ( Photo © fhr.ru )
The captain of the Russian national team , Alexei Morozov , playing for Ak Bars Kazan in the KHL , will carry the Russian flag at the Olympics opening ceremony , says the official Russian Hockey Federation site .
“ I ’m very pleased to be entrusted with such an honor ” , said Morozov to Russian site sportbox .ru ( translation by RussianHockeyFans.com ) .
“ Hundreds of sportsmen will represent Russia at the Olympics and I was entrusted with the flag , which increases responsibility .
I wo n’t say that I was shocked by this news but rather pleasantly surprised . ”
Morozov became the second KHL player to carry his national flag at the Olympics ’ opening ceremony after Avangard Omsk ’s Jaromir Jagr , who will be the standard - bearer for the Czech Republic .
The ceremony will take place on February 12 .
JAKARTA , Indonesia 
A recently erected statue of President Obama as a 10 - year - old boy will be removed from a public park here , city officials said Friday , bowing to vociferous criticism on Facebook just a month before Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit Indonesia .
The statue will be relocated as soon as possible to an elementary school that Mr. Obama attended during the four years he spent here , the governor of Jakarta , Fauzi Bowo , told reporters .
In December , the city unveiled the 43 - inch - tall bronze statue in a park in Menteng , the neighborhood where Mr. Obama lived with his divorced mother and Indonesian stepfather in the late 1960s .
Financed by $ 10,000 from Mr. Obama ’s supporters here , it depicts the boy known at the time as Barry in shorts and a T - shirt , smiling as a butterfly lands on his left thumb .
But the statue of Mr. Obama  who successfully exploited the potential of social networking sites during the 2008 presidential campaign  soon became the target of intense ire of critics who said that Mr. Obama had done nothing for Indonesia and that the park should be reserved to honor an Indonesian .
NOW backs Stupak challenger
The National Organization for Women is throwing its backing to the Democrat mounting a primary challenge to Rep. Bart Stupak over his opposition to health care reform legislation .
NOW President Terry O'Neill told POLITICO her organization intended to mobilize its chapters in Michigan to support former Charlevoix County Commissioner Connie Saltonstall , who announced a challenge to Stupak last week as the congressman threatened to block a health care bill due to concerns about its language governing funding for abortion .

" Bart Stupak , colluding with the Catholic bishops , is trying to shut down women 's access to a very important form of health care , " O'Neill said Wednesday , describing Saltonstall as a potential ally on a host of issues .
" She will work with us to repeal the Hyde Amendment .
She will work to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act .
She supports the Equal Rights Amendment . "
O'Neill said defeating Stupak was her " highest priority , " along with supporting a challenger to Rep. Joe Pitts ( R - Pa. ) , who worked with Stupak to craft an amendment that would have imposed strict limits on abortion funding .
Announcing her campaign against Stupak last week , Saltonstall issued a statement saying she objected most strongly to Stupak 's willingness to scuttle his party 's proposed health care overhaul .
" I believe that he has a right to his personal , religious views , but to deprive his constituents of needed health care reform because of those views is reprehensible , " Saltonstall said .
SILICON VALLEY ( The Borowitz Report ) - A new social network is about to alter the playing field of the social media world , and it 's called PhoneBook .
According to its creators , who invented the network in their dorm room at Berkeley , PhoneBook is the game - changer that will leave Facebook , Twitter and even the much anticipated Google Buzz in a cloud of dust .
" With PhoneBook , you have a book that has a list of all your friends in the city , plus everyone else who lives there , " says Danny Fruber , one of PhoneBook 's creators .
" When you want to chat with a friend , you look them up in PhoneBook , and find their unique PhoneBook number , " Fruber explains .
" Then you enter that number into your phone and it connects you directly to them . "
Another breakout utility of PhoneBook allows the user to arrange face - to - face meetings with his or her friends at restaurants , bars , and other " places , " as Fruber calls them .
" You will be sitting right across from your friend and seeing them in 3 - D , " he said .
" It 's like Skype , only without the headset . "
PhoneBook will enable friends to play many games as well , such as charades , cards , and a game Fruber believes will be a breakout : Farm .
" In Farm , you have an actual farm where you raise real crops and livestock , " he says .
" It 's hard work , but it 's more fun than Mafia , where you actually get killed . "

Patch 1.05 for Titan Studios ' hit PlayStation Network game Fat Princess goes live today , bringing with it two new maps - Frost Bite and Candy Mountain - the latter of which is a land of sweets , and joy , and joyness .
Candy Mountain , Candy Mountain , fill me with sweet sugary goodness !
I can't imagine a more appropriate name for one of the two new maps coming free to Fat Princess with today 's patch .
It just seems like the sort of place a fat princess would hang out , does n't it ?

The new maps almost make up for the fact that the patch changes the level one area attack for ice mages from an attack that freezes enemies to one that merely slows them , as well as disabling online score saving for the Soccer map in order to keep people from gaining rank too easily .
All will be completely forgiven if the Candy Mountain map has a kidney - removing cave on it .

Hey , # focusonthefamily :
You were pulled because of hurtful wares , not deceptive advertising copy !
by Jeremy Hooper
These are direct quotes from the Focus on the Family website , which one can find by simply typing " homosexual " into the search box found on the organization 's main landing page :
" Focus on the Family is committed to the thousands of individuals who are ensnared by homosexuality but are desperately seeking a way out .
" [ Source ]
" Look beyond the " gay " or " lesbian " label to the whole person inside .
Rather than seeing your friend as a homosexual , think of him or her as a person with a homosexual problem .
" [ Source ]
" Truly , the homosexual movement has become a steamroller in nations around the world .
" [ Source ]
" Any nation that mocks the laws of God will ultimately fail .
It is inevitable .
And each of us is either part of the problem or a part of the solution .
" [ Source ]
" The best prevention of gender confusion remains a strong home life .
Homosexuality is much less likely to occur in the context of a loving home where parents are reasonably well - adjusted sexually themselves .
I do n't think it is necessary to react with paranoia even in this aberrant culture .
If parents provide a healthy , stable home life and do not interfere with the child 's appropriate sex role , homosexuality is highly unlikely to occur . " [ Source ]
" To those of you who are parents , I say , " Be aware ! "
Your children are being inundated with inaccurate — but enticing — messages about homosexuality .
Television , movies , music and an increasing number of public schools constantly reinforce the idea that " gay is good . "
Monitor the influences your children are receiving , and address the subject of homosexuality directly with them .
" [ Source ]
" Sexual orientation is complex because it develops over time .
We are born with the potential to have a healthy sexual orientation — towards the other sex — but because of sin , our sexual orientation may not develop as God intended .
This is where we need God 's power for healing and change .
" [ Source ]
" Finally , if homosexuality were genetically transmitted , it would be inevitable , immutable , irresistible , and untreatable .
Fortunately , it is not .
Prevention is effective .
Change is possible .
Hope is available .
And Christ is in the business of healing .
Here again , gay and lesbian organizations and the media have convinced the public that being homosexual is as predetermined as one 's race and that nothing can be done about it .
That is simply not true .
There are eight hundred known former gay and lesbian individuals today who have escaped from the homosexual lifestyle and found wholeness in their newfound heterosexuality .
" [ Source ]
" I head a division of Focus on the Family whose purpose is to introduce homosexuals to Jesus Christ and to offer a way out of the lifestyle that ensnares them .
We also provide hope , information and support to their friends and family members .
We have found that many homosexuals who seem so angry are actually desperate to escape , but have never been told that God loves them .
Many are intimidated from seeking a solution to their pain . " [ Source ]
" In addition to the ominous feeling that something is wrong , there are a number of telltale signs that your partner might be struggling with same - sex attraction or having a homosexual affair : [ FOF proceeds to list 14 " warning signs " ] [ Source ]
" Attempts to subjugate objective biblical truths to subjective human experiences lead men and women to accept lies .
Often those having a personal interest in the promulgation of pro-gay revisionist theology twist the plain teaching of Scripture to support and justify their behavior .
" [ Source ]
" The media , the rock music and film industries , universities , the judiciary , and now more commonly , Congress itself conspire to reposition homosexuality as just another normal lifestyle .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
" [ Source ]
" Homosexuality is a lonely and disillusioning way of life .
There is a reason why this behavior has been considered morally wrong throughout most of human history .
" [ Source ]
" Love is not enough to justify a relationship .
A married man can fall deeply in love with a woman other than his wife ; that will never sanctify adultery .
Likewise , love between two men or women cannot justify a homosexual relationship .
" [ Source ]
So why do we show you this ?
Well , because Focus on the Family is on an aggressive mission to deny that the NCAA had any credible reason for pulling an FOF banner ad from its website .
Staffers , led by head communications guy Gary Schneeberger , are acting like there was no cause , since the ad copy itself was benign and loving :
Gary Schneeberger , vice president of ministry communications at Focus on the Family , said he was “ befuddled ” by the NCAA ’s decision .
“ Have we really become a society where it ’s considered distasteful and controversial for a dad to hope the best for his son ? ” he said .
“ If so , we have a lot of soul - searching to do as a nation . ”
Steve Maegdlin , CEO of the CSK Strategic Marketing Group which produced the print ad , said there ’s no reason for it to be pulled .
“ There ’s no hidden message or hidden agenda in here , ” he said .
...
“ We said during the weeks of controversy before our Super Bowl commercial with the Tebows aired that – despite the charges of critics who had n’t even seen it – the spot was not political or divisive or hateful , ” Schneeberger added .
“ And , it was n’t .
The print ad now being protested is even more non-threatening – if that ’s possible .
It simply says , ‘ Focus on the Family is here to help you raise your kids , thrive in your marriages and tackle the challenge life throws your way . ’” NCAA Pulls the Plug on Focus Ad After Protest [ FoTF ]
But of course true to " pro-family " form , Schneeberger and company COMPLETELY IGNORE the product that they are selling !
The ad that was pulled led viewers directly to the FOF landing page .
It 's the same landing page where one who searches for information on the subject of homosexuality is greeted with comments like the above ( but a tiny fraction of the site 's unscientific homo - hostility , which we were able to assemble in less than twenty minutes ) .
Their product undeniably tells people that gays have a " problem " that needs " fixing , " regardless of how much they might wish to soften that before presenting it to the American public !
It 's one thing if FOF wants to defends its property .
But it 's COMPLETELY disingenuous of them to use the nice , sweet ad copy as a way of denying any wrongdoing .
It would be like McDonald 's denying that their food can make one obese , simply because their spokesmodels are attractive and their jingles catchy !
Your thoughts
As a kid going to a Baptist school from Pre-school all the way to graduation : I can say from experience that this organization caused more self - hate , self - deniel and extremely dangerous behavior for me than if someone could of just said , " Hey Jen , Ya know some people may not get it , but God loves you , just as much as he does them and we all make mistakes . "
That statement leaves it open for anyone to be wrong about anything yet still find common ground in humanity .
I 've healed from what they did to me , but man oh man , I do n't wish it on my worst enemy .

It is sad that some gay youth will grow up listening to this crap .
They make these claims based on the Bible and the testimonies of those with awful experiences in gay life .
" Love is not enough to justify a relationship . "
I did n't know I needed to justify any gay relationship I have to FOTF .
Posted by : KZ | Feb 26 , 2010 10:54:30 AM
Oh , these comments are just SICK !
Yet again , the Christians are trying to bombard society as a whole into believing that there is something ' wrong " with being gay , and that it should NOT be the treasured gift that it is , and that it has been for countless millennial !
Now , MY mission is to express to as many religious leaders , their communities , and to as MANY Gay people as possible that we MUST reclaim our once - powerful religious roles and esteem that society once viewed us as ...

A bookish revolt has erupted in the home of Margaret Atwood , Yann Martel and Michael Ondaatje .
A seemingly innocuous plan by Amazon to open a warehouse in Canada has tapped into political anxiety over protection of the country 's literary identity from its more powerful neighbour .
Booksellers in Canada are urging the Ottawa government to use sweeping cultural protectionist powers to block a proposal by the world 's biggest online bookshop to create its first physical presence north of the 49th parallel .
The issue has sparked a vigorous debate over cultural " insecurity " in Canadian media and legal circles .
And it poses a test for prime minister Stephen Harper 's avowed desire for free trade .
For the last eight years , Canadians have been able to buy books on a Canadian - focused Amazon website , Amazon.ca .
But the Seattle - based internet empire has been doing business through a loophole – by not employing anybody in Canada and using a contractor to ship orders across the border , it has avoided oversight under the 1985 Investment Canada Act , which allows ministerial scrutiny of foreign companies ' presence in the country .
This month , Amazon declared that it wanted to implant a footprint by creating a distribution centre in Canada .
The department of Canadian heritage stepped in , exercising its discretionary power for a formal review , " to determine if the investment by Amazon.com will be of net benefit to Canada " .
Nurturing talent
Inevitably , Canadian booksellers are vehemently opposed to Amazon , wary of a multinational competitor with deep pockets .
Stephen Cribar , president of the Canadian Booksellers Association , said independent bookshops did a great deal to nurture authors by holding literary readings and by giving prominence to local writers .
" The things independent booksellers are good at – supporting our communities , supporting local cultures – could be jeopardised , " said Cribar .
Under strict rules safeguarding Canadian content in radio , television and on bookshelves , there are no leading foreign book chains on Canadian high streets .
Only one locally owned retailer , Indigo , has anything approaching a national spread .
Cribar said that if the government caved in to Amazon , the landscape would change : " If they 're allowed to do this , it could open the doors to others .
We could see Barnes & Noble and Borders in Canada . "
Canadian literature has more than its fair share of talent .
The Ontario writer Alice Munro , 77 , won last year 's Man Booker International prize for her short stories of small - town life .
And Yann Martel won the 2002 Booker for his parable about a boy and a tiger on a lifeboat , Life of Pi . The Oscar - winning movie The English Patient was based on a book by Canada 's Michael Ondaatje .
Even the leader of the opposition , Michael Ignatieff , is an acclaimed writer .
Amazon argues that by selling Canadian books in 170 countries it is doing more than anyone to promote local work .
The company 's vice - president of global policy , Paul Misener , told Toronto 's Globe and Mail : " I do n't think anybody is doing anything near this to help disseminate Canadian cultural products generally . "
He added : " To claim that somehow a US - based company can't help Canadian culture is just proved wrong by the facts . "
It may seem a familiar spat of small retailers against a global behemoth .
But Canada 's desire to assert a distinct identity can be more acute than elsewhere .
Nearly nine out of 10 Canadians live within 100 miles of the US border , putting them a short drive away from the world 's dominant superpower .
There are 100 million crossings annually of the longest non-militarised frontier in the world .
In a newspaper column , one Canadian novelist , Roy MacSkimming , lamented that the encroachment of Amazon amounted to " Wal - Martization , the law of lowest - cost , lowest - common denominator . "
Andrew Cohen , president of a think - tank dedicated to Canadian identity , the Historica - Dominion Institute , says the issue goes to the heart of a long - standing disquiet in Canada over US influence that dates back long before a free trade pact signed between the two countries by the former prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1988 .
" Canada is insecure and it has been for years .
It 's easily explicable when you 're 33 million people sitting next to the world 's greatest cultural machine , " said Cohen , who says his compatriots tend explicitly to stress anything that sets them apart form the US .
" We look for the narcissism of small difference .
We 've made a whole industry of pointing out ways in which we 're different from the US . "
Borders blocked
Canada 's government has intervened before to block cross - border cultural deals .
In 1996 , an effort by Heather Reisman , founder of the book chain Indigo , to strike a deal with the US firm Borders was blocked .
And strict rules limit foreign ownership of Canadian newspapers and television stations , complicating efforts to restructure the country 's biggest news publisher , Canwest , which is in bankruptcy .
But the country 's conservative administration has a free - trade instinct .
In this month 's throne speech , which outlines the government 's legislative programme , the Harper administration announced it wanted to allow foreign ownership of telecoms and satellite companies .
And Ottawa kicked up a huge stink against protectionism last year when the Obama administration inserted " Buy America " provisions decreeing that public works funded by its $ 787bn ( £ 528 bn ) economic stimulus package should favour US contractors over foreigners .
The fact that Amazon has been doing business in Canada for eight years without a physical presence raises questions of whether protectionism between neighbouring nations is even practical in the digital era .
Jeffrey Brown , a competition expert at the Ottawa law firm Stikeman Elliott , said : " The government 's policy in the past has been fairly restrictive when it comes to cultural industries .
Is this going to be precedential in nature ?
It could be , although it 's a bit of a special case . "
If Amazon gets the green light , Brown suggests , there could be " undertakings " attached to ensure the bookseller does its part in promoting Canadian talent .
He said : " I know it looks a bit mysterious to the rest of the world but Canada has a population of about 33 million and probably about three quarters of us are English speaking .
Most of us share a common language with the US , which is a cultural superpower in the world , and when you 're right on the doorstep , there can be a perception that your culture is under threat " .

Yikes !
Not only does it hurt to have to do so much work , but this stress then carries over into other aspects of our life .
Thankfully there some strategies we can take to combat with a busy work schedule and still maintain sanity .
A. Re-think what counts Sometimes work overload is really just a figment of our imagination .
In actuality we may not have that much to do after a bit of re-scheduling , holding off , or cutting down on our to - do list .
Find some things you can put off until next week .
Also see if you can identify any tasks that you can just forget about completely .
Often , “ busy - ness ” is something we only subject ourselves too when we do n’t take the proper time to re-think what really counts .
Learn to treasure a bit of minimalism , it ’ll help you preserve energy for the more important stuff .
B . Take a siesta or two As I mention in my one article , “ reflection has shown to increase learning , memory , and other cognitive abilities .
The more employers apply these revolutionary findings to the workplace the quicker we can move to what I hope to be a more enlightened age for modern capitalism .
C. Dedicate 10 - 15 minutes toward fitness OK , we get it – you are “ just too busy ” to go to the gym .
But fitness can be achieved anywhere as long as you have the creativity and dedication to integrate it into your routine .
Try taking short breaks and do some push - ups and sit-ups in your office .
By doing this you are taking your mind off of your latest assignment and rejuvenating your mental health .
Taking an active approach to personal fitness is a great way to channel your stresses and at the same time boost your stamina throughout the day .
CEOs take note : one article here illustrates how fitness in the workplace helps increase productivity by boosting employee self - confidence and company morale .
“ Those who think they have no time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness . ”
– Edward Stanley
D. Remember the importance of leisure
Leisure is anytime you are actively engaged in something of pleasure .
Without the highs we would certainly have greater difficulty bearing the lows ; leisure it is what makes life live - able .
So , if you do n’t already , find yourself some hobbies that really spark your interest and curiosity – something that energizes you and reminds you that there is a good life .
And no matter how down or stressed out you may become there are always these one or two things available to lighten your mood .
E. Highlight what you like about your job
Most of us never achieved our childhood dream jobs .
That is part of why the jobs we have can be so stressful and overbearing .
But there is a mental thing you can do to learn to love your job more .
First , make note of the aspects of your job that you do enjoy .
That change in focus can help facilitate your workday , and the more you can learn to love , the easier time you will have .
I am not asking you to be delusional and all - smiles as you walk through the office , but to make the best out of what is , and learn the importance of a positive attitude .
Rather than going into your day thinking , “ Oh no , not another Monday , ” instead think , “ This will be a fun and productive day . ”
What you are creating is a self - fulfilling prophecy – where your expectations affect your behaviors , and in return those behaviors elicit outcomes where your expectations actually come true .
This phenomena has shown support in psychology ever since Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson published a study in 1968 .
It showed that when teachers have high expectations for students ( even when based on false information ) it leads to those students actually performing better on their IQ tests .
Never underestimate the importance of your attitude and beliefs .
F . As a last resort : say “ fuck it all ” and take a day off
I would be lying to you if I did n’t include the age old “ fuck it all ” strategy .
Of course it is a last resort , but sometimes it is necessary .
I ’ve done it myself during busy times of the year where I just need that extra day off to gather up my strength .
Work is important , but it is not worth selling your soul for .
The times where you feel most exhausted and overtaxed are the best times to stay at home and re-build yourself .
But , I do n’t recommend skipping out on days where you have an important business meeting or days when a big project is due – you have to use your own best judgment .
Do n’t do something that will get you fired .
Stay updated on new articles and resources in psychology and self improvement :
Enlarge By David Coates , The Detroit News via AP Kwame Kilpatrick appeared in court for a Dec. 9 restitution hearing .
DETROIT  Most restitution hearings are over in hours .
Then again , most restitution hearings do n't involve former Detroit mayors with million - dollar restitution tabs .
After seven days of testimony and legal arguments that stretched over months , a judge 's ruling this week will reveal the fate of former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his progress in paying restitution to the city of Detroit as part of a deal to end a criminal case stemming from a 2008 text - message scandal .
A Detroit Free Press analysis of Wayne County Circuit Judge David Groner 's orders found that although Kilpatrick did make required restitution payments , he did not disclose the finances of his wife , Carlita , or provide copies of leases on the two homes his family has rented since their move to Southlake , Texas .
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy filed a motion last week asking the judge to find Kilpatrick in violation of the terms of his probation for hiding assets and failing to pay as much as he should on a monthly basis .
Groner is scheduled to rule Wednesday .
" This is longer than some jury trials , " Groner said on Dec. 8 , " way longer . "
Defense lawyer Michael Alan Schwartz contended his client is being singled out .
" Unfortunately , they want this man so destroyed that he will not be able to go on with his life , " Schwartz said .
Worthy said the special attention given to Kilpatrick stems from his own behavior : leasing pricy vehicles , renting limousines , living in a mini-mansion .
In any given year , as Wayne County Circuit Court figures suggest , courts collect just about 10 % of restitution .
Worthy said her office needs to improve how it handles many aspects of restitution .
One thing that she says wo n't change is the level of attention she 's devoting to the biggest restitution case she has .
" He owes a lot of money .
He has access to it , " she said .
" We have to make sure it gets done . "

Still the fastest airplane ever flown , the North American X - 15 earned its title 40 years ago , when on October 3 , 1967 Air Force Major William “ Pete ” Knight flew the rocket - powered aircraft to 4,520 mph , Mach 6.72 .
It was built to find out how aircraft structures , materials , and control surfaces would perform at hypersonic speeds and very high altitudes .
In 199 research flights , the X - 15 provided that information and more .
The program has been acknowledged as the most successful flight research program in history , and it helped make human spaceflight possible .
X - 15 flights were short ; each lasted about ten minutes .
So that the rocketplane could use all its fuel for acceleration , it was carried beneath the wing of a NASA B - 52 to 45,000 feet , where it was dropped .
NASA test pilot Milt Thompson remembered the experience in his book At the Edge of Space : “ [ The launch ] was a surprise no matter how many times I went through it .
It felt as if the X - 15 exploded off the hooks . …
“ The pilot did not have much time to waste after launch .
He either had to get the engine lit or abort the flight and make a landing at the launch lake .
The problem was that he was losing altitude rapidly ( about 12,000 feet per minute ) while waiting for the engine to light . ”
Joe Walker reached 354,200 feet , an altitude not exceeded until 2004 , when Brian Binnie reached 367,442 feet in SpaceShipOne .
The pilots would aim for an altitude but were rarely able to predict exactly how high they would end up .
The X - 15 climbed at 4,000 feet per second , so if the pilot was even one second late ( or early ) in shutting down the engine , he would miss the mark by 4,000 feet .
The powered portion of an X - 15 flight lasted approximately 85 seconds .
Each mission ended in an unpowered landing after a steep descent .
The pilots flew a low - lift glide that helped develop the energy management techniques space shuttle pilots would use many years later .
Only one X - 15 pilot did not make it back for a landing .
Air Force Major Michael Adams was killed in 1967 when the aircraft broke apart in a hypersonic spin shortly after reentry .
The program ended the following year .
You might think that robots are strictly a 20th century invention , but you'd be sorely mistaken :
At the same time that the human race thought stomach aches were just tiny , enchanted dwarfs casting hunger spells , a few brilliant souls ( possibly aliens ) were actually building full functional robots .
So maybe they 're not R2D2 caliber , but who are we to judge ?
They built friggin ' robots before there was toilet paper !

Car fire raises safety concerns for Tata Motors
MUMBAI , India —
When it was launched less than a year ago , the $ 2,500 Tata Nano was promoted as a safe , ultra - cheap car for poor Indians , an alternative to the motorbikes that zoom precariously around the country .
New questions about the safety of the pint - sized auto are being raised , however , after one of them burst into flames Sunday as it was being driven home from the showroom .
Software engineer Satish Sawant , his wife and 5 - year - old son escaped from the silver Tata Nano — which still bore a celebratory garland of marigolds on the front hood — before the tiny car was engulfed by fire .
A chauffeur initially was at the wheel , but Sawant said he had taken over driving before the fire broke out .
Tata has offered Sawant a replacement Nano or a refund .
“ My wife now does n’t want to buy any car , ” Sawant said by phone from his home in northern Mumbai on Thursday .
“ She does n’t even want to go for a Mercedes . ”
His ordeal showed just the latest problem with the low - cost Nano as Tata Motors sets its sights on global expansion and aims to ramp up production of the car with a new factory next month .
Tata Motors spokesman Debasis Ray said the company is investigating the cause of the fire .
Although Ray said the automaker believed it was “ a one - off , stray incident , ” he also said he did not know how the blaze began .
“ It did catch fire .
We ’re trying to figure out what may have caused it , ” Ray said .
Last fall , three customers in India complained that their Nanos started smoking , but Ray said Thursday the incidents are not related to this week ’s fire .
Tata Motors attributed those to a faulty electrical switch and said it had changed suppliers and done additional tests to rule out a recall or redesign .
The switch problem , he said , “ has been comprehensively addressed . ”
“ Safety has never been an issue with Tata cars , ” Ray added .
“ They are one of the safest cars on Indian roads . ”
The Nano has gotten rave reviews and awards , but some say the smoke and fire problems are symptomatic of pervasive quality control issues at India ’s No. 3 carmaker .
The Nano was meant to bring automobile ownership to the impoverished masses — first in India but eventually around the world — by offering a safe car to people who could n’t otherwise afford one .
Ratan Tata , who heads the Tata Group empire , has said he conceived of the idea for a “ people ’s car ” after seeing entire families crammed precariously on motorbikes .
He decided they deserved a safer , all - weather transport option .
The four - seater can travel up to 65 mph ( 105 kph ) and gets 55.5 miles to the gallon ( 23.6 kilometers per liter ) .
The Nano does not have air bags or antilock brakes — neither of which is required in India — and air conditioning and power windows are extra .
It has as few moving parts as possible .
There ’s only one windshield wiper , one side mirror and the headrests are n’t adjustable .
The dinner - plate - sized wheels have three bolts rather than four .
The tiny trunk does n’t open ; you access it from the inside , behind the rear seats .
There are four gears , plus reverse .
The dashboard of the base model has only a speedometer , an odometer and a fuel gauge .
Tata Motors , which also owns Jaguar and Land Rover , plans to start selling versions of the Nano in Europe in 2011 , and later in the U.S .
“ As of today , is Tata good enough to take on the world ?
I would say no , ” said Deepesh Rathore , an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in New Delhi .
“ On quality standards , Tata barely makes the cut . ”
There are fewer than 30,000 Nanos on the road today , which means that on a percentage basis , the problem rate is fairly high , he said .
“ The Nano is a wonderful product , but these incidents really tarnish the image of the car as well as the company , ” Rathore said .
“ This is the time for Tata to have a deep look at quality . ”
He said the company recently made a step in the right direction , hiring Carl - Peter Forster , former head of General Motors in Europe , as group chief executive .
“ They ’ve got a guy running the show now who knows how the industry should work , ” he said .
“ How soon will the effects be seen across the Tata product range ?
Well , that will take time . ”
THE competence of diligent dads helping out at home is damaging the self - esteem of " super- mums " who feel caught between work and traditional child - rearing roles , according to a new study .
According to a LiveScience report , the University of Texas at Austin interviewed 78 dual - earner couples who had eight - month - old infants , measuring them on two types of self - esteem - self - liking and self - competence .
Researchers asked the parents to talk about their partner 's strengths and weaknesses and rated their responses .
They found that among mothers who thought their partners were competent caregivers , the more time those fathers spent alone with their children , the lower the mother 's self - competence rating was .
" In American society , women are expected to take a main role in parenting despite increasingly egalitarian sex roles , " study researcher Takayuki Sasaki said .
" Thus , we believe that employed mothers suffer from self - competence losses when their husbands are involved and skillful because those mothers may consider that it is a failure to fulfil cultural expectations .
" Husbands do not suffer from self - competence losses even when their wives are involved and skillful because that is consistent with cultural expectations . "
Not surprisingly , mothers were found to spend nearly three times as much time child - rearing by themselves as their husbands did .
And this was noticed by husbands who gave their wives top marks in parenting skills .
In contrast they got a much lower rating from the mothers but even so , the women often said their husbands were good parents .
" Many wives would say care - giving by their husbands is helpful but at the same time wives give their husbands negative feedback because their husbands ' care - giving style is different from their own , " Ms Sasaki told LiveScience .
" For example , a wife appreciates when her husband feeds their baby but also tells her husband that after all it makes more work because the way the husband feeds is messy . "
MONTREAL - New wireless player Public Mobile will launch in Toronto and Montreal in mid-May , offering unlimited talk and text for $ 40 a month .
Public Mobile announced Thursday it has 15 stores now open in Toronto and 10 in Montreal selling cellphones .
“ We 're excited of offer unlimited talk and text and we want people to have the chance to use our service as soon as it's available , ” CEO Alek Krstajic said in a news release .
Krstajic says he expects Public Mobile to have twice the number of locations open by mid-May when the service is up and running in both cities .
He said customers who buy their phones now will be easily able to activate them when service begins in two months .
Public Mobile is one of several new entrants into the wireless business , now dominated by Rogers ( TSX : RCI.B ) , Bell ( TSX : BCE ) and Telus ( TSX:T ) .
New player Wind Mobile launched in December and it's been estimated it has attracted only about 30,000 subscribers .
Public Mobile is aiming at basic talk and text services with no contract and is looking to attract Canadians who do n't already own cellphones .
Deloitte Canada technology analyst Duncan Stewart said once Public Mobile attracts these untapped customers , it still has to find ways to further grow its business .
Stewart said Wind Mobile 's experience has shown that it's not always easy to attract customers even when offering no contracts and subsidies for cellphones .
“ We 've turned into a no-money down culture in North America , ” said Stewart , director of research in technology , media and telecommunications .
“ In North America we are subsidy - a - holics . ”
Stewart said consumers routinely say they do n't want contracts for their cellphones but they also do n't like to pay the full cost of the phone in order to avoid having contracts .

Wireless carriers typically subsidize phones , often several hundred dollars , and consumers then sign three - year contracts in order to have mobile phones be less expensive .
In most other parts of the world , people pay month - to - month for their cellphones and do n't have contracts .
Residents of the Arab village of Maghar are mourning the murder of local IDF soldier Ihab Khatib Wednesday , and stressing that they will continue to serve the state loyally despite discrimination against them .
Terror in West Bank Soldier killed in West Bank knife attack Efrat Weiss IDF soldier sitting inside jeep near Tapuach Junction stabbed twice in chest by Palestinian ; Assailant apprehended after onlooker runs him over with car .
Terrorist reportedly served as senior officer in Palestinian security forces Soldier killed in West Bank knife attack
Sergeant - Major Ihab Khatib , 28 , from the Kfir Brigade , was knifed to death at the Tapuach junction in the West Bank earlier Wednesday .
The killer , who was nabbed at the scene , served as a senior Palestinian security officer .
Many residents arrived at the Khatib family home to comfort the parents .
" Our village has sadly ' contributed ' many soldiers to the security of the State of Israel , " one of the visitors said .
" Even if there are disagreements among us , and despite the instances of discrimination and oppression , we will all continue to enlist and contribute to the country in which we live , and for whose continued existence we pray . "
3rd tragedy for family
The tragedy that befell the Khatib family was the third of its kind within the past few years .
Ten years ago Ihab 's uncle , an IDF officer , was killed during an operation in the Jordan Valley .
Four years ago , during the Second Lebanon War , his aunt died when a Katyusha rocket hit her home in Maghar , located in the eastern Galilee region .
Saliman Khatib , Ihab 's uncle , told
Ynet the family had learned of the attack early on , but the victim 's identity was only revealed to them later on .
" Ihab was a golden boy , very modest , who knew how to contribute to the army as well as to his family , " he said .
" This is a huge tragedy and very difficult to digest . "
The soldier is survived by his parents , two brothers , and three sisters .
His funeral has not yet been scheduled , but it is expected to take place tomorrow at the military cemetery in the village .

Felipe Massa has revealed that he will be striving to go one better than his did in 2008 and claim the Formula One world championship title should the 2010 Ferrari allow him to be competitive .
The claim is a remarkable one given that the Brazilian suffered a serious head injury during qualifying at last season 's Hungarian Grand Prix , but he insists that he feels as healthy as ever , and buoyed by the support he has received from the Scuderia since Budapest .
" It 's great to be back here year after year - this is the best possible way to start the season , absolutely unique , working and having fun , " he told the media at Ferrari 's annual Wroom event in Madonna di Campiglio , before going on to discuss his recovery and the road ahead .
" After the accident , I never thought I had to stop racing .
I was convinced that I could be back on the track already in Valencia , " he continued , " The accident has n't changed anything in my work approach and in my way of thinking .
Because I had to cope with so many difficulties in my life , I always learned a lot .
" I always had lots of support from Ferrari , from when I started racing for this team , but the strength and the availability they showed after my accident was really incredible .
I knew that I could count on them , but what they gave me was really exceptional . "
Massa 's return to fitness was ' interrupted ' by the arrival of his son but , asked if his life has changed now that he was a father , the Brazilian insisted that he remained as focused as ever on the job of winning the championship .
" The arrival of my son made my life very special , but I have n't changed the way I 'm living the races , " he claimed , " When I sit behind the wheel , I do n't think about my family .
It is only when I come back to the garage that I remember that I 'm a dad now .

Barack Obama in an interivew with the New York Times - April 2009
During last night 's podcast with Mark Stepneski , we spent a long time talking about the defensive issues the Stars have had this season and whether it's a result of the players or the system .
While we all wanted Matt Niskanen and Trevor Daley to play up to their potential under Marc Crawford and Charlie Huddy 's offensive - friendly system , the reality is that neither have produced anywhere near the amount of offense this team needs .
The fact that both have been shaky on defense has n't helped either .
Yet now the Stars are facing a serious issue with scoring balance among the forwards , and it could trigger a temporary philosophy change for Marc Crawford and his offensive schemes .
How the loss of Mike Ribeiro for a minimum of 19 games will ultimately affect the Dallas Stars remains to be seen .
While you certainly do n't want to bring up " luck " when discussing such a serious injury , there 's no doubt that the Stars benefited from the timing of the injury ; over half of Ribeiro 's supposed recovery time will come during the Olympic break .
There 's a chance that Ribeiro misses more than the 4 - 6 week window that is planned , yet right now it looks as if Ribeiro will return to the ice right after the Olympic Break , including an extra week to recover during the break .
The issue is that by the time the Stars get their # 2 center back , the season could well be over .
Currently the Stars sit 4 points behind Los Angeles for the 8th position in the West .
It is far from an impossible task for the Stars to not only keep pace with the playoff field while Ribeiro is out but to also gain ground , but is anyone convinced that this team can rely on goaltending and defense can carry them until Ribeiro returns ?
On Sunday night , Marc Crawford put James
Neal back on the top line with Brad Richards and suddenly the Stars became a one - line team .
Neal , Eriksson and Richards represent the top three scorers on the Stars and it's not even contest when you take Ribeiro out of the equation .
Brenden Morrow is fourth among the forwards ( excluding Ribeiro ) with 27 points and after him there is a steep , steep dropoff for production from the Stars forwards .
Jamie Benn has 21 points , Mike Modano has 15 and Steve Ott has 13 , all in over 30 games played .
Yet it 's the 12 points from Tom Wandell that is most concerning .
With Marc Crawford returning
Neal to the top line , Wandell is being asked to not only be the team 's second center but to also be the catalyst for secondary scoring .
While we are all impressed with Wandell 's play lately , he does not have the experience nor the track record to show that he has the ability to produce at the level of a top - six center .
With the top line loaded up with the best offensive players , it 's obvious that Crawford is hoping that a line that frequently dominates can continue to provide the majority of the team 's offense while relying on the rest of the team to not fall apart defensively .
If the game against Columbus was any indication , that plan is severely flawed .
The Stars were not only shutout , but were grossly outshot in the game .
The Stars allowed 41 shots while barely mustering 25 themselves , and a good number of those came in a late - minute flurry .
With the Stars playing on the road , opposing coaches have the advantage of being able to get the last change , ensuring they get favorable matchups .
Ken Hitchcock exploited this all game long .
While James Neal was certainly electrifying at times , the top line produced no points and the rest of the Stars lineup was scrambling for a good part of the game .
So with Ribeiro out and the Stars struggling to find some way to get scoring from secondary sources , the questions becomes whether the Stars should continue to front load their lines or try and spread it out .
There are certainly pros and cons to this ( James Neal has yet to show he can consistently produce when not playing with Richards ) .
If the Stars are unable to get goals from the top line , and the second and third lines are allowing a high number shots , then obviously something needs to change .
If Tom Wandell and even Mike Modano were able to spark any sort of production , then the question becomes moot .
But as
What would you have the Stars do ?
Should Crawford stick with the Brad Richards line that has been so succesful all season , hoping he can overwhelm the opposition ?
Or should he spread the offense out , and rely on Tom Wandell and Mike Modano to try and spark the offense as well ?
[ Python - Dev ] Proposal for virtualenv functionality in Python
This is a proto- proposal for including some functionality from virtualenv in Python itself .
I 'm not entirely confident about what I 'm proposing , so it 's not really PEP - ready , but I wanted to get feedback ...
First , a bit about how virtualenv works ( this will use Linux conventions ; Windows and some Mac installations are slightly different ) : * Let 's say you are creating an environment in ~/env / * /usr / bin/ python is * copied * to ~/env/bin/ python *
This alone sets sys.prefix to ~ /env/ ( via existing code in Python ) *
At this point things are broken because the standard library is not available * virtualenv creates ~/ env/lib / pythonX.Y / site.py , which adds the system standard library location ( /usr/lib/pythonX.Y ) to sys.path * site .py itself requires several modules to work , and each of these modules ( from a pre-determined list of modules ) is symlinked over from the standard library into ~/ env/lib / pythonX.Y / * site .py may or may not add / usr / lib / pythonX.Y / site - packages to sys.path * * Any * time you use ~ / env / bin / python you 'll get sys.prefix of ~ /env / , and the appropriate path .
No environmental variable is required .
*
No compiler is used ; this is a fairly light tool
There are some tweaks to this that could be made , but I believe virtualenv basically does things The Right Way .
By setting sys.prefix All Tools Work ( there are some virtualenv alternatives that do isolation without setting sys.prefix , but they typically break more often than virtualenv , or only support a limited number of workflows ) .
Also by using a distinct interpreter ( ~/env/bin / python ) it works fairly consistently and reliably compared to techniques like an environmental variable .
The one serious alternative is what buildout ( and virtualenv -- relocatable ) does , which is to use the system Python and change the path at the beginning of all scripts ( it requires its own installer to accomplish this consistently ) .
But virtualenv is kind of a hack , and I believe with a little support from Python this could be avoided .
virtualenv can continue to exist to support the equivalent workflows on earlier versions of Python , but it would not exist ( or would become much much simpler ) on further Python versions .
The specific parts of virtualenv that are a hack that I would like to replace with built - in functionality : * I 'd rather ~ / env / bin / python be a symlink instead of copying it .
* I 'd rather not copy ( or symlink ) * any* of the standard library .
* I 'd rather site .py support this functionality natively ( and in turn that OS packagers support this when they make other modifications ) *
Compiling extensions can be tricky because code may not find headers ( because they are installed in /usr , not ~/env / ) .
I think this can be handled better if virtualenv is slightly less intrusive , or distutils is patched , or generally tools are more aware of this layout .
*
This gets more complicated with a Mac framework build of Python , and hopefully those hacks could go away too .
I am not sure what the best way to do this is , but I will offer at least one suggestion ( other suggestions welcome ) :
In my ( proto - ) proposal , a new binary pythonv is created .
This is slightly like pythonw.exe , which provides a Python interpreter on Windows which does n't open a new window .
This binary is primarily for creating new environments .
It does n't even need to be on $ PATH , so it would be largely invisible to people unless they use it .
If you symlink pythonv to a new location , it will effect sys.prefix ( currently sys.prefix is calculated after dereferencing the symlink ) .
Additionally , the binary will look for a configuration file .
I 'm not sure where this file should go ; perhaps directly alongside the binary , or in some location based on sys.prefix .
The configuration file would be a simple set of assignments ; some I might imagine : * Maybe override sys.prefix * Control if the global site - packages is placed on sys.path *
On some operating systems there are other locations for packages installed with the system packager ; probably these should be possible to enable or disable * Maybe control installations or point to a file like distutils.cfg I got some feedback from the Debian / Ubuntu maintainer that he would like functionality that might be like this ; for instance , if you have /usr / bin / python2.6 and /usr / bin / python2.6 - dbg , he 'd like them to work slightly different ( e.g. , /usr / bin / python2.6 - dbg would look in a different place for libraries ) .
So the configuration file location should be based on sys. prefix * and* the name of the binary itself ( e.g. , /usr/lib/python2.6/python-config-dbg.conf ) .
I have no strong opinion on the location of the file itself , only that it can be specific to the directory and name of the interpreter .
In addition to all this , I think sys would grow another prefixy value , e.g. , sys.build_prefix , that points to the place where Python was actually built ( virtualenv calls this sys.real_prefix , but that 's not a very good name ) .
Some code , especially in distutils , might need to be aware of this to compile extensions properly ( we can be somewhat aware of these cases by looking at places where virtualenv already has problems compiling extensions ) .
Some people have argued for something like sys.prefixes , a list of locations you might look at , which would allow a kind of nesting of these environments ( where sys.prefixes [ - 1 ] == sys.prefix ; or maybe reversed ) .
Personally this seems like it would be hard to keep mental track of this , but I can understand the purpose -- you could for instance create a kind of template prefix that has * most * of what you want installed in it , then create sub - environments that contain for instance an actual application , or a checkout ( to test just one new piece of code ) .
I 'm not sure how this should best work on Windows ( without symlinks , and where things generally work differently ) , but I would hope if this idea is more visible that someone more opinionated than I would propose the appropriate analog on Windows .

A scientific network set up recently by India 's environment ministry will contribute formally to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the country 's prime minister has announced
A scientific network set up recently by India 's environment ministry will contribute formally to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the country 's prime minister has announced .
It is the first time that Indian scientists will be involved at an institutional level with the IPCC , whose job is to assess the information relevant to understanding the risks of climate change .
Its scientists have hitherto made individual contributions .
The Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment ( INCCA ) , formed last year ( October 2009 ) , will provide its first research findings to the IPCC by November 2010 , prime minister Manmohan Singh told a sustainable development summit in New Delhi today ( 5 February ) .
Its findings will form part of the panel 's fifth assessment report , due to be finalised in 2014 .
INCCA comprises more than 200 scientists drawn from 120 institutions across the country and will focus on the ' three Ms ' — measuring , modelling and monitoring — to make comprehensive assessments of climate change 's impact on key sectors such as agriculture , water , biodiversity , natural ecosystems and health , environment minister Jairam Ramesh said yesterday ( 4 February ) .
A group within INCCA , made up of scientists from the environment ministry , the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the Indian space department will provide " institutional inputs " to future IPCC reports , Ramesh said .
The announcements come amid international debate over an IPCC claim about the melting rate of the Himalayan glaciers ( see Glacier dispute reveals holes in research ) and suggestions that scientists from the University of East Anglia , United Kingdom , were selective about which of their climate research results they publicised .
But Singh emphasised that , despite some criticism of the IPCC 's reports , " India has full confidence in the IPCC process and its leadership and will support it in every way that it can " .
Ramesh said that the Indian initiative " will help fill an important scientific knowledge gap in the IPCC assessment by providing robust information at the sub- regional level " .
INCCA is one of a series of measures by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to strengthen India 's scientific base .
Others include the Global Advisory Network Group on Environmental Sciences ( GANGES ) that will focus on creating a research agenda and promoting collaboration in the field ; a national environmental sciences research programme ; a scientific expert committee to the ministry ; and an action plan to enhance forestry science .
Ramesh said that the intended scientific focus of the environment ministry has " got somewhat diluted " over the years and the initiatives will bring science " back into the mainstream of our work and decision - making " .
The country is also setting up a national institute on Himalayan glaciology in Dehradun , northern India , said Ramesh .
It 's as common a sight in business districts as street lamps or parking spaces : a revolving vertical tube that signals a destination for patrons in need of a haircut or shave .
It 's the barber pole , and it usually materializes with a red- , white - , and blue - striped color scheme .
It would be fair to guess that the design has something to do with patriotism .
The truth , however , is n't so heartwarming .
The dual arts of cutting hair and shaving faces have been around for a very long time , as have the barbers who practice them : Razors dating from the Bronze Age have been found , and the " barber 's razor "  is even mentioned in the Bible .
For much of their early history , barbers did much more than just take a little off the top ; early physicians thought of some surgeries as being beneath them , so the tasks of mending wounds , bloodletting , and extracting teeth fell to barbers .
For their dual roles of cutting hair and cutting veins , they were called barber - surgeons and later , when the Collège de Saint - Côme in Paris wanted to further distinguish between academic surgeons and barber - surgeons , " surgeons of the short robe . "
The striped poles you see outside barber shops are a legacy of the barber - surgeons ' practice of bloodletting .
The typical barber - surgeon 's equipment for bloodletting or applying leeches consisted of a staff ( for the patient to grasp , causing the veins of the arm to stand out sharply ) , a basin ( to catch blood and hold leeches ) , and a number of linen bandages .
Often , the bandages were tied to or twisted around the staff , which was capped with the blood bowl , so everything was together when needed .
The equipment would then be placed outside , both to dry washed bandages and to act as an advertisement .
With the help of a stiff breeze , the bandages — clean in some spots , permanently stained in others — would twist around the pole and create an unmistakable swirling red and white pattern .
Over time , bloodletting fell out of practice , and the tools of the trade disappeared from barbers ' shops as they concentrated on hair .
( Some stubbornly continued to practice medicine ; in 1745 , England passed legislation to permanently separate barbers from surgeons . )
To maintain tradition and advertise their services with a recognizable symbol , many barbers placed wooden poles outside their shops , which they painted with stripes and topped with a ball , to resemble the staff / bandage / basin arrangement .
The red represented the blood , the white the bandages , and the blue the protruding veins .
The modern barber pole was born .
Many of today 's poles feature rotating , light - up cylinders and weather - resistant plastic and steel parts .
Most of these poles probably came from the William Marvy Company of St. Paul , Minnesota , which has , for decades , been the dominant producer of barber poles in America .
Company founder William Marvy got his start as a barber supply salesman in the 1920s .
He was convinced that he could produce a better barber pole than the ones he'd been pushing , so he launched his own company .
By 1950 , he had perfected his version of the barber pole .
The Marvy model featured a Lucite outer cylinder , cast aluminum housing , and stainless steel fittings , making it lighter , sturdier , and more durable than the other poles available .
By the late 1960s , two of Marvy 's competitors had gone out of business , and his other two rivals were farming out their pole manufacturing to his factory .
Soon enough , the Marvy Company was the only game in town , and in the country .
William Marvy , the only non-barber in the Barber Hall of Fame , died in 1993 , but the company is still going today under the direction of his son , Bob .
Annual pole sales are down to about 600 ( compared to 5100 in 1967 ) , but the company keeps itself busy selling replacement parts and grooming supplies and restoring old poles .
If you 're in the market for one to advertise your styling or bloodletting services , they still offer several different revolving and stationary models .

WASHINGTON , Feb. 7 ( UPI ) --
The risk of a " double - dip " recession is " much lower " now , U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said Sunday .
Speaking on ABC's " This Week , " Geithner said that with the recent ongoing economic growth , a second recession has become less likely .

" We have much , much lower risk of that today than at any time over the last 12 months or so , " Geithner said .
" Again just think of where we are .
We are in an economy that was growing at the rate of almost 6 percent of ( gross domestic product ) in the fourth quarter of last year -- the most rapid rate in six years .
" So we are beginning the process of healing . "
Geithner made the comments as fresh worries were raised last week by figures indicating that 8.4 million jobs have been lost during the recession .
The treasury chief said the Obama administration is determined to " help guide this economy back to the point where we 're not just growing again , but we 've seen growth translate into jobs .
And that we 're reaching the lives of all Americans . "

New Labour combined two fundamental elements in its energetic break with the lethargy , nostalgia and incompetence of Old Labour : emancipation and centralisation .
The long struggle to modernise the left culminated in a coup , staged with exceptional discipline and determination by Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson .
Their authoritarianism was in part a response to the equally bullying sectarianism of the left .
At the same time , it drew inspiration from the audacity of the boardroom , the idea of human rights and the world of international wealth and power .
New Labour 's " market pluralism " offered freedom from the narrow oppressions of both the labour movement and ruling - class elitism .
Along with its grasping for power , celebrity and control , there was the liberating potential for democracy and reform .
But that promise has now been sacrificed to the claims of an enlightened despotism .
At the time of the 2005 election , the columnist Polly Toynbee , concerned the Tories might win because of Labour abstentions over the Iraq war , offered anyone who would go to the polls rather than sit on their hands in disgust " a free wooden nose peg with Vote Labour on it " .
If you wanted a better society , you should hold your nose and vote the party back in , was her influential call - and it succeeded .
Rightly , Toynbee had a positive assessment of what Labour had initially achieved .
And , looking forward , she argued that the main reason for re-electing the party in 2005 was that Blair would be replaced by Brown .
Toynbee seemed to believe , as I and many others did , that Brown would reignite the democratic , progressive and egalitarian side of New Labour when finally he had the chance to lead it .
He read books .
He knew the arguments .
He was passionate about helping the poor and was a dedicated constitutional reformer , convinced of the need to engage with the public .
Many saw through this , however - Scots especially .
When I argued that Brown would be different , the journalist and former New Statesman editor John Lloyd , a Blair supporter , was emphatic that I was projecting my desires on to Brown , who would prove to be no better .
Lloyd was right .
The pity of it was that Brown did launch his premiership with the promise of constitutional renewal , and the initial popularity he gained was more than just relief at Blair going .
Voters wanted a new approach .
Brown had the capacity and the advisers to understand this .
But to summarise what happened between July 2007 and June 2009 : he could have chosen democracy ; instead he chose Mandelson .
Last summer he had another chance .
The MPs ' expenses scandal broke .
Among leading British politicians outside the Liberal Democrats , he was perhaps the only one who could claim he had always wanted bold measures to sweep away a broken system with a new settlement .
He chose not to .
I mention this history to distinguish the situation now from that which obtained in 2005 .
One has to make a judgement about the direction a party 's leaders are taking .
The government is firmly in the hands of Brown and Mandelson , who have an unquenched will to power .
Any victory will be theirs .
We can judge them by their settled support for global capitalism , inequality , authoritarianism and deception .
Global capitalism
In the 1980s the left lost its sense of the future while capitalism , turbocharged by new technology and world trade , projected itself as a planetary project now known as " globalisation " .
Brown embraced globalisation as socialism in a new guise : a wealth - creating substitute for internationalism that would provide the levers to transform Britain .
Though an obvious shift to the right , his move retained a vanity that often blemishes the left - the belief that one 's role is to be the vanguard of the inevitable force of history .
New Labour had its own version of this peculiar combination of determinism and voluntarism : in its jargon , we had to embrace science - based , market - driven modernity , or else suffer the ignominy of becoming yesterday 's story .
On 19 February this year , speaking at an event for " progressive governance " , Brown positioned himself for the coming election with a restatement of this creed :
With globalisation we have a unique chance to recognise our global independence as citizens and work towards a truly global society : towards a world free from climate - change catastrophe ; and a world free from terrorism , poverty , disease , illiteracy and inequality .
Together my proposals are the modern progressive way of achieving our historic goals of economic progress , social justice and environmental care .
To achieve this , he called for nothing less than a " constitution for the global financial system " .
This was a proposal of Blair - like hubris .
But what was the contribution regular folk were expected to make towards achieving Brown 's " historic goals " ?
I believe that as we [ develop ] the skilled jobs of the future we should see social mobility as the modern route to social justice and devise together the radical measures to massively accelerate the rate of social mobility in our societies .
Apparently we must adopt a planetary form of Tebbitism , where everyone has to get on their bike and pedal all the harder to achieve social justice - mobility without liberty .
Behind this supposedly inspiring vision , the hard edge of Brown 's global economics had been set out by Mandelson in a speech to the Work Foundation early the previous month .
This was a well - crafted case announcing some sharp proposals , appointments and intelligent policies to encourage economic development outside the financial sector but :
First and foremost we need to foster a new climate for enterprise in Britain .
There is no substitute for this - no substitute for the drive and ambition that it brings .
It can sometimes be a touch ruthless and raw .
But it is the single most important engine of economic progress . . .
Enterprise and reward go hand in hand .
Much as it shocked many of my friends when I said I was comfortable with people making themselves " filthy rich " , in the context I was speaking I was simply stating a simple truth : that enterprise and effort should be rewarded .
It sets goals to spur people and brings gains to us all .
And it is often forgotten that I added the important rider " as long as people pay their fair share of taxes " .
That 's people paying taxes , not businesses .
There was no recognition in the speech that public spirit and investment can also drive growth and progress .
Mandelson restated an approach that led to Private Finance Initiatives , privatising the delivery of the health service , and now the disastrous subordination of scholarship to commerce .
At first he was a tart for deregulation .
Now a touch of government is needed .
But we can rest assured that it is only in order to manage Britain as a free market for the good of global capitalism .
Inequality
New Labour 's embrace of globalisation has turned it into an offshore government , judging domestic policy by its appropriateness for international finance and investment .
This has disabled Labour 's social democrats ( and they do exist , in both government and party ) from addressing inequality with the self - belief required to make a lasting difference .
There is no point to social democracy if it does n't make society less unequal .
How to do this with respect to education , opportunity and income may be complicated , but an egalitarian state is , in my view , a prerequisite to succeeding .
Debate on these matters , however , can't begin unless the fundamental ambition is articulated in the first place and acted upon .
New Labour has made Britain a better place to live , but is it attempting to make it more equal ?
Is it a social - democratic or a right - wing government ?
Equality here is not a matter of assisting the poor , imperative though that is .
As Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show in their book The Spirit Level , it involves diminishing the overall levels of difference , holding down the corrupting and degrading effects of widening inequality between top and bottom .
The answer under Blair was clear ; he refused to countenance greater equality .
Now , under Brown , with Harriet Harman 's Equality Bill and the creation of the Government Equalities Office , a serious effort is being made to measure what is happening .
This is one of the tricks of Brown 's trade .
However superficial his policies may turn out to be , he exercises his hegemony by occupying what can be described as the mental terrain of an issue .
Raise the question of a social problem under Labour , and a barrage of reports , initiatives , consultations and other evidence will be produced to show how deeply the party knows and how seriously steps are being planned - as if Labour were in opposition , struggling to make a difference .
An example is the outstanding report from the National Equality Panel , An Anatomy of Economic Inequality in the UK , published in January .
It shows that Britain would have been even more unequal had the Conservatives won the 1997 election - hardly a cause for self - congratulation - and maps the Himalayan rise of top pay and wealth .
They know what they are doing .
The housing shortage symbolises the nature of Brownian policy towards inequality .
He had more than ten years to see it coming .
He saw it coming .
New Labour permitted housing shortfalls that fed the inflation of property prices and could only exacerbate unfairness .
When he became Prime Minister and planned a snap election , he pledged an additional 250,000 homes .
As with constitutional renewal , the promise makes the failure all the more despicable .
So what was Brown doing ?
Instead of building homes , he was doing all he could to help the City .
After he had been anointed Labour leader , but just before he was to replace Blair , Brown gave his final Mansion House speech as chancellor on 20 June 2007 .
On his watch , the City had become the world 's leading financial centre .
No sign of shortages here :
I congratulate you , Lord Mayor and the City of London , on these remarkable achievements , an era that history will record as the beginning of a new golden age for the City of London . . .
And I believe it will be said of this age , the first decades of the 21st century , that out of the greatest restructuring of the global economy , perhaps even greater than the Industrial Revolution , a new world order was created .
Do n't just blame the bankers .
So let me say as I begin my new job [ as Prime Minister ] , I want to continue to work with you in helping you do yours , listening to what you say , always recognising your international success is critical to that of Britain 's overall , and considering together the things that we must do - and , just as important , things we should not do [ my italics ] - to maintain our competitiveness . . .
Top of his list of what we should not do was " a British Sarbanes - Oxley " , the act passed in the US in 2002 after the collapse of Enron .
Thus Brown explicitly opposed the need for regulation that he now maintains is essential to the construction of his new world order .
Helping make Britain a more equal society was not openly listed as one of the things " we should not do " , but the implication was obvious .
Given its tremendous differentials of wealth and income , Britain needs a major party whose core mission is greater equality .
This ought to be the Labour Party .
Its policy advisers are now much better equipped to introduce intelligent and effective ways of achieving this .
But if the government remains under the control of Mandelson and Brown , it wo n't embrace them .
Labour has to sort itself out in opposition before it can present the electorate with a credible commitment to a " fairer way forward " .
Authoritarianism
In the mid-1980s , Robin Cook told me a story whose veracity I have not been able to confirm , but which has stayed in my mind .
Cook had been at a private gathering in Europe during Jim Callaghan 's premiership .
Monetarism ( what today we would call " neoliberalism " ) was the subject under discussion .
Nigel Lawson told the gathering that Britain did not have the conditions to introduce monetarism .
Asked what these were , Margaret Thatcher 's future chancellor answered , " Water cannon . "
That was at the dawn of neoliberalism .
Thatcher and her cabinet subsequently found the requisite conditions : a successful war , a stupid miners ' leader who opened the way to a confrontation that destroyed Labour 's praetorian guard , huge cash surpluses generated by North Sea oil , Rupert Murdoch , and a realignment of economic power that brought immense productivity increases in its train .
The political culture that accompanied this change replaced the stiff upper lip and consensus politics with a boastful , authoritarian spirit .
But if intimidation was essential to the implementation of the free market it also helped unstitch a historic nation .
Thatcher incarnated the tension , agreeing to an EU single market while trying to say " No " to Brussels .
It proved even harder for her successors .
Blair tried to become a war leader , too , but , unable re-create her populism , turned to faith .
Brown attempted a redefinition of Britishness , to deserved derision .
But below the radar , and from early in the New Labour years , he and Blair initiated an audacious and sustained " transformation of government " .
Its ample official documents , never debated by parliament , set out to restructure the relationship between the state , citizens and business .
It is a programme for a " database state " in which government departments can transfer information on citizens without them knowing , where surveillance is ubiquitous and government becomes the corporate deliverer of Britain 's inhabitants to the marketplace .
The " DBS " , as it is cheerfully known , presents a novel and formidable challenge .
A supporter recently told me that the database state is " inevitable and desirable .
What we need are strong rights within it , iron - clad privacy within a context of the DBS . "
But there cannot be " iron - clad privacy " within its context .
That is the whole point .
And I was struck by the combination of the “ inevitable " and the " desirable " , of fate and enthusiasm , the coin of New Labour from the start , merging delight in power with historical inevitability .
We are entering a new kind of constitution , one overseen not by judges , but by the Association of Chief Police Officers , organised as a private company outside the reach of Freedom of Information .
The state that results can penetrate our daily lives at will without a warrant , log our movements , demand to know our intentions when we travel and compile , as with the DNA database , police records that imply guilt irrespective of charges , let alone a verdict .
Central to this redefinition of what it will mean to be British is the National Identity Register , with the ID card as its visible expression .
This is not a card that permits us to claim our rights as with a passport , which was meant , as the name itself records , to be a laissez - passer , a right to travel .
The UK identity card is closer to the electronic tag worn by criminals allowed out on probation .
It belongs to the state and will entail an obligation to keep it informed and updated as the state manages our identity for us .
Should it become compulsory , it will mark our subordination to the electronic leviathan .
Hardly popular , you might say , and opinion polls bear this out , which is why the policy itself is also being managed rather than debated .
A marvellous example was provided by Brown himself in his party conference speech at the end of September last year :
In the last two years we have looked again at how we can give the best security to our British citizens whilst never undermining their liberties .
We will reduce the information British citizens have to give for the new biometric passport to no more than that required for today 's passport .
And so conference , I can say to you today , in the next parliament there will be no compulsory ID cards for British citizens .
I think it is fair to say that without the Convention on Modern Liberty organised by Henry Porter and myself the previous February , such " looking again " would not have occurred .
The announcement of no compulsory ID cards got one of the loudest cheers of Brown 's conference speech .
But what he was really saying was , " Re-elect me and there will be compulsory ID cards after the next parliament . "
What appeared to be a welcome retreat was in fact a blatant , yet devious , decision to carry forward the creation of the state management of our identities , while sterilising it as an election issue .
We do n't live in a police state .
But the potential for a modern authoritarianism has to be reversed , or else its forms of intimidation , far more sophisticated than hosing protesters into the gutter , may become irreversible .
On this issue , above all , Brown is imposing his will , and he will have his way , circumventing open debate , unless he is defeated at the polls .
Deception
Deception is a New Labour hallmark .
Its routines were established early in what we can call " the Campbell Code " , in which presentation is substance , projection a form of media war and the appearance of truth its warrior sword .
It was on display at the Chilcot inquiry as Blair insisted that the invasion of Iraq was a matter of his " judgement " as prime minister .
But when Lawrence Freedman queried Blair 's judgement for telling parliament it was " beyond doubt " that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , Freedman was told that this was what the former prime minister " genuinely believed " .
An effortless transformation of the issue into one of sincerity .
Blair got away with it .
And the bankers got away with it , without even as feeble an inquiry as Chilcot .
For the public , the scandal of MPs ' expenses was decisive - it was a " Gotcha ! " moment .
Trust wo n't be " restored " by somehow instilling financial propriety among MPs , because the crisis involved a ruling culture of deception and entitlement having its cover blown .
David Cameron can't oppose it credibly , since he presented himself as the heir to Blair .
So , when the government attacked the Conservatives over the influence on them of Michael Ashcroft 's money , Cameron 's reply was that " people in glasshouses should n't throw stones " .
In parliamentary terms , the riposte worked .
But the episode confirms that ordinary voters are right to see both parties as living in the same corrupt conservatory .
And the taint of corruption is embedded deep in the system .
In 1985 , in his Mackintosh Memorial Lecture ( which Brown would have read at the time ) , Neal Ascherson argued :
It is not possible to build democratic socialism by using the institutions of the Ancient British State .
Under that include the present doctrine of sovereignty , parliament , the electoral system , the civil service - the whole gaudy heritage .
It is not possible , in the way that it is not possible to induce a vulture to give milk .
Part of the appeal of New Labour before 1997 was the implicit promise that it would tackle this culture head - on .
Instead , its leaders stripped away such decrepit checks as parliamentary procedure and cabinet deliberation , so as to exercise all the more fully what is , in effect , royal power .
Power thus exercised is intrinsically corrupt .
Personally unimpeachable politicians , such as the Miliband brothers , are just as contaminated by it all as Blair .
Brown could have stopped the rackets that kept backbenchers quiescent in the Commons .
He could have abolished the crony appointment of half of our parliament that besmirches the UK 's claim to be a democracy .
He could have , but he did n't .
Instead , he drank the vulture 's milk .
Here is a test .
Ask a Labour candidate if he or she is politically honest .
They will assure you that they are .
Ask them if they will accept the will of voters in their constituency on election night if they fail to get the largest number of votes .
" Of course , " they will reply .
Then ask them whether , should they be elected , they intend to accept the will of the voters across Britain ?
Here , there might be a pause for calculation .
Taking advantage of the pause , develop the question .
Suppose that the Conservatives were to get 5 per cent more votes than Labour - in other words , a clear majority of the popular vote between the two parties - but Labour were to win as many seats .
Would n't it be dishonest to support Labour in forming the government ?
Should n't they agree that they will not defy the clear preference of British voters by preventing the Tories from realising a chance to exercise power ?
It will take no time at all for your honest candidate to dismiss such a suggestion as naive .
You will be told that you " do not understand " how things work .
In fact , you will have understood it very well .
It goes to show that we do not have an honest politics , however honest individual MPs may be .
Brown and Mandelson love being in power .
They will do everything they can to stay there .
Maybe they have lost interest in the tiresome country that they also have to " run " , preferring to call for global constitutions instead .
But they need national office , if only as a base from which to advance their planetary pretensions .
They long ago replaced their socialist hearts with a triple - bypass that beats to the pulse of globalisation and international finance .
And to secure their base , they have initiated a staggering reconstruction of the British state , using their unchecked executive power to modernise our government and policing , and to pre-empt the democracy of constitutional citizenship with hi-tech subjecthood .
Brown , Mandelson and Blair are not the only begetters of the corruption of this country 's political system ; the responsibility lies with the political class as a whole , something that the public understands pretty well .
But they alone inherited the power to reform it and they must take the responsibility for failing to do so .
The alternative
I watched David Cameron talking recently about Brown 's suggestion of a referendum on the voting system .
He said that what this country needs is " strong government " .
An involuntary shudder passed through me .
Have they learned nothing ?
What this country needs is an opposition : an alternative to the two - party bad faith on Afghanistan ( pity , but we have to stay ) , the EU ( pity , but we have to stay ) , the House of Lords ( pity , but it will have to stay ) , strong government ( got to keep it in order to ensure the above ) .
When the expenses scandal struck , Cameron declared that it was time to give " power to the powerless " , while Brown pleaded that he was a long - time supporter of Charter 88 .
Who are they kidding ?
Neither will deliver change .
As there is n't an opposition , we should start to invent one by opening up the political space from which it can emerge .
It would be best to do this with the Liberal Democrats , but if not with them , then without them .
The slogan is short enough : " Hang 'em " .
We need to hang parliament and hang the two main parties .
We need to vote Brown and Mandelson out , first of all , but not vote Cameron and company in to carry on where Labour has left off .
We need a hung parliament so that invention and new voices are registered , so that the public can express how it has lost trust in the political class , and different forces be allowed to reshape the political scene .
In my view , one of these should be an English voice , so that the United Kingdom can move , at last , to a grown - up federal model .
I note this to signal that I am not afraid of such an outcome .
Naturally , other populist sentiments will emerge .
But the longer they are bottled up , the more twisted and resentful they will become .
If we want a progressive realignment , it has to come from below .
How should we hang 'em ?
By voting for the candidate most likely to increase the number of independent and third - party MPs of all kinds .
That means Lib Dems in constituencies where the party looks the most promising .
And Caroline Lucas in Brighton for the Greens ; Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party where they have the best chance ; even , despite his loathsome attack on Herman van Rompuy , Nigel Farage of Ukip against the Speaker of the House of Commons ( who anyway endorses the need for rough justice ) .
Ideally , the Lib Dems would seek English electoral pacts wherever possible , and likewise in Scotland and Wales .
Alex Salmond got it right when he said that the SNP should aim to hold the balance of power .
This , surely , is the bold approach Nick Clegg , Vincent Cable and Chris Huhne should take .
A single list of independents , nationalists , Greens and Lib Dems should be negotiated , on the basis of who is most likely to open up politics , so that everyone can vote to hang the two main parties .
And to hot things up , the list should also include maverick MPs from the Tories and Labour - Frank Field and David Davis come to mind .
This would send out a different kind of signal from the one the political class expects : that it pays to rebel .
It 's easy to imagine the headlines - especially from the Sun , which " prayed " for Britain to become great again when it switched allegiance to Cameron .
It would lead to confusion , it would make us look weak .
We 'd lose our credit rating and Argentina would invade the Falklands .
But think of the upside .
Arguments that attract popular support might have influence - thanks to a public , it should never be forgotten , that was wiser than the political class about Iraq .
Real thinking could begin , and , who knows , there may be a role for websites and magazines such as the New Statesman in debating the future of the British system , rather than supporting this or that party , this or that faction .
Those on the left should help Britain vote out New Labour , but frustrate the Cameroons .
Brown , Mandelson and Blair had an unprecedented opportunity to reform the British system with public support .
Instead , they chose to intensify the centralisation of power .
There were important reforms , yet these have only moderated but not reversed the construction of an authoritarian government , dating back to Thatcher , the function of which is to support a profoundly unequal and exploitative global order .
Voters do n't want this .
As the New Statesman 's Mehdi Hasan argued recently , the public is " to the left not simply of New Labour , but the political and media classes as a whole " .
If he is right , then , in order to let the people speak , we must break open our political - media class and , above all , the two - party system .
The best way to do this is to hang 'em .
Anthony Barnett is the founder of openDemocracy and co-edits its British blog , OurKingdom .
We will be publishing replies to this essay in the next few issues , beginning here with David Marquand .
This article appeared in the New Statesman under the headline " Hang ' Em "
On March 30th , humanity is scheduled to start running the biggest , baddest particle collider ever constructed , the one that makes its closest competitor , Fermi's Tevatron , so out - of - date that the current plan is simply to shut the Tevatron down .
But Brookhaven 's RHIC , which can't even reach the Tevatron 's energies , will be kept running indefinitely .
If that does n't make sense , it 's just one of a large collection of things associated with particle physics that may not be very intuitive .
Like the fact that we 've built a series of detectors in the Large Hadron Collider that are designed to pick up signs of particles that we 've never seen before , and tiny bits of dark matter that do n't actually interact with anything .
Or the fact that we need a bunch of detectors for this in the first place .
Fortunately , for the last month or so , I 've had a variety of physicists explaining matters to me in language that even a biologist could understand .
In a series of articles , I 'll try to explain the process of physics so that , as the LHC gears up , you can appreciate why scientists think it 's a pretty big deal .
The basics of smashing atoms
The recent generation of particle accelerators rely on essentially identical principles : take an atom , strip off all its electrons , and use the charge that remains as a lever to boost it to speeds that are a rounding error away from the speed of light .
Two beams of identical particles are sent around a ring - shaped accelerator in opposite directions and , at specific points , the beams are made to cross , creating the possibility of collisions .
For the LHC , this primarily involves the simplest atomic nucleus , the single proton of hydrogen .
RHIC uses gold , with 79 protons and 90 neutrons , although the LHC is capable of using lead , which is similar in mass to gold .
( We 'll get into the whys of the two weights shortly . )
The atoms end up going so close to the speed of light that distance contracts along the path of their travel — if you could watch the gold atom shoot past from the side , it would look like a disk .
( In fact , Brookhaven scientists had to change their images from spheres to disks after complaints from anal - retentive audience members [ my term , not theirs ] . )
It 's moving so fast that the huge repulsion that might otherwise result from the large collections of positive charges does n't even have a chance to slow things down .
" By the time these guys realize they should experience charge repulsion , " said Brookhaven 's Peter Steinberg , " it 's all over . "
Different generations of hardware exist side - by - side in the control room at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
Two protons bring a total of six quarks into the collision , yet a large collection of particles results from their collision .
Two gold ions bring in over 150 protons and even more neutrons , and over 10,000 particles come streaming out — physicist Todd Satogata said that , to scale , it looks " like a Kush ball the size of a three - story house . "
Where 's all this stuff coming from ?
When particles collide , they bring a tremendous amount of energy to a screaming halt .
It all has to go somewhere , and some of it ends up radiating off as massless photons .
But , because mass and energy are equivalent , a certain amount of the energy gets converted directly to mass and kinetic energy , creating the particles that spray from the collisions .
Why the LHC is a big deal
Here 's where we get into the difference between RHIC 's use of gold and the LHC 's use of protons .
Since energy and mass are proportional , the heavier the particle you hope to create , the more energy you have to pump into the collisions .
So , for example , if a particle 's mass is the equivalent of a trillion electron volts , you have to have collisions with at least that much energy to have any chance of producing it .
As the energy involved in the collisions increases beyond this point , you have an increasing chance of producing the particle in question .
For well over a decade , we 've been stuck with collisions that are just under 2TeV , provided by Fermi Lab 's Tevatron .
That was easily enough to produce the top quark , and may be within the range of a major hypothetical particle , the Higgs boson .
But the probabilities of spotting the Higgs in the Tevatron are pretty low , which means that long runs and lots of data would be needed to know for sure .
At its maximum energy , the LHC will produce collisions that are nearly an order of magnitude more powerful than the Tevatron's , and it will produce a lot more of them — it has a higher luminosity , as physicists put it .
The Higgs will be easily within reach , and any number of more exotic hypothetical particles should definitely be possible .
What 's the point of a low - powered collider like RHIC ?
At its highest energies , Brookhaven 's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider could n't even produce a top quark .
Why 's it considered so valuable that it'll keep going after the Tevatron 's scheduled to shut down ?
As Brookhaven 's Steinberg put it , the LHC is a particle machine , but RHIC is a quantum chromodynamics machine — it studies the interactions among fundamental particles when they 're present in bulk .
The LHC can do that as well , with its ability to accelerate lead and an entire detector , ALICE , devoted to studying these collisions .
But that was n't what it was built for , so new physics like the Higgs and dark matter particles will always be a higher priority .
RHIC 's top priority has always been the nuclear program .
Although the collisions of heavy ions also produce a fair share of unusual particles like strange quarks , their key feature is the fact that they take lots regular quarks , which are normally bundled in the protons and neutrons of the nucleus , and pack them into an incredibly dense space at extremely high energy .
Under these conditions , the forces that keep quarks and gluons neatly bundled into these particles break down , and they diffuse into a dense particle soup .
That soup lasts a total of 30 yoctoseconds — long enough for light to cross the width of about 10 protons — before escaping in a miniature fireball .
This quark - gluon plasma has n't been seen with any regularity since shortly after the big bang .
In fact , Brookhaven scientists were fairly cautious about claiming that they had even created it .
Even though physicists had been talking as if it had existed for years , the paper that provided the best evidence to date was only published this year .
There are two interesting aspects to these collisions .
The first is the behavior of the quark - gluon plasma , which appears to act as a perfect quantum liquid , with properties that Brookhaven staff suggested made the odd behavior of Bose - Einstein condensates look positively tame .
The other is that , as the quarks rocket out of the collision site , they will re-condense into familiar ( and strange ) nucleons .
If enough of these end up travelling in close proximity , they can also condense into a regular nucleus ( or antinucleus ) .
These processes can help us understand how the world of regular matter gets put together .
RHIC also does some collisions using protons to study phenomena that may not require the huge energies available at the LHC .
One of these involves a search for the proton 's spin , which is the sum of the spins of its component quarks .
That may sound nice and intuitive , but there 's apparently nothing intuitive about the physical process that performs that addition .
Intriguingly , the search for source of the spin has come up short so far .
" We 've figured out a lot of places it is n't , " said Steinberg , who called it " the most fascinating null result I 'm aware of . "
We 're arranging to talk to someone about the proton experiments .
In the meantime , check in tomorrow as we discuss how the huge detectors at the LHC and RHIC manage to identify the tiniest of particles , and use that information to reconstruct what happens in the instants after collisions take place .
It 's time .
We 've fought for far too long .

Your votes will determine the winner of each matchup .
Pies and cakes invited to the playoffs were chosen and seeded at the discretion of the Selection Committee — debating the validity of entrants or their rankings is moot ; we must move forward with competition .
Please note , generalizations of pie and cake types cover all variations of pies and cakes in their respective genre .
Carmel Apple Crumb Pie , for example , is still an Apple Pie ; Yellow Birthday Cake With Chocolate Buttercream plays for Team Birthday Cake .
Strawberry Rhubarb Pie is Rhubarb Pie , Neopolitan Ice Cream Cake is an Ice Cream Cake .
You get the idea .

Today , the # 1 seeded Birthday Cake will face off against # 16 Fruitcake ; in the Pie Conference it 's # 1 Apple versus # 16 Grasshopper .
Voting will remain open for 24 hours .
Let the games begin !
[ Update : The Selection Committee acknowledges the omission of Key Lime Pie , which has been added as a strong wildcard at the # 3 spot in the Pie Conference .
S'mores has been found in violation of campfire rules and has been disqualified .
The bracket has been updated ; there will be no further changes to the tournament . ]
Doctor Who Started Vaccine , Autism Debate in Ethics Row Doc 's critics and parent supporters say ethics debate is irrelevant to science .
Feb . 1 , 2010  --
Parent activists who say vaccines can trigger autism , and scientists who say that hypothesis has been discredited , agreed on one point last week .
It wo n't change their debate if Dr. Andrew Wakefield -- the British doctor known widely for sparking international fear that vaccines cause autism -- loses his medical license for unethical behavior .
Wakefield has been found guilty of acting unethically during the time he conducted the famous , and now retracted , 1998 case report of 12 children that questioned if a childhood vaccine caused a new form of autism .
The United Kingdom's General Medical Council concluded Jan. 28 that Wakefield participated in " dishonesty and misleading conduct " while he conducted the 1998 research .
Most of the findings against Wakefield are breaches of standard ethical codes meant to keep bias out of scientific journals .
But , according to one of the findings against the doctor , Wakefield took blood samples from children at his own child 's birthday party , and paid them five British pounds for their trouble .
On Feb. 2 , the Lancet retracted Wakefield 's paper , explaining in a statement : " Following the judgment of the UK General Medical Council 's Fitness to Practice Panel on Jan 28 , 2010 , it has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al are incorrect ... in particular , the claims in the original paper that children were ' consecutively referred ' and that investigations were ' approved ' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false .
Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record . "
" In some ways I think it 's irrelevant , " said Dr. Paul Offit , chief of the Section of Infectious Diseases at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , who has been twice threatened with lawsuits for critical statements he has made of Wakefield 's work .
" His hypothesis was that by combining the MMR into a single shot that it was somehow weakening the immune system , causing the measles part of the vaccine to travel to the gut and cause damage , " Offit said .
That theoretical damage , according to Wakefield 's hypothesis , could then theoretically travel into the bloodstream and cause ( theoretical ) damage to the brain -- perhaps causing autism symptoms .
" It created a firestorm , " Offit said .
Parent advocacy groups jumped on the possibility of vaccines as a cause , or at least that gastrointestinal symptoms were a unique problem to children with Autism .
" The Autism Society strongly supports funding research into gastrointestinal pathology , as well as any links between this pathology and the symptoms of autism , " the advocacy group said in a statement .
" In this field , Dr. Wakefield 's contributions to our families and members are greatly appreciated and there are many who support him in his research efforts . "
The GMC panel also found Wakefield responsible for an ethics breach because he wrote that the children involved in the case report were referred to his clinic for stomach problems , when Wakefield knew nearly half of the children were actually part of a lawsuit looking into the effects of a measles - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) vaccine .
Some children did n't have stomach issues at all .
The GMC also found that Wakefield failed to disclose he was paid in conjunction with the lawsuit , or that he had a patent related to a new MMR vaccine in development when he submitted the 12 - child case report to be published in a scientific journal .
Wakefield declined an interview with ABCNews.com , but issued a statement saying , " The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion . "
Wakefield was found " proven " to have committed the ethical breaches by the GMC Fitness to Practice Panel , but his time before the government is not over yet .
On April 7 , the GMC is scheduled to decide whether these breaches constitute " serious professional misconduct " and if so , how Wakefield will be reprimanded or whether he will lose his license .
Wakefield and his former colleagues may see their fate hanging on the April decision , but the public may not agree .
Scientists who say Wakefield 's hypothesis has been discredited long ago with large studies finding no link between vaccines and autism view the ethical breaches as an interesting , but meaningless , side point .
Similarly , the parent groups who stood behind him in rallies and in press statements say his theories have led to anecdotally successful treatment in their children and also doubt that a finding by the GMC will change any minds .
Are Dr. Wakefield 's Ethics Irrelevant ?
When the public got word of Wakefield 's work , worried parents skipped vaccines , and the percentage of children who were not vaccinated in the United States rose from 0.77 percent in 1997 to 2.1 percent in 2000 , according to an article by Dr. Michael Smith in the journal Pediatrics .
A similar drop - off in vaccinations occurred in Britain , weakening overall immunity and putting those who are too young to get vaccinated at risk for measles , mumps or rubella .
Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control declared the United States cleared of measles in 2000 , fewer vaccinations brought back the disease in a 2008 outbreak .
At least 131 cases were reported to the CDC , and 11 percent of the cases were hospitalized .
A handful of children in Britain died of the measles around the time of the U.S. outbreak .
Scientists Investigate Vaccine , Autism Connection
Offit said that scientists did n't sit idly by after the news broke in 1998 .
" People spent millions and millions of dollar looking at this hypothesis that he raised , " he said .
But according to Offit -- and international studies supported by the CDC as well as a 2004 review of large international studies by the Institute of Medicine -- high - quality studies could not confirm Wakefield 's hypothesis about vaccines .
Parent Groups Still Supporting Dr. Wakefield ... and His Work
Although Wakefield 's original hypothesis did not mention mercury , a row also arose over whether a mercury - based preservative called thimerosal found in other vaccines cause autism .
As a precaution , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and several other governors banned mercury from childhood vaccines in 2004 .
But autism rates have only increased since then .
" He had his day in scientific court , this is his day in ethics court , " said Offit .
Robert Field , an expert in health care ethics and a professor of law and public health Drexel University in Philadelphia , agreed that the charges against Wakefield posed ethical issues .
In light of the ethical charges brought against Wakefield , 10 of the original 13 authors of the 12 - child article issued a retraction .
Yet , like Offit , Field did not believe the current charges would influence the way scientists viewed Wakefield 's hypothesis .
" Taking blood samples without the consent would be a serious ethical and legal violation in the United States and even more so if children were involved , " Field said .
But , " independent of the autism and vaccine issue , that is unethical behavior .
I would also say that counseling parents to avoid vaccines for fear of autism would also be unethical . "
Field said it was unethical because , " there is no evidence , even after numerous scientific investigations , of a link between vaccine and autism . "
Parents like Rebecca Estepp of Talk About Curing Autism and anti-mercury activists like Theresa Wrangham , say these current charges are irrelevant not because Wakefield 's hypothesis has been proved or disproved .
Instead , groups like Talk About Curing Autism , the Autism Society and SafeMinds , say they still appreciate Wakefield 's work .
" The number one point we were making , kids with autism have gastrointestinal issues .
We know this , " said Theresa Wrangham , president of SafeMinds -- an organization that dedicated to eliminating neurological damage in children from exposure to mercury .
" Our kids are in distress , and this is a recognized area that needs research . "
Dr. Wakefield 's Legacy Still Debated
Wrangham said bringing up Wakefield on charges of unethical conduct would only " chill " other researchers who want to investigate issues such as vaccine 's link to autism , or the mercury additive in vaccines thimerosal .
" Do I think the book is closed on thimerosal ?
No , " Wrangham said .
Estepp , Talk About Curing Autism 's manager of strategic planning , agreed with Wrangham in that the charges against Wakefield may lead doctors away from researching vaccines , or gastrointestinal problems in children .
" What comes down at the end of the day is that Dr. Wakefield continued his research , " said Estepp .
" The things that he has found and the different treatment models that have come about from those findings are the things I 've seen improve my son . "
Indeed , Wakefield left England since the original 1998 article and has since set up an alternative research and treatment organization called Thoughtful House in Austin , Texas .
Estepp correctly noted that it was n't a complaint from a parent of the 12 children , but an investigation by U.K journalist Brian Deer that opened up questions into Wakefield 's actions .
" In my eyes Dr. Wakefield 's work was the foundation of my son getting better , " said Estepp .
" The thing that I 'm worried about as a parent with a child of autism … is if you are a scientist and you stumble upon something controversial , we now know that scientists can see that their careers or their livelihoods are at stake , " she added .
But doctors like Offit warn that not every doctor who goes against the status quo is necessarily a brilliant outlier .
" Science is full of mavericks , " said Offit , pointing to stories of genius such as Galileo in which the maverick is originally thought to be heretical and is cast out by the scientific community only later to be vindicated by scientific evidence .
" But the history of science is also filled with mavericks that have this heretical notion that is dead wrong , " he said .
Oh , this is wonderful to hear : The Lancet -- a leading UK professional medical research journal -- is retracting the paper published by Andrew Wakefield back in 1998 that linked vaccines with autism .
The paper has been found to be multiply and fatally flawed , with Wakefield and his work being thoroughly discredited .
As the Lancet editorial itself states :
Following the judgment of the UK General Medical Council ’s Fitness to Practise Panel on Jan 28 , 2010 , it has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al. are incorrect , contrary to the findings of an earlier investigation .
In particular , the claims in the original paper that children were “ consecutively referred ” and that investigations were “ approved ” by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false .
Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record .
That 's great news , especially after Wakefield had his head handed to him last week by the GMC over his unethical and irresponsible behavior that led to this horrible paper being published in the first place .
The Lancet statement is a bit bloodless ... but they are a professional research journal and not a blog , so it 's not appropriate for them to call out Wakefield in more emotional -- and utterly deserved -- terms .
It 's up to the blogs to call out Wakefield for his tireless efforts in creating of the modern antivaccination movement , which is becoming so successful that measles , mumps , pertussis , and other preventable diseases are on the rise again .
And to note that not only was his research wrong , but that he may have faked his data .
And to say that he has a huge conflict of interest here , since at the time he was involved in creating an alternative to vaccination that would make him very , very rich if people became scared to vaccinate their kids .
And to inform people that Wakefield was in the pocket of lawyers trying to sue the vaccine industry .
And to basically call out the entire antivax movement for the incredible damage they have done and continue to do to public health .
All that 's left now is for the GMC to officially sanction Wakefield , disbar him , essentially , to finish this all up officially .
Of course , that wo n't even slow Wakefield or the antivaxxers .
They do n't care for the real world , based on evidence and fact .
They are , for all intents and purposes , religious zealots now , believing in Wakefield , Jenny McCarthy , and the rest with such fervor that there is literally no amount of evidence that can ever sway them .
And they will continue to spin , fold , and mutilate the truth , while we watch as diseases rise back from the dead , infecting hundreds of thousands of people , and killing many of them .
Never forget what 's at stake here .
Never .

A colleague called me over today for some help with a memory usage issue in his PHP script .
The script was performing the basic ( but critical ) task of importing data , pulling it in from MySQL in large chunks , then exporting it elsewhere .
He was receiving the wonderful “ Fatal error : Allowed memory size of XXXX bytes exhausted ( tried to allocate YY bytes ) ” error message .
The code was following a basic flow :
10 Get stuff from the database ( large array of arrays )
20 Iterate over it , doing stuff 30 Goto 10
I fixed the memory usage exceeded problem with an unset ( ) , at the end of a loop .
Take a look at this sample program : loopOverStuff ( ) ; function loopOverStuff ( ) { $ var = null ; for ( $i = 0 ; $ i < 10 ; $ i++ ) { $ var = getData ( ) ; // Do stuff } } function getData ( ) { $ a = str_repeat ( “ This string is exactly 40 characters long ” , 20000 ) ; return $ a ; }
The important thing to realize is that PHP will end up needing around twice as much memory as getData ( ) takes .
The problem is the line $ var = getData ( ) .
The first time it is called $var is incredibly small , it ’s clobbered and the return value of getData ( ) is assigned to it .
The second time through the loop $ var still holds the value from the previous iteration , so while getData ( ) is executing you ’re maintaining the original data ( in $ var ) , and a whole new set ( being built in getData ( ) ) .
Fixing this is incredibly easy : function loopOverStuff ( ) { $ var = null ; for ( $ i = 0 ; $ i < 10 ; $ i++ ) { $ var = stealMemories ( ) ; // Do Stuff unset ( $var ) ; } }
loopOverStuff ( )
Other Stuff + ( 2 * memory needed in loop ) > Memory Limit
This way we avoid the duplication in memory of those values on that line .
To see this happen in more detail take a look at this sample script with ouptut : memory - usage - example .php .
This is n’t critical , except when it is .
Oncecompletes , and the function ends .
The memory is released back to the rest of PHP automatically .
You ’ll only run into problems where .
There are better architectures available to avoid the issue entirely ( like not storing everything in the array , just to iterate over it later ) but they ’re an issue for a different post .
For a very simple base case demonstration of the issue take a look at the simple example .
On Tuesday , February 9th at 12 pm , San Franciscans concerned about the recent actions of the California ABC and SFPD are expected to assemble outside City Hall with a homemade phone booth , flyers and signs encouraging voters to call the mayor and ask him to fix what they see as problems with the California ABC and what they refer to as unconstitutional raids on SF parties , venues , and drinking establishments .
The citizens will use the makeshift phone booth and form a line so they can call Gavin from inside the phone booth to create a visual representation of political impact , “ with something as simple as calling our employee , Gavin Newsom . ”
The organizer , Ani Niow , is passionate for the cause , adding “ We need to let people know that there are real people affected by the War on Fun . ”
Call The Mayor Day is the brainchild of Debra Walker , candidate for District 6 , Supervisor , after suggesting it at the Flux Summit last month .
The group is asking for some assistance with building the phone booth and creating signage .

Abusegate : mother of all scandals ?
January 19 , 2010
By Carey Roberts Mirror , mirror , on the wall , what 's the most colossal scandal of them all ?
Watergate ?
Climategate ?
Tigergate ?
If you said ' yes ' to any of these , Folks , we 're not talking about a media - adled tempest in a teapot .
No , this is an old - fashioned head - banging , sit - down - and - cry - your - eyes - out affair .
Abusegate refers to our nation 's flawed crusade to curb domestic violence ( DV ) .
Originally a high - minded and well - intentioned effort , the end - abuse campaign has now fallen prey to an invidious anti-family agenda .
In the name of making homes safe , the domestic violence industry curtails fundamental civil rights and often betrays those in greatest need .
Let me count the ways our domestic violence effort has failed to deliver on its promises , all the while undermining our most cherished values and societal institutions :
Our abuse shelters are filled with women who are just as violent as the men they left .
When abused women come for help , they need a safe place where they can get counseling , housing assistance , and treatment for substance abuse problems .
But instead they get a hefty dose of gender ideology proffered in the name of promoting " female empowerment : " http://www.radarsvcs.org/docs/RADARreport-Are-Abuse-Shelters-Helping-True-Victims.pdf
Amanda McCormick of Praxis International recently shocked abuse conference attendees with this calumny : . "
Less than two months later the Department of Justice awarded a $ 3.5 million grant to her organization , prompting Examiner.com columnist Trudy Schuett to wonder why the federal government is using taxpayer money to subsidize anti-male hate - speech .
The domestic violence industry often pretends women are never violence - prone , ignoring the hundreds of studies that show females are equally likely to slap , shove , and punch their spouses and boyfriends :
http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm
Remember former NFL star Steven McNair ?
Each year the domestic violence industry takes in over a billion dollars of federal support .
And what good are those programs doing ?
" NOT PERFORMING : Results Not Demonstrated , " the federal Office of Management and Budget declares on its website : http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/summary/10002150.2004.html
Thanks to the Violence Against Women
Act , the federal government spends millions of dollars each year to promote " mandatory arrest " laws .
But according to research by Harvard economist Radha Iyengar , such policies actuallypartner homicides by nearly 60 % .
In their effort to undermine the family , abuse industry representatives often recite claims like " a marriage license is a hitting license . "
Turns out the opposite is true  persons in stable married relationships are theto be abused , compared to persons in dating or co-habiting relationships .
Legal scholar Jeannie Suk has authored a chilling analysis that details how domestic violence laws allow a man to be vacated from his home without a shred of hard evidence .
Marital break - up ensues and children wind up in a single parent household : http://www.yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/439.pdf
Pay a visit to the website of the DoJ Office of Violence Against Women : www.usdoj.gov/ovw .
Attempt in vain to ferret out even basic information about the millions of taxpayer dollars the agency awards for domestic violence services every year .
The DV industry tries to convince women to summon the police for every tiff and squabble  and rewards them handsomely for doing so .
( One analysis of restraining orders in West Virginia found 70 % of restraining orders are unnecessary or false . )
Before long the legal system becomes bogged down with trivial and false cases of partner abuse  making it harder for the real victims to get the help they so desperately need .
Our Constitution was designed to protect innocent citizens from the arbitrary use of government power .
Maybe that 's why the VAWA Mafia has worked to circumvent constitutional guarantees of due process , probable cause , and equal protection under the law .
Ms. Erin Pizzey was the founder of the first abuse shelter in the world .
In her essay , " The Planned Destruction of the Family , " Pizzey reveals how her movement was hijacked by a group of schemers whose true agenda had little to do with curbing domestic violence .
" Destroy the family and you destroy the country , " Pizzey laments .
Yes , our country needs laws such as the Violence Against Women Act to thwart partner aggression .
But our current approach is in desperate need of an overhaul . ©

The rarely seen creatures in Antarctica 's lush algae " forests " are the subjects of a University of Alabama at Birmingham search for potential new cancer medicines .

Unedited Script
The cold waters near Antarctica are filled with lush forests of 4 main species of large algae plants , or seaweeds .
Researchers are comparing their pervasiveness to giant kelp forests of the more temperate Pacific coast of California .
SOUNDBITE : Chuck Amsler , Phycologist , Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham : “ You enter these dense forests .
They rise up 3 or 4 feet off the bottom just carpeting the bottom . ”
Researchers have found the plants and invertebrates in this region produce defensive chemicals , and some are under study for the treatment of at least one type of cancer .
Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham are in the midst of a 3 - month diving expedition to the frozen continent .
The video , shot by lead researcher Chuck Amsler , shows lush growths below the ocean surface along the western side of Antarctica ’s peninsula .
SOUNDBITE : Chuck Amsler , Phycologist , Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham : “ You do n’t think about there being forests in Antarctica .
But there truly are these forests of giant seaweeds underneath the surface of the water . ”
The large brown algae forest includes one species that can grow up to 50 feet in length and up to 4 feet wide .
These lie on the bottom , at a depth of 100 feet and more , and cover the floor nearly 100 percent in some areas .
Another brown macroalgae , or seaweed , has small spherical gas - filled bladders to make it buoyant , and the 6 foot tall plants stay upright .
Smaller algae grows at shallower depths , but still , often covers the sea floor .
These lush Antarctic forests are different from their counterparts in warmer climates .
SOUNDBITE : Chuck Amsler , Phycologist , Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham : “ And what ’s unusual compared to other large forests of algae in other places in the world , is that these forests of algae are chemically defended .
They are using compounds to make them taste bad . ”
By tasting bad , large algae does n’t get eaten by other organisms .
They feast on smaller algae , and that in turn keeps the small algae from encroaching on the big algae .
Then , besides the forests , there is other thriving life in these cold waters .
SOUNDBITE : Chuck Amsler , Phycologist , Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham : “ There are lots of very steep shores , where especially when we get down deep , we get to be on pretty much vertical walls .
And when you ’re on vertical walls , and there are overhangs and things , the big seaweeds do n’t do as well .
And that ’s where we can start to find really lush and really diverse communities of sponges and colonial sea squirts or tunicates , soft corals , you do n’t think about corals , and it ’s not hard re-forming corals but gorgonian and soft corals .
And they will cover nearly a 100 percent or certainly well over 60 - 70 percent of that surface . ”
From some of the tunicates , the researchers discovered a compound that in the laboratory , in early studies , has been shown to combat some forms of melanoma in mice .
SOUNDBITE : Jim McClintock , Marine Chemical Ecologist , UAB : “ We certainly have the potential of discovering a compound that could help fight cancer , or AIDS or a flu virus , these types of things . ”
Because the water is so cold , the researchers ’ dives are limited to 30 - 40 minutes at a time .
They wear thick layers of underwear under dry suits , but their hands do get cold .
SOUNDBITE : Chuck Amsler , Phycologist , Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham : “ Unfortunately , if we wore as much on our hands as we wore everywhere else , we ’d be wearing boxing gloves and we would n’t get a lot of work done .
So you ’re hands get cold .
We have some tricks , and chemical heater packs on the hands are nice . ”
Their primary goal on these dive studies is to find out more about the ecosystems in these underwater forests , and learn about the relationships between the creatures and plants that live there .

This Friday brings us a new planet reveal .
But first is the next issue of the Threat of Peace comic :
The twenty - sixth issue of Threat of Peace™ delivers the final moments of the battle between the Sith and the Jedi in Dantooine ’s crystal caves .
The death of Master Dar ’Nala restores the prospects for peace and Jedi Knight Satele Shan refused to continue the fight .
As the Republic heroes guardedly depart the crystal caves , Lord Baras offers one final opportunity to Satele and a chilling prediction for the future .
Check out the latest issue of Threat of Peace now .
The more exciting update though is the unveiling of another planet , namely Taris .
If you ’ve played Knights of the Old Republic then you might remember Taris as the planet bombarded by Darth Malek ( while you were still on it ) , which eventually destroyed all life .
But now it seems that in an act of defiance the Republic has decided to try and recolonize it .
As per the official news :
Once home to a thriving civilization , Taris was razed by the Sith Lord Darth Malak 300 years ago during the Jedi Civil War .
As a symbol of hope , redemption , and defiance , the Republic has begun an unlikely effort to re-colonize Taris .
To do so , they will have to deal with the toxic soil , dangerous pirates , and ferocious rakghouls – the only survivors of the Sith bombardment .
Determined to overcome the challenges , Republic and Jedi leaders are moving forward with the effort .
However , Imperial intelligence has other plans …
Access the HoloNet to read about the history of Taris and the re-colonization of this ruined world swarming with rakghouls .
Also , see the scarred surface of Taris in this video and visit the media section for exclusive screenshots , concept art , and wallpapers !
Definitely sounds like an interesting planet .
I just hope that it ’s not a PvP planet ( existing solely to have players fight each other ) .
But we ’ll see .
You can find screenshots and concept art on the planet ’s HoloNet page and there ’s also a new wallpaper :
So that makes eight planets so far .
It definitely feels like they ’ve ramped up the planet reveals in the last few months .
Kucinich : It ’s High Time for Single - Payer Health Care
Created : February 08 , 2010 17:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
As Republican leaders are urging President Obama to scrap the Democrats ’ health care reform legislation and start the process from scratch , they ’ve found an unlikely ally in Rep. Dennis Kucinich .
The Ohio Democrat — a perennial presidential candidate — wants President Obama to consider government - sponsored , single - payer health coverage in lieu of the insurance industry - based reforms being proposed by Democratic leaders .
In a letter to Obama today , Kucinich argues that single payer is “ the only health care [ system ] that has consistently proven to address each of the criteria you have outlined for a satisfactory heath care plan . ”
As you know , Medicare for All increases quality , provides coverage for everyone , and controls costs .
The Ohio liberal is urging Obama to include a single - payer advocate as part of the bipartisan health reform summit the White House will host on Feb. 25 .
Indeed , Kucinich offered himself to be that advocate .
Considering the Obama administration ’s ever wobblier attempt to impose " crippling sanctions " on Iran , the New York Times ‘ David Sanger recently wrote , " The delays and the potential for a substantially watered - down resolution , Mr. Obama ’s allies say , have put the administration ’s credibility on the line in one of its biggest foreign policy challenges . "
Credibility .
Washington policymakers have been in search of it , have even fought wars in its name , for half a century now .
In the Vietnam era , realizing that our victory weapons , nuclear bombs , were essentially too powerful to use , American strategic thinkers sought others ways to project , if not power commensurate with our arsenal , then an image of power commensurate with it – " an image of vast national strength and of unwavering determination to use that strength in world affairs , " as Jonathan Schell explained in his remarkable book from that era , Time of Illusion .
Unfortunately , when you put your faith in " credibility , " you also offer power to others in whose eyes you must , of course , be credible .
By that standard , in the age of Obama , the United States has reached a curious moment of rising incredibility on the global stage .
Indeed , nothing illustrated this onrushing state more vividly than the whack the Israelis recently gave Vice President Joe Biden – and so the global image of American power .
While Biden was in Israel paying homage to that country and trying to jump - start the " peace process , " Israel announced a new building program in East Jerusalem .
The news was n’t in itself particularly startling – such building in occupied lands , after all , has been a nonstop reality of Israeli policy for years .
New was the stunning timing of the announcement , the way the leadership of a country remarkably dependent on American power and money evidently had no hesitation in administering a humiliating credibility - drubbing to Mr. Number Two .
Most observers have discussed this startling act largely in terms of the Middle East , but it was no less striking if you were sitting in Beijing , wondering how exactly to deal with U.S. complaints about the value of the yuan , or in Moscow , where Russian leaders , during a visit by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the following week , duplicated the Israelis ’ act .
They announced that they , too , were about to do a little more building ; they were going to have Iran ’s first nuclear power plant at Bushehr up and running this summer , another credibility - drubbing that was more striking for its timing than its substance .
Nor were they alone .
As Jay Solomon and Peter Spiegel of the Wall Street Journal point out , there has been " a string of public rebukes of U.S. foreign policy in recent weeks , " including by Brazilian President Lula da Silva , who spoke out against Iranian sanctions ( also during a Clinton visit ) , and Syrian President Bashar Assad , who appeared with Iran ’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the head of Hezbollah , " defying U.S. calls to loosen ties with Tehran and the militants . "
The Israelis , the Iranians , the Russians , the Chinese … when the Europeans start to say " no , " and make announcements meant to sting while American officials are visiting , you ’ll know that we ’re in a new world .
In the meantime , consider Prime Minister Netanyahu ’s slap ( and his reiteration of Israeli building policy in his speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention yesterday ) a measure of a Washington with two draining wars and a host of domestic problems that finds itself increasingly incapable of projecting an image of " credibility " abroad .
Fifty years ago , with the invention of what Schell called " the doctrine of credibility , " the U.S. superpower actually gave others the power to judge .
Now , the judgments are beginning to roll in .
As TomDispatch regular Tony Karon , who runs the provocative Rootless Cosmopolitan Web site , makes clear , at least when it comes to Israel , more imagery , no matter how credible , or even more angry words alone , wo n’t help to change that .
Tom
Israel Wo n’t Change Unless the Status Quo Has a Downside
Obama ’s peace effort is doomed because Israel loses nothing if it fails
by Tony Karon
Uncomfortable at the spectacle of the Obama administration in an open confrontation with the Israeli government , Connecticut Sen .
Joe Lieberman – who represents the interests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud Party on Capitol Hill as faithfully as he does those of the health insurance industry – called for a halt .
“ Let ’s cut the family fighting , the family feud , ” he said .
“ It ’s unnecessary ; it ’s destructive of our shared national interest .
It ’s time to lower voices , to get over the family feud between the U.S. and Israel .
It just does n’t serve anybody ’s interests but our enemies . ”
The idea that the U.S. and Israel are “ family ” with identical national interests is a convenient fiction that Lieberman and his fellow Israel partisans have worked relentlessly to promote – and enforce – in Washington over the past two decades .
If the bonds are indeed familial , however , last week ’s showdown between Washington and the Netanyahu government may be counted as one of those feuds in which truths are uttered in the heat of the moment that call into question the fundamental terms of the relationship .
Such truths are never easily swept under the rug once the dispute is settled .
The immediate rupture , that is , precludes a simple return to the status quo ante ; instead , a renegotiation of the terms of the relationship somehow ends up on the agenda .
Sure , the Obama administration and the Netanyahu government are now working feverishly to find a formula that will allow them to move on from a contretemps that began when the Israelis ambushed Vice President Joe Biden , announcing plans to build 1,600 new housing units for settlers in occupied East Jerusalem .
He was , of course , in Israel to promote the Obama administration ’s failing efforts to rehabilitate negotiations toward a two - state peace agreement , a goal regularly spurned by Israel ’s continued construction on land occupied in 1967 .
Once again , as when Obama demanded a complete settlement freeze from the Netanyahu government in 2009 , the Israelis will fend off any demand that they completely reverse their latest construction plans .
Instead , they will shamelessly offer to continue their settlement activity on a “ don ’ t - ask - do n ’t - tell ” basis , professing rhetorical support for a two - state solution to placate the Americans , even as they systematically erode its prospects on the ground .
There is , as former Secretary of State James Baker has noted , no shortage of chutzpah in this Israeli government .
“ United States taxpayers are giving Israel roughly $ 3 billion each year , which amounts to something like $ 1,000 for every Israeli citizen , at a time when our own economy is in bad shape and a lot of Americans would appreciate that kind of helping hand from their own government , ” Baker said in a recent interview .
“ Given that fact , it is not unreasonable to ask the Israeli leadership to respect U.S. policy on settlements . ”
The General Joins the Fray
Sooner or later , the present imbroglio is likely to be fudged over , but make no mistake , it opened Washington up to a renewed discussion of the conventional wisdom of unconditional support for Israel .
It also brought into the public arena the way U.S. administrations over the past two decades have enabled that country ’s ever - expanding occupation regime and whether such a policy is compatible with U.S. national interests in the Middle East .
Back in 2006 , the realist foreign policy thinkers John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt provoked a firestorm of ridicule and ad hominem abuse for suggesting in their book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , that the goals pursued by the two sides were , in fact , far from identical and often at odds – and that partisans motivated by Israel ’s interests lobbied aggressively to skew U.S. foreign policy in their favor .
Israel partisans also heaped derision on the suggestion by the Iraq Study Group commissioned by President George W. Bush that the U.S. would not be able to achieve its goals in the Middle East without first settling the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Response to the reiteration , last week , of the idea that Israel ’s behavior might be jeopardizing U.S. interests has been strikingly muted by comparison .
That ’s because it came from Gen. David Petraeus , commander of U.S. Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , which oversees America ’s two wars of the moment .
He is the most celebrated U.S. military officer of his generation , and a favorite of those most ferocious of Israel partisans , the neocons .
Petraeus told Senators on Wednesday : “ The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in [ CENTCOM ’s ] AOR [ area of responsibility ] . ”
He added , “ The conflict foments anti-American sentiment , due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel .
Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world .
Meanwhile , al - Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support .
The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients , Lebanese Hezbollah and Hamas . ”
He also stressed that “ progress toward resolving the political disputes in the Levant , particularly the Arab - Israeli conflict , is a major concern for CENTCOM . ”
Normally , any linkage between the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and a wave of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world is pooh - poohed by neocons and other Israel partisans .
Typically , they will derisively suggest that those who argue for the linkage made by Petraeus are naive in their belief that al - Qaeda would give up its jihad if only Israel and the Palestinians made peace .
That , by the way , is a straw - man argument of the first order :
The U.S. has done plenty on its own to antagonize the Muslim world , and ending the Israeli - Palestinian conflict would not in itself resolve that antagonism .
The point is simply that a fair solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is a necessary , if not sufficient , condition for repairing relations between the U.S. and the citizenry of many Muslim countries .
Abe Foxman , head of the Anti-Defamation League , who has made a profession of trying to negate the difference between anti-Semitism and criticism of ( or hostility to ) Israel , gamely ventured that “ Gen. Petraeus has simply erred in linking the challenges faced by the U.S. and coalition forces in the region to a solution of the Israeli - Arab conflict , and blaming extremist activities on the absence of peace and the perceived U.S. favoritism for Israel . ”
His conclusion : " This linkage is dangerous and counterproductive . ”
You can , in fact , hear the pain in Foxman ’s admission that “ it is that much more of a concern to hear this coming from such a great American patriot and hero . ”
That Petraeus chose to make his concerns public at the height of a public showdown between Israel and the U.S. , and to do so on Capitol Hill , where legislators seemed uncertain how to respond , signaled the seriousness of the uniformed military in pressing the issue .
Longtime Washington military and intelligence affairs analyst Mark Perry caught the special significance of this at Foreign Policy ’s Web site : “ There are important and powerful lobbies in America : the NRA , the American Medical Association , the lawyers – and the Israeli lobby .
But no lobby is as important , or as powerful , as the U.S. military . ”
He noted as well that , in a January CENTCOM briefing of Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm .
Michael Mullen , Petraeus had evidently suggested the Palestinian territories – over which Israel continues to exercise sovereign military control – be included under CENTCOM ’s area of responsibility , a prospect that would make Israel ’s leadership apoplectic .
It ’s not that , as far as we know , Petraeus harbors any particular animus , or affection , for the Jewish state .
It ’s that , in his institutional role as the commander of hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops stationed across what Washington strategists like to call the “ arc of instability , ” he is concerned about aggravating hostility towards the United States .
The idea that Washington needs to rein in Israeli expansionism and force a political solution to its conflict with the Palestinians is hardly novel for America ’s unsentimental men in uniform .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former U.S. Mideast envoy Gen. Anthony Zinni , both of whom had their formative experiences of the region in the course of massive U.S. military deployments there , were on the same page as Petraeus is today .
Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton is the U.S. officer responsible for creating and training the Palestinian Authority security force that has cracked down on West Bank militants and restrained them from attacking Israel over the past few years .
He was no less blunt than Petraeus in a speech in Washington last year .
He emphasized the premise on which the force was built , and withstood charges from within its own community that it was simply a gendarmerie for Israel : its soldiers believed themselves to be the nucleus of the army of a future Palestinian state .
The loyalty of his men , he warned , should not be taken for granted : “ There is perhaps a two - year shelf life on being told that you ’re creating a state , when you ’re not . ”
Vice President Biden , too , was quoted in the Israeli press as having berated Netanyahu – behind closed doors – over his plans for settlement expansion , warning that it would put at risk the lives of American personnel in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
The Tough - Love Solution
In public , of course , Biden offered familiar pabulum direct from Joe Lieberman ’s “ family ” album : “ From my experience , the one precondition for progress [ in the Middle East ] is that the rest of the world knows this – there is no space between the U.S. and Israel when it comes to security , none .
That ’s the only time that progress has been made . ”
In fact , the history of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict suggests that the reverse is true .
The origins of the peace process the Obama administration is now trying so desperately to resuscitate do not lie in the unconditional American support for Israel that has become a third rail in national politics over the past two decades .
They lie in the national interest - based tough love of the administration of President George H.W. Bush .
Grounded in a realist reading of American national interests across the Middle East – at a moment when a military campaign to eject Saddam Hussein ’s Iraqi forces from Kuwait had put hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops on the ground there – the first Bush administration recognized the need to balance Israel ’s reasonable interests with those of its Arab neighbors .
That ’s why , in 1991 , it dragged Israel ’s hawkish Likud government under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to the Madrid conference , and so broke Israel ’s “ security ” taboo on direct engagement with Yasir Arafat ’s Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) .
The Bush administration also made it clear that there would be immediate and painful consequences for Israel if it continued building settlements on land conquered in the war of 1967 , construction which the U.S. was then willing to term not only “ unhelpful ” – the preferred euphemism of Presidents Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and now Barack Obama – but illegal .
Under the direction of Bush family consigliere and Secretary of State Jim Baker , Washington threatened to withdraw $ 10 billion in loan guarantees if Israeli colonization of Palestinian territory continued .
In the resulting political crisis , Israelis – mindful of their dependency on U.S. support – voted Shamir out of office and chose Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister .
Rabin has been rightly lionized as a leader who took a courageous decision to change course in the face of bitter domestic opposition .
To understand how Israel started down the path of peace , however , it ’s necessary to clean the Vaseline off the lens of history and quiet the string section .
Only three years earlier , Rabin had ordered Israeli troops to use baseball bats to break the limbs of stone - throwing teenagers in hopes of stopping the Palestinian Intifada or uprising .
He certainly did not embrace the Oslo peace process with the PLO out of some moral epiphany .
He changed course thanks to a cold - blooded assessment of Israel ’s strategic position at the time .
The United States then had a growing stake in creating a regional Pax Americana that required Arab support .
Given the end of the Cold War , Israel ’s value as an ally was diminishing , while its expansionist policies , antagonizing Arab public opinion and making it more difficult for vulnerable regional governments to ally with Israel ’s enabler , were increasingly a liability for Washington .
Rabin had reason to believe that U.S. support for Israel at the expense of its neighbors would prove neither unconditional nor eternal .
At the same time , the PLO had been weakened by years of Israeli military attacks and by a disastrous diplomatic blunder – it had aligned itself with Saddam Hussein in the First Gulf War .
It was a fortuitous moment , he concluded , to press for a political solution with the Palestinians on favorable terms , by trading the West Bank and Gaza for peace .
Where Are the Consequences ?
Rabin acted because the consequences of maintaining the status quo seemed increasingly unpleasant , which takes nothing away from his courage in doing so .
The same could be said for South Africa ’s last white president , F.W. de Klerk .
He opted to negotiate an end to apartheid with Nelson Mandela ’s ANC because the collapse of the Soviet Union had removed the most persuasive rationale the U.S. and other Western powers had for backing his white - rule regime .
Similarly , it ’s unlikely that the Soviet political system would have put Mikhail Gorbachev in power if the KGB had n’t determined that far - reaching changes were necessary to prevent Moscow from being eclipsed as a superpower , thanks to Western economic and technological advances .
If U.S. pressure and the specter of isolation and opprobrium pushed Israel onto the path of a two - state solution , the easing of that pressure and the creation of the “ familial ” notion of U.S. - Israel ties have coincided with a steady movement away from completing the peace process .
Even at the height of the Oslo era , coddled by Clinton , the Israelis kept on expanding the settlements that jeopardized geographic prospects for Palestinian statehood .
The Israeli opposition , led by Ariel Sharon and Netanyahu , sought to prove Rabin wrong .
They were convinced that American support could be maintained without conceding Palestinian statehood – by making constant end runs around the Oval Office and appealing directly to Capitol Hill and U.S. public opinion .
Sharon and Netanyahu were vindicated in spades when the suicide - terror strategy taken up by the second Palestinian Intifada and the attacks of 9/11 led George W. Bush ’s administration to reconceptualize the world on the basis of its “ Global War on Terror . ”
This , in turn , led Washington ’s political class to accept Israel not as just another ally in that war , but as a model for how to conduct it .
In the Bush years , the peace process and the two - state solution became a hollow catechism that could be mouthed by Israeli leaders ( and their supporters in Washington ) , while getting on with the task of smashing the Palestinian national movement and expanding settlements .
In real terms , the peace process – the series of reciprocal moves designed to build confidence for concluding final status talks and implementing a two - state solution – died when Ariel Sharon came to power in February 2001 .
Even his 2005 withdrawal of Jewish settlements from Gaza was never conceived in terms of a peace process ; it was n’t even negotiated or coordinated with the Palestinian Authority .
Sharon , in fact , imagined his unilateral withdrawal as a substitute for a peace agreement .
It was designed , as Sharon ’s top aide Dov Weissglass so memorably explained , as a dose of “ formaldehyde that ’s necessary so that there will not be a political process with the Palestinians . ”
Despite mounting Arab exasperation , the Bush administration put no pressure on Israel to bring the peace process to a conclusion , limiting itself to the Grand Guignol of the " Annapolis process . "
With all external compulsion to conclude a peace agreement removed , domestic political pressure in Israel not surprisingly collapsed as well .
The Palestinians were now largely locked behind the vast separation wall that winds through the West Bank and the siege lines of Gaza .
Their plight is once again invisible to Israelis , only 40 percent of whom , when asked by pollsters , even express an interest in seeing the peace process restarted .
Only around 20 percent believe that such a move would bring any results .
“ Israel has no real intention of quitting the territories or allowing the Palestinian people to exercise their rights , ” wrote Israeli political commentator Gideon Levy in Ha’aretz last week .
“ Israel does not truly intend to pursue peace , because life here seems to be good even without it .
The continuation of the occupation does n’t just endanger Israel ’s future , it also poses the greatest risk to world peace , serving as a pretext for Israel ’s most dangerous enemies .
No change will come to pass in the complacent , belligerent and condescending Israel of today . ”
The Obama administration ca n’t be under any illusions on this score .
And they are being forced to confront it by another kind of pressure .
The bills are coming due for Bush ’s War - on - Terror adventurism .
Those responsible for maintaining the U.S. imperium in the Muslim world are now raising warning flags that the price to be paid for continuing to indulge Israel in evading its obligation to offer a fair settlement to the Palestinians could be high – and , worse than that , unnecessary .
Israel ’s leaders , and its voters , have amply demonstrated that they will not voluntarily relinquish control of the Palestinian territories as long as there are no real consequences for maintaining the status quo .
Sure , you can tell them that the status quo is untenable , but the whole history of Israel from the 1920s onward has been about transforming the impossible into the inevitable by changing the facts on the ground .
Building settlements on occupied territory in violation of international law after 1967 seemed untenable at the time ; today , the U.S. government says Israel will keep most of those major settlement blocs in any two - state solution .
It is precisely in line with this sort of improvisational logic that Sharon calculated he could hold on to the settlements of the West Bank if he gave up the settlements of Gaza ; the same logic allows Netanyahu to say the words “ two states for two peoples ” while always winking at his base that he has no intention of allowing it to happen .
A peace process that requires Israel and the Palestinians to reach a bilateral consensus on the distribution of land and power under the prodding of U.S. matchmakers is a non-starter – and therefore unlikely to lead to a goal which is of increasing urgency in America ’s national interest .
Arguably , it ’s increasingly important even for the Israelis , since the status quo has already eroded prospects for a two - state solution to the point where both sides may be consigned to an even longer and bitterer conflict .
Hence , the necessity of correcting Vice President Biden : progress in the Middle East will not come until the U.S. changes Israel ’s cost - benefit analysis for maintaining the status quo .
The only Israeli leader capable of accepting the parameters of a two - state peace with the Palestinians , which are already widely known , is one who can convincingly demonstrate to his electorate that the alternatives are worse .
Right now , without real pressure , without real cost , with nothing but words , there is simply no downside to the status quo for Israel .
Until there is , things are unlikely to change , no matter the peril to U.S. troops throughout the Middle East .

Montreal - based Sani Sport has managed to make a big impact on the sporting world 's injury prevention industry , doing so through the use of their patented machine .
Currently used by twenty seven NHL teams , including the San Jose Sharks , Sani Sport 's machine reduces bacteria that makes sweat - soaked equipment stink , as well as preventing the spread of methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus .
More commonly known as MRSA , this staph infection can have serious consequences if left untreated .
MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics , and generally leads to skin and soft tissue infections .
Although historically it was only seen in hospitals amongst the elderly , MRSA has begun to crop up in locker rooms and athletic training facilities around North America .
In some rare instances it has even resulted in death .
" MRSA is one of the diseases that you can receive from the bacteria in your equipment as it enters your skin through a cut or abrasion , " Sani Sport CEO Steve Silver said .
" What we do is get rid of that bacteria and reduce the risk of injury . "
The Sani Sport cleansing process is a simple one , the entirety of which takes fifteen minutes .
After placing the gear into the machine , ozone and air circulate throughout the chamber .
This is then followed by an automated spray which helps protect the equipment and eliminate any residual ozone left behind .
No water or chemicals are contained in the treatment .
The machine is able to sanitize one full set of adult gear at a time .
Some NHL teams prefer to carry multiple machines ; the San Jose Sharks have chosen to use one .
" I 've been dealing with Mike Aldrich for years , and they are very happy with the technology .
They use the machine all the time , " Silver said .
" It is an important part of what they do to protect their players . "
One of those players is Joe Thornton , who has had a history of MRSA infections .
Thornton started using Sani Sport while with the Boston Bruins , and shortly after being traded to San Jose , the Sharks organization purchased a machine .
Thornton missed five games during the 2002 - 2003 season due to an infected elbow caused by unsanitary pads .
He required surgery to clean the area .
Former NHL right winger Mikael Renberg also ran into trouble with MRSA .
While playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2002 , Renberg cut his hand tying his skates ; the resulting infection nearly required amputation of his arm .
Other documented cases amongst NHL players include Darren McCarty , Ed Belfour , and former - Shark Gary Suter .
Sani Sport 's emergence into the market has managed to greatly reduce these cases .
Although the NFL , CFL , and United States government have purchased this product , the majority of Sani Sport 's sales come in the retail sector .
Small business purchase the $ 10,000 - $ 12,000 machine and charge a fee for it's use , catering to hockey parents who are offended by the smell of their child 's gear , as well as those who are concerned about the health issues that can occur .
The company has also made headway into numerous other areas within the hockey community outside of the NHL .
Partners include USA Hockey , the American Hockey League , and branches of the juniors system .
Although some may typically think of Chris Pronger or Douglas Murray when citing hazards to a player 's health , these tiny microbes of bacteria pose a threat as well .
Every organization 's goal is to keep their assets functioning at the highest level possible throughout the course of the season .
And by reducing the risks associated with MRSA , this machine is helping them to do just that .
Go Sharks .

Germany should set up centres for Islamic studies at two or three state universities to educate Muslim scholars , teachers and pastoral workers for its large Muslim minority , an academic advisory council has said .
The Council on Science and Humanities ( Wissenschaftsrat ) said the lack of such institutes at universities , which already teach Christian and Jewish theology , “ does not do justice to the importance of the largest non-Christian faith community in Germany . ”
Muslim organisations should join advisory boards to help develop Islam institutes and choose faculty members and all main Muslim views in Germany should be represented , it said in a report ( here in German ) on Monday .
“ For me , this is part of a modern integration policy , ” Education Minister Annette Schavan told Deutschlandfunk radio in Berlin .
“ The main question will be who the partner is in developing this . ”
Since the September 11 attacks in the United States , several European countries have been seeking ways to educate Muslim imams and teachers in Europe rather than importing them from Islamic countries out of step with modern western societies .
France has set up an imam training course in Paris run jointly by the Grand Mosque and Catholic Institute , which stepped in after the Sorbonne university declined to join because it might violate the separation of church and state .
Private schools operate in several countries , but the German report advised against this option , saying Islamic studies needed to be in the university system to ensure they met the same academic standards as theology studies of other faiths .
The report said Germany , where around four million Muslims live , has about 700,000 Muslim pupils and would need 2,000 Islam teachers if all states offer religious education for them .
Only a few states now teach Islam , often with teachers from Turkey .
Many German universities teach about Islam in Middle Eastern studies or history courses , but none teach its theology , law and languages in an academic curriculum similar to that used in their Christian theology faculties .
The only German university training Muslim teachers is in Münster , but several Muslim organisations have criticised it because one professor — a German convert to Islam — has questioned whether the Prophet Mohammad actually existed .
The report said the advisory councils meant to help universities develop Islam studies should be made up of representatives of the main Muslim organisations , which are often organised along ethnic or political lines .
“ Various theological schools of Islam should be represented , ” it said .
This would include non-affiliated Muslim academics and minority groups such as the Alevis , “ insofar as they consider themselves as belonging to the Muslim religion , ” it said .
The Alevis , a Sufi group based mostly in Turkey , are considered heretics by many mainstream Muslims .
UPDATE : The council ’s proposal was widely welcomed in German political parties , teachers ’ unions , Muslim organisations and the Catholic Church , according to Die Zeit and Die Welt .
DITIB , the association of Turkish mosques that is the largest Muslim group in Germany , has denied reports that it said it did not need German - educated imams itself because it has imams from Turkey , but has not yet clarified its stand .
The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that several universities , including Tübingen with its famous faculties of Protestant and Catholic theology , have expressed interest in setting up institutes of Islamic Studies .

There are many video games from our youth that we as gamers may introduce to our children .
Few of them will be 3D titles from the Nintendo 64 era .
While games like Mario 64 still stand up , trying to suffer through Goldeneye or Perfect Dark on the original hardware these days is a painful lesson in just how much nostalgia can distort our memories .
The re-release of Perfect Dark on the Xbox 360 Live Arcade wants to fix that , and by updating some aspects of the game and leaving others alone the $ 10 title becomes a fun , if sometimes frustrating , look back at an earlier time in console first - person shooter history .
So what 's better , and why is it hard to look back ?
Let 's dig in .
The graphics and controls
The game now runs at 1080 p , at a smooth 60 frames per second .
The menus , and the character and gun models may have been redone , but they keep the overall look and feel of the original .
What 's left is a Perfect Dark that looks like the original , simply with clearer graphics and play that 's as smooth as Joanna 's wetsuit .
This is how to do this sort of game : keep the aesthetic the same , but improve the fundamentals .
That does n't mean the game does n't look dated , however .
You 'll see repeating textures , clunky , angular models , and some very plain environments .
If you were a fan of the original , this simply allows you to revisit the past without dealing with the horrid framerates of the original , and it will look nice on your HDTV .
The animations are likewise what you remember from the past , which makes the way characters move somewhat amusing to modern eyes .
You 'll also want to take the time to tweak the controls , as the auto - aim feature on the Xbox 360 controller makes combat almost comically easy ; the characters seem to be made of iron and your cross -hair is a magnet .
The controls are another mixed bag .
Classic feels like the original , Spartan changes things into a more Halo feel , and Duty Calls ... well , you can imagine .
Having a button that locks you in place so you can aim more carefully is a throwback to the early days of the N64 controller , but it feels weird now .
The game looks and controls like a carefully updated game that wants to stay true to the original , and there are worse ways to tackle projects like this .
The gameplay
This is where things start to go bad .
The weapons are still fun to play with — there are a wide variety of guns to shoot and be shot by — but there is little in the way of hints or visual elements telling you where to go or what to do .
Combine that with the somewhat bland graphics in many of these environments , and you 'll find yourself turning in circles , becoming lost , and getting frustrated trying to find your next objective .
The single - player game is a good lesson in what we now expect from single - player games ; we 're rarely left alone these days to solve puzzles or explore purely on our own .
While Perfect Dark may frustrate those not familiar with the levels , especially on harder difficulty levels , it 's fun to see just how hardcore gamers used to be .
No hints for us , we 're just going to scour every inch of this hallway until we find what we need !
The game can also be played in two - player co-op , either splitscreen or via Xbox Live .
That is a very good thing .
The multiplayer
Here 's where things get good .
You get all the multiplayer game modes from the original , all the maps , the ability to customize your game damn near any way you see fit , and you can play with up to seven people — for a total of eight players — on Xbox Live .
If you bought this game just for the multiplayer , you did n't waste your money .
Many gamers are clamoring for a re-release of Goldeneye , but licensing has more or less made that an impossibility .
With Perfect Dark , we have been given the next best thing .
All the weapons from Goldeneye will be included in Perfect Dark multiplayer , along with the maps Felicity , Temple , and Complex .
All the multiplayer options are also unlocked from the first time you play , making this an instantly robust experience .
Multiplayer is still a blast with a couch filled with friends , and the inclusion of online play is icing on the cake .
While kids who cut their teeth on Halo may find the game short on charm , those of us who loved the originals are going to enjoy revisiting these levels with these options .
More games need this sort of treatment .
Enough work to make the game look and play better than the original , but enough love of the original to keep the core experience untouched .
This is a high - class take on a game that had major framerate issues on release , and now we can play it the way it always should have been .
Verdict : Buy
WASHINGTON — Google Inc. said European antitrust authorities have opened a preliminary inquiry into complaints about its tactics made by three European Internet companies .
The inquiry , disclosed late Tuesday , appears to focus largely on complaints that Google unfairly ranks the sites of the Internet competitors , in effect lowering their rank in search results that appear on Google sites .
Google denied violating European law or taking any action to stifle competition .
The European Commission inquiry is at an early , fact - finding stage and may not result in any action .
But it appeared to be the first time that European antitrust authorities have examined Google 's conduct outside of a merger review .
The inquiry also comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Google in Europe , where the company has an even more dominant position in search advertising than it does in the U.S .
Google said the allegations were made by Ciao.de , a German subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. , Foundem.co.uk , a U.K. price comparison site , and EJustice .fr , a French site specializing in legal search inquiries .
Foundem and EJustice could not immediately be reached for comment .
Every year , the Big Sandy Shoot draws in hundreds of shooter from all over the world , for what is known as the “ largest shoot ” .
The Big Sandy Shoot is a bi-annual event , held in the western desert of Arizona , where you can shoot your heart out for three straight days .
Featuring a 1500 foot firing line , 1200 yard maximum range , over 1000 reactive targets and aerial targets , this is one shooting exhibition you do n’t want to miss , if you ’re into this stuff .
Machine - guns , gatling guns , bazookas , and pretty much every other type of weapon ever invented can be found at the Big Sandy Shoot .
Shooters have to fork out $ 230 ( $ 200 if reserved in advance ) to participate and spectators just $ 25 .
Both have to sign a release waiver stating they enter the shooting range at their own risk .
The average 3.5 million rounds fired at the Big Sandy Shoot certify it as the world ’s biggest shooting event .
I ca n’t say that impresses me much and regarding the safety , seeing women and kids handling deadly equipment is n’t very reassuring .
Can someone please tell me what the health benefits of cutting out caffeine are ?
Oh ... what ?
You can't ?
That 's because there is no reason for the vast majority of people to reduce caffeine intake .
Ca n't sleep ?
Sure , you can try reducing caffeine consumption .
In reality if you 're sensitive enough for it to cause sleeplessness then you are n't consuming enough of it for there to really be an issue .
High blood pressure ?
Any increase in blood pressure is extremely short lived .
So unless bending over is no - no for you , you 're probably gonna be ok .
In my highly unqualified point of view , the stress of giving it up will increase your blood pressure way more than the caffeine .
1st trimester ?
OK , you got me there .
Caffeine in excess of 200 mg ( about 3 - 4 cups of coffee ) might increase the chance of miscarriage .
For each study that has found a link another has found caffeine safe .
Taking Luvox ?
Being one of the earliest SSRIs , Luvox is now rarely prescribed for much of anything .
A side effect of the medication is that is messes with the way your liver metabolizes all kinds of things .
So it 's possible that your second cup would be like coffee number 4 or 5 for the rest of us .
As an aside , the only growth area for the drug is an off - label use .
Luvox appears to help in the treatment of ... pedophilia !
Caffeine overdose ?
Well , depending on your tolerance and your metabolism , that would be somewhere between 80 and 100 cups of coffee consumed in about 30 minutes .
If you need that much coffee to get out of bed , you may wanna take a personal day .
I could go into the tremendous number of benefits that caffeine brings us , but I 'm beginning to get the shakes and need to fire up another pot .
Sincerely ,
Dan Hughes , Caffeine Pushers of America .

McLaren believes that it is critical that Formula 1's new teams are stabilised as quickly as possible , for the good of the sport .
Following on from the withdrawals of BMW and Toyota at the end of 2009 , and US F1's inability to make it to the grid this season , the Woking outfit 's managing director Jonathan Neale said that the newcomers , such as Virgin and Lotus , should be welcomed into the fold , rather than disregarded for any lack of experience at the top level .
" As a group we have to be supportive in getting new teams off the ground , " Neale told reporters via teleconference .
" I respect greatly what the drivers are saying and one or two have raised concerns about it , but I think that 's a matter for the FIA .
" We have to try and get as many new teams off the ground and stabilise them as quickly as possible because we need it in view of the disappointing losses Honda , Toyota and BMW [ since 2008 ] is disappointing .
I 'd like to think that collectively we can achieve that . "
Despite voicing his support for the new teams , Neale said that he expected the FIA to keep a close eye on their performances , and particularly that of the Spanish HRT squad , as its car will not turn a wheel until first practice in Bahrain this weekend .
" I would n't like to be an MD with a car running for the first time on a GP Friday in terms of the reliability package and how do you dial it in with such limited running and so few tyres , " he added .
" I 'm sure that the FIA will look very closely at it and if there are big gaps in closing speeds and plenty of red flags , then they 'll take the necessary actions .
And it 's important that they do because we do n't want yet more casualties before the start of the season . "
I read this from Bloomberg this morning : Payrolls Probably Increased in March
Employers in the U.S. probably added jobs in March for the second time in more than two years , setting the stage for a broadening of the expansion , economists said before a report this week .
Payrolls probably rose by 190,000 , the most in three years , after declining 36,000 in February , according to the median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Labor Department ’s April 2 report .
Aargh .
As I noted earlier this month in Employment : March Madness , a headline number of 200,000 net payroll jobs might be considered weak !
The March report will be distorted by two factors : 1 ) any bounce back from the snow storms in February , and 2 ) the decennial Census hiring that picked up sharply in March .
These are real payroll jobs , but the Census hiring is temporary - and the Census jobs that are added in March , April and May will all be lost over the following 6 + months .
What we are interested in is the underlying trend of payroll job growth .
To find that number we need to adjust for the Census jobs ( although they are reported NSA ) , and we also need to adjust for the February snow storms .
Later this year we will need to add the Census jobs back to find the trend .
The important point is 190,000 is probably a weak number for March - and probably not " setting the stage for a broadening of the expansion " - although we need to see the details .
There are bold programmers but no old programmers .
That fear - tinged saying echoes even more today among software developers , who fear the recession provides a handy cover for age discrimination in the high - tech world .
But a closer look suggests that it's the nature of IT itself to push its elderly workers out , and in an odd twist , the recession -- at least for now -- has actually protected older workers .
There 's a commercial airing on ESPN right now that features two hiring managers discussing the two job candidates sitting in the lobby .
We see the backs of these candidates ' heads ; one is dark brown and lustrous , the other brittle and gray .
The managers debate -- should they go with the experienced candidate ?
( " He wo n't have energy ! " frets one manager ) -- or the fresh young thing ?
And then -- surprise ! -- the two candidates are the same person before and after a hair - dye job .

It 's a nasty and effective commercial , and one that deftly plays on a pervasive fear of job hunters :
Will my age be held against me ?
And in IT -- where the popular narrative favors kids launching companies in their dorm room or bringing down a corporate network as a way to blow off steam after finals -- that fear of age discrimination is especially pervasive .
The IT workforce by the numbers : Older workers do better Take a look at the numbers defining the scope of the recession .
When you break down the unemployment rate by age group , here 's how it pans out : 16.7 percent for everyone aged 15 to 24 , 8.2 percent for everyone aged 25 to 44 , and 6.3 percent for everyone aged 45 and older .
So , the older you are , the less likely you are to be unemployed .

When you break down the unemployment rate by age group , here 's how it pans out : 16.7 percent for everyone aged 15 to 24 , 8.2 percent for everyone aged 25 to 44 , and 6.3 percent for everyone aged 45 and older .
So , the older you are , the less likely you are to be unemployed .
Federal records show that the older you are , the more money you 're likely to be making :
The median weekly salary for workers in the 16 - to - 24 age bracket is about 41 percent less than what someone aged 25 to 44 makes -- and they 're making 6 percent less than the folks in the 55 - and - up group .
When you look at the numbers in the Computerworld 2009 salary survey , staff - level salaries start at $ 46,975 and climb higher as the jobs proceed up the ( very short ) ladder .
And , unfair as this seems , the more you 're making , the less likely you are to be unemployed .
According to a new study at Northeastern University 's Center for Labor Market Studies [ PDF ] , the unemployment rate for people making between $ 39,000 and $ 50,000 is 9 percent , and it only drops more as your income climbs :
If you 're making $ 79,100 or more , only 3.2 percent to 5 percent of the people in your income bracket have lost their jobs .
Hate - filled bigots marched Monday to demand insults for people of all skin tones , regardless of race or nationality .
WASHINGTON — A coalition of the nation 's most fervent bigots convened in Washington Monday to address growing concerns that the production of hateful new racial slurs has failed to keep pace with the rise in mixed - race births .

According to representatives from the American Racists and Bigots Council ( ARBC ) , the growing number of children born to parents of different ethnicities has posed a real challenge to the nation 's hate - speech developers — a challenge they say threatens their way of life .
" The world is changing , and we , the hateful and ignorant of America , need to change with it , " ARBC chairman Tom Branson said at a rally Monday .
" The time has come for our ugly , intolerant rhetoric to step into the 21st century .
Our disgusting , dehumanizing slurs simply must reflect the terrifying new global society we now live in . "

Added Branson , " In order to continue going backward , we first have to move forward . "
According to statistics provided by the coalition , a rise in the birthrate of mixed - race Americans has left millions of confused racists with absolutely nothing prejudiced to say when confronted by a person of indeterminate or complex background .
What frightens the coalition most is data suggesting that by 2015 , ignorant bigots everywhere could be powerless when it comes to reducing mixed - raced individuals to profoundly uninformed cultural stereotypes .

In response , a number of prominent bigots have proposed steps for developing new slurs and counteracting what many in the racist community believe to be the greatest obstacle to the advancement of racially motivated vitriol .
" It all starts with education , " ARBC strategist Michael McNeil said .
" If you are at a bar drinking boilermakers in a desperate attempt to quell your rage and self - hatred and an Armenian - Brazilian man walks in , you have to be able to swiftly formulate the most vile and thoughtless way to demean him as a human being .
Yell out an outdated or inaccurate slur in a situation like that , and you just wind up looking ignorant . "

" The mind is an incredibly powerful thing , " McNeil continued .
" But it must be fed new and better ways to hate , or it will fail to grow . "
According to coalition representatives , the country 's top racists are working to create a multi-tiered strategy for the coming decade , including seminars on mixed - racial profiling , after - school programs designed to teach children the latest in ethnic stereotyping , and a campaign to provide poor , underprivileged white people with new state - of - the - art racial epithets for daily use .
Advertisement
" We all know that they are here to steal our jobs , marry our children , and take away everything we so desperately cling to , but who are ' they ' really ? "
McNeil asked reporters .
" If we can't answer that simple question , then there 's no way we can go on blindly persecuting those who are different from us .
To tell you the truth , I do n't understand how we ever fell so far behind in the first place .
Damn Nigerian
Jews probably behind it , I bet . "
Although many have expressed doubt over whether the nation 's bigots will be able to remain as effective in this century as they were in the past two , Branson contended that the difficulties of navigating the country 's so - called post - racial landscape are temporary and will soon be rectified .
Advertisement
" This is just a minor setback , " Branson told reporters .
" Our new and improved slurs will soon tip the balance of power back into the hands of honest , hardworking white citizens , and all of the other breeds and half - breeds living within what was still called the United States of America , last time I checked , will go back to whatever dirty little heathen countries they crawled here from and never come back .
Oh , they think they 're so smart , see , but no , they 're not smart at all , none of them , all they are is just a bunch of stupid … goddamn … they 're nothing , do you see what I 'm saying ?
They 're just a dumb… fucking … bunch of …of … . "
" God …damn it , " a red - faced Branson added .
" God…fucking … damn it . "
Taipei , Taiwan
Dick Cheney says President Obama is “ trying to pretend that we are not at war ” with terrorists .
There is only one thing I have to say about that : I sure hope so .
Frankly , if I had my wish , we would be on our way out of Afghanistan not in , we would be letting Pakistan figure out which Taliban they want to conspire with and which ones they want to fight , we would be letting Israelis and Palestinians figure out on their own how to make peace , we would be taking $ 100 billion out of the Pentagon budget to make us independent of imported oil  nothing would make us more secure  and we would be reducing the reward for killing or capturing Osama bin Laden to exactly what he ’s worth : 10 cents and an autographed picture of Dick Cheney .
Am I going isolationist ?
No , but visiting the greater China region always leaves me envious of the leaders of Hong Kong , Taiwan and China , who surely get to spend more of their time focusing on how to build their nations than my president , whose agenda can be derailed at any moment by a jihadist death cult using exploding underpants .
Could we just walk away ?
No , but we must change our emphasis .
The “ war on terrorists ” has to begin by our challenging the people and leaders over there .
If they ’re not ready to take the lead , to speak out and fight the madness in their midst , for the future of their own societies , there is no way we can succeed .
We ’ll exhaust ourselves trying .
We ’d be better off just building a higher wall .

Passages like Genesis 1:26 really make you question the modern interpretation of the bible .
Judaism and Christianity are strictly monotheistic religions based on the principle that there is one single god ; yet , there are several passages in the bible that make references to multiple gods ( i.e. , polytheism ) .
The reason for these contradictions is probably related to earliest Jews being henotheists .
While they only worshiped their own god , they still believed that other gods existed .
Comments haileris writes : hm .
i do n't know exactly , but there are some major translation issues with the bible ... going from Hebrew to greek and latin before reaching modern european languages ...
is there something like Majestic Plural in Hebrew ?
Because it would still be a proper way of talking about himself for the LORD .
Just my two cents on that .
xD
Keep this comic going !
I love it !
The Almighty Guru writes :
There are indeed major translation issues with the bible .
Although we have various early sources , those sources do n't neatly mesh .
We 've known for a long time about the differences between the Hebrew Masoretic text , the Septuagint , and the Samaritan Pentateuch .
More recently , the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered ( which predate the aforementioned sources ) and have several discrepancies with the others as well .
Your comment about the majestic plural is a great point , I 'll see what I can find on that .
There are several other theories for the use of plural " gods " in the bible , and they will be addressed in more detail in the upcoming panels .
Winterset writes : Forgive my interjection , but the majestic plural does n't change the problem .
The majestic plural is a statement using " we " to indicate the entire throne and the descendants / subjects thereof .
In this case there is only one on the throne , no descendants and not yet any subjects as he 's about to create some .
The " royal we " , as it 's called , would still indicate the existence of multiple gods .
Besides , what 's the difference between that god making angels and another creator god making other gods ?
It 's still a self - denying pantheism .
HeebAnon writes : Could be the royal " we " .
Also , Judaism was originally not monotheistic but rather monolatrous ( the difference between not recognizing other gods and not worshipping them ) .
Also , the various text sources are all pretty similar ( not by any means identical ) about the earlier stuff in the bible , IIRC .
DoubleU writes : I 've heard his name was " Elohim " , which means " The Gods " .
I 'm not sure what that means , although I 've heard it taught before that it IS a plural group .
The Almighty Guru writes : " Elohim " is indeed plural .
The singular form is " eloah " .
Katy writes :
There is actually nothing in the bible to deny the * existence * of other gods - it is only forbidden for Yahweh 's pet people to * worship * other gods ...
Also , those who are n't Israelites are not bound to follow the Laws , so all the crazy " thou shall nots " and " do this " stuff in the Old Testament is not relevant to anyone else ...
The Almighty Guru writes :
It may not even be wrong for the Hebrews to worship other gods .
The first commandment reads , " Thou shalt have no other gods - before - me . "
Some people have interpreted this to mean that you can worship other gods , but you must treat Yahweh as the most important god .
Katy writes :
That is certainly true - I 've used that argument myself a time or two , just for fun
:-) TallyHo writes :
Or , He could be referring to the other two parts of the Holy Trinity , or the Trinity as a collective .
The AlmightyGuru writes : @ TallyHo :
That seems unlikely since the idea of the Trinity is never presented in the bible , and certainly was not a part of any of the Jewish texts .
Bahookee writes :
If we being one are three body soul ( mind and emotions ) and spirit ( our essence of our life force .
mthem why can't our creator be three yet one .
The substance tha makes al that exist atoms are three separate and opposite energies yet ONE ...
Everything in life goes to a primary number of what 3 how is it that God say the two shall become one THIS is a great mystery !
God is ONE GOD in three distinctive separate entities the Father Son and Holy Spirit ..
The son does n't mean born of but one of relationship TheAlmighty Guru writes :
Humans are not body , mind , and spirit , they are body alone .
The mind is an emergent property of the brain and there is no such thing as spirit or soul .
Also , atoms are not made of up three energies .
I 'm assuming you 're referring to protons , neutrons , and electrons , but there are actually hundreds of subatomic particles in an atom .
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle)
It is a logical absurdity to say that something has more than 100 % or is made up of 100 % of two or more over - lapping or contradicting properties .
Saying that Jesus was 100 % human and 100 % God is like saying that a color is 100 % black and 100 % white .
Guest writes :
What are these " atoms " of which you speak ?
It sounds as though some forgettable idiot stumbled into some sort of small particle and had a desperate need to compensate for something so they started screaming about it being indivisible even though the consistent variation between them makes it pretty clear that they are working off of some systemic variation drawn forth from variations in their constituents ...
Next thing you know there will be abject morons of obscene incompetence talking about multiple universes as though fundamental concepts of the composition of existence are toys that the first half - baked idiot that stumbles into an embarrassingly immature concept can just tear down thousands of years of gradual progress because they want to big - note themselves ...
I mean , how are we supposed to discard god if we throw away the concept of the universe ?
I mean , the vast majority of god- worship is based upon " it created us so whatever it says is exactly what we deserve " but it is obvious that there are no external influences to the universe , thus there is nothing external to justify its existence and everything internal is a product of its nature and thus subordinate to it and thus irrelevant to its justification .
Therefore the universe exists because it " just does " and thus and gods that exist are , at best , products of " just happened to be a component of the single scenario of all of existence that just happened to be the one that happened to exist " and thus , ultimately , any form of creator - worship must inherently be subservient to the ultimate creator : Dumb luck !( no , not fate , fate would have properties , and thus could n't exist without the universe , dumb luck can only impart properties to the universe because dumb luck is a fictional concept to describe valid justifications that are not justified ... )
Oh the irony !
Twitter founder Evan Williams tweeted yesterday : " Met the Dalai Lama today in LA .
Pitched him on using Twitter .
He laughed . "
Who 's laughing now ?
The @DalaiLama account is up and running .
And , unlike a previous hoax account , this appears to be the real deal .
Twitter 's new vice president of communications , Sean Garrett , just welcomed the Tibetan spiritual leader to the site .
The account is here .
The Dalai Lama already has more than 6,000 followers .
While the Dalai Lama has an affinity for technology , Twitter has been blocked in China since last year .
Not a bad day for Twitter .
It announced earlier that it is posting 50 million tweets a day .

Many thanks to the Linux Outlaws for mentioning this on a recent episode of their excellent podcast …
Two weeks ago today the Linux Mint blog announced the passing of Mats Geier , well - known in their forums as “ Husse ” .
The 250 - plus comments below the post make for a powerful tribute , the likes of which I ’ve not seen anywhere else on the web .
As I ’ve only dabbled in Mint myself I never had the pleasure of interacting with Mr. Geier on the forums , but I think I know people like him .
People like Jon Ramvi of Easy Peasy , who spent an evening ( off an on ) walking me through the security aspects of Linux filesystems on IRC , and gave me the opportunity to test a brand - new login theme for his netbook OS .
People like Adam McDaniel , who spent more than two hours with me on Skype troubleshooting a broadband data connection with Jolicloud and Nokia ’s Booklet 3G .
Or the Linux Outlaws themselves ( aka Fab and Dan ) who tirelessly celebrate the heroes of open source and their feats each and every week .
To the entire Linux community I ’m so very grateful for your generosity , your genius and your patience .
I ’m not so naive to not understand that some of you are on a payroll or have a vested interest in a particular product or service .
But together you have done amazing things to keep our computers and Internet open and free .
You ’ve changed the world , and me .
Your noble work will not be forgotten .
Nor will Mats … rest in peace .
How about discovering a temperate planet outside our solar system that will actually be relatively easy to study ?
Spanish researchers have done just that , according to Science News .
The newly spotted planet , COROT - 9b , is 1,500 light years away .
It is n't , itself , Earth - like — think something more akin to Jupiter or Saturn — but its atmosphere might contain water vapor , and , if it turns out to have any moons , those could be habitable .
Most important , though , is the fact that researchers can actually study the thing .
Although a number of extrasolar planets with moderate temperatures have been discovered , only a planet that passes in front of — or transits — its star can be studied in depth .
The starlight that filters through the atmosphere of the planet during each passage reveals the orb's composition , while the amount of starlight that is blocked outright indicates the planet 's size .
All the other transiting planets seen so far have been " weird — inflated and hot " because they orbit so close to their stars , notes study collaborator Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory in Sauverny , Switzerland .
Deeg , Queloz , and their colleagues report their findings in the March 18 Nature .

The Bloom Box fuel cell device has been the subject of plenty of controversy since its unofficial unveiling in a 60 Minutes segment earlier this week .
The device , which has already been installed on the campuses of major companies like eBay , Google , Staples , and FedEx , converts natural gas into electricity .
But how efficient is it ?
Is the box worth the money ?
Amy Skoczlas Cole , the Director of eBay ’s Green Team , spoke with us briefly about eBay ’s installation of five Bloom Boxes .
According to Cole , the boxes take up 3,000 square feet of space and produce 500 kilowatts of power–enough to take 15 % of the San Jose , California , campus ’s energy use off the grid .
At the moment , eBay is running its Bloom Boxes off natural gas , but the company plans to switch to biogas sometime in the near future .
“ We ’re in the stages of finalizing the contract to turn on biogas , ” Cole explained .
Once the system switches to biogas , the Bloom Box energy process will have net zero production of CO2 .
EBay ’s Bloom Boxes complement the 3,246 solar panels on the roof of the company ’s LEED Gold - certified headquarters .
But the Bloom Boxes are ultimately more efficient .
“ The solar panels takes 55,000 square feet and at their peak performance takes 18 % of our electricity use off the grid , but that ’s not at night or on days when we have rain , ” Cole said .
“ Running the two side by side over the course of a year , we will get 5 times as much energy from the Bloom system . ”
Bloom Boxes do n’t come cheap–companies pay $ 700,000 to $ 800,000 a pop–but Cole estimates that eBay ’s system will pay for itself within three years .
Since the system started running seven months ago , eBay has already saved $ 100,000 in electricity costs compared to power from the grid .
And so far , the company has n’t had any big issues with the system .
“ Maintenance teams have had to come out to replace wafers in the system before , but that
was part of standard maintenance .
The way the system is built there
are hundreds if not thousands of the wafers in each system , so it did n’t cause us any particular issues , ” Cole said .
eBay ’s maintenance contract lasts 10 years , which says something about how long Bloom expects its boxes to run .
Over the past 7 months , eBay has managed to keep its system under wraps–even to employees .
“ The boxes sat behind a fence for a long time while they were being installed , ” Cole explained .
“ But we gave our employees a heads up about the 60 Minutes piece . ”
Eventually , eBay might add even more Bloom Boxes to its main campus .
“ We ’re actively in discussion about what more we can do together , ” Cole said .
“ It ’s a terrific new technology that we ’re really excited to be early adopters of . ”

For more than a century , a few scientists have occasionally daydreamed of transforming much of the Sahara desert green , with a lush inland sea or vast tracts of farmland .
Now researchers say they have actually found a way to make such a scheme work with forests across the desert -- and to slow climate change in the process .
The idea is the brainchild of Leonard Ornstein , a cell biologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine , who partnered with climate modelers David Rind and Igor Aleinov of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , all in New York City .
They envision desalinating seawater from the neighboring oceans and bringing it inland using aqueducts and pumps .
Drip irrigation -- plastic tubing to water the trees ' roots -- would minimize the amount of water lost to evaporation and seepage into sandy soils , allowing trees to prosper in areas that are parched today .
According to climate simulations to be published next month in the journal Climatic Change , the forests would cool the Sahara by up to 8 °C in some areas .
" Eucalyptus grandis and a large number of other tropical tree species are heat - tolerant , so long as they have an ample supply of water in the root zone , " Ornstein says .
The tree cover would also bring more rain -- about 700 to 1200 millimeters per year -- and clouds , which help reflect the sun 's rays back into space .
The scheme could also work for the arid Australian outback , the team reports .
Ornstein says that if most of the Sahara and Australian outback were planted with fast - growing trees like eucalyptus , the forests could draw down about 8 billion tons of carbon a year - - nearly as much as people emit from burning fossil fuels and forests today .
As the forests matured , they could continue taking up this much carbon for decades .
The project would n't be cheap .
Adding up the costs for building , running , and maintaining reverse - osmosis plants for desalination and the irrigation equipment , the researchers put the price tag at some $ 2 trillion per year .
The price would be roughly comparable to that of capturing carbon dioxide at power plants and storing it underground , which would eventually cost about $ 200 per ton of carbon , according to a recent study from Harvard University 's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs , compared with about $ 400 per ton of carbon for the forests .
" Any solution to climate change has to be a multitrillion - dollar project , " Ornstein says .
" The issue is what the payback is . "
In several decades , the forests could be sustainably harvested as a source of fuel for wood - burning power plants , making them a nearly carbon - neutral energy source , Ornstein argues .
Planting these forests might have side effects .
The increased moisture could trigger plagues of locusts in Africa , just as the odd wet year does now .
It could also dampen existing soils , stopping iron - rich dust from blowing off the Sahara and into the Atlantic Ocean , where it nourishes sea life , the study points out .
Despite the drawbacks , the proposal " is incredibly important and definitely worth taking seriously and looking into further , " says atmospheric scientist Richard Anthes , president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado .
" The benefits could be enormous and go well beyond carbon sequestration , " making vast areas far more livable and productive .
The key issue is whether desalinating enough seawater would be affordable , Anthes adds .
" This paper suggests that it is . "
XSS ( Cross Site Scripting ) became a favored attack method in the last years .
Several things are possible using an XSS vulnerability ranging from small annoyances to a complete desaster .
The XSS prevention cheat sheet states 6 rules to prevent XSS attacks .
For a complete solution output encoding is needed in addition to input validation .
Here I take a further look on how to use the built in encoding methods in grails applications to prevent XSS .
Take 1 : The global option
There exists a global option that specifies how all output is encoded when using $ {} .
See grails - app/ conf / Config.groovy :
//
The default codec used to encode data with $ {} grails.views.default.codec=" html " // none , html , base64
So every input inside $ {} is encoded but beware of the standard scaffolds where fieldValue is used inside $ {} .
Since fieldValue uses encoding you get a double escaped output – not a security problem , but the output is garbage .
This leaves the tags from the tag libraries to be reviewed for XSS vulnerability .
The standard grails tags use all HTML encoding .
If you use older versions than grails 1.1 : beware of a bug in the renderErrors tag .
Default encoding $ {} does not help you when you use your custom tags .
In this case you should nevertheless encode the output !
But problems arise with other tags like radioGroup like others found out .
So the global option does not result in much protection ( only $ {} ) , double escaping and problems with grails tags .
Take 2 : Tainted strings
Other languages / frameworks ( like Perl , Ruby , PHP , … ) use a taint mode .
There are some research works for Java .
Generally speaking in gsps three different outputs have to be escaped : $ {} , <% % > and the ones from tags / taglibs .
If a tainted String appears you can issue a warning and disallow or escape it .
The problem in Java / Groovy is that Strings are value objects and since get copied in every operation so the tainted flag needs to be transferred , too .
The same tainted flag must also be introduced for GStrings .
Since there is n’t any implementation or plugin for groovy / grails yet , right now you have to take the classic route :
Take 3 : Test suites and reviews
Having a decent test suite in e.g.
Selenium and reviewing your code for XSS vulnerabilities is still the best option in your grails apps .
Maybe the tainted flags can help you in the future to spot places which you did n’t catch in a review .
P.S. A short overview for Java frameworks and their handling of XSS can be found here
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt today lambasted the British government for the disclosure of seven paragraphs of a “ redacted ” CIA report on the abuse of a British national at Guantanamo Bay .
Binyam Mohamed
LaBolt said the administration was “ deeply disappointed ” in the ruling of the British court , adding that “ we shared this information in confidence and with certain expectations . ”
The paragraphs were released earlier today on the British Foreign Office website , and conceded , among other things , that the detainee , Binyam Mohamed , faced “ at the very least cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities . ”
Mohamed was released in early 2009 , and all charges against him were dropped .
LaBolt suggested that the US would be more cautious about releasing intelligence to Britain , as the confidentiality of such releases would be in doubt .
The British government had fought against the release , insisting that national security rested on its ability to keep such secrets .
The goal of every story is to form some degree of connection with its observer .
Most often , this link is fleeting at best , but every now and then , a much deeper bond is formed .
This bond is one in which the observer is less of a passive participant and more of an emotionally engaged accomplice .
Though many video games ( as well as most novels and movies ) strive to be the latter , Heavy Rain is one of those few games that can claim to have truly achieved this lofty objective .
A powerful interactive drama , Heavy Rain is an intensely absorbing experience that meticulously conveys the tension , urgency , surprise , and tragedy that its characters feel .
Though the overall direction of the plot cannot be changed , the ongoing narrative adapts to your every action and cultivates a deeply personal journey that leaves everyone who undertakes it with something different .
How far are you prepared to go to save someone you love ?
This is the central question of Heavy Rain and one that the protagonist , Ethan Mars , is compelled to answer .
After Ethan 's son goes missing and is presumed to be the latest victim of the mysterious Origami Killer , he vows to do whatever it takes to rescue his boy .
Besides Ethan , you also take control of three other seemingly unrelated individuals that have been drawn into the case : private investigator Scott Shelby , FBI criminal profiler Norman Jayden , and insomniac Madison Paige .
Though it takes a little while to pick up , Heavy Rain is an immersive interactive drama that sucks you in and does n't let go .
As you control each of the four characters , onscreen prompts have you press buttons in sequence , move the right analog stick in specific directions , shake the controller , and more to interact with the scenes .
Each input is proportionally difficult to the task being performed , and when a character is scared or stressed , the floating prompts tremble accordingly .
This unconventional control scheme does a fantastic job of grounding you to the characters and their emotional states .
Your actions approximate theirs , and the often short amount of time you have to react to new situations mirrors their own reaction time .
There is plenty of action to be found in the form of brutal and violent brawls , heart - pounding chases , and deadly gunfights , but even such mundane tasks as brushing your teeth or rocking a baby to sleep are surprisingly engaging , and help to strengthen your bond with the characters .
Unlike other games that make extensive use of quick - time events , Heavy Rain does not track your progress in terms of success and failure .
There is no right or wrong way to play ; thus , no matter what your outcome is , the game will move forward and adapt to the consequences of your actions or lack thereof .
Though the overall narrative framework is unyielding , your performance throughout the game can have a variety of effects , ranging from subtle changes in how a scene plays out to much bigger adjustments .
Entire events may not occur because your actions and choices caused the plot to branch in a different direction .
It 's even possible for key characters to die , thus eliminating any subsequent contributions to the story that they might have made .
No matter what happens in your play - through , the adaptive plot of Heavy Rain becomes a deeply personal sum of your experiences .
Even seemingly mundane scenes like this help better connect you to the characters .
Though Heavy Rain 's involving story is its greatest strength , it is also somewhat of a weakness in terms of the game 's replayability .
Clocking in at an intensely satisfying eight to 10 hours , Heavy Rain is full of branching plot points and permutations , but it 's hard to actually go back and play through the game differently once you 've completed it .
Your story -- the one that you got so caught up and invested in -- has already been told ; thus , the characters you bonded so closely with wo n't be the same if you do things differently .
A chapter - select screen allows you to smartly play through some of these " what if " scenarios if you like , but scenes are rarely as impactful the second time .
Minor issues with replayability aside , Heavy Rain is not a flawless narrative experience -- it suffers from some bigger problems as well .
Scene to scene , the game does a fantastic job of drawing you into the action and the minds of its characters .
However , there are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies that work against this immersion .
For example , there are several obvious leads and key pieces of evidence in the case of the Origami Killer , which the police department seems completely unaware of .
And a major plot point that haunts Ethan throughout a number of early scenes is never explained in the slightest .
Depending on how you play through the game , you may be left scratching your head wondering what happened or how characters that never seemed to meet know each other .
The story also features a number of over - the - top or cliche villains that seem out of place in the realistic setting , including an overly - aggressive detective and a super - sleazy nightclub owner .
Heavy Rain 's problems are n't strictly limited to the plot either -- there are a number of other flaws as well .
You move your character forward by pulling the R2 trigger and alter the direction he or she is facing by moving the left analog stick .
On paper , this is a sound system , but in practice , it is clumsy and imprecise .
The frame rate is inconsistent , screen tearing is frequent , and noticeable texture pop -in occurs almost every time something is closely examined .
Rare immersion - breaking glitches can also occur , including audio that does n’t match what ’s happening onscreen , and textures failing to load and leaving you with either an all - black environment or a silhouetted character .
These technical issues are particularly unfortunate , because Heavy Rain is generally a beautiful and fantastic - looking game .
The visual design of the various environments is outstanding , and whether you 're visiting a dirty double - wide or an intensely creepy room filled with webcams streaming live video to nearby TVs , the painstaking amount of detail that went into constructing each locale is incredible .
Character models are hyperrealistic -- particularly in how they move and interact -- and in many ways , they emote just as well as any real person .
Occasionally , a stiff or awkward animation will crop up such as a robot - like march upstairs , but for the most part , characters move extremely well .
Finally , an excellent orchestral score stirs up your emotions in just the right way , and the mostly great voice acting completes the human element to round out the experience .
Quick - time events are employed for much of Heavy Rain 's action .
Though it suffers from its share of plot and technical problems , Heavy Rain is nonetheless a bold and visionary step forward in the medium of interactive storytelling .
Part adventure game and part psychological thriller , Heavy Rain is far from the quick - time - event - powered movie that it may appear to be at first glance .
Every action you perform or decision you make -- from the simple and mundane to the dark and disturbing -- brings you closer to the flawed but realistic characters you manipulate .
Their stories become your story , and their hardships become obstacles that you feel compelled to overcome with them .
No matter how your adventure plays out , Heavy Rain is a profoundly personal experience that should not be missed .
Research in the Congo River Basin has determined that 3 million tons of bushmeat are being removed every year , the equivalent of butchering 740,000 bull elephants .
Malnutrition and the ease of access to weapons has caused the rate of poaching to increase dramatically .
Most animals taken are small antelopes , but even monkeys are gorillas are being killed for their food .
But in a 500 million acre region of the Congo Basin stretching into eight countries , hunting has reached an unprecedented scale .
Researchers from the Overseas Development Insititute calculated that 3.4 million tonnes of bushmeat is removed every year from that area alone , equivalent to the weight of 40.7 million men .

The Tehran regime has new gear to help squash today 's pro-democracy protests : high - tech anti-riot vehicles , imported from China .
Live bloggers of the events reported seeing the vehicles stationed around the city , noting " it appears that they will be used in the suppression of people 's protests today . "
Suppression may be a bit of an understatement since the armored vehicles are apparently " equipped with water cannons that can douse people with boiling water or teargas . "
One Iranian opposition site reports that the vehicles " have a capacity of 10,000 liters to shoot cold and hot water , and three 100 liter tanks to shoot burning chemical liquids " at a distance of up to 70 meters .
Manufactured by Dalian Eagle - Sky Co. , the vehicles cost an estimated $ 650,000 .
The site also said that " a lot of extra burning liquid , paint , and tear gas was purchased " in addition to the vehicles .
The riot stoppers are another example of how China is surpassing the European Union as Iran 's biggest trading partner .
Iran is also using paint in more low - tech suppression tactics .
Having successfully restricted the digital flow of information by cutting off access to GMail , the Iranian government is using spray paint and paintball guns to mark protesters in order to easily identify and arrest them later .
Jason Shams over at the Daily Beast notes that the regime forces " marked people with spray paint or shot them with paintball guns when they could n’t arrest them because things were too chaotic .
Later , when things died down and the mass groups dissipated , the Guards arrested those with paint on their clothes . "

I was standing outside my office yesterday during an unseasonably warm , sunny , winter day .
It ’s been that way for the past month , and I have no complaints .
A co-worker walked by and we both commented about the beautiful day .
However , she said it ’s sad for the environment that global warming is working this quickly .
Huh ?
Any scientist would tell you that our current weather is being driven by larger cyclical forces and not global warming ( although it is cyclical as well ) .
El Nino is a well - researched phenomenon that just happens to be occurring right now .
The model predicts warm weather , and that ’s exactly what we ’re seeing .
And for the folks we left behind on the east coast – enjoy the snow , just like the model predicts .

In PiSigma way in Agda TypeConstructorsWhichPreserveGuardedness.agda 29/3 Cont .
Universe of sets with decidable equality using codata .
data Rec( A : infinity Set ) :
Set where fold : flat A ->
A mutual -- A code can be infinite data Data :
Set where empty : Data maybe : infinity Data ->
Data -- the only way to guard sigma : usual --
El a does not contain infinite things , as you can see no infinity here El : Data ->
Set El empty = bottom El ( maybe A ) = Rec( Sharp Maybe ( El ( flat A ) ) ) El ( sigma A B ) = the usual -- nat is the least fixpoint of Maybe nat : Data nat = maybe( Sharp nat ) --
This is a shallow embedding of the recursive type definition z :
El nat z = fold nothing s : El nat ->
El nat s n = fold ( just n ) Trying to define eq for each El a. 2 problems of Agda were fixed .
1 . Obviously the constructor Rec ( any constructor ) preserves guardedness , but Agda did n't know it . ->
Nisse fixed it 2 .
Agda thought this co-induction co-recursion is not strictly positive , because of the hidden argument A of flat . ->
Fixed .
reflexivity , substitubitiby , etc proven , but with termination problem .
30/3
Yesterday's fix ( making type constructors to be guardedness preserving ) was too much of a fix : this also pass the type checking .
data Endo A : Set where endo : ( D -> D ) -> D D = Rec( #( Endo D ) )
New fix : type constructor only guards positive args .
Now this made yesterday 's Thorsten 's example NOT pass .
due to the matching occuring in the use of Sharp .
Final fix :
Let the positivity checker go inside the pattern when checking .
So now , flat : { A} -> inf A ->
A flat ( # x ) = x passes positivity check as intended , and flat ( # x ) = x -> x woudl n't .
Other observation : Gurdedness preserving type constructor allows induction - recursion without induction . - A nice explanation of induction - recursion .
( But needs strengthening the productivity checker . )

Reflection = representing Agda values as Agda terms , as in RingSolver .
Problem : user must manually write out the representation even thou
you and Agda know what it represents .
Solution : Automaticaly getting the representation from the current goal .
... open import NatSolver plus-zero : \all n -> n + 0 equiv n plus - zero = quoteGoal t in {!
t !}-- t is the string rep of the goal type plus - zero = quoteGoal t in {!
solve t !} plus - zero = quoteGoal t in solve t {! tt !} plus - zero = quoteGoal t in solve t _ Currently the type of t is String and solve must parse t , but Thorsten is making it to be the Agda version of the whole of ISyntax .
foo :
String foo = quote ( \ x -> x ) ---> foo = " \x -> x "
Need to keep / recognize higher level structure in normalised semantics ?
In future , we maybe able to use Agda as its own tactics language like Ltac .

Did an experiment on whether it's good to remove eta-expansion on records .
Eta-eq on records with deep hiearchy are causing perf .
prob .
Made sure do n't eta-expands too much .
Tried to remove eta-equality on records altoghter ( When you want , you can still specify to use eta-expansion . )
The result of experiment is that you do want eta-expansion most of times , because otherwise constraints solving ( among projections on metas ) does n't work well .
So we keep record eta-expansion , but try harder to avoid unnecessary expansion .
Figuring out why it 's slow based on some examples .
30/3
Decided it 's not optimal to changing variable rep etc as a sprint .
More profiling on memory usage .
- RTS flags .
Two things :
1 . Changing equality on Sharps 2 .
Structural equality ( after variable rep etc. are changed . )
( There is a potential str.eq . would make Agda slow - so we may not do it after all . )
( The necessity for str.eq. may be not so much . )
4. Nisse , Ulf , Andreas , Thorsten Smarter productivity checker Sized types in Agda ( evidence based termination checking via sized types ) Theory Sprint : Modular nesting of inductive - coinductive types Together with 3 . , self - organizing 25 /3

Agreed on how to interprets data types and so on .
Fixed the defect that the current termination checker is not modular w.r.t. extensional semantics .
Discussed whether " notation with infinity and sharp are too low level " OR NOT .
Will figure out what they mean and MAYBE later will give some sugar .

30/3 See the 1B entry .
Andreas : Termination checking
A patch submitted for new termination checking .
The size differences recognized by Current Termination Checker are just {0 , 1 , infinity} .
New Termination Checker can count more than that .
Consider the terminating f zero = zero f ( suc zero ) = zero f ( suc ( suc n ) ) with zero ... | m = f ( suc n ) which translates to f ( suc ( suc n ) ) = aux n zero aux n m = f ( suc n ) and confuses termination checker .
A new flag " - - termination - depth=2 " ( or 3,4 , .. ) makes termination checker to see deeper .
( Similar attenuation is done for whether termination checker uses dot- pattern arguments or not . )
Caveat : On Tree - like data , it does not work so well .

A model is constructed in Agda ( ParamSetoidModel.agda ) mutual data TyCode : Set where U : TyCode Pi : ( a : TyCode ) -> ( f : el a -> TyCode ) -> ( F : {d ' d : el a} -> eq d' d -> f d <= f d ' ) -> TyCode Pi- : ( a : TyCode ) -> ( f : el a -> TyCode ) -> ( F : {d ' d : el a} -> f d <= f d ' ) -> TyCode el : TyCode ->
Set el U = UCode el ( Pi a f F ) = Sigma ( (d : el a ) -> el ( f d ) ) ( \ g -> \all {d ' d} ( d ' -d : eq d' d ) -> eq{f d}(g d ) {f d'} (g d' ) ) el ( Pi- a f F ) = Sigma ( (d : el a ) -> el ( f d ) ) ( \ g -> \all { d ' d} -> eq{f d}(g d ) {f d'} (g d' ) )
Intuition for this hetero equality : " equal after erasing the irrelevant argument " 300 lines .
Conclusion : IT 'S DONE .
30/3 Discussion continued .
Implementing in Agda would be a major change .
We are not clear about Syntax yet ( Mini - Agda uses [..] but ca n't take them away from user . )
Suggested for similarlity with dot- pattern
(.x : A ) ... {.x : A} ...
The problem :
We loose the invariant " when comparing two things they are of the same type . "
This would necessiate extra check before instantiating meta variables .
Cost / Benefit - extra check + parametric things does n't have to be compared .
Idea : Keep track of ' tainted ' terms and do the extra checking only under parametric binders ;
Then , we do n't pay performance penalty so long as we do n't use parametric functions .

Keishi Okamoto and Yoshiki discussed about the following :
31/3 A logic for small step semantics
By C P , we wish to express a property that “ P holds during the whole execution of C ” In Dynamic Logic , one writes [ C ] P for “ P holds just after the execution of C terminates ( if it ever terminates ) , ” but it does not say anything about what happens during the execution of C .
For instance , one wants to assert sort an array a using an index i “ i is in the range of indices of the array a ”

Obviously cron jobs are abundantly useful for so many things , all the way from basic housekeeping up to big application functionality .
They ’re also the source of plenty of flail .
What do I mean ?
They are neither code nor data , so often get overlooked , or shonkily installed , by application deployment tools
They run with a minimal environment that can catch out the unwary : scripts that work in interactive shell sometimes do n’t from cron
The default behaviour of mailing output to the cronjob owner generates large amounts of mail that gets ignored , filtered or bounced
Jobs can fail silently and no - one notices until , say , you need to restore that backup that has n’t run for last six months
Jobs that helpfully append their output to a log commonly do n’t rotate that log
It ’s easy to have jobs overlapping if they get stuck or take longer than expected to complete .
This is a splendid way of wedging a machine .
The mail aspect is a particular peeve .
In some jobs my mailbox has enjoyed several thousand cron generated mails a day , and there ’s no way I ’m able to accurately look at each one and react to it .
Mostly they contain expected output from successful job execution , so they ’re easy to skip .
But I do n’t trust my eyes to get that right all the time .
One approach to this is to arrange for jobs to only send mail on error .
This is an improvement , but can lead into thinking that a job is happily succeeding when in fact it ’s either not running or the only - on - error logic is bust .
Since cron jobs often cover essential system tasks like backing up , syncing data around and reporting it ’s vital that they do n’t fail silently .
I ’ve worked somewhere that tackled this by collating cron-generated mails from diverse systems into a system mailbox and pattern matching them for failure signs .
This seems slightly dubious — it ’s fragile and labour intensive — but at least the system also flagged if expected jobs failed to arrive and got our inboxes tamed .
To tackle these problems I find myself writing wrappers for cronjobs .
I ’ve written several variants to meet different situation ’s needs .
Unhelpfully I call them all cronwrap .
These wrappers sets out to
Engage the amazingly useful lockrun utility to guard against multiple execution of stuck crons
utility to guard against multiple execution of stuck crons
Place cron output into timestamped logs that can be both aged out and made available to interested parties
Hook into local monitoring systems :
On execution , update a run counter ( SNMP data or some simple text file )
On failure , send a SNMP trap or leave some bait for Nagios .
Also , update a fail counter
If lockrun has prevented a job running owing to overlap , send a SNMP trap or similarly bait Nagios
If required , send output by mail somewhere ( sometimes this is necessary , even with the concerns listed above )
So , nothing surprising there .
Using such wrappers helps keep cron jobs tamed and reliable , and it ’s monitoring them near to where the action occurs , rather than mediating via SMTP .
This is hardly invention either , there ’s plenty of prior art with different nuances in behaviour to meet the needs of different environments .
Perhaps I ’ll merge the variants of my efforts and publish too .
What ’s curious is that this functionality is n’t available inside the cron daemon itself .
It is perfectly placed to catch exit status , divert output and know if a job has overrun ; and would remove the need for all this additional monkeying to make jobs reliable and well behaved .
If my C was n’t just read - only I ’d have a crack at it !
There , I ’ve finally condensed all my cron rant into one sustained piece .
Update : I posted a cron wrapper at https://github.com/zomo/cronwrap.
Peeps are adorable .
The soft sugary crunch .
Bright yellow and blue .
Long soft bunny ears .
Brown eyes and nose .
And those often - flattened chick beaks .
But how do you take these delightful marshmallows up to the next level ?
I love them just the way they are , straight out of cellophane - covered boxes , but I love them even more when they are dipped in delicious white chocolate and covered with colorful candy and sugar sprinkles .
Okay , I have to admit that I got a little carried away when I made chocolate - dipped strawberries the other day .
But , seriously , the delicious sugar - covered white chocolate layer adds flavor and texture to these bunnies and chicks and make them so much more delightful .
Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler or in a homemade double boiler .
I used Venezuelan El Rey Icoa white chocolate with 34 % cocoa .
It ’s pure and fragrant and has a wonderful smooth texture .
Place the white chocolate chips in a metal bowl and set the bowl over a pot of simmering water .
The metal bowl should be big enough so that it sits on top of the pot without touching the water .
Turn off the heat .
Stir the chocolate from time to time until completely melted and smooth .
Remove the bowl from the pot and set aside the melted chocolate .
Line a baking sheet with wax paper or parchment paper .
Take a Peeps marshmallow bunny or chick and while gently grasping its adorable head dip its body in the melted white chocolate .
Twirl it around to get it uniformly coated .
Sprinkle the melted chocolate with either sugar or candy sprinkles .
The blue bunnies look handsome with blue sugar crystals while the yellow chicks look so pretty when decorated with multicolored candy sprinkles .
Take a quick snapshot of your chocolate - dipped chicks and bunnies and if you ’re a flickr member post them on my flickr group Chocolate - Dipped .
A final word , these treats will give you an unimaginable but wonderful sugar high .
Happy Spring !

In the submicroscopic world -- the domain of elementary particles and individual atoms -- things behave in the strange , counter - intuitive fashion governed by the principles of quantum mechanics .
Nothing ( or so it seems ) like our macroscopic world -- or even the microscopic world of cells or bacteria or dust particles -- where Newton 's much more reasonable laws keep things sensibly ordered .
The problem comes in finding the dividing line between the two worlds -- or even in establishing that such a line exists .
To that end , Keith Schwab , associate professor of physics who moved to Cornell this year from the National Security Agency , and colleagues have created a device that approaches this quantum mechanical limit at the largest length - scale to date .
And surprisingly , the research also has shown how researchers can lower the temperature of an object -- just by watching it .
The results , which could have applications in quantum computing , cooling engineering and more , appear in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Nature .
The device is actually a tiny ( 8.7 microns , or millionths of a meter , long ; 200 nanometers , or billionths of a meter , wide ) sliver of aluminum on silicon nitride , pinned down at both ends and allowed to vibrate in the middle .
Nearby , Schwab positioned a superconducting single electron transistor ( SSET ) to detect minuscule changes in the sliver 's position .
According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , the precision of simultaneous measurements of position and velocity of a particle is limited by a quantifiable amount .
Schwab and his colleagues were able to get closer than ever to that theoretical limit with their measurements , demonstrating as well a phenomenon called back - action , by which the act of observing something actually gives it a nudge of momentum .
" We made measurements of position that are so intense -- so strongly coupled -- that by looking at it we can make it move , " said Schwab .
" Quantum mechanics requires that you cannot make a measurement of something and not perturb it .
We 're doing measurements that are very close to the uncertainty principle ; and we can couple so strongly that by measuring the position we can see the thing move . "
The device , while undeniably small , is -- at about ten thousand billion atoms -- vastly bigger than the typical quantum world of elementary particles .
Still , while that result was unprecedented , it had been predicted by theory .
But the second observation was a surprise :
By applying certain voltages to the transistor , the researchers saw the system 's temperature decrease .
" By looking at it you cannot only make it move ; you can pull energy out of it , " said Schwab .
" And the numbers suggest , if we were to keep going on with this work , we would be able to cool this thing very cold .
Much colder than we could if we just had this big refrigerator . "
The mechanism behind the cooling is analogous to a process called optical or Doppler cooling , which allows atomic physicists to cool atomic vapor with a red laser .
This is the first time the phenomenon has been observed in a condensed matter context .
Schwab has n't decided if he 'll pursue the cooling project .
More interesting , he says , is the task of figuring out the bigger problem of quantum mechanics : whether it holds true in the macroscopic world ; and if not , where the system breaks down .
For that he 's focusing on another principle of quantum mechanics -- the superposition principle -- which holds that a particle can simultaneously be in two places .
" We 're trying to make a mechanical device be in two places at one time .
What 's really neat is it looks like we should be able to do it , " he said .
" The hope , the dream , the fantasy is that we get that superposition and start making bigger devices and find the breakdown . "
