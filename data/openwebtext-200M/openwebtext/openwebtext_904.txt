It 's going to be interesting to see how quickly Congress and the administration caves in to banks and Wall Street after expressing so much indignation about bonuses over the last week .
Here is the backdrop .
Senator Chuck Grassley said AIG " Sucking The Tit Of The Taxpayer " .
President Obama said " It 's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 m in extra pay "
Obama pressed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to " pursue every single legal avenue " to block the bonuses .
House Passes 90 % Tax On Bonuses
The Senate plans to vote next week on steep levies on employee bonuses after the House overwhelmingly approved a 90 percent tax on bonuses at American International Group Inc. and other companies receiving bailout funds .
The Senate ’s proposal on companies that got federal money would place a 70 percent tax on the bonuses .
Half that amount would be paid by employees , half by the companies .
The 328-93 House vote came amid a national outcry over $ 165 million AIG paid in bonuses last week after receiving $ 173 billion in bailout funds as part of the government ’s efforts to stabilize credit markets .
President Barack Obama said he was “ stunned ” by the bonuses and vowed to recoup the money .
Nineteen state governments have begun probes of the AIG bonuses .
“ Paying excessive bonuses to the same group of folks that helped get us into this crisis is simply unacceptable , ” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said in a statement .
“ Millions of Americans continue to struggle to get by , counting their dollars , and Congress needs to do the same . ”
The House measure would cover companies receiving 75 percent of federal bailout funds , according to the Ways and Means Committee .
The Senate proposal would affect a larger pool of workers and the chamber may vote on it next week , said its primary sponsor , Baucus , a Montana Democrat .
Meanwhile , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank proposed legislation late yesterday to ban payments at companies getting U.S. aid until the government is repaid .
More Than $ 250,000
The House bill passed yesterday would affect employees earning more than $ 250,000 who received bonuses from companies that received more than $ 5 billion in aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
“ These people are getting away with murder , ” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel of New York .
“ They ’re getting paid for the destruction they ’ve caused to our communities . ”
The House ’s 90 percent tax would apply to bonus payments made after Dec. 31 , 2008 , and it would cease when the U.S. government ’s investment in the company fell below $ 5 billion .
The tax would n’t apply to any bonus returned to a company , or to commissions or fringe benefits .
About $ 3.6 billion in Merrill Lynch & Co. bonuses would n’t be affected by the new legislation because they were paid before Dec. 31 .
Bonuses for employees at Bank of America Corp. , Citigroup Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley would be affected because they were paid after Dec. 31 .
Banks Fight Back
Citigroup Inc. ( C ) Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ) Chief Executive Ken Lewis issued strongly worded internal memos about the proposed tax legislation , according to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal , while J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon sought to reassure his top executives that the firm is engaging with lawmakers on the matter .
Citi's Pandit criticized the proposed legislation in a memo to employees on Friday , arguing that it could result in the firm losing top talent .
" It would affect countless number of people who will find it difficult , if not impossible , to pay back the bonuses that they earned , " Pandit said .
Bank of America 's Lewis , for his part , said that he 's written to lawmakers about why the proposed tax legislation " is of such grave concern to us , " adding that it has " the potential to damage the ability of the government to engineer a financial recovery .

Fannie , Freddie Regulator to Stand Behind Retention Bonuses
The regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said he still supports the companies ’ retention bonuses for senior executives .
“ The loss of key personnel would be devastating to the companies and to the government ’s efforts to stabilize the housing system , ” Federal Housing Finance Agency Director James Lockhart said in a letter today to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank .
“ FHFA initiated these programs prior to conservatorship as we and our advisors agreed that they were critical to a successful conservatorship .
I still believe that . ”
Lockhart Is A Fool
Obama to Weigh Impact of Bonus Tax on Credit Flows
President Barack Obama will consider what impact taxing employee bonuses paid by companies that receive taxpayer aid will have on credit flows , his spokesman said .
Obama is balancing assuaging “ taxpayer anger and frustration ” about bonus payments at American International Group Inc. and other companies with the need to “ stabilize the financial system and ensure that credit flows from banks and lending institutions , ” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters at a briefing today .
The financial - services industry is warning that allowing a steep tax on bonuses may cause some banks to consider exiting the Troubled Asset Relief Program before their competitors are healthy enough to do so , risking a new freeze of the nation ’s credit markets .
“ This will undermine the recovery efforts , ” said Scott Talbott , senior vice president for government affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable , an industry trade group in Washington .
“ It will decrease industry interest in participating in any recovery program and cast a pall over existing and future contracts . ”
Obama said yesterday the vote on the House measure “ rightly reflects the outrage ” over disclosure of payouts at companies like AIG .
He said he looks forward to getting the final legislation .
Gibbs today stopped short of saying Obama would sign the House bill .
“ That ’s the evaluation that is being undertaken here , ” Gibbs said .

NEW DELHI :
It may sound utopian in the backdrop of months - long downslide on bourses , but a US - based equity research group sees India 's benchmark index Sensex scaling a milestone of 1,00,000 points within next 15 years .
This would mean an unimaginable rally of over 10 - times from the level seen just a few days ago , when Sensex was toiling below 10,000 - point mark after a meltdown that began more than a year ago .
The Sensex had more than halved to trade below 8,000 - point mark in October last year after scaling a record high of over 21,000 points on January 10 , 2008 .
Unperturbed by the sharp fall , US - based global equity research group Elliott Wave International , which specialises in analysis of technical charts of stock movements , believes that the recent surge in Indian market is the beginning of a long - running bull cycle that could continue for 15 years .
The recent upsurge began on March 9 and the Sensex has gained over 2,500 points or by more than 30 per cent .
"
If the price and time proportions between the waves in the 2003 -2008 rally continue , the Sensex should hit 100,000 in about 15 years , " research group 's Asia - Pacific Financial Forecast editor Mark Galasiewski told PTI over phone .
In its report for Asia - Pacific markets , based on analysis of technical charts , Elliottt Wave has said there were strong indications of " a resumption of the bull market in Indian stocks " .
Extending its previous analysis in November last year , when it had said the Sensex might continue advancing for 15 years before the end of another bull run , Elliott Wave said the market seemed to have completed its most recent downward spiral in October 2008 .
The Indian stock market benchmark Sensex had scaled an all - time high of 21,206.77 points on January 10 , 2008 before embarking on a downward journey , wherein it touched a low of 7,697.39 points on October 27 .
According to the Elliot Wave 's April forecast report , the Sensex has declined in three waves to the October low , where it retraced approximately 50 per cent of its 2003 - 08 rally on a percentage basis .
The index has just broken out of its downward trend channel and the patterns seen recently and during the 2003 - 04 period " are the best argument for a resumption of the bull market in Indian stocks , " it added .
Naming India among the " potential baby bulls " of the region , alongside Taiwan and Korea , Elliott Wave had said the completion of three waves of fall from their respective highs had made them " strong candidates to rally back to at least near their all - time highs -- if not beyond " .
Elliottt Wave has also classified Japan , Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Australia as long - term bear markets , while the " potential baby bulls " have been described as those which investors should consider for long - term investments .
The report further noted that India had experienced long - running bearish phase in the past , indicating that the next bull - run could continue beyond its most recent all - time high levels .
Until the early 2000s , the long bear market in India lasted for 11 years ( 1992 -2003 ) .
" The five - wave pattern from 2003 - 08 is a road map to the future .
Elliott waves progress in five waves and correct in three waves , " research group 's Asia - Pacific Financial Forecast editor Mark Galasiewski said .
Mozilla has released a new version of Firefox in response to the discovery of several security flaws in the browser software .
Version 3.0.7 of Firefox plugs five security vulnerabilities , three of which earn the dreaded " critical " label .
Of these critical flaws a bug that means that Firefox crashes with evidence of memory corruption stands out as the most severe .
Critical flaws in Mozilla 's garbage collection process ( involving memory management and " cloned XUL DOM elements " ) as well as bugs in the PNG library used by Mozilla also create a possible means for hackers to inject malware onto vulnerable systems .
The Firefox update also fixes a number of lesser security and stability bugs , as explained in Mozilla 's release notes here .
Malware exploiting the bugs is yet to be seen in circulation , but that 's a poor reason to hold off upgrading .
Those who have enabled Mozilla 's automated update process should find that new software is installed within a day or so .
Mozilla 's Thunderbird email client and SeaMonkey application suite share a similar code base to Firefox and therefore also need updating , to Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 and SeaMonkey 1.1.15 , respectively .
The Firefox update was published on Thursday a day after Opera released a new version of its software , largely in response to the discovery of separate security flaws , making it a busy week on the alternative browser security front . ®
It was six short , precious years ago that former Georgia governor and senator Zell Miller wrote " A National Party No More " , which warned that the Democratic Party of which he claimed to be a member was in clear peril of being marginalized .
Or , as the product description over at Amazon puts it so succinctly :
With the growl of the Marine sergeant he was , Senator Zell Miller leaves no doubt that he believes his own Democratic Party is badly out of step with most of the country and needs to shape up or ship out .
Of course , believing something , and something actually being true are not exactly the same thing .
However , Miller was prescient in one way .
He correctly warned America of a political party bent on its own self - destruction , risking complete irrelevance in the process .
He only missed on one small element -- he got the identification of the political party wrong .
Perhaps it was all a matter of geography .
Miller , a product of the rural South , may have made the mistake of believing that the political attitudes of his friends and neighbors in exurban and rural Georgia were somehow predictive of the nation writ large .
But evidence is mounting that the solidly red South , far from a bellwether , is rather an outlier in understanding what " real America " thinks about the issues of the day .
In a must - read piece for National Journal , former LA Times political chief Ron Brownstein outlines how the Republican Party is now , by all right , growing into a Southern regional entity .
Readers to Daily Kos have heard that thesis tossed out before .
Yesterday , in the write up for our weekly tracking poll , DemfromCT pointed out a quote from a Daily Kos piece from over a year ago which stated the following :
The Republicans , under George W. Bush , have succeeded in remaking themselves from a national party into a regional party ( the South ) .
This graph , from the National Journal piece , shows the unreal disparity in presidential elections between the South ( defined as National Journal as the eleven states of the old Confederacy plus Oklahoma and Kentucky ) and the other states of the Union :
Notice , in particular , how both Al Gore and John Kerry had reasonably comfortable leads outside of the South that were more than offset by that single region of the nation .
At the Congressional level , the disparities are , if possible , even more stark .
In the United States Senate , Republicans control 19 of the 26 seats in the South .
Outside the South , Democrats control 53 seats .
The GOP controls just 21 seats outside of the South .
What this means , in a nutshell , is that outside of the South , Democrats come very close to controlling three - quarters of the seats in the United States Senate .
While the ratios are not quite as stark in the more localized House of Representatives , the statistics are still pretty damning .
Since the mid-1990s , the majority of the GOP House delegation has come from the South .
According to National Journal , the last time that was true was during Reconstruction , when many old - line Democrats were barred from serving because of their service to the Confederacy ( this was also the brief moment in history when the South sent African - American members to the United States Congress like Senators Hiram Rhodes Revels and Blanche Bruce ) .
The primacy of social politics in modern conservatism ( as covered in Thomas Frank 's 2004 book " What 's The Matter With Kansas " ) has solidified its position in the South , but may well have done the party irreparable damage elsewhere .
As outlined here last week , Republican presidential performance in the suburbs , relative to average national performance , has been eroding consistently over the past decade or so .
It is hard not to suspect some connective tissue between the ascendancy of the GOP in the American South and their descent elsewhere .
Especially when one looks at the polling data on what issues Americans believe are of the utmost political importance .
The political trinity that seems to define Republican social conservatism is " God , guns , and gays . "
Somewhere along the line , the Republican Party grew convinced that social conservatism along those lines was the ticket not only to locking down the South , but winning over middle - class voters elsewhere .
It worked in the South , where even Democratic candidates at the federal level feel the need to toe the line on the trinity listed above .
But , nationally , their decision to put social issues at the top of the list in terms of issue - based talking points has been disastrous .
It is not that America necessarily is in solid dissent with the GOP on these issues .
Indeed , on issues like gun rights , gay rights , and abortion , the GOP position could either be classified as the narrow majority position or a significant minority position .
Where the GOP loses voters by emphasizing social conservatism is in the fact that voters just do n't think these issues are of paramount importance , and the Republicans risk looking like the party of misplaced priorities by campaigning on them as vehemently as they do .
Consider this Time Magazine poll from June of 2008 .
The date , incidentally , is chosen intentionally because it predated the worst of the economic crisis that wound up dominating the public conversation close to the election .
What follows are the percent of Americans who found the issue in question either extremely important or very important :
The Nation 's Economy -- 94 %
The War In Iraq -- 86 %
Gas Prices -- 81 %
Health Care -- 81 %
Education -- 81 %
Terrorism -- 81 %
Strengthening Social Security / Medicare -- 74 %
Taxes -- 69 %
Immigration -- 57 %
Global Warming -- 51 %
So - Called " Values Issues " Such As Abortion and Gay Marriage -- 47 %
To put it succinctly -- the voters of America do not care about the trinity of social conservatism nearly as much as the Republican Party thinks that they do .
And they have paid a steep political price for that miscalculation .
Furthermore , this trend towards southern concentration in the party also presents a problematic dilemma for the GOP .
As Ron Brownstein writes :
That dynamic has threatened Republicans with a spiral of concentration and contraction .
Because the party has lost so much ground elsewhere , the South represents an increasing share of what remains -- both in Congress and in its electoral coalition .
The party 's increasing identification with staunch Southern economic and social conservatism , however , may be accelerating its decline in more - moderate - to - liberal areas of the country , including the Northeast and the West Coast .
" Many of the things they have done to become the dominant party in the South have caused them to be less successful in other places , " said veteran Democratic strategist Bill Carrick , a South Carolina native .
Therein lies the challenge for the GOP , one that no one could reasonably envy .
To moderate the party , as candidates like Charlie Crist might represent , would risk alienating the one demographic group that still remains steadfastly in the Republican Party 's corner .
Alas , to stay the course risks making it immeasurably more difficult to lure back a coalition capable of attaining a Congressional majority or 270 electoral votes in three years .
It is not an easy call , and it is undoubtedly going to be the source of an endless procession of circular firing squads as the Republican Party stumbles into 2010 and 2012 .
April 28 , 2009 Sony Electronics has launched the GreenFill recycling service , an extension of its Take Back program using in - store , drop - boxes for the collection of unwanted portable electronics good - around 80 % of which currently end up in landfill .
All brands of small electronic goods like cameras , portable music devices , small laptops , cell phones and portable gaming devices can be dropped off free of charge at participating outlets in the Greenfill program - 81 retail stores are on board so far .
For larger electronic goods , Sony 's Take Back Program has 270 + participating recycling depots which accept its own brand no charge and add a small fee for other brands .
According to Sony , more than 14 million pounds of electronic waste has been collected since the commencement of the Take Back Program , but sadly that 's just a tiny fraction of what 's out there .
In the US it 's estimated that 18 % of the hundreds of thousands of tons of electronics waste in accumulated storage is recycled - a figure that has jumped 3 % since 2006 on the back of mandatory collection and recycling programs for electronics in several states .
There has been an increase in momentum in the USA particularly since 2008 , with several significant organizations taking responsibility for responsible electronic waste ( e- waste ) recycling and ensuring any associated hazardous wastes are not exported to developing countries .
The Basel Convention was established to provide control of the transboundary movements of Hazardous wastes and their disposal .
In 2008 , Waste Management Recycle America ( WM Recycle America ) announced its commitment to adopt the Electronics Recycler ’s Pledge of True Stewardship for the dismantling and recycling of e-waste .
Sony Electronics is in partnership with WM Recycling America and has also signed the Basel Action Network Manufacturers Commitment to responsible e-waste .
More information the GreenFill program can be found at Sony Green .

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board declared Tuesday that in some situations you sorta do n’t have to mark the value of the securities you hold to their market values if you really do n’t feel like it , while many Republicans in Washington are pushing for an even more sweeping suspension of mark - to - market accounting .
I ’ll weigh in on the topic later , but for the moment I ’ll give the floor to Curious Capitalist Senior Accounting Theory ( and Professional Golf Management ) Correspondent Paul B.W. Miller :
Here are my basic points : reports that are truthful are more useful than those that are not ; reports based on assumptions and predictions are not as reliable as reports based on observations ; mark - to - market reports are based on observations ; other methods of accounting are based on assumptions or untimely measures of investments ( e.g. , cost ) ; ergo , MTM accounting is superior to other forms .
I had suggested to Paul that while mark - to - market made sense for financial reporting purposes , it might be prudent for banking regulators to ignore it in time like these .
His take :
As to your bifurcation into regulatory and nonregulatory applications , why would you prefer that regulatory reporting be based on something that we ( and the capital markets ) know is NOT true ?
Why would you want to use something like “ economic value ” ( present value of management ’s predictions discounted at management ’s rate ) instead of market value ( observed consensus valuation of lots of buyers and sellers with no predictions or assumptions ) .
The consequence of moving away from the truth is a movement toward a public policy of deceptive reporting as a good thing .
This policy is doomed to fail .
Which is exactly how we got into this mess — managers were lulled into investing in very risky ( volatile ) instruments , in part because the accounting did not reveal their riskiness .
Going with mark - not - to - market is an endorsement of not holding managers accountable for their decisions and outcomes .
Indeed , it ’s organized imaginary accounting .
No one believes it except the managers , and no one is calling for bad accounting except managers and Congress .
Where is the CFAI on this issue ?
[ Editor ’s note :
They ’re here . ]
The apparent objection to MTM is that it reveals what management ( a ) does n’t want anyone to know , namely that their investments are risky and volatile , and ( b ) does n’t want to confront , namely that they did n’t do their homework and ended up believing others who said that mortgage - backed securities are as safe and sound as CDs .
They messed up and they do n’t want us to know it and they do n’t want to have to fix it .
They would rather live in an imaginary world where all income streams are placid and constant .
With regard to capital requirements — wow , that ’s where the whole problem lies .
They are so over - leveraged with short term debt and over - extended with long - term assets that their real equity is incredibly volatile .
If we want safe and secure financial institutions ( as a matter of public policy ) , which option makes more sense ?
A ) Report the real volatility , thereby driving managers to take steps to avoid risky investments or to actually mitigate risk through valid hedging strategies ; or , B ) Present them with accounting rules that hide the volatility and produce results that suggest there is no risk .
I vote for A ) every time .
One more time : messing with the accounting to produce artificially smooth and safe results is a public policy based on deception .
And — do n’t forget this point : just because the financial statements project an image that everything is smooth and placid and riskless does n’t mean the capital markets will accept that image .
There is no law in the land that can make investors believe and act on manipulated statements , and there is no law in the land that can prevent them from seeking out other information by other means to try to uncover reality .
The obvious public policy is to promote full and timely disclosure of that which is known and desired by the markets so that inefficiency and deception are squeezed out .
The consequence is less uncertainty , lower risk , and lower capital costs , with higher values for both bonds and stock .
Simple economic logic .
At the Montpelier Tea Party I mentioned in my speech the abusive monetary policy that we have been subjected to .
I invited Jim Hogue to speak about the Federal Reserve .
The Campaign For Liberty distributed information about the Federal Reserve and a very important bill in Congress right now which would require an audit of the Fed .
It 's time for each and every one of us to put our mouth where our money is and call Peter Welch , urging him to support HR1207 , " The Federal Reserve Transparency Act " .
This is the complete text of the bill : H.

*** That 's it .
An audit of the Federal Reserve .
The Federal Reserve is mistakenly assumed to be a government entity , like the Treasury Department .
There are a number of books and articles which discuss the origins of the Federal Reserve .
Some people are turned off by the idea of discussing the Fed because it smells too much like conspiracy theory .
However we all know that something 's not quite right about our monetary system .
The fact is we 've been robbed , just as Jim said in his speech .
It 's about time the Federal Reserve opened its books and showed us the money .
( I 've written this last sentence 3 ways and I still can't do it without a pun ! )
These quotes are from this great article :
On December 23 , 1913 , the Federal Reserve Act , also known as the Glass - Owen Bill , was passed .
The Republican controlled Senate rammed the bill through when many members of the US Congress were home for the holiday .
The President , Dr. Thomas Woodrow Wilson , signed it into law one hour after being passed by the Congress !
Somebody very powerful really wanted this law passed .
The Federal Reserve System is an independent central bank .
Although the President of the United States appoints the chairman of the Fed , and this appointment is approved by the United States Senate , the decisions of the Fed do not have to be ratified by the President , or anyone else in the executive branch of the United States government .
Buried in the legislation was the granting of total power over the monetary policies of all US banks .
A very curious statement is found in the original 1913 law .
SEC . 30 .
The right to amend , alter , or repeal this Act is hereby expressly reserved .
Reserved expressly to whom , or what ?
No definition is provided .
This is the entire Section 30 statement !
Stock not held by member banks shall not be entitled to voting power .
This clause guarantees that no outsider can justify buying shares in the Federal Reserve .
SEC .
25 .
Any national banking association possessing a capital and surplus of 1,000,000 dollars or more may file application with the Federal ReserveBoard , upon such conditions and under such regulations as may be prescribed by the said board , for the purpose of securing authority to establish branches in foreign countries or dependencies of the United States for the furtherance of the foreign commerce of the United States , and to act , if required to do so , as fiscal agents of the United States .
Such application shall specify , in addition tothe name and capital of the banking association filing it , the place or places where the bankingoperations proposed are to be carried on , and the amount of capital set aside for the conduct of its foreign business .
The Federal Reserve Board shall have power to approve or to reject such application if , in its judgment , the amount of capital proposed to be set aside for the conduct of foreign business is inadequate , or if for other reasons the granting of such application is deemed inexpedient .
Wow , the US government has no formal control over the foreign operations of the Federal Reserve banks !
The Federal Reserve banks are exempt from all taxation .
These people are very independent .
Independent of audits , independent of congressional supervision , and independent of the American voter .*** Last week , Ed Towns ( chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee ) and Dennis Kucinich ( chair of the subcommittee on Domestic Policy ) issued a pair of letters to Timothy Geithner and Ben Bernanke .
Read these letters .
They are demanding an expanded investigation into the alleged strong - arming by the Fed and Treasury to force Bank of America to file fraudulent claims with the SEC in the acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
They have asked for documents once already and were disregarded .
Now what I find really troubling is that Peter Welch sits on this committee .
He knows what 's going on yet he has not indicated that he intends to call for any increased transparency in regard to the Fed .
It 's time to put an end to this abuse .
Interestingly Peter Welch , who sits on the Government Oversight and Reform Committee has n't co-sponsored it .
Why not , Peter Welch ?
Does he think that the American People do n't have the right to know what 's being done with their money ?
In fact , Bernie Sanders has introduced similar legislation in the Senate ( S. 604 ) .
With all of this activity around him his silence is suspect .
I have been calling Peter Welch 's office daily urging him to co-sponsor HR1207 .
I have informed office staff that I will call every day until he signs onto it or gives an explanation why he will not .
Early last week the bill had 62 co-sponsors .
By Tuesday morning , through the hard work of Campaign For Liberty volunteers and members around the country another 30 co-sponsors were gained .
Increased pressure and an official Action Day on Tuesday yielded 8 more .
We are now at 100 co-sponsors .
This should be enough to force it out of committee and onto the House floor for debate but we must not make assumptions .
As part of the Campaign For Liberty Action Day I spent an hour in the park on Main Street in Burlington talking to people , passing out literature and asking for signatures on a petition .
It was a very last minute thing but out of 41 people I asked , 35 signed the petition .
I then brought the petitions to Peter Welch 's office .
You may have heard me on the radio Tuesday morning talking about the action day .
I was on the Comment Show in St. Albans and True North Radio .
I sent out a limited email earlier in the week and asked for support in contacting Peter Welch .
Now I 'm asking you , my Tea Party friends , to make your voices loud and clear .
Email , fax and call Peter Welch 's offices .
If you 've already done it , do it again .
Join me in being a squeaky wheel .
If you 're in Burlington even better -- GO to his office and tell them that you are there to ask Peter Welch to co-sponsor HR 1207 , The Federal Reserve Transparency Act.

Court is scheduled to vote today on whether to submit those ideas to a U.S. Justice Department grant program that was allocated $ 2 billion in stimulus funding to make neighborhoods safer .
If approved , all the equipment would be used by the sheriff ’s homeland security bureau , which Maj .
Robert Doguim said was essentially a division in name only when Garcia took office in January .
Helicopter tops wish list
According to the grant proposal submitted to the court , most of the money would be spent leasing and staffing a helicopter to augment law enforcement activities on the ground .
The vendor would provide , maintain and fuel the aircraft , along with three contract pilots .
Four deputies would serve as tactical flight officers .
The county already operates a single - engine , four - seat plane donated last year by a talk radio host ’s anti-illegal immigration group .
Court members and representatives from the sheriff ’s office said at the time that they would rather have a helicopter , but could not afford one .
Just last week , the plane helped deputies track a man during a foot chase , Doguim said .
But helicopters can hover , have a shorter turning radius and can be outfitted with video and thermal imaging equipment too heavy to be installed on the plane , he added .
About $ 113,000 would be spent on a surveillance van .
Another $ 175,000 would be spent on eight machine guns to be mounted on the marine division ’s four patrol boats .
The sheriff ’s gang unit also would get $ 200,000 for body armor and other gear .
Commissioners Steve Radack and El Franco
Lee said they had some questions about the spending decisions in light of long - term staffing issues in the jail and the patrol division .
The money also could be used to fix the problems that caused the jail to recently fail its state inspection for the fourth time in six years , Radack said .
Conservative groups also have questioned whether it was appropriate for Congress to allocate stimulus funding to law enforcement projects .
While President Obama said injecting cash into the existing grant program would create jobs while helping prevent crime , David B. Muhlhausen , a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation , said any jobs gained from the new programs would be offset by jobs cut by businesses facing higher taxes .

This February , Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) introduced HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 to audit the FED .
When I first reported on it in March , privately I was quite ecstatic that there were 11 co-sponsors , and three were Democrats .
Why ?
Well , Dr. Paul has tried this variants of this theme multiple times before over the past 30 years .
For instance , HR 1148 was introduced in 1999 to abolish the Federal Reserve and obtained a whopping zero co-sponsors .
This was repeated in HR 2755 in 2007 .
Result ?
Zero co-sponsors .
Paul 's new clever strategy has been to extremely limit the scope of the bill � just audit the books of the FED , nothing more � and has been able to tap into the wide - ranging dissatisfaction surrounding the October 2008 banker bailout , the Obama stimulus plan , and the outright socialization of our banking , auto , and insurance sectors .
It only takes half a brain and a pulse to get angry about the fact that the central bankers gave the American people the equivalent of a middle finger on Bloomberg 's Freedom of Information Act request .
The FED denied to disclose how they used $ 2 trillion dollars in open market operations that they executed outside of Congressional authority .
Congress has no clue how the FED used the money either since that is not how the FED works .
Without an audit , Congress also has no clue how much gold our nation owns .
( photo )
So what 's the big picture ?
Basically , the legislative process in Washington is usually as slow as molasses , and most bills die in committee with the obvious exceptions of very long lobbyist bills like the USA PATRIOT
Act and urgent banker bailout - stimulus plans that no one in Congress admittedly even has time to read before voting on them .
Ron Paul is a veteran legislator , and most of his bills this decade are quite short - HR 1207 is 446 words � and follows the K.I.S.S. Principle : Keep It Simple Stupid .
Obviously he has not had a lot of success , but that 's mostly been due to lack of cooperation .
In the case of HR 1207 , Paul has chosen this battleground wisely - who wants to be on the " No " side with all of the popular sentiment against it ?
Campaign for Liberty and Liberty Maven , two sites that publish my articles , and many more like - minded sites have thrown all their momentum into winning this one small battle .
Galvanized supporters have watched in awe as the number of co-sponsors rise from 11 to 33 to 88 to 124 at present , an impressive feat .
The New American recently quoted Austrian economist Thomas Woods 's doubts as saying , " [ The FED ] is too complicated for most Americans .
This is n�t going to galvanize people .
I was wrong !
He�s taken an issue that wasn�t even an issue , and he�s got a lot of Americans suddenly fascinated by the Fed , by monetary policy , by the Austrian business cycle theory . "
My thoughts are that Woods is severely underestimating both the number and intelligence of Paul 's supporters , especially when it is so apparent our future prosperity as a society is at stake .
The fight to pass HR 1207 by the House is winnable .
Even if it fails , the rEVOLution will have learned a very important fact � which of the Representatives on either the Financial Services committee or in the House itself can be viewed as domestic enemies .
Disdain for what the FED has done to the American people is one of the reasons I am running for Congress in Pennsylvania 's 15th district , and also why I have contacted my current representative multiple times to co-sign HR 1207 .
I published my latest letter to him , and a reader asked the following questions .
As a wanna - be Congressman , I thought I would take a shot at answering them !
Q : " What does it take to get this bill out of committee and on the floor of the House for a vote ? "
A : The bill is currently in committee and must pass before a House vote can be called .
It is possible the bill will be tabled , or die , while in committee .
To pass , the committee must have quorum � the necessary amount of representatives present to vote on it .
The exact number needed to obtain a quorum is determined by each committee .
Passing requires a majority of those in attendance at committee before moving to a House vote where a simple majority is needed � this is democracy at work !
This process is described here , see page 21/67 .
Q : " How many co-sponsors does it need to force that ?
Or does that even matter ? "
A : The number of co-sponsors does not matter .
However , it does indicate the expected minimum support a bill will receive on the House floor , so is a key indicator while in committee .
While bills are in committee , they can be marked up and amended , which is why the simplicity of Paul 's bill is key .
Q : " Is it really a matter of getting Barney Frank to move it to the House for a vote ?
What 's the process ?
Does anyone know ? "
A : Representative Barney Frank , D - MA , is the chair of the Financial Services committee of 70 representatives .
He has not co-signed the bill , and traditionally is allied closely with the banking special interests and FED , so no cooperation can be expected from him .
Several weeks ago , Frank spoke about Paul , HR 1207 , and committee politics - while boldly proclaimed that there is no inflation .
It is my guess that Campaign for Liberty and Ron Paul will take their time to have their supporters keep banging away on their local representatives to rachet the number of co-sponsors higher .
Over 150 would be impressive , to say the least .
At this point , page 20 / 67 states : " Three or more members of a standing committee may file with the committee a written request that the chairman call a special meeting ...
If the chairman does not call the requested special meeting within three calendar days after the filing of the request , to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request , a majority of the members of the committee may call the special meeting by filing with the committee written notice ... "
Since there are already three co-signers , the first step can be completed at any time .
However , I think it would be best to target the remaining 6 of 29 Republicans on the committee who have not co-signed and try to pick up more than one Democrat ( the other 40 have not co-signed ) before proceeding .
These six possible Republican banker - buddies are located in the states of NJ , NY , CA , and PA and here is a downloadable interactive list .
Supporters of HR 1207 should contact any red-listed member as a top - priority ( see below ) .
Rely on sites like Campaign for Liberty and Liberty Maven to keep up with the current status .
When the bill goes to committee , it will be time to melt the phone wires on the phones of those Financial Services members still in red .
HR 1207 is not just an audit of the FED , it is an audit of your local Representative !

KABUL , Afghanistan 
A senior Taliban leader responsible for numerous roadside bombings and suicide attacks against NATO forces has been killed along with nine other insurgent fighters , NATO said Monday .
Maulawi Hassan , described as a well - known Taliban commander in southern Afghanistan , was killed Saturday in an attack on his compound near Kajaki , in Helmand Province , according to a NATO statement .
“ He became known for his insurgent activities in the autumn of 2008 and was heavily involved in several illegal activities , ” the statement said , noting that there had been no civilian casualties in the attack .
The statement said Mr. Hassan had reported directly to Mullah Rahmatullah , the Taliban commander who directs insurgency efforts from outside Afghanistan .
The police chief of Helmand Province , Assadullah Shirzad , said the killing of Mr. Hassan and his men was “ an important achievement for Afghan and NATO forces in Helmand , and a real blow to the Taliban . ”
Feature trailer for The Hurt Locker , starring Jeremy Renner .
The Hurt Locker , winner of the 2008 Venice Film Festival SIGNIS Grand Prize , is a riveting and suspenseful portrait of the elite members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal ( EOD ) squad , soldiers who volunteer to challenge the odds and save lives in one of the world ’s most dangerous jobs .
Three EOD members battle insurgents and each other as they seek out and disarm deadly bombs in a thrilling race against time .
A heart - pounding , edge - of - your - seat look at the effects of combat and danger on the human psyche , The Hurt Locker , meaning a place of ultimate pain , is based on the first - hand observations of journalist and screenwriter Mark Boal , who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq .
It is a gripping portrayal of real - life sacrifice and heroism and a layered , probing study of the soul - numbing rigors and potent allure of the modern battlefield .
Want to know how I know that I 'm old , out of shape , spend too much time sitting at my desk and writing , and not enough time exercising ?
I hurt my back yesterday ... by standing up .
Yep .
That 's it .
Doorbell rang , I stood up to go to the door , and the whole right side of my back seized up .
Goodtimes .
It still hurt this morning , so I went out to see my massage therapist to get it worked on just after lunch .
She worked out a lot of the tension , reminded me ( as always ) that I need to take better care of myself , and I headed home ... so I could write this story that my brain is demanding I write .
Shortly after I got on the freeway , I saw a huge crash happen , entirely because someone was driving like an asshole .
It really shook me up , because just this morning I said to Nolan , " Whenever you go somewhere with your friends , please make sure you are wearing a seatbelt , and never ride with someone who drives like an idiot . "
" I do , and do n't worry , because my friends are n't idiots . "
" I have no reason to doubt you , but there are idiot drivers all over the place , and if one of them decides to crash into you , I want you to be wearing a seatbelt . "
" Okay , Wil . Do n't worry . "
" Sorry , but I 'm going to worry , because I 'm your parent and that 's just my thing , " I said .
When I was on the freeway just about an hour ago , I was in the number 2 lane , cruising along with the flow of traffic .
I saw that the number 1 lane was slowing down a lot , so I slowed down too , just in case people whipped out of that lane and into mine .
It happens all the time , because people drive like assholes .
Sure enough , some asshole was speeding down the number 1 lane , and I do n't know if he was n't paying attention or what , but he whipped around into my lane - about 100 yards in front of me , I suppose - over corrected , spun sideways , and T - boned a van .
The van flipped onto its side , and the asshole driver sped into the carpool lane .
I 'm not sure if he crashed into the wall or hit his brakes , but he stopped and got out of his car .
I expected to see a 20 year - old kid , but it was a man in a suit who appeared to be in his late 40s or early 50s .
The van , on its side , was about two car lengths in front of me .
I realized that I 'd been holding my breath , and my hands were shaking so hard I could hardly grip my steering wheel .
Just when I snapped out of it and thought I should get out to help , the door of the van opened and the driver climbed out .
I could n't tell if he was hurt .
I picked up my phone to dial 911 , and saw that every car around me was already doing that .
I started to get out of my car , and I saw that about six or seven different people had already gotten out and were checking on the people who were involved in the crash .
I decided that I 'd just be in the way if I stopped , so – very carefully – I drove around the scene of the crash and – very carefully – I drove home .
When I got into our house , I immediately called Nolan to reiterate our conversation from this morning .
My hands are n't shaking as violently as before , but now I can't stop thinking that , if I had been less than 15 seconds farther down the freeway , I would have been in the car that was crashed into by the asshole driver .
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and her Cabinet cut their own salaries in half Wednesday and urged lawmakers to follow suit as economic crisis grips the country .
Ukraine is among the countries hardest - hit in the global financial meltdown , which has depressed demand for the steel and chemicals that are crucial sources of its export income .
Industrial output fell by nearly one - third in February , year - on - year , the national currency has shed nearly half its value against the U.S. dollar since September and the economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent this year .
The salary cuts for Tymoshenko and the other ministers , announced in a Cabinet statement , came as Ukraine ’s divided leadership juggles public concern over the economic crisis with efforts to secure a $ 16.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund .
The loan was suspended last month due to Tymoshenko ’s reluctance to make the unpopular move of cutting social spending ahead of a presidential election expected late this year .
COPENHAGEN ( Reuters ) - A draft U.S. climate bill did not go far enough to cut greenhouse gases , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told Reuters on Sunday , three days after the plan won a key Congressional panel vote .
Ban applauded President Barack Obama ’s engagement on global warming but said that other countries were doing more , and added that a new global climate pact meant to be agreed in December could not wait for the United States to pass its domestic rules .
“ That ’s what I have been doing and will continue to do , ” Ban said when asked if he was urging the United States to do more .
The bill passed on Thursday aimed to cut U.S. greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming by 17 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2020 .
“ That ’s clearly lower than other countries are now aiming , particularly the European Union , ” Ban said on the fringes of a climate change and business conference in Copenhagen .
“ I appreciate President Obama and his administration taking an active role .
Now we need to continue to encourage the United States to do more , ” he said , adding that he welcomed the vote by the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee .
The panel ’s approval moved the draft bill closer to a vote in the full House , which could occur by August .
But it is unclear whether it would go through the Senate by December .
“ That should not be any conditionality of this global deal in Copenhagen , ” said Ban , who earlier told reporters that a deal in December “ was not an option . ”
A U.N. General Assembly summit on climate change in September would be the largest forum on the issue and “ critically important ” to allow leaders to resolve their differences three months before an anticipated deal , he said .
“ We will be in a much better position to identify the key sticking points , to sort out at the leaders level . “
“ I will try to make this the most interactive debate forum among the leaders so they can exercise ... the commitment and vision to look for the future of the entire planet Earth . ”
BLAME
Poorer countries say that the developed world has got rich from more than two centuries of industrialization , spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels like coal and oil , and so expect the North to act first .
Developing countries led by China and India want rich countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 - 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
The goal of the draft U.S. bill is equivalent to roughly no change on 1990 levels .
The United States will try to persuade rich and poor countries to share the burden of fighting climate change this week , holding May 25 - 26 talks among major economies , including China , the European Union , Russia , India and Japan , in Paris .
Ban identified key challenges to a climate deal in December , and firstly “ ambitious targets as scientists tell and as the IPCC ( U.N. climate panel ) recommends ” for developed countries .
Other key objectives included more clarity on funds to help least developed and small island and land - locked developing nations prepare for climate change .
My phone has been ringing too many times these past few days – mostly journalists and producers calling to book an interview .
I am an Afghan .
The topic : " Sharia law in Afghanistan allows men to rape their wives . "
All of a sudden , there is an enormous interest in Afghan law .
But all they are interested in is condemnation .
My favourite producer says : " We are looking for local outrage and you are our top choice . "
When I try to explain that I 'm equally outraged at the way the media is treating this story , there is silence on the line .
And when I say , what about context as well as outrage , she says : " Let me check to see if we have time in the show and I 'll call you back right away . "
I never hear from her again .
I 'll repeat the usual mantra : any law or practice that treats any member of a society , men or women , with prejudice should not be tolerated .
But with the West 's hysteria on this issue , I wonder whether we 're not projecting our own fears of sharia on to what 's unfolding in Afghanistan .
In the West , we hear the word sharia and we tremble because all we know of Islamic law is the Taliban , the Danish cartoons affair and executions in Saudi Arabia .

In the case of Afghanistan , the new legislation will affect women of the Shia minority – about 5 per cent of the population .
The majority of all Afghan women are in fact hostage to far more draconian practices , enshrined in customs and traditions that date back to pre-sharia days – and are in some cases contradictory to Islam .
Even in its conservative interpretation , Islam recognises women 's rights to land ownership .
It insists on the " consent " of both sexes when entering a marriage contract or sexual relations .
What is branded as " sharia " for Shias in the legislature is basically giving Afghan men the right to control their wives , which is already practised widely .
While Hamid Karzai's government may call for the review of the law the attitude of Afghan men wo n't change with the re-wording of a legal document through external pressures , especially from the West .
Most Afghans suffer from lack of security .
Afghan TV programmes break taboos by reporting frequent cases of rape and the abuse of young women .
Powerful mafia gangs operate freely amid corruption .
Most Afghan journalists working for one of the 14 independent television and radio stations risk their lives to report these stories ; and the victims of these crimes and their families face social humiliation – in some cases retaliation and threats – by going public .
But there has n't been a single protest in the West about these crimes which are affecting the lives of women every day – not a single expression of support for these victims who , of course , do n't make it into the headlines ; because we are too busy looking for " local outrage " in order to condemn the Afghan government .
This week more than 100 Afghan women from 34 provinces met in Kabul to discuss the situation of women in the country ; they highlighted insecurity as the biggest impediment to their freedom and equality .
Most women fear to leave their homes , to attend school or go to work – not because of their husbands , but because they do n't feel safe .
Their rights to education , freedom of movement and action are guaranteed in the Afghan constitution , but the gap between words and reality is too huge to be bridged simply by revising a few clauses in a legal document .
Sure , we must fight to protect the legal rights of women .
But we must also seek ways to bring about change so that legislation is relevant to the lives of women and men in Afghanistan .
The majority of Afghans cannot read and write ; an even greater majority do n't go to the courts to resolve family and marriage problems .
The few who are educated who might seek legal help are sceptical about the rule of law because of the corruption and lack of trust in the Afghan government and the judicial system .
This government has lost its legitimacy because most Afghans view Karzai as a Western puppet .
Mr Karzai , of course , has been making concessions to conservatives to prove he is the leader of a sovereign state – in the hope this will help him win the next election .
But causing him this international public embarrassment and forcing him to give in to even more Western dictates is undermining his already shrinking local popularity – let alone any chance of re-election .
By all means , help Afghan women .
But spare me the hysteria .

More great news for lovers of American Values such as the equal protection ( supposedly ) guaranteed to all under our U.S. Constitution !
On the heels of a ban on discrimination against same - sex marriage by the Iowa Supreme Court 's conservative reading of their state 's constitution last week , the Vermont legislature today has overridden their Governor 's veto to officially recognize the right of same - sex partners to be officially married under the protection of state law .
Vermont becomes the fourth state ( following MA , CT and IA ) to currently recognize marriage equality , after they 'd formerly adopted " first - in - the - nation civil unions law " nine years ago .
We 're delighted to see two - thirds of each Statehouse chamber override the Governor 's veto of a law which will correct the injustice of segregation via " civil unions " .
Vermont 's Legislature is the first in the Union to affirm the right to marriage equality .
Previous rulings , in four states , have been made by state Supreme Courts , each with a Republican - appointed Justice penning the majority opinion .
4 states down , 46 to go , in the quest for Constitutional Conservatism and the equal protection for all .
( At least in this matter . )

Ultra -cold strontium atoms in an atomic clock
Perfect timekeeping has taken a step closer to reality after scientists developed a clock that loses just a second every 300 million years .
The researchers claim the new atomic clock is more than twice as accurate as timepieces currently used to regulate international time zones and satellite systems .
Like its predecessors , the strontium atomic clock at the University of Colorado , harnesses the natural – and extremely consistent – vibration of atoms to keep track of time .
But it makes the “ pendulum effect ” of atoms even more consistent by holding them in a laser beam and freezing them to almost minus 273 degrees – the temperature at which all matter stops resonating .
“ An atom consists of a nucleus and some electrons that spin in clearly defined orbits around the nucleus , ” said Professor Jan Thomsen , a nuclear physicist at the University of Copenhagen , who has worked with the new experiments together with researchers at the University of Colorado .
“ By using the focused laser light one can make the electron swing back and forth in a clearly defined way between these orbits , and it is that which forms the pendulum in the atomic clock ” .
Even though the increase in accuracy represents only a small fraction of a second , it has great potential in areas to do with the determination of great distances – for example , measuring the distance to distant galaxies in space .
Now the team want to go a step further .
“ We dream of getting an atomic clock with perfect precision , ” said Prof Thomsen .

Google 's stated goal is to have an index of all the world 's information .
It started with the Web , where the information it obtained allowed it to build a hugely successful search service .
From there , the company branched out , both by internal development and acquisition ; books got scanned , e-mail and documents hosted , and a variety of products , such as the Android operating system , appear to have been developed simply as a way of encouraging users to rely on other Google services .
Now , even as the company is killing some of these non-core products due to the tough economic times , its diversity is causing it more trouble than it may be worth , as antitrust worries appear to be accompanying the company 's every move .
Google first ran onto the antitrust shoals last year , when it was attempting to lock in a long - term partnership with Yahoo .
Concerns raised by the Department of Justice eventually scuttled that deal , as the company chose to walk away rather than submit to limitations on the deal or long - term monitoring by the judiciary .
Still , that case involved the placement of search ads , which is Google 's core profit center , and an area where it 's pulling ahead of its competitors .
A similar thing happened in a field where Google is equally ( if not more ) dominant , however : book search .
The effort involved in scanning book material probably makes it more expensive , and the service is probably less popular than Web searches , so it 's unlikely to be the same sort of profit center that Web search is .
Nevertheless , Google 's major commercial competitors have dropped out of that market ( presumably because of the lower profit margins ) , leaving it in a dominant position .
Now , its best chance to capitalize on that position , a deal that would see Google become a retailer of out - of - print books , is running into the same sort of resistance .
The Department of Justice is looking into the settlement Google reached with publishers and other rights holders .
Meanwhile librarians , as parties to that settlement , have voiced reservations about Google 's potential market power , suggesting that the settlement should be subjected to long - term monitoring by the judiciary , lest Google limit access to its library of scanned works .
Last week , Google came under fire for its
Web browser and the Android mobile phone operating system , products for which there 's no obvious route to profitability .
The problem here is that Google CEO Eric Schmidt also sits on the board of a competitor in both those markets , Apple .
There 's no indication that Schmidt has exerted any sort of interest on the day - to - day operations in Cupertino , but it 's still the sort of connection that makes antitrust authorities nervous .
Late last week , two events made it clear just how extensive the worries about Google 's dominance have become : Microsoft cited it in arguing that the EU should go easy when evaluating the company 's next moves in the operating system space , and Google itself felt compelled to go on record as saying there 's nothing to worry about here .
On Friday , the Financial Times reported that Microsoft argued that EU regulators should back off any consideration of limiting Redmond 's ability to distribute its Web browser with its OS .
Any decision to do so , in Microsoft 's view , would send OEMs running to Google in an attempt to bundle Chrome on their machines , which would in turn give Google even more search users .
In essence , Microsoft is arguing that the browser no longer matters except as a vehicle for delivering search to users and , as such , Google is the dominant party .
Meanwhile , Google itself has gotten nervous about all this attention and , on the same day , published a blog post in which it argued that it is still in a competitive market place , and its services enable other competitive markets .
Readers were invited to view a webinar in which those arguments are laid out in full .
In a lot of ways , Google is a victim both of its own success in search and its strategic approach to new markets .
The company seemed to have services ( rumored , in beta , and otherwise ) in just about every online market imaginable , including some odd fits , like virtual worlds .
The idea , presumably , was that it wanted to be ready to move in case any of these areas took off .
Instead , the company is now finding itself facing resistance to just about everything it does .

Developer sources familiarizing themselves with betas of Apple 's iPhone 3.0 software have uncovered a handful of additional tweaks and improvements to the system in recent weeks , including changes to Safari 's window handling , new battery status indicators and notification preferences , as well as the advent of data detectors in certain apps .
Safari
With the release of iPhone 3.0 , Safari will let you close out and clear all your open browser windows without having to first create a new blank page to get rid of the contents of the last active window .
For example , you can have eight open Safari windows in the existing version of the iPhone software , seven of which you can close rapidly by using the red " x " icons in the upper left - hand corners of the pages .
However , there 's no " x " icon to close out the last page standing .
Therefore , the only way to get rid of the contents on this last remaining page is to first create a " New Page , " then cycle back to the page and close it out .
With iPhone 3.0 , Apple has enabled the option to close out the lone remaining page .
Once the " x " icon is triggered , the page disappears and a new blank page quickly slides into view .
This process is reportedly difficult to capture in a screenshot , though an example illustrating part of the process can be seen below .
Battery indicators
Meanwhile , it appears that iPhone 3.0 will also introduce an option of showing you how much battery life you have left on your iPhone or iPod touch in a numerical percentage .
Resource files contained within the new version of the device 's Springboard application include 22 new PNG files to facilitate this option .
Half are numerical characters ( and a " % " sign ) in black typeface for representing healthy battery level percentages while the other half are in red typeface for when battery life falls bellow a certain threshold .
It appears , though it 's not confirmed , that users will have the option of selecting how their battery status indicator appears in the menubar — such as an icon - only view ( per current versions of the software ) , an icon + numerical view , or a numerical - view only .
This would be similar to fast user switching menu option for Mac OS X that lets you display the accounts by " Name , " " Short Name , " or " Icon . "
Push Notification preferences
Also visible in the latest betas of iPhone 3.0 software is a new Push Notifications preference pane that will allow you to enable or disable any of the three types of notifications that third party applications can push to your handset : Sounds , Alerts and Badges .
Alternatively , notifications can be disabled as a whole .
This should provide users with tighter control of their battery usage .
Data Detectors
Finally , it 's also noted that Apple is enabling Data Detectors in a variety of new applications .
Data Detectors automatically detect text fragments like email addresses , phone numbers , and street addresses , so you can execute actions on those fragments via touch selections — like dialing a phone number automatically by clicking on it or adding it to your address book .
The example above shows Data Detectors in action in the new Notes application .
The detectors are only visible and executable when viewing a note , not while editing one .
Variable scrubber speeds
Update :
These shots just came in , showing the ability to change scrubbing speeds in the iPod application .
STILL looking for ways to lower your taxes ?
Greening your home means you can get more greenbacks in return .
The stimulus plan approved by Congress in February offers tax credits for making your home more energy efficient .
For tax tips , the Green Home turned to Kateri Callahan , president of the Alliance to Save Energy , a nonprofit group that advocated some of these credits .
How can the new tax law make our homes greener ?
Uncle Sam is offering up to $ 1,500 in tax credit for energy - efficiency upgrades like new insulation and windows .
The credits are worth 30 percent of the total cost for the upgrades .
For example , if you spent $ 3,000 on eligible windows , you can get back $ 900 .
What exactly is covered ?
Can I get money back for weather stripping ?
Yes .
There are four types of upgrades that are covered .
The first batch are home - shell improvements like insulation , windows and sealing .
These are designed to make the home tighter and close up leaks .
The next batch are home heating , ventilating and air - conditioning , or HVAC .
This includes efficient air - conditioners and furnaces .
A third batch is renewable energy technology like geothermal heat pumps , solar water heating , small wind generators and photovoltaic systems .
The last batch  and perhaps the most popular  are hybrid and diesel cars .
Are the credits limited to green improvements that we make right away ?
No , the credits for the home shell and HVAC are available if you make these investments anytime before Dec. 31 , 2010 .
Investments in renewal energy systems are eligible for credit until Dec. 31 , 2016 .
A year following the death of Ludwig von Mises , Murray Rothbard wrote the book designed to inspire a new generation to take up the Misesian cause in economic theory and political action .
His task was to provide an overview of Mises ’s writings and place in the social sciences .
The essay achieved extraordinary fame .
We might even say that " The Essential von Mises , " distributed in the form of a mini-book , was more responsible for immortalizing Mises than any other essay ever written .
The Mises Institute is thrilled to be able to bring it back again .
It has lost none of its power in the intervening years .
Here it is coupled with an outstanding biographical piece that Rothbard wrote in the 1990s : " Scholar , Creator , Hero . "
It goes into greater biographical depth , and incorporates many discoveries made over twenty years .
The content really serves as an expansion on the first essay rather than an updated form of the same , so it makes sense to have them placed together .
Therefore this book might be called " Rothbard on Mises " but it really serves as the best , short , all - round introduction to Misesian thought to ever appear in print .
It is all the essentials of what you must know about this great man and thinker .
By the way , the cover is extremely cool , though you might not be able to tell it from the small picture .
It is actually made from dozens of tiny pictures of Mises , and really constitutes an artistic and technological marvel .
You may download a high - resolution version of this cover , here .

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of medicine 's most vexing challenges .
In a study described in Nature Chemical Biology , researchers from Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University are developing a new generation of antibiotic compounds that do not provoke bacterial resistance .
The compounds work against two notorious microbes : Vibrio cholerae , which causes cholera ; and E. coli 0157 : H7 , the food contaminant that each year in the U.S. causes approximately 110,000 illnesses and 50 deaths .
Vern Schramm , Ph.D.
Most antibiotics initially work extremely well , killing more than 99.9 % of microbes they target .
But through mutation and the selection pressure exerted by the antibiotic , a few bacterial cells inevitably manage to survive , repopulate the bacterial community , and flourish as antibiotic - resistant strains .
Vern L. Schramm , Ph.D. , professor and Ruth Merns Chair of Biochemistry at Einstein and senior author of the paper , hypothesized that antibiotics that could reduce the infective functions of bacteria , but not kill them , would minimize the risk that resistance would later develop .
Dr. Schramm 's collaborators at Industrial Research Ltd. earlier reported transition state analogues of an enzyme that interferes with " quorum sensing " — the process by which bacteria communicate with each other by producing and detecting signaling molecules known as autoinducers .
These autoinducers coordinate bacterial gene expression and regulate processes — including virulence — that benefit the microbial community .
Previous studies had shown that bacterial strains defective in quorum sensing cause less - serious infections .
Rather than killing Vibrio cholerae and E. coli 0157 :H7 , the researchers aimed to disrupt their ability to communicate via quorum sensing .
Their target : A bacterial enzyme , MTAN , that is directly involved in synthesizing the autoinducers crucial to quorum sensing .
Their plan : Design a substrate to which MTAN would bind much more tightly than to its natural substrate — so tightly , in fact , that the substrate analog permanently " locks up " MTAN and inhibits it from fueling quorum sensing .
To design such a compound , the Schramm lab first formed a picture of an enzyme 's transition state — the brief ( one - tenth of one - trillionth of a second ) period in which a substrate is converted to a different chemical at an enzyme 's catalytic site .
( Dr. Schramm has pioneered efforts to synthesize transition state analogs that lock up enzymes of interest .
One of these compounds , Forodesine , blocks an enzyme that triggers T - cell malignancies and is currently in a phase IIb pivitol clinical study treating cutaneous T - cell leukemia . )
In the Nature Chemical Biology study , Dr. Schramm and his colleagues tested three transition state analogs against the quorum sensing pathway .
All three compounds were highly potent in disrupting quorum sensing in both V. cholerae and E. coli 0157:H7 .
To see whether the microbes would develop resistance , the researchers tested the analogs on 26 successive generations of both bacterial species .
The 26th generations were as sensitive to the antibiotics as the first .
" In our lab , we call these agents everlasting antibiotics , " said Dr. Schramm .
He notes that many other aggressive bacterial pathogens — S. pneumoniae , N. meningitides , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Staphylococcus aureus — express MTAN and therefore would probably also be susceptible to these inhibitors .
While this study involves three compounds , Dr. Schramm says that his team has now developed more than 20 potent MTAN inhibitors , all of which are expected to be safe for human use : Since MTAN is a bacterial enzyme , blocking it will have no effect on human metabolism .
Other Einstein researchers involved in the study were Jemy Gutierrez , the lead author , Tamara Crowder , Agnes Rinaldo - Matthis , M. C. ( Joseph ) Ho and Steven C. Almo .
The powerful inhibitors were reported in an earlier publication in collaboration with the Carbohydrate Chemistry Team of Industrial Research Ltd. , in New Zealand .
The compounds in this paper have been licensed to Pico Pharmaceuticals , which plans to develop and initiate clinical trials of transition - state analogues .
Dr. Schramm is a Pico Pharmaceuticals co-founder and chairman of its scientific advisory board .
In the United States when I think of ladies underwear I think of Victoria ’s Secret .
If you were to ask me to name another store I would n’t know how to answer .
Victoria ’s Secret is a staple in any American mall , men lust over their sexy models , and it seems like every woman loves shopping there .
That ’s the situation here in the US , but this got me thinking … where do ladies shop for bras and other intimate clothing in other countries ?
What is the equivalent “ Victoria ’s Secret ” in foreign countries and how do they advertise their product ?
Armed only with the power of the Internet in this series of posts I set out to find out these answers and embark on the World Bra Tour – an exploration of Bra culture around the world .
Today I start off the tour with Germany .
…
How Do You Say “ Bra ” in German ?
I was real excited to get started on my Bra quest , however , the first roadblock I came across in my research is that if you search “ German Bra Commercials ” in Google you do n’t get many good results .
The same is true if you search Youtube .
I decided to change my approach and search in German .
But how do you say “ bra ” in German ?
I headed to Google Translate and entered “ bra ” and was given the German translation “ BH . ”
Then I learned to say “ BH Werbung ” ( Bra advertisement ) .
I do n’t speak any German , but I was curious to see what “ bh ” actually sound like and thanks to online text - to - speech I was able to find out .
Here I learned what “ BH Werbung ” sounded like .

Unfortunately “ BH Werbung ” is not very useful in everyday speech , so here ’s a phrase that might be more useful “ Ich kann Ihre BH ! ” ( I can see your bra ! )

Thanks to my new found knowledge I was able to find much more interesting bra commercials .
…
Bonprix
To be honest this commercial is n’t that exciting .
The clip is from their youtube channel , Bonprix FashionTV , where they are advertising and all of their clothing products which also include men , women , and children ’s fashion .
Turns out Bonprix is one of the largest e-commerce websites in Germany ( top 10 according to their translated wiki page ) .
They sell their goods through mail order catalogs , online , and a TV shopping show they have .
Their website has this pretty cool feature where you can browse and even download their full catalogs .
For those interested in Bonprix ’s bra and underwear fashions check out their catalog .
The catalog is pretty interesting .
It has page turning animations so as you are browsing you feel like you are viewing a real catalog .
If you happen to find a bra that interests you , you can click on it and you ’ll be taken to the product information page .
More impressively , if you click on the magnifying glass on that page you can zoom - in ultra close on the product and model .
I ’m assuming the reason you would want to do this is the examine the quality of the material .
…
Lascana
As Lascana ’s slogan “ It ’s a woman ’s world ” suggests , Lascana is focused solely on women ’s fashion .
They have stores throughout Germany and seem to be similar to Victoria ’s Secret , but perhaps more upscale .
In addition to lingerie they also sell swimsuits and “ homewear ” ( which looks like sleepwear to me ) .
Mahret Kupka , a German fashion blogger , did a great write up ( originally in German , but translated courtesy of Google ) where she toured a Lascana store and snapped some good photos .
Below is a video tour
She did at one of Lascana ’s stores .
It seems she was very fascinated by the dressing rooms .
Lascana also has an online catalog so if you are curious you can scope out all the latest Lascana fashions .
Just like Bonprix , Lascana also has their own product super zoom - in feature .
It ’s a little different , but basically the same idea .
Find a product you like and then zoom up way close to check out the quality of the fabric .
…
C&A
Of all the German bra commercials I ’ve come across so far , C&A ’s seems to be the sexiest .
In addition to showcasing not only their bras but also their “ strings ” ( which I assume are panties … ) they have some interesting camera angles and shots .
Here ’s another example of their more racy commercials .
The prices do n’t seem so bad considering it ’s only 6 euros ( $ 8 ) for the string ( panties ) , 15 ( $ 20 ) for the “ corsage , ” and 12 ( $ 16 ) for the “ BH ” ( which we all learned earlier is bra in German ) .
However , it should be noted that these videos are from 2003 so if you take into account inflation it ’s probably like million euros now .
As you might be able to guess with these kind of prices C&A is n’t going after the high end market ( Walmart sells a bra for $ 19 ) .
Similar to Bonprix , C&A sells all kinds of fashion for men , women , and children .
They have stores all over Europe , but in 2001 closed down all the stores in the UK due to poor sales .
Recently they ’ve been trying to reinvent their low budget image by improving the quality and increasing the prices .
You can check out C&A ’s bra and underwear fashions by checking out their online catalog .
It ’s not as fancy as the other two online catalogs , but they lots of photos and they have their own product super zoom - in feature .
I know Walmart for sure does n’t have this feature .
…
Overall Lessons Learned
The German online bra and underwear browsing and shopping experience is very different from the United States .
They take tons of high quality photos of the products and models .
They also have very innovative interactive product catalogs .
I ’m still amazed at how you can zoom so close up to the models .
You can see the pores in the skin !
Victoria ’s Secret seems so boring now .

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are major investors in Tesla Motors , which on March 26 revealed the prototype of its all - electric , zero-emission sedan , the Model S .
The vehicle , which can accelerate from 0 - 60 mph in under 6 seconds and hit a top speed of 130 miles per hour , will feature a 17 - inch touch - screen with 3G connectivity , allowing drivers to check Google Maps or other data .
The car 's electrical charge could also theoretically be monitored via an iPhone or a laptop , according to the company .
Tesla hopes that the Model S will eventually lead to a mass - produced electric vehicle , but production hinges on whether the Department of Energy will provide a $ 350 million loan to help kick - start production .
" This is just the first of many mainstream cars we 're developing , " Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla , said in a statement .
Musk was a co-founder of PayPal and founder of SpaceX .
Musk went on to cite the ownership cost of the Model S , should it enter production , as " similar to a gasoline car with a sticker price of about $ 35,000 " once the lower cost of electricity versus the likely future price of gasoline was taken into account .
The company anticipates that the base price of the Model S will stand at $ 49,900 , once federal tax credits totaling roughly $ 7,500 are factored in ; it will come with a choice of batteries with either a 160- , 230 - or 300 - miles - per - charge range .
Deliveries of the vehicle will begin in 2012 ; those interested can visit this site to put their name on what will presumably be a long waiting list , if sales of the Roadster , Tesla 's first electric car , are any indication .
The Roadster , currently in production with a price of just over $ 109,000 , can go from 0 - 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and travel 244 miles per charge .
There is a substantial waitlist for the vehicle , which was unveiled in 2006 , three years after the founding of Tesla Motors .
Starting this spring and continuing through 2009 , Tesla will open stores in Chicago , London , New York , Miami , Seattle , Washington and Munich .
Both Page and Brin , who 've made no secret of their green IT leanings , were early investors in the company .
Should the Model S enter production , it may very well have a variety of technologies already in place to help meet drivers ' commuting IT needs .
Intel rolled out four new Atom processors on March 2 designed to fit into a wider variety of devices , including those embedded in car dashboards ; those processors will be paired with the Microsoft Auto software platform , designed to provide features such as mobile device integration and speech recognition .
The Model S's promised 3G connectivity will allow drivers to connect with Google Maps , Internet radio and other tools .
By combining techniques from game theory and artificial intelligence , computer scientists at the University of Michigan have developed a better way to find the best bidding strategy in a simulated auction modeled after commodity and financial securities markets .
In their paper Stronger CDA Strategies Through Empirical Game - Theoretic Analysis and Reinforcement Learning , Michael Wellman , a professor in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering , and doctoral candidate L. Julian Schvartzman describe a continuous double auction -- an ever - changing market in which bidders exchange offers to both buy and sell , and transactions occur as soon as participants agree on a price .
This dynamic behavior is characteristic of the stock market , for example .
And it makes such markets difficult for researchers to study and solve .
Analysts trying to " solve " such problems are seeking an equilibrium for the market .
An equilibrium is a configuration of bidding strategies under which each participant uses the best strategy he or she can , taking into consideration the other participants ' strategies .
Schvartzman and Wellman evaluated and tested all prior proposals for the best strategies , which include waiting until the last minute to bid , randomly bidding , and taking into account the history of the bids of all participants .
They say they 've conducted the most comprehensive continuous double auction strategy study ever published .
To this evaluation they added a layer of artificial intelligence , or machine learning .
The " reinforcement learning " technique they used enables a computer to , in essence , learn from experimenting with actions in a variety of situations to determine what overall strategy would work best .
" Nobody has put these techniques together before , " Schvartzman said .
" One could take these techniques and apply them to real markets , not to predict specific price movements , but to determine the best bidding strategy , given your objectives , " Wellman said .
This new combined method generated a more stable equilibrium candidate comprising stronger bidding strategies than any previously identified , the researchers say .
The method would produce different strategies in different situations .
" My goal is to make a contribution to the automation of markets , " Schvartzman said , " not just financial markets , but in other scenarios , such as web advertising or even nurses bidding for their shifts in hospitals .
Eventually , any resource allocation problem in which there is uncertainty about what something is worth could use a dynamic market instead of a fixed price . "
President Barack Obama is ordering the release of nearly a quarter of a million pages of records from the Reagan White House .
Obama releases Reagan records
President Barack Obama is ordering the release of nearly a quarter of a million pages of records from the Reagan White House that were kept from the public during a lengthy review by President George W. Bush .
The Reagan documents – which include presidential briefing papers , speechwriting research materials and declassified foreign policy records — are expected to be released Monday .

Officials said the Obama administration ’s quick verdict on the documents was prompted by an executive order Obama signed in January that gives the incumbent president 30 days to make such a decision , unless he sets a longer period .
By contrast , Bush ’s executive order on presidential records set no time limit on the White House ’s review .
“ With regard to the Reagan Administration records , I am writing to inform you that the President has not asserted executive privilege over any of this material , ” White House Counsel Greg Craig wrote in a letter Thursday obtained by POLITICO .
“ Pursuant to the President ’s Executive Order , NARA may release these records — opening close to 250,000 pages of history , ” Craig wrote to the director of the presidential libraries unit at the National Archives and Records Administration , Nancy Kegan Smith .
A smaller batch of 797 pages from President George H.W. Bush ’s presidential library on the topic of Saudi Arabia also has been cleared for release Monday .
In recent years , historians and open - government groups complained bitterly that the review process President George W. Bush instituted was causing a backlog that was stalling the release of tens of thousands of pages of presidential records .
“ The cynical view is that the process is deliberately inefficient , ” Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive testified at a Congressional hearing on the issue in 2007 .
One advocate for greater disclosure hailed Obama 's move .
" This is a great development , " Scott Nelson of the Public Citizen Litigation Group said .
" It 's very encouraging that the Bush order and the burden it imposes on the White House to do a page - by - page review apparently wo n't be taking place under this administration .
We wo n't have this additional layer of delays . "
However , there were indications that the most contested presidential records from the Reagan era might not be among the roughly 250,000 pages cleared for release by Obama .
Nelson ’s group fought a court battle for about a dozen documents , including memoranda about possible pardons for Iran - Contra figures such as Oliver North and John Poindexter .
Representatives of former President Reagan objected to the release of those documents and were backed up in almost all instances by lawyers for President Bush .
A federal judge ruled that the requesters ’ had no legal grounds to overcome the incumbent president ’s assertion of privilege .
Craig ’s letter says Reagan ’s representative approved of the release of the documents the White House cleared on Thursday , making it unlikely the files contain the same records that led to the court battle .
A representative for the elder Bush also consented to have his documents released , officials said .
Obama ’s openness to releasing historical presidential records could put him at odds with former presidents or their families who seek to block such a release .
But officials said there was no disagreement about the records to be released next week .

Swine flu panic is spreading in Mexico and soldiers are patrolling the streets after it was confirmed that human to human transmission is occurring and that the virus is a brand new strain which is seemingly affecting young , healthy people the worst , and that the bug is a never - before - seen intercontinental mixture of human , avian and pig viruses from America , Europe and Asia .
Clues that the virus may be a synthetic creation are already manifesting .
According to reports , the virus is a “ never - before - seen form of the flu that combines pig , bird and human viruses ” which consists of an intercontinental mix of viruses from North America , Europe and Asia .
“ CDC officials detected a virus with a unique combination of gene segments that have not been seen in people or pigs before , ” according to an Associated Press report .
“ This strain of swine influenza that ’s beencultured in a laboratoryis something that ’s not been seen anywhere actually in the United States and the world , so this is actually a new strain of influenza that ’s been identified , ” said Dr. John Carlo , Dallas Co. Medical Director ( video clip here ) .
Alarming reports are now filtering in about people catching the illness who have had no contact with pigs whatsoever .
These include a man and his daughter in San Diego County , a 41 - year - old woman in Imperial County and two teenagers in San Antonio , Texas .
In fact , in all U.S. cases , the victims had no contact with any pigs .
Dr. Wilma Wooten , San Diego County ’s public health officer , told KPBS “ We have had person - to - person spread with the father and the daughter , ” says Wooten , “ And also with the two teenagers in Texas , they were in the same school .
So that also indicates person - to - person transfer . ”
“ Dr. Wooten says it ’s unclear how people were exposed to swine flu .
She says none of the patients have had any contact with pigs , ” according to the report .
Although the situation in the U.S. looks under control , panic is spreading in Mexico , where 800 cases of pneumonia in the capital alone are suspected to be related to the swine flu and the virus has hit young and healthy people , which is very rare with an flu outbreak .
Despite the danger of a pandemic , the U.S. border with Mexico remains open .
“ Mexico has shut schools and museums and canceled hundreds of public events in its sprawling , overcrowded capital of 20 million people to try to prevent further infections , ” reports Reuters .
“ My level of concern is significant , ” said Dr. Martin Fenstersheib , the health officer for Santa Clara County .
“ We have a novel virus , a brand - new strain that ’s spreading human to human , and we are also seeing a virulent strain in Mexico that seems to be related .
We certainly have concerns for this escalating . ”
The WHO insists that the outbreak has “ pandemic potential ” and has been stockpiling supplies of Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , a pill that can both treat flu and prevent infection , according to officials .
As we previously highlighted , those that have a stake in the Tamiflu vaccine include top globalists and BIlderberg members like George Shultz , Lodewijk J.R. de Vink and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Indeed , Rumsfeld himself played a key role in hyping an outbreak of swine flu back in the 1976 when he urged the entire country to get vaccinated .
Many batches of the vaccine were contaminated , resulting in hundreds of sick people and 52 fatalities .
The fact that the properties of the strain are completely new , that the virus is spreading from people to people , and that the young and healthy are being hit worst , has disturbing parallels to the deadly 1918 pandemic that killed millions .
It is unclear as to why , if the virus is a brand new strain , that public health officials are so confident programs of mass vaccination , which are already being prepared , would necessarily be effective .
It certainly would n’t be the first time that deadly flu viruses have been concocted in labs and then dispatched with the intention of creating a pandemic .
When the story first broke last month , Czech newspapers questioned if the shocking discovery of vaccines contaminated with the deadly avian flu virus which were distributed to 18 countries by the American company Baxter were part of a conspiracy to provoke a pandemic .
Since the probability of mixing a live virus biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible , this leaves no other explanation than that the contamination was a deliberate attempt to weaponize the H5N1 virus to its most potent extreme and distribute it via conventional flu vaccines to the population who would then infect others to a devastating degree as the disease went airborne .
However , this is not the first time that vaccine companies have been caught distributing vaccines contaminated with deadly viruses .
In 2006 it was revealed that Bayer Corporation had discovered that their injection drug , which was used by hemophiliacs , was contaminated with the HIV virus .
Internal documents prove that after they positively knew that the drug was contaminated , they took it off the U.S. market only to dump it on the European , Asian and Latin American markets , knowingly exposing thousands , most of them children , to the live HIV virus .
Government officials in France went to prison for allowing the drug to be distributed .
The documents show that the FDA colluded with Bayer to cover - up the scandal and allowed the deadly drug to be distributed globally .
No Bayer executives ever faced arrest or prosecution in the United States .
In the UK , a 2007 outbreak of foot and mouth disease that put Britain on high alert has been originated from a government laboratory which is shared with an American pharmaceutical company , mirroring the deadly outbreak of 2001 , which was also deliberately released .
As we reported yesterday , last time there was a significant outbreak of a new form of swine flu in the U.S. it originated at the army base at Fort Dix , New Jersey .

I had a really great time at RailsConf .
I met a ton of really cool people bursting with enthusiasm for great projects .
I sort of knew this already , but now I know it viscerally : the diversity of things that people are doing with Rails far outstrips the ability of those most deeply involved in building it day - to - day to anticipate .
What was also really great was that so many of the ideas people asked me about could be answered by pointing at new extension points or modular APIs that we 're adding to Rails .
About my talks : let 's just say some of them could have been better .
I 'll post the slides inline below with my personal wrap - up of each .
The jQuery Tutorial
The slides for the tutorial are available on this blog ; the code is at Github .
I had high hopes for this tutorial initially , but a few things ( mostly my fault ) made it worse than I expected .
First of all , I lost my co-presenter around a week before the tutorial .
Thanks to Andy Delcambre , this did not catastrophically destroy the tutorial , but it did add additional challenges .
Had I been better - prepared , it would not have been such a problem , and Andy performed very well under pressure , getting into the flow in a week in which he was also preparing the Flex demo for RailsConf .
Second of all , I did n't specify the required skill level for the tutorial , which led to a wide disparity in the skill level of the attendees .
I expected an intermediate group , so the focus that should have been on the introductory section and the labs was spread out to parts of the tutorial that we never really got to ( e.g. evented programming ) .
As a result , almost all of the feedback was either " that was wayyyy too introductory " or " that was wayyyy too advanced . "
Again , this is something I should have prepared for , so definitely a mea culpa on my part .
All that said , I thought the content and labs were really good for the portion of the audience in the sweet spot ( knew some JavaScript and CSS , but still needed more training in jQuery ) .
Technical Deep Dive
No code or slides here ; the entire session was Carl and I talking through the recent architectural changes .
For an evening Birds of a Feather , we got excellent attendance , and almost exclusively positive feedback .
I thought it went very well , and really enjoyed the opportunity to share the gory technical details with the folks who took a night off of Vegas to stay for a very low - level technical talk .
Russian Doll Pattern
Again , this did n't go as well as I 'd hoped , but I 'm still relatively pleased with the outcome .
It was the first talk given jointly by Carl and me , and our relentless focus on getting the Rails code we 're working on ready for RailsConf left us with less time to get our delivery anywhere near as smooth as the Ruby standard - bearers for joint talks , Joe O'Brien and Jim Weirich .
The talk is available from this blog as well .
We also focused heavily on the concept of mountable apps and addressed a lot of the concerns that people have made in the past , as well as focused on appropriate techniques for building applications that could be reusable .
Unfortunately , we 're not yet at a point where we can show a final DSL for the specifics .
What I find personally frustrating is that for a lot of the most interesting projects , the hard work is the first 98 % , after which there 's nothing " cool " to show .
The final 2 % , which is usually a day or two of work , produces the whiz - bang demos .
For a lot of what we 've been doing in Rails , we 're at the 90 % or so mark , which means that the underlying infrastructure for doing really cool stuff is in place , but we do n't have the whiz - bang demos yet .
Thankfully , there was a great complementary talk by James Adam at RailsConf which covered the state of the art of engines as of Rails 2.3 , so I was happy focusing our presentation on the likely future .
Still , the " unicorn " , ethereal focus definitely detracted from what was otherwise a good first showing for the pair of Carl and me .
If anyone attended any of the sessions and has questions or constructive feedback , I 'd love to hear it .

Richard Bilton meets people who watch us and those who have fallen foul of modern surveillance
A new three part series looks at why the UK has become one of the most watched places in the world - with millions of CCTV cameras , a growing network of number plate recognition cameras , one of the largest DNA databases in the world and government plans for the basic details of all our phone calls e-mails , and every internet site we visit to be logged and kept .
We all benefit from better crime detection and from easier and cheaper services .
The government argues that : " If you 've got nothing to hide , then you 've got nothing to fear . "
Richard Bilton explores the hidden world of surveillance .
He goes inside the CCTV nerve centre , sees how all of our journeys can be monitored , and meets undercover agents , those who are watched and those who have fallen foul of modern surveillance .
Who 's Watching You ?
explores why increasingly we are all being watched and why some think we have already become a surveillance society .

American singer , actress and author Miley Cyrus from the hit Disney show Hannah Montana has come out publicly with her support for same - sex marriage .
In response to the current fiasco over Miss USA contestant Miss California who publicly stated her opposition to equal marriage , gossip columnist Perez Hilton asked Cyrus for her thoughts .
The pop star went on to say that :
" Everyone deserves to love and be loved and most importantly smile ... God 's greatest commandment is to love .
And judging is not loving .
That 's why Christians have such a bad rep " ( KBS Radio ) .
It is so critical for celebrities who hold a lot of media attention and influence over the public to speak out , particularly Miley Cyrus who speaks to millions of youth nationwide .
Please thank Miley Cyrus by contacting her through her Myspace page .
The SigO and I went to the grasslands to do some shooting on Saturday morning .
We discovered that part of the reason she does n’t like firing my Glock is that , as a southpaw shooter , the magazine release on the thing gouges her hand near the base of her index finger , particularly when it recoils .
Since it ’s a .40 S&W caliber handgun with a lightweight polymer frame , it recoils a bit .
Magazine releases are really high on the list of things to look out for when shopping for a gun for her .
Another big lesson for the day was the discovery that CCI Blazer FMJ .32 ACP sucks in the Kel - Tec P32 .
We put 57 rounds through the P32 that day , 50 of which were the CCI Blazers .
About one of every three rounds misfired .
Point , squeeze . . . click .
It would dimple the primer , but nothing would ignite .
Recock , squeeze again — 60 % or so chance it ’ll fire on the second try .
All of them fired by the third try , except one that took about six or seven tries to get it to discharge .
I wanted all that ammo expended .
Considering the whole point of a P32 is to have a highly concealable sidearm for defensive concealed carry , misfires are a really bad idea .
The previous week , I put 50 rounds of FMJ from Aguila Ammunition through it with the help of a friend ( we swapped off shooting the P32 ) , and it went without a hitch .
While struggling this last Saturday to get the CCI Blazer ammo to fire , I expended a full magazine of Federal Premium ’s Hydra - Shok ( my defensive ammo of choice for carry ) through the barrel just to make sure what I was carrying would actually do some good if ( God forbid ) I should ever be called upon to defend myself with it , and it went as slick as a whistle .
Not one single magazine of CCI Blazer was expended without at least one , usually two , misfired cartridges .
I do n’t intend to ever buy another round of CCI Blazer again , after a performance like that .
I ’m tempted to hunt down a box of Winchester white box FMJ .32 ACP to see how well it performs , since I ’m sure it would be cheaper than the Blazer .
Amusingly , I have discovered that I have a tendency to confuse people in gun shops when shopping for FMJ ammunition .
I have a habit of calling it “ ball ” rather than “ FMJ ” , because that ’s what we called the full metal jacket 5.56 mm ammunition in the Army : “ 5.56 mm ball ammo ” .
Yeah , people give me weird looks and say interesting things like “ What ? ” I really need to adjust my jargon .
They probably all thought I was an idiot .
Bullets are n’t balls !
Addendum : I found reference to someone else having problems with CCI Blazer in a Kel - Tec P32 , as well .
Apparently , Kel - Tec recommends avoiding CCI Blazer .
Another Addendum : I ’ve been informed by someone who would probably know that the reason the CCI Blazers misfire in my P32 is that CCI uses “ hard ” primers — which are , along with Winchester ’s “ hard ” primers , recommended for reloading / handloading , because of their reduced likelihood of going off while handloading ammo ( that is to say , creating a live cartridge by putting a new bullet , primer , and powder charge in a used shell casing ) .
When buying factory ammo , though , I think I ’ll just avoid CCI and Winchester ammo for my P32 , at least unless and until I replace the firing pin spring with something that provides more tension so it ’ll set off the harder primers on the first try every time .
Yet Another Addendum : I tried CCI Blazer with aluminum casings , and discovered that it fires quite well in my P32 .
Apparently , it ’s only the brass - cased Blazers that have that problem .

THE STORY
The Age of Stupid stars Oscar - nominated Pete Postlethwaite ( In The Name of the Father , The Usual Suspects , Brassed Off ) as a man living in the devastated future world of 2055 , looking back at old footage from our time and asking : why did n't we stop climate change when we had the chance ?
Launched at a Guinness World Recording - winning solar - powered premiere in London 's Leicester Square , the film was released in cinemas worldwide , topped the UK box office ( by screen average ) , became one of the most talked - about films of 2009 and garnered sensational reviews :
The Telegraph called it " Bold , supremely provocative and hugely important " , the News of the World described it as " A deeply inconvenient kick up the backside " , ABC Australia said " So tightly constructed and dynamic you leave the cinema energised rather than terrified ... hits home like a hammer blow " and the LA Times said " Think ' An Inconvenient Truth ' , but with a personality " .
Multi-award - winning documentary director Franny Armstrong ( McLibel , Drowned Out ) and Oscar - winning producer John Battsek ( One Day In September , Restrepo ) pioneered the now ubiquitous " crowd - funding " model to finance the film , and then spent four years following seven real people 's stories to be interweaved with Pete Postlethwaite 's fictional character : an Indian entrepreneur struggling to start a new low - cost airline , a Shell employee in New Orleans who rescued more than 100 people during Hurricane Katrina , an 82 - year - old French mountain guide watching his beloved glaciers melt , two Iraqi refugee children searching for their elder brother , a young woman living in desperate poverty in Nigeria 's richest oil area and a windfarm developer in Britain battling the NIMBYs who do n't want his turbines to spoil their view .
The Age of Stupid led to the formation of the 10:10 carbon reduction campaign which now operates in 45 countries ( www.1010global.org).
Recognising the film 's unique contribution to independent filmmaking , the Huffington Post said that it " represents the future of film , film culture and film distribution and marketing " .
The Age of Stupid is now available to view in 20 languages on iTunes , Amazon Prime , Vimeo On Demand , Google Play and direct from this site .

You gaze idly at the carnage around you , sigh , and go calmly back to your coffee and your People magazine .
You think you ’re an activist because you bitch all day on the internet , but you reelect the same gangsters at a 99 % rate .
You shrug your shoulders at the knowledge that your government is populated by criminal liars intent on fooling you into impoverished , helpless submission .
You cheer this process on .
You consider yourself informed because you waste a significant portion of your life watching the same three news stories cycle over and over again on your gargantuan , aerodynamic television set while you eat processed food .
Your whole life has been a pitiful exercise in rote mimicry , a meek subjugation of individuality in exchange for herd approval .
Your delusions of “ common sense ” wisdom stem from an unwillingness to seek information and an inability to critically analyze it .
You cling to every scrap of bullshit you can find to support your ludicrous belief system , and reject all empirical evidence to the contrary .
You never hesitate to offer strong opinions on subjects you do n’t know a damn thing about .
You ’re more worried about friction on the “ Desperate Housewives ” set than the lack of health coverage at your tedious , soul - destroying job .
You have no idea what is going on in the world , and you ’re fine with that .
You have a poorer understanding of your country ’s foreign policy history than a third world peasant , but you ca n’t wait to see what Julia Roberts will be wearing at the Oscars .
You are shallow , inconsiderate , afraid , brand - conscious , sedentary , and totally self - obsessed .
You are American .
You are why democracy does n’t work .
You are an idiot .

The Factor game framework
For kicks , I felt like taking a couple weeks and trying to write some game infra­structure in Factor .
You can see some of my handiwork in the terrain demo I recently threw together .
If you have an OpenGL 2.0 - capable graphics card , download a recent Factor build for Windows or Mac and run from the listener :
" terrain " run
( X11 is n't supported by some of the libraries yet . )
Wait a few seconds and you should see this :
Use the WASD keys , spacebar , and mouse to walk , fly , and look around , respectively .
Hit Escape when you get bored .
Here 's what I 've added to Factor to make the demo possible :
The UI library
Factor 's UI already provided a decent cross-platform interface to the OpenGL implementations on X11 , MacOS X and Windows .
However , the UI library does a lot of OpenGL state manipulation that gadgets have to work within ( or work around ) to behave alongside other gadgets .
If you just wanted an empty window and a naked OpenGL context to have your way with , there was nowhere to hide from the UI 's disapproving glare .
… Until now , that is .
I shoved all that gadget management code into a handful of generic functions that you can override by providing your own subclass of world ( Factor 's representation of a window ) .
I also added pixel format selection support , so you can ask for a window with stencil buffers , multisampling , high - resolution depth buffers , or other OpenGL features not required by the UI .
Game input
I wrote some bindings to DirectInput on Windows and IOHIDManager on MacOS X , and wrapped them in a cross - platform game - input library .
Along with some support from the UI for grabbing the mouse pointer , the library provides raw polling access to keyboard , mouse , and game controller input .
Game loop
Writing a good game loop is hard .
Now you do n't have to — there 's a game - loop library already there .
Give it a timer tick length and a delegate object , and the loop goes off , drawing your world as quickly as your hardware allows and firing off a timer tick when necessary .
The loop also provides a tick - slice fraction to the draw hook to allow the drawing routine to interpolate the game state between timer ticks .
A game - world class neatly wraps up the above components .
Remaining work
All this code is still pretty green , so do n't quit your job to write games in Factor just yet .
Here are a handful of things that need to be worked on :
The game loop does n't fire ticks very steadily yet .
There 's noticeable unevenness when walking around in the terrain demo .
It needs some tweaking to interact better with Factor 's thread scheduler .
game - input does n't support Linux or the BSDs yet .
It 's been a while since I 've used any of those platforms on a desktop machine , and I do n't know what the hip way of handling raw input is these days .
And I 'm afraid to ask .
does n't support Linux or the BSDs yet .
It 's been a while since I 've used any of those platforms on a desktop machine , and I do n't know what the hip way of handling raw input is these days .
And I 'm afraid to ask .
I have n't investigated audio at all .
Factor has an OpenAL binding that 's been around for a while and has been used for a couple of simple demos .
However , OpenAL is much lower - level than something like fmod , and you 'd need to build a lot on top of it to use it in a game .
Factor 's UI has a set - fullscreen function , but this just hides system decorations and resizes the window to cover the screen .
At some point I 'd like to make it support seizing the screen , changing the resolution , and using a true fullscreen OpenGL context .
The terrain demo itself is very basic too ; it only generates one small segment of terrain , and the Perlin noise code I wrote takes much longer than it should to generate segments .
Shortcomings aside , Factor 's a lot of fun to work with .
The FFI makes binding to system libraries trivial .
Its code is well - compartmentalized , and even old , relatively crusty code like the UI internals is easy to work with and add features to .
I do n't think any of the problems above are going to be hard to fix over time .
Cyrus Reed Teed , a.k.a. the Prophet Koresh .
Public - domain image from Wikipedia
It seems that every religion has at least one signature bizarre belief : whether it be that the messiah is an American soldier who will return from across the ocean bringing marvelous cargo , or that human beings are possessed by the ghosts of murdered aliens , or that God wants us to transform him into crackers and consume him each week .
But for sheer extravagant , defiant wackiness in the face of obvious disproof , you ca n’t beat the subject of today ’s entry .
An enduring notion in humanity ’s meme pool , one that ’s captivated obscure crackpots as well as famous sci- fi authors like Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs , is that the Earth is hollow and habitable within .
But the prophet Koresh , born Cyrus Reed Teed , took this charmingly crazy idea to a previously undreamed - of level : yes , he claimed , the Earth is hollow – and we ’re living on the inside .
Cyrus Teed was born in rural New York in 1839 .
By coincidence , he was a distant cousin of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith .
He served in the Union army and afterward studied medicine at the Eclectic Medical College , an unorthodox institution teaching what would today be called alternative medicine , focusing mainly on homeopathy and botanical remedies .
( To be fair , bloodletting was still the state of the art in conventional medicine . )
The recently - discovered laws of electromagnetism were all the rage at the time , and when Teed hung out his shingle , he blended his botanicals with what he called “ electro - alchemy ” , which employed strategic zaps of electricity , as well as liberal doses of religious mysticism and spiritual mumbo - jumbo , to cure his patients ’ ills .
In his spare time , he also dabbled in alchemy and claimed to have discovered the long - sought Philosopher ’s Stone which turns any base metal to gold .
David Standish ’s delightful book Hollow Earth calls
Teed ’s practice a “ peculiar amalgam of doctoring and cosmic revelation ” .
Even then ,
Teed held his curious belief that the world is hollow and that we all live on the inside , which he called the “ cellular cosmogony “ .
I just have to quote some of his magnum opus to give you a feel for it :
The alchemico - organic ( physical ) world or universe is a shell composed of seven metallic , five mineral , and five geologic strata , with an inner habitable surface of land and water .
This inner surface , as the reader already understands , is concave .
The seven metallic layers or laminae are the seven noble metals , — gold constituting the outermost rind of the shell .
This shell or crust is a number of miles in thickness .
Within this shell are three principal atmospheres , the first or outermost ( the one in which we exist ) being composed chiefly of oxygen and nitrogen ; the one immediately above that is pure hydrogen , and the one above the hydrogen atmosphere we have denominated aboron [ word invented by author — Ebonmuse ] .
Within this is the solar electromagnetic atmosphere , the nucleus of which is the stellar center .
In and occupying these atmospheres are the sun and stars , also the reflections called the planets and the moon .
The planets are mercurial disci moving by electromagnetic impulse between the metallic laminae or planes of the concave shell .
How Koreshans see the cosmos .
Image via David Standish ’s Hollow Earth .
This alone would n’t have elevated Cyrus Teed above the garden - variety kooks , but fate had greater things in store for him .
As his beliefs continued to evolve , he decided he had a higher calling than quack doctoring , and began calling himself the “ Prophet Koresh ” .
Moving seamlessly from pseudoscientific medicine into pure faith healing , he established the first “ Koreshan ” community in Chicago .
This was a combination of church and commune , presided over by Teed ( or Koresh ) that preached celibacy , the hollow earth , electro - alchemy , and Teed ’s belief in a deity who was the harmonious union of male and female .
Partly due to this , the Koreshan community was surprisingly enlightened for its time regarding the equality of the sexes , and many of its earliest followers were women .
Over several years , the number of followers grew .
By 1888 Teed had 126 devotees in Chicago , nearly three - quarters of whom were women .
Finally , he decided it was time for them to seek more spacious quarters elsewhere , so that he might build his New Jerusalem .
The spot he settled on was a place called Estero on the southwestern Florida coast .
Teed ’s ambitious vision was to build a great city , populated by tens of millions , all laid out according to his utopian schemes for a harmonious , socialist community of art , science , advanced technology – and , of course , the hollow earth .
Needless to say , Estero never attained this stature – the Prophet Koresh ’s cult topped out at around a few hundred – but it was a genuinely productive , peaceful community , and aside from an unsuccessful foray into local politics , got along well with surrounding towns .
Unlike many cult leaders ,
Teed never used his immense power over his followers for personal benefit .
His primary interest continued to be writing broadsides in Koreshan publications such as the Guiding Star ( later renamed to the Flaming Sword , which evidently focus - grouped better ) in favor of the hollow earth and against “ that dangerous fallacy , the Copernican system ” .
As Teed explains , the cosmos had to be as it was in his vision , because God would n’t have created a universe too great for us to understand :
If we accept the logical deduction of the fallacious Copernican system of astronomy , we conclude the universe to be illimitable and incomprehensible , and its cause equally so ; therefore , not only would the universe be forever beyond the reach of the intellectual perspective of human aspiration and effort , but God himself would be beyond the pale of our conception , and therefore beyond our adoration .
Sadly for
Teed , neither his utopian vision nor his hollow - earth theology were ever to make a larger impact on humanity : after a lingering illness , he died in December 1908 .
But his followers did not lose faith , because another of Teed ’s preachings was what he called “ theocrasis ” , “ the incorruptible dissolution of the physical body by electro - magnetic combustion ” .
In short , Teed claimed that , phoenix - like , he could resurrect himself .
His devoted followers accordingly placed his body in state … and waited .
And they kept waiting while their prophet decomposed , until local health authorities showed up , declared the Prophet Koresh to be obviously dead , and forced his body to be buried .
After Koresh ’s death , the community dwindled , but did not break up altogether .
Amazingly , it was not until 1961 that the last few die - hard Koreshans deeded Estero to the State of Florida .
It is now a state park , although Teed ’s mausoleum was washed out to sea in a hurricane in 1921 .
Only his granite headstone remains .
The cult of Koreshanity shows how shared devotion to any idea , no matter how bizarre , can serve to unite people under a common purpose .
The specific nature of the belief is irrelevant , so long as it serves to give its adherents a sense that they are among the elect .
If they are scorned and rejected by the wider world , so much the better , as this shared sense of persecution serves only to temper their communal bond .
And the next time a proselytizer claims that belief in God is a necessary inducement to virtue , remind them of the Koreshans .
By all accounts , their hollow - earth belief genuinely did produce , temporarily , a utopian community of peace , industriousness , and equality .
Does that make their belief any more true ?

SHEFFIELD , England , Jan. 4 ( UPI ) --
A new primary school in Britain has decided against calling itself a " school " because the word is too negative .
" One reason was many of the parents of the children here had very negative connotations of school , " said head teacher Linda Kingdon , calling Watercliffe Meadow " a place for learning . "

Watercliffe Meadow , which opens Monday , also will ban whistles , bells and locked doors , said Kingdon , noting children will be encouraged to wear soft shoes indoors to feel more comfortable , The Telegraph reported Sunday .
" We wanted to de-institutionalize the place and bring the school closer to real life , " she said .
Not everyone is in favor of Watercliffe Meadow 's decisions .
" We all know that they are going to be going to a school whatever you call it , " said Marie Clair , spokeswoman for the Campaign for Plain English , a group that opposes the use of " gobbledygook " in public life in Britain .
' Flawless ' : U.S. Navy snipers killed three Somali pirates with just three shots ... in the dark , from the deck of a rolling ship
Even for a Hollywood film , it sounds like an impossible shot .
In the dark , from the deck of a rolling ship , U.S. Navy snipers had to take aim into a covered lifeboat 75 ft away that was also pitching in the choppy seas .
They needed to kill three Somali pirates - one of whom was inside the pilot house of the lifeboat - and they needed to do it simultaneously to save the life of hostage captain Richard Phillips .
Captain Richard Phillips ( R ) shakes hands with Frank Castellano , commanding officer of USS Bainbridge after being rescued by off the coast of Somalia
And succeed they did .
A fourth pirate was then captured after being injured .
He faces a life sentence in an American prison .
Vice - Admiral William Gortney , head of the U.S. Navy in the region , said the marksmen pulled off ' phenomenal shots ' from 75 ft away .
Barack Obama had given his approval for the Navy to use lethal force to free captain Richard Phillips , who had spent five days as the prisoner of the heavily armed mercenaries .
See how the SEALS pulled off the miracle shots here
Embedded video from CNN Video
Vice - Admiral Gortney said the order to shoot came after the pirates were spotted ' with their heads and shoulders exposed ' in the lifeboat where they were holding Captain Phillips .
One of the Somalis had his AK - 47 machine gun trained on the captain 's back .
But when all three pirates ' heads popped out of the top of the covered lifeboat , the snipers fired simultaneously .
Captain Phillips , 53 , who had his hands tied and was standing up at the time of the shooting , was unharmed .

Captain Richard Phillips was being held hostage on the boat at the time .
He was released yesterday after U.S. snipers killed three of his pirate captors
Fellow pirates vowed retaliation over the deaths yesterday , raising fears for the safety of around 230 foreign sailors still being held hostage on more than a dozen captured ships anchored in the Indian Ocean off lawless Somalia .
' From now on , if we capture foreign ships and their respective countries try to attack us , we will kill the hostages , ' said Jamac Habeb , a Somali pirate leader , last night .
' The U.S. have become our number one enemy . '
But in a sharp warning to the increasingly brazen pirates , Mr Obama said : ' I want to be very clear that we are resolved to halt the rise of piracy in that region .
' We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise and we have to ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes . '
On the freeing of Captain Phillips , he added : ' I 'm very proud of the efforts of the U.S. military and many other departments and agencies that worked tirelessly to resolve this situation . '
Pentagon officials confirmed that they are now considering attacks on pirate bases in Somalia .
The U.S. could also send food and aid to help people in the country , which has been torn apart by civil war .
It sounds like fun and games  the boozy , all - woman answer to those close - knit gangs of Hollywood boy - men captured on screen in “ Entourage ” and embodied by the real - life Apatown , the industry moniker for filmmaker Judd Apatow ’s coterie of actors and screenwriters including Paul Rudd , Jason Segel and Seth Rogen .
But these women also work hard : Ms. Cody , Ms. Fox and Ms. Scafaria can command seven figures to write a movie that makes it into theaters with big stars .
Ms. Meriwether ( the others call her “ the freshman ” ) is on her way to joining them .
That ’s no small achievement when you consider that among the screenwriters who are in steady demand for major projects , only about 20 are women .
Do n’t even try to credit their bankability to their looks .

“ When you read a screenplay , it does n’t come with a picture on the cover , ” said Adam Siegel , president of Marc Platt Productions , a producer who is friends with all four women and has worked with all except Ms. Cody .
“ I know a few beautiful women , but none of them write like Dana , Liz , Lorene or Diablo . ”
But not everyone loves these four women , and plenty are happy to say so ( many of them anonymously ) .
So among them there is also a battle - scarred camaraderie .
“ Whenever you have a project out in wide release , there are haters , ” Ms. Cody said .
“ Blogs , imdb , Rotten Tomatoes , reviews .
It ’s a lot to deal with .
When most people get Googled , they get maybe a Facebook page .
When we get Googled , there ’s criticism , bad reviews , commentary on the way we look .
You need people who have been through it . ”
The Fempire ’s solid front  all four wear the same gold necklaces with tiny heart pendants inscribed with words that ca n’t be printed here , gifts from Ms. Cody  seems to make some men nervous and envious at the same time .
“ I adore them and I ’m terrified of them , ” said Jason Reitman , who directed “ Juno . ”
“ There ’s so much talent packed in the group .
Writing is such a solitary activity .
The idea that they have each other is quite lovely .
When I think of the four of them together , writing , of course I ’m jealous . ”
“ We have seen the triumph of sensible ideas and have reaped the rewards in terms of macroeconomic performance , ” Romer concluded .
“ The costly wrong turn in ideas and macropolicy of the 1960s and 1970s has been righted and the future of stabilization looks bright . ”
She was , as we now know , wrong about the happy ending .
In retrospect , what is striking about Romer ’s lecture is not the chastened tone of its opening but the celebratory nature of its conclusions .
“ Better policy , particularly on the part of the Federal Reserve , is directly responsible for the low inflation and the virtual disappearance of the business cycle in the last 25 years , ” she said ( emphasis added ) .
“ In this area , the policy mistakes of the 1960s were a painful , but not permanent , detour on the road to excellent economic performance . ”
I do n’t mean to pick on Romer , who is a fine and careful scholar .
Until recently , this triumphalist view was the conventional wisdom .
And it is n’t 100 percent wrong .
Fed policy really did break inflation and keep it low .
The relative stability from the mid-’80s to last year really was much better than the economic chaos of the 1970s .
But containing inflation and eliminating , or noticeably dampening , economic downturns are two entirely different things .
Congratulating policy makers for “ the virtual disappearance of the business cycle ” oversteps the evidence and encourages the hubris that fostered the current crisis and could make recovery more difficult .
The conventional explanation for the Great Moderation gives too much credit to easily identifiable economic policy makers —
“ I feel the contribution of good policy cannot be overstated , ” said Romer — and too little to all those anonymous managers and workers whose everyday actions get summarized in the aggregate statistics that Fed economists watch so closely .
Research published in journals like the American Economic Review , dating back to a 2000 article by Margaret McConnell of the New York Fed and Gabriel Perez - Quiros of the European Central Bank , tells a different story .
This line of research says that good Fed policy was necessary but not sufficient , that the business cycle never disappeared , and that most of the Great Moderation emerged not from deliberate government policy but from changes in business practices that occurred for competitive reasons having nothing to do with macroeconomic goals .
In the Summer 2008 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives , economists Steven J. Davis and James A. Kahn review this research and further dissect the evidence from both aggregate statistics and individual measurements of things like the lead times for ordering production materials and fluctuations in household spending .
What they find fits the broad outlines of Romer ’s story — but not its congratulatory conclusion .
The Great Moderation looks a lot like the staid 1950s , with better inventory management and more - flexible employment contracts .
Khaled Hosseini has joined the illustrious ranks of Philip Pullman and the authors of a story about gay penguins , after his novel The Kite Runner became one of the books that inspired most complaints in America last year .
The bestselling and critically acclaimed title , the story of a 12 - year - old Afghan and his betrayal of his best friend , includes the rape of a boy , and provoked challenges in the US over what objectors saw as sexual content and offensive language .
Some objections led to the removal of the book from library shelves , while others saw it replaced with bowdlerised versions minus the offending scenes , according to the American Library Association , which compiles an annual list of the most challenged titles in the country .
Topping this list in 2008 was , for the third year running , Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell 's And Tango Makes
Three , a children 's book about two male penguins who bring up an orphaned chick .
Based on a newspaper story the authors saw about a zookeeper who noticed two of his penguins trying to hatch a stone , the book was criticised for being pro-gay , anti-religion and anti-family .
" Books that address same - sex parenting , or same - sex relationships , are particularly prone to challenges in the US , " said Deborah Caldwell - Stone , deputy director of the ALA 's office for intellectual freedom , which has collected information on challenged books for the last 20 years .
" In the case of And Tango Makes Three , there are many parents who believe it inappropriate to teach children anything at all about homosexual relationships , even in the form of a picture book about a true story . "
Another stalwart of the ALA 's list , Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy , rose to second place overall in 2008 from fourth the previous year , distressing challengers over its political viewpoint , religious viewpoint and violent scenes .
Last year Pullman said his immediate reaction on hearing the news was " glee " .
" They never learn , " he said .
" The inevitable result of trying to ban something – book , film , play , pop song , whatever – is that far more people want to get hold of it than would ever have done if it were left alone .
Why do n't the censors realise this ? "
Caldwell - Stone said the film of The Golden Compass , based on the first novel in Pullman 's trilogy , had renewed attacks on the sequence from Catholic pressure groups .
" In many cases school boards reacted precipitously and removed it – then a few weeks later they returned it to the shelves , " she said .
This year , challengers appeared to be focusing their efforts on more recent releases , with Mark Twain 's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( which had drawn criticism for racism ) , Alice Walker 's The Color Purple ( challenged for sexual content , homosexual content and offensive language ) and Maya Angelou 's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( sexual content ) all dropping out of the top 10 after riding high last year .
The ALA recorded 513 challenges in 2008 , up from 420 in 2007 .
The ALA defines a challenge as " a formal , written complaint , filed with a library or school , requesting that materials be removed or restricted because of content or appropriateness " .
It estimates that as few as one in five challenges are actually reported .
" We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg , " said Caldwell - Stone .
Seventy - four books were actually removed from shelves following challenges last year , the ALA said , ranging from Jodi Picoult 's bestselling novel My Sister 's Keeper , pulled for its sexually explicit content , to Sherman Alexie 's The Absolutely True Diary of a Part - Time Indian , which includes references to masturbation .
Alexie 's comments at the time echoed Pullman's , with the author telling local press that " the amazing thing is these banners never understand they are turning this book into a sacred treasure .
We do n't write to try and be banned , but it is widely known in the [ young adult ] world , we love this shit . "
" While not every book is right for each reader , every reader has the right to choose reading materials for themselves and their families and should be able to find those materials in libraries , classrooms , and bookstores .
Our goal is to protect one of our most precious fundamental rights - our freedom to read , " said Caldwell - Stone .
The ALA celebrates all banned and challenged books every year with Banned Books Week , founded by Judith Krug , a tireless anti-censorship campaigner who died last week after a long illness , aged 69 .
Often quoted as saying that " censorship dies in the light of day " , Krug was the director of the ALA 's office for intellectual freedom and executive director of its Freedom to Read Foundation for more than 40 years .
" Judith had an abiding faith in the power of ' the community of the book ' – she was convinced that when librarians , publishers , booksellers , and authors stand together in defence of intellectual freedom we are unstoppable .
She believed in our obligation to take on that fight wherever and whenever it arose , and more often than not she led the charge , " said Judith Platt , president of the Freedom to Read Foundation .
" She considered librarianship to be the highest of callings and there is an entire generation of librarians out there whose commitment to intellectual freedom was forged and shaped by Judith Krug . "

ROCHESTER , Minn . --
A new study conducted at Mayo Clinic reports that one in six patients receiving therapeutic doses of certain drugs for Parkinson 's disease develops new - onset , potentially destructive behaviors , notably compulsive gambling or hypersexuality .
VIDEO ALERT : Additional audio and video resources including excerpts from an interview with Dr. J. Michael Bostwick describing the research , are available on the Mayo Clinic News Blog .
The study extends findings from two Mayo case series published in 2005 that reported a connection between dopamine agonist medications and compulsive gambling or hypersexuality .
Dopamine agonists are a class of drugs that include pramipexole and ropinirole .
They are commonly used to treat Parkinson 's disease , but low doses also are used for restless legs syndrome .
They uniquely stimulate brain limbic circuits , which are thought to be fundamental substrates for emotional , reward and hedonistic behaviors .
" The 2005 case series alerted us that something bad was happening to some unfortunate people .
This study was done to assess the likelihood that this effect would happen to the average Parkinson 's patient treated with these agents , " says J. Michael Bostwick , M.D. , Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who spearheaded the new study .
It is published in the April issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings .
The researchers analyzed the medical records of patients with Parkinson 's disease residing in counties surrounding Rochester , Minn. , who received their primary neurological care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2004 and 2006 .
This group included 267 patients .
Of those , 66 were taking dopamine agonists for their Parkinson 's disease .
Of those 66 , 38 were taking the drugs in therapeutic doses ( doses expected to be at least minimally beneficial ) .
The findings were definitive .
Seven patients experiencing new - onset compulsive gambling or hypersexuality were taking dopamine agonists in therapeutic doses .
None of the other Parkinson 's disease patients developed compulsive gambling habits or hypersexuality , including the 28 patients on subtherapeutic dopamine agonist doses or the other 201 patients not taking dopamine agonists .
None of the 178 patients treated only with the standard drug for Parkinson 's disease , carbidopa / levodopa , developed these behaviors .
" It is crucial for clinicians prescribing dopamine agonists to apprise patients as well as their spouses or partners about this potential side effect .
The onset can be insidious and overlooked until life - altering problems develop , " says J. Eric Ahlskog , M.D. , Ph.D. , Mayo Clinic neurologist who co-authored and treated many of the patients in the 2005 study .
" It also is worth noting that the affected patients were all taking therapeutic doses .
Very low doses , such as those used to treat restless legs syndrome , carry much less risk . "
" For some patients , a reduction in the dose of the dopamine agonist may prove to be sufficient treatment , " says Dr. Ahlskog , " although total elimination of the offending drug is often necessary . "

Common infections may trigger cancer cell growth Scientists have shown how common infections might trigger childhood leukaemia .
They have identified a molecule , TGF , produced by the body in response to infection that stimulates development of the disease .
It triggers multiplication of pre-cancerous stem cells at the expense of healthy counterparts .
The Institute of Cancer Research study appears in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
While infection is clearly only one factor in triggering progression , this study greatly increases the strength of evidence for its role in the commonest form of childhood leukaemia
Dr Shabih Syed
Leukaemia Research Leukaemia occurs when large numbers of white blood cells take over the bone marrow , leaving the body unable to produce enough normal blood cells .
The researchers had already identified a genetic mutation - a fusion of two genes - occurring in the womb that creates pre-leukaemic cells .
These cells then grow in the bone marrow , effectively acting as a silent time bomb that can stay in the body for up to 15 years .
Evidence suggests the mutation may be present in as many as one in 100 newborn babies , but only about one in 100 of these children then go on to develop leukaemia .
This suggests that the cells will only complete the transformation to fully - fledged cancer cells if they exposed to an independent trigger .
The latest study suggests production of TGF in response to an infection could be that trigger .
Because the molecule hugely increases the rate at which the pre-leukaemic cells multiply , this significantly raises the the chance that some will become even further damaged in a way that results in the child developing leukaemia .
Preventative measures Researcher Professor Mel Greaves said : " Identifying this step means we can determine how an unusual immune response to infection may trigger the development of the full leukaemia and eventually perhaps develop preventative measures such as a vaccine . "
Dr Shabih Syed , scientific director at the charity Leukaemia Research , said : " Before this study , there had been only circumstantial evidence to implicate infections in the progression from a child carrying pre-leukaemic cells to actually having leukaemia .
" There was no evidence of the mechanism by which this might happen .
" While infection is clearly only one factor in triggering progression , this study greatly increases the strength of evidence for its role in the commonest form of childhood leukaemia . "

IGN recently had the opportunity to speak with director Robert Rodriguez , who was promoting the long - awaited release of Sin City on Blu-ray .
We could n't help but ask Rodriguez if the resurgence of the 2005 film , based on Frank Miller 's graphic - novel series , is fueling the buzz for the proposed sequel .
There 's been talk of a follow - up film practically since the first one was released , but according to Rodriguez , it 's starting to look like it might actually happen .
Daily Fix Video May 7th,2009
This news and more in the Daily Fix . - 3D Realms No More
- Milking The Hero
- StarCraft 2 Beta
- Sin City 2
" People have been talking about Sin City 2 since the first one came out , " Rodriguez said .
" Whenever I 'm out and about , people say , ' When 's Sin City 2 coming ?
When 's Sin City 2 coming ?'
They 've been asking that for years .
So this probably will add to that , certainly .
" Rodriguez added that he had a few other commitments he had to complete before moving on to Sin City 2 , but he is beginning talks with his creative team and could begin filming as early as next year .
" I actually had a phone call with some of the players in it today , but I was on a plane so I missed it , " he said .
" So next week we 're going to talk about it some more and get a timing on when we'd be doing it .
But there 's a lot of people who are interested in it .
...
We are definitely going to do that one .
As for the story in the film , Rodriguez said that it will include the Sin City story " A Dame to Kill For " as well as new additional material written by Miller himself .
" There 's a lot of stories , " Rodriguez said .
" That was sort of the approach I took to it .
That 's why there 's three stories in the [ first ] movie , because I thought , ' I love this material , but gosh , what happens if it 's not successful and I do n't get to make a part two and part three .
I still want to see " The Big Fat Kill " and " That Yellow Bastard . " '
So I wanted to put them all in one movie so I could at least get some of these stories out of my system .
But there 's still so many books and so many stories to do . "

The Holographic Universe
Take one universe .
Turn it into a hologram .
Find its quantum wavefunction .
Understand the birth of the cosmos .
by Anil Ananthaswamy
ALEX MALONEY
McGill University
Even when I did n’t
have a name for it ,
I sort of had a good idea
of what I wanted to do .
- Alex Maloney on physics
quantum gravity , which can be applied in realms where both quantum mechanics and general relativity are important .
But , unfortunately , it does n’t offer any easy answers to mystery of dark energy ; string theory ’s intractable mathematics has made applying it to the problems of cosmology near impossible .
Hawking and Holograms
So now Maloney is turning to techniques that were forged to understand another arena where immense gravitational forces meet microscopic volumes and quantum gravity cannot be ignored : black holes .
And that ’s where holograms come in .
In the 1970s , Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein showed that the information stored in a black hole is proportional to its surface area rather than its volume .
This encoding of three - dimensional information on a two - dimensional surface came to be called the holographic principle .
In 1997 , Juan Maldacena of the IAS formalized the principle , showing that the string theory description of a black hole is mathematically equivalent to a quantum field theory without gravity that describes the surface of the black hole .
" PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL
SYSTEM . "
Alex Maloney assesses the universe .

The holographic principle came to the rescue ; physicists used it to show that the information of the constituents of the black hole is actually encoded in the radiation that emanates from its surface .
So no information is ever lost .
The next step , says Maloney , is to try and apply these sorts of ideas to " what ’s probably the most interesting quantum gravitational system " — the universe as a whole .
Holography right now
is the most powerful
tool to understand
precise formulations of
quantum gravity .
- Alex Maloney wavefunction — a mathematical object that can be used to work of the probability that the particle will have certain properties when it ’s observed .
So Maloney ’s quest involves hunting for nothing less than the quantum wavefunction of the entire universe .
The universe ’s wavefunction will help chart things like its volume or its rate of expansion in a quantum mechanical manner .
Instead of being sharply defined at every instant in time , these quantities will fluctuate because of the inherent uncertainties of any quantum mechanical system .
Arriving at the right theory of quantum gravity is imperative for such work .
" Holography right now is probably the most powerful tool to understand precise formulations of quantum gravity , " says Maloney .
But it wo n’t be easy .
The correspondence that Maldacena found works in very particular circumstances .
It deals with a simple form of spacetime , called anti de Sitter space , which is symmetric , finite , and mathematically pliant .
The early universe , by contrast , is modeled by something called de Sitter spacetime .
" You might think that because they only differ by one word , the description is rather similar , " says Maloney .
" But it turns out that describing de Sitter space using holography is much more subtle , and much trickier . "
Black - Hole Universe
One of the key differences is that the volume of de Sitter space changes with time .
That makes sense when you want to describe the early universe , which is thought to have increased nearly 1060 times in its infancy , during a period of exponential expansion , known as inflation .
" If space is being created , then you might think that information is being created , so there is a tension there ( with ) the idea that information can neither be created nor destroyed , " explains Maloney .
" This is one of the real puzzles of quantum cosmology .
It ’s very analogous to the black hole information problem . "
LAUNCHING THE QUEST FOR A THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY
The Ariane 5 launcher lifts - off from the European spaceport in Kourou

Credit : European Space Agency Robert Brandenberger , Jim Cline and Keshav Dasgupta at McGill plan to use their $ 117,120 FQXi grant to apply the holographic principle to de Sitter space .
It ’s going to be tough , but Maloney ’s peers think he ’s up to the job .
Strominger says that Maloney " has some very creative ideas , " adding that Maloney ’s " main strength is his ability to discover new angles for looking at problems . "
Treating the universe as a hologram might sound like just a nifty mathematical trick , with little relevance to reality .
But if holographic techniques can be applied to de Sitter space , they can also be used to make predictions about patterns etched in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , the relic radiation left over by the big bang .
Maloney ’s main strength
is his ability to
discover new angles .
- Andrew Strominger scale invariant .
That means that the power in the fluctuations of the CMB is the same regardless of the scale at which the sky is being studied .
But measurements made by NASA ’s WMAP satellite hint at a small deviation from scale invariance .
The European Space Agency ’s Planck satellite , launched on 14 May , will be trying to home in on those tantalizing hints offered by WMAP , and Maloney is eagerly awaiting the outcome .
" Understanding how it deviates is a question that might be relevant for a theory of quantum gravity , " says Maloney .
Maloney ’s combining all that he ’s learnt : mathematics and physics , general relativity and quantum mechanics .
" Applying quantum gravity to quantum cosmology is a very exciting thing to be doing nowadays , " he says .
Those childhood days spent reading Hawking ’s obscure musings to his grandfather are certainly paying off .

It 's called the Holographic Principle .
It 's when what appears to be n+1 dimensions is represented in n dimensions much as a holographic film can represent a 3d volume .
The concept was brought up with string theory in resolving the information loss paradox of a black hole .
It brings certain limitations as to information density and so far , everything including black holes has observed these limits .

By 1988 , when Alex Maloney was just twelve years old , holograms were well and truly " in . "
Scientists had only recently worked out how to capture these three - dimensional photographs and emboss them onto two - dimensional metallic film and soon — to every kid ’s delight — they were appearing on credit cards , magazine and book covers , and bank notes .
Maloney had little idea then that more than two decades on he would be ambitiously attempting to cast the entire universe as a hologram , in an effort to explain the mysteries of the cosmos in its infancy .
But even at that young age he did know that he wanted to be a physicist .
"
Even when I did n’t have a name for it , I sort of had a good idea of what I wanted to do , " says Maloney , now at McGill University , Montreal .
He credits his grandfather Dewitt Stetten , a prominent biochemist who would rather have been a mathematician or a physicist , for this insight .
In his later years , Stetten went blind and it fell upon young Maloney to read to him .
But this was no ordinary reading list .
Maloney had to read aloud books likeand a four - volume set on the history of mathematics , straining his young mind to the explain the illustrations in the books .
And then came Stephen Hawking ’s .
Which prompts the question : did the twelve - year old Maloney understand the book ?
" You know , I do n’t think anyone understood , " says Maloney .
Still , this unusual introduction to physics and mathematics steered Maloney towards its confluence : string theory as it applies to cosmology .
Maloney cut his teeth on string theory during his Ph.D. at Harvard under Andrew Strominger ; later he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Studies ( IAS ) in Princeton with Edward Witten .
But it was the discovery of dark energy in 1998 that kindled his interest in cosmology .
Astronomers had found that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , and they put it down to an inherent energy density of the vacuum of space .
But no theory in physics can explain why dark energy has the value it does .
" I remember very clearly how excited everybody was by this set of discoveries , " says Maloney .
" Even though it did n’t have a direct influence on the thinking in string theory , it had an indirect influence .
" String theory has been formulated as a candidate theory of

The outbreak of a new flu strain — a nasty mash - up of swine , avian , and human viruses — has infected 1,000 people in Mexico and the U.S. , killing 68 .
The World Health Organization warned Saturday that the outbreak could reach global pandemic levels .
Is Smithfield Foods , the world ’s largest pork packer and hog producer , linked to the outbreak ?
Smithfield operates massive hog- raising operations Perote , Mexico , in the state of Vera Cruz , where the outbreak originated .
The operations , grouped under a Smithfield subsidiary called Granjas Carroll , raise 950,000 hogs per year , according to the company Web site .
On Friday , the U.S. disease - tracking blog Biosurveillance published a timeline of the outbreak containing this nugget , dated April 6 ( major tip of the hat to Paula Hay , who alerted me to the Smithfield link on the Comfood listserv and has written about it on her blog , Peak Oil Entrepreneur ) :
Residents [ of Perote ] believed the outbreak had been caused by contamination from pig breeding farms located in the area .
They believed that the farms , operated by Granjas Carroll , polluted the atmosphere and local water bodies , which in turn led to the disease outbreak .
According to residents , the company denied responsibility for the outbreak and attributed the cases to “ flu . ”
However , a municipal health official stated that preliminary investigations indicated that the disease vector was a type of fly that reproduces in pig waste and that the outbreak was linked to the pig farms .
It was unclear whether health officials had identified a suspected pathogen responsible for this outbreak .
From what I can tell , the possible link to Smithfield has not been reported in the U.S. press .
Searches of Google News and the websites of the New York Times , Washington Post , and Wall Street Journal all came up empty .
The link is being made in the Mexican media , however .
“ Granjas Carroll , causa de epidemia en La Gloria , ” declared a headline in the Vera Cruz - based paper La Marcha .
No need to translate that , except to point out that La Gloria is the village where the outbreak seems to have started .
Judging from the article , Mexican authorities treat hog CAFOs with just as much if not more indulgence than their peers north of the border , to the detriment of surrounding communities and the general public health .
Get this :
De acuerdo con uno de los habitantes de la comunidad , Eli Ferrer Cortés , los desechos fecales y orgánicos que produce Granjas Carroll no son tratados adecuadamente , lo que genera contaminación del agua y del viento en la region .
My rough translation : According to one community resident , the organic and fecal waste produced by Granjas Carrol is n’t adequately treated , creating water and air pollution in the region .
I witnessed — and smelled — the same thing in Hardin County , Iowa , a couple of years ago , another area marked by intensive industrial hog production .
The article goes on to say that area residents have long complained of “ fetid odors ” in the air and water , and swarms of flies hovering around waste lagoons .
Like their counterparts who live in CAFO - heavy U.S. areas , they also complain of respiratory ailments .
Now , with 30 percent of the area ’s residents now infected with the virulent flu bug , people are demanding that state and federal authorities inspect hog operations there .
So far , reports La Marcha , the response has been : nada .
The Mexico City daily La Jornada has also made the link .
According to the newspaper , the Mexican health agency IMSS has acknowledged that the orginal carrier for the flu could be the “ clouds of flies ” that multiply in the Smithfield subsidiary ’s manure lagoons .
I ’ll be in touch with contacts in Mexico as this story develops — and I ’ll be curious to see whether the U.S. media explores the link with Smithfield ’s Mexico operation .
Note :
In the original version of this post , I had called production at Granjas Carroll “ nearly equal to Smithfield ’s total U.S. production . ”
I had been confusing total production at Granjas Carroll — 950,000 hogs produced in fiscal 2008 — with the number of sows , or breeding pigs , kept by Smithfield in the United States .
According to my source — “ Concentration of Ag Markets , 2007 ” ( PDF ) by Hendrickson and Heffernan — Smithfield keeps 1.2 million sows .
Actual hog production is much larger — thus Smithfield ’s total U.S. hog production is much larger than Granjas Carroll’s .
I regret the error .

Barack Obama branded the original military trials an enormous failure President Barack Obama has announced he is to revive military trials for some detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
However , in a statement he said legal rights for those facing the military commissions would be improved .
Mr Obama had halted the trials as one of his first acts on taking office in January , saying the US was entering a new era of respecting human rights .
The decision to revive the military trials has brought harsh criticism from some US civil liberties groups .
There are currently 240 detainees still at the US base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
On the campaign trail last year , Mr Obama had branded the military commissions " an enormous failure " .
However , analysts say that although Mr Obama has condemned the Military Commissions Act , set up by his predecessor George W Bush , he has never ruled out revamping it .
Commissions ' appropriate '
In the statement issued on Friday , the US president said military commissions were appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war , provided that they are properly structured and administered .
But he said he had opposed the tribunals used by the Bush administration because they had failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined swift and certain justice .
The improved rights for detainees include restrictions on hearsay evidence ; a ban on evidence obtained by cruel treatment ; giving detainees more leeway to choose their own lawyers ; and protecting detainees who refuse to testify , the statement said .
Mr Obama said he is seeking more time so that the new procedures can be implemented .
Text : Obama statement Q&A : Closing Guantanamo ' Struggle ' over Guantanamo
Send us your comments " These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " Mr Obama said .
" This is the best way to protect our country , while upholding our deeply held values . "
Earlier , as White House aides released details of Mr Obama 's impending statement , rights groups reacted with dismay .
Zachary Katznelson of Reprieve , which represents a number of Guantanamo Bay detainees , told the BBC that the president was making a " fundamental mistake " .
" He is taking a gravely , truly flawed system , tinkering at the edges and hoping that the world is somehow going to see this as legitimate , as open , as fair - it's not going to happen , " he said .
" There is no way that these trials should be rehabilitated .

It 's tried , it 's tested , it works . "
The BBC's James Coomerasamy , in Washington , says that although some are disappointed , for others it is further evidence of Mr Obama 's pragmatic style of leadership , one that recognises the need to balance the change he has promised with the reality he has inherited .
Detainee released Shortly before Mr Obama 's announcement , US officials said that Algerian detainee Lakhdar Boumediene had left Guantanamo Bay for France .
Mr Boumediene was arrested in Bosnia in 2001 and was held for seven years .
He was cleared of any wrongdoing in November .

Surprisingly , Microsoft has decided that it will not be mandatory for OEMs to implement Service Pack 2 for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 .
In their most recent update ( Jan. 19 , 2009 ) , they announced that the standalone and integrated builds for both Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are optional .
What does that mean for OEMs and us , the customers ?
Basically , it means that OEMs will not be compelled to ship their systems with the new builds , which would have required extensive work ( tests , implementation , logistics ) .
They are also not required to send their customers the Service Pack 2 upgrades .
Microsoft 's decision to make this update optional is likely due to the impending release of Windows 7 .
Many OEMs are probably hesitant about spending more money and effort into qualifying the new builds with their products , especially in light of the current economic situation .
So , the onus will be on the consumer to update their Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 installations via Windows Update .
6 Steps to Eliminate Limiting Beliefs

I consider myself a frugal person and I ’ve always thought that it was a good thing .
However , I recently discovered that , while frugality is a worthy and useful quality , the root of my own frugality is based on some limiting beliefs that I ’ve held .
It all started with the story of a little dell laptop , and the story went something like this …
The computer I use every day is a five - year - old Dell laptop .
It was originally my work laptop from Amazon.com , until the hardware lease expired , and I was allowed to purchase it for $ 68 .
This little machine has served me well , but due to its nature ( ahem – it runs on Windows ) – its gradual decline in reliability and performance was noticeable ( even after re-installing Windows and doubling the RAM ) .
I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated by the need to reboot my computer at in - opportune moments , and the random crashes and slowness of Photoshop – which I frequently use .
Last week , Jeremy watched as I was hunched over my little laptop , frustrated once again by the slowness of its functions , hinting of the need to reboot .
I cursed out loud , not wanting to reboot because I had too many browser tabs open ; so I persisted , insisting that I could tough it out .
He turned to me , and with a concerned expression , said , “ Honey , let ’s get you a new Macbook and an external display .
I think you ’re really gonna love it and you ’ll be so much happier and productive . ”
I have resisted converting to Apple for about ten years .
My excuse was always that I could n’t stand the keyboard differences .
While this was somewhat true , it was also an excuse to stay within my comfort zone and to resist change .
That evening , however , I reached a tipping point in my dissatisfaction with PCs , and decided to give Mac a try ( while trying to ignore the resistance in my stomach ) .
So , Jeremy and his friend Dave took me to the Apple Store .
Once inside , I immediately felt like a kid in a candy store , drooling over the sleekness of the machines and the beautifully minimalistic store design .
We walked into the store with the idea of buying the cheapest laptop + display combo , but when I saw that the current generation of 23 ″ monitors have a glossy reflective display , I knew that it would distract me more than be a tool of inspiration and productivity .
Then we spotted it , the 30 ″ Cinema HD Display , which has a non-reflective matte screen and the higher price tag to go with it .
The three of us gathered in front of the model display “ oooowing and ahhhhing ” at the enormous mass of aluminum beauty .
After playing with it for about ten minutes , pulling up Think Simple Now in the browser , and testing out Photoshop with great satisfaction , Jeremy proclaimed , “ Babe , let ’s get you this . ”
Dave smiled widely .
And then , it happened , I heard a peculiar voice inside my head say , “ You do n’t deserve it “ .
I observed as the feeling glistened over me .
While I was excited for and had always lusted over the Apple Cinema Display , I felt the guilt hover over me and turn the hope into shame , for even wanting it .
I felt sad and pathetic that I had picked this belief up somewhere along the way , and have been unconsciously carrying it with me , for god knows how long .
Memories of my childhood began flashing in front of my eyes …
My Childhood : The Story of a Silent Limiting Belief
Growing up in communist China , my family was poor , and lived on a modest salary of 150 RMB ( $ 18.75 USD ) that my mother brought in every month .
As a little girl , when I needed something , I always picked out the cheapest one instead of the prettiest one .
Even today , my mother still tells the story – with tears in her eyes – of my five year old self , selecting the olive corduroy shoes instead of the red cotton ones , because they were 3 RMB ( $ 0.37 USD ) cheaper .
And I still remember being made fun of by the other kids for what I wore to school .
The idea of not putting a financial burden on my mother became deeply ingrained in me and lasts to this day .
After moving to Canada , my family lived in the one room basement of someone else ’s house .
I never asked for what I wanted , out of fear that I was burdening my parents .
As I got older and became a teenager , fitting - in with my peers consumed much of my attention .
I got into teen modeling , started making my own money and rejoiced that I no longer had to rely on my mom .
I would go shopping and buy all the things I thought I missed out on ; things that teenage girls wanted in order to secure their identity : makeup , clothes , and teenybopper magazines .
Often , I would come home , and be scolded for having “ wasted money ” at the mall .
Somewhere in there , my five and thirteen year old self came to the unconscious conclusion and false belief that I did n’t deserve nice things .
Afterwards
I shared this belief and emotional discovery with Jeremy , and he stared into my eyes with great empathy and conviction and said , “ If anyone deserves it , it ’s you ! ”
He continued with tears in his eyes , “ Think of how many hours a day you sit in front of a computer , and think of the number people you can help if you are happier with your work station . ”
My heart melted , and a feeling of relief washed over me .
He was right , but I still needed some time to let that sink in and start to believe it myself .
Recently , in an email exchange with a friend , she shared with me her recent discovery that she has always viewed herself as the “ wacky sidekick ” , and continued with , “ I want to be the main character now .
I no longer want to whine and complain about life .
I no longer want to react to life , I want to be a partner with the Universe in creating the life that I want and am destined to live . ”
Wow !
It became clear that I was n’t alone ; although our beliefs were different , they boiled down to the same issue .
We all have conscious and unconscious beliefs about ourselves that either drive us forward or act like an unseen weight tied to our ankle .
These beliefs either unleash our spirit or hold us back from our potential to BE and to live the best life possible , which is what we all deserve .
What are some beliefs holding you back ?
Action : What to Do to Overcome Limiting Beliefs
Note :
If you are looking for results , do n’t just read the following steps , actually do the tasks each step asks .
It ’s best to be somewhere you wo n’t be disturbed , grab a pen and paper , and let ’s start !
Photo : Simón Pais - Thomas
1. What Are Your Beliefs ?
Beliefs are mental notions and assumptions we have , about ourselves and the world around us , that we hold onto as absolute truths .
They are emotional and psychological and often irrational .
They are formed through our experiences and interactions with the world .
Dr. Rao says that these beliefs make up our mental model .
Others simply call them unconscious beliefs .
They often do not serve us but rather hold us back from pursuing our dreams and living freely and fully to our potential .
Many of these beliefs were formed and accumulated throughout our childhood .
We picked them up through our interactions with others – like when we were scolded for doing something wrong or not doing something the way our parents expected us to .
A common resulting belief is I ’m not good enough , which then bleeds into other beliefs that affect us during adulthood , like , I ’m not capable enough or I ’m not talented or I ’m stupid .
Relationship based beliefs are also very common , because the events associated with them are often emotionally heightened and leave lasting impressions on our subconscious mind .
If we got hurt early on in our dating career , we might end up concluding that we do not deserve a loving relationship , or associate that love is a cause for suffering .
On a piece of paper , write some beliefs you have about yourself and the world around you that you ’ve come to accept as reality .
Especially ones that you know are over generalized , and are no longer serving you on your path to personal wellbeing .
Some of these statements may seem like you do n’t actually consciously believe them , but if you noticed an emotional reaction in your body , then you actually do carry that belief with you .
Here are some common beliefs :
I ’m not important
Making money is a struggle
I ’m not good enough
I ’m not smart enough
I do n’t deserve it
I am too young , people wo n’t take me seriously
I am too old , it ’s too late to start …
I am a hard worker .
I work hard for money .
I ’m pretty much doomed , I do n’t have good luck , problems always follow me .
In other examples , here are some of my beliefs from the past ( I no longer have them , however , I did carry them for many years until I realized that they were hurting me and limiting my potential to be happy ) :
Good looking men are unfaithful or unkind .
I am a bad writer .
I do not deserve a loving relationship .
I have to work hard to be successful , working without rest or having a social life .
I am not pretty enough .
I do not deserve or am not able to find someone I am attracted to .
I am not a good engineer .
They ’re going to find out really soon that this is true .
I could go on for hours with a list of beliefs I have had about myself .
It is something I now consciously watch for and have chosen to change about myself .
I can speak from personal experience that unlearning these beliefs has served me well and I was surprised to find the abundance of goodness that was around me all along .
By brainstorming and writing these out for yourself , you become aware of them , and can choose to work on overcoming them .
2. Find a Counter Instance
Pick one of the beliefs from step 1 to work on and continue on with the remaining steps .
For your belief , look for one specific example where the statement is not actually true , where you did something or experienced something – even through someone else – that was not in alignment with your belief .
For example ,
For the belief I am a bad writer : this proved untrue when I wrote ( fill in the blank ) article two years ago .
For the belief Good looking men are unfaithful or unkind : this has proven to be untrue in the case of x person ’s husband .
This step introduces the possibility that there are flaws in this belief .
As you go about your day , specifically look for examples that counteract this belief statement .
For example , if your belief is “ nobody likes me ” , spend your day looking for “ people who like me for who I am ” .
If you are not finding an example after trying for ten minutes ( please try ! ) , move on to the next step .
3. How Has This Belief Worked Against You ?
Think of all the instances where this belief worked against you , either kept you away from taking action towards something you wanted , or negatively affected you emotionally and thus affected other areas of your life – relationships , health , etc .
How has this belief hurt me in the past ?
Write it down .
Change happens when we take action , and pain can be an effective motivator to catapult and accelerate our desire for change .
When we ’ve experienced enough pain , we will want change and will take action to make it happen .
Now , close your eyes and experience the pain you felt as a result of this belief .
Visualize , hear , and feel the emotions of that moment .
Make it as real as possible .
4. Find the Source
Dig deep into memories from your past – childhood , teenage years , early twenties or even last year – what instance or instances brought you to this conclusion ?
Be specific and write them down using as many words as needed to describe them .
Tip : it helps to close your eyes , and repeat the belief statement out loud .
This triggers emotions that will assist in locating the events that contributed to its formation .
For example ,
For the belief , I am a bad writer , I recalled an instance when a high school English teacher told me that my paper was poorly done .
For the belief , Good looking men are unfaithful or unkind , I realized that several ex boyfriends who were either unfaithful or unreliable or unkind were good looking men .
For the belief I am not good enough , I realized that I had formed this belief during my childhood years , when my mother would seem frustrated with me when I did n’t do certain things exactly the way she expected .
Close your eyes and visualize this scene .
Re-live the scene and remember how it made you feel .
5. Alternative Meaning
The external event you identified in step 4 was n’t necessarily responsible , on it ’s own , for the formation of your belief statement .
For example , just because my high school English teacher expressed dissatisfaction with one paper from a class 15 years ago , did n’t mean that I had to invent the belief that , “ I am a bad writer ” .
I believed this , because that was how I had interpreted the situation .
I attached that meaning to the scenario .
I had chosen that perspective out of the many possible perspectives that could have explained the situation .
But at the time , I chose one , and attached myself to it .
Nothing has any meaning , unless we give it a meaning .
The only power we can give to any external event or scenario , is the power we allow it to have on us .
Now , brainstorm for other perspectives that could also explain the external event you identified .
It may be helpful to pretend you are other people , viewing the situation from multiple angles .
In my example above , where I had concluded that , “ I am a bad writer ” , here are some alternative perspectives that may equally explain the situation :
The teacher was having a bad day .
The teacher had a different writing style than me .
I was really nervous while writing the exam , contributing to the poor performance .
Maybe it was n’t my best performance , but it was an isolated occurrence .
Close your eyes and visualize the scene from step 4 , except , view it from these new alternative perspectives .
See that you are free to choose the meaning you give to the external event .
Now repeat your original belief statement verbally and examine how you feel .
Do you now feel that your emotional reaction to the statement is reduced or non-existent ?
6. Eliminate Beliefs

Step A :
( Guide Visualization : listen above or download mp3 file )
Close your eyes and once again visualize the scene you found in step 4 ( a situation that contributed towards you forming this belief ) .
Now imagine that this image in your mind has gone dim , as if someone turned off a light or two in the scene .
Now visualize that the image is moving away from you , as if contained in a box that is being pulled away from you .
As the image moves away , see that it also becomes blurry .
Continue to imagine the image shrinking until it disappears and all you are left with is darkness .
Now , take a nice deep and long inhale , causing an audible exhale , making an – ahhhhhhh sound .
Step B :
Open your eyes .
Now write down a statement that has the opposite meaning from your belief statement .
For example , I am a great writer , I am deserving of good things , there are many good - looking men who are faithful and kind , I am a good person , etc .
Step C :
( Guided Visualization : listen above or download mp3 file )
Close your eyes , and see yourself living with this statement you just constructed .
Imagine yourself as a great writer , typing away at your desk .
See yourself walking around on a beautiful day knowing that you are a good and deserving person .
Look around at the details of this scene .
What do you see around you ?
What do you hear ?
Touch something in your environment .
How do you feel ?
Feel the emotions of that moment .
Feel the joy bursting from your being .
You are smiling .
Now make this image slightly brighter , as if someone had shined extra light onto the scene .
Continue to imagine this scene until you are satisfied .
How do you feel now ?
Try repeating your original statement .
Does it still bother you in the same way ?
Repeat the process if you still feel an emotional reaction towards it .
Parting Words
One of the most profound things I ’ve heard recently is from Morty Lefkoe , in his interactive ( and free ) video program on getting rid of I ’m not good enough .
In it , he uses a beautiful analogy ; for every experience that we go through that results in a belief , we are adding new clay or defining details to make a clay person , and then we attach ourselves to this clay person , assuming that it is us .
We forget that we were the hands that created the clay person .
Indeed , we are not our beliefs .
We are not the clay person we have created .
Remember that behind every belief , there was a source that did the interpreting , created the meanings and attached those meanings to the external event .
This source is part of us – it is our consciousness .
When our conscious experience is mixed with our ego , we get confused and start attaching ourselves to these otherwise meaningless events .
Remember , if we can create the clay person , then we have the power and capability to modify it .
If we want to , we can change our beliefs and thoughts and actions and therefore , change the results .
Thus , in a way , we are in control of our destiny .
Thank you for reading .
I hope you can apply this in your life , and see positive results .
Do come back and share your experiences with us .

THE FATHER OF A BOY NAMED SUE ( Written by Shel Silverstein ) Intro by Shel Silverstein OK , now , years ago , I wrote a song called " A Boy Named Sue " , And , that was OK and everything except , then I started to think about it , and I thought , It is unfair .
I am , I am looking at the whole thing from the poor kid 's point of view .
And as I get more older and more fatherly , I begin to look at things from old men's point of view .
So , I decided to give the old man equal time .
OK , here we go ...
Yeah , I left home when the kid was three
And it sure felt good to be fancy free
Though I knew it was n't quite the the fatherly thing to do But that kid kept screaming and throwing up
And pissing in his pants till I had enough So just for revenge I went and named him Sue Yeah !
It was Gatlinburg in mid July I was gettin drunk but gettin by Gettin old and going from bad to worse
When through the door with an awful scream Comes the ugliest queen I 've ever seen
He says , " My name is Sue , how do you do ? "
Then he hits me with his purse
Now this ain't the way he tells the tell
But he scratched my face with his fingernails And Then he bit my thumb
And kicked me with his high heel shoe
So I hit him in the nose and he started to cry
And he threw some perfume in my eye
And it sure ain't easy fightin an old boy named Sue So I hit him in the head with a cane back chair
And he screamed , " Hey dad , you mussed my hair ! "
And he hit me in the navel and knocked out a piece of my lint
He was spittin blood , I was spittin teeth
And we crashed through the wall and out into the street Kickin and gouging in the mud and the blood and the creme de menthe
Then out of his garter he pulls a gun I 'm about to get shot by my very own son
He 's screaming about Sigmund Freud and looking grim - woo
So I though fast and I told him some stuff
How I named him Sue just to make him tough And I guess he bought it cause now I 'm living with him Yea he cooks and sews and cleans up the place
He cuts my hair and shaves my face
And irons my shirts better than a daughter could do And on the nights that I can't score
Well , I can't tell you any more
But it sure is a joy to have a boy named Sue Yeah a son is fun but it 's a joy to have a boy named Sue !

The IMF and Romania : A Road Well Travelled John Horvath
Romania looks set to follow in the footsteps of Hungary and others down the path of IMF structural adjustment
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) announced at the end of March that it would grant a loan of close to $ 17.4 billion to Romania .
The country is to receive another $ 9.4 billion from other lenders such as the European Union , the World Bank , and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) .
The money is expected to come in over the next two years .
Romanian authorities have negotiated to repay it all by 2015 at an interest rate of 3.5 percent annually .
After Hungary , Belarus , the Ukraine , Latvia , and Serbia , Romania has become the sixth country in Central and Eastern Europe to borrow money from the IMF in order to tackle the effects of the global financial crisis .
Ironically , Bulgaria - considered just as vulnerable as Romania - has postponed signing such a deal .
Although poorer than Romania , Bulgaria has run a much smaller budget deficit and its currency is kept stable by a Currency Board which was established after a major financial collapse in 1997 .
As with other countries within the region which fell into the trap of asking for an IMF loan to help stem the effects of the global financial crisis , the Romanian government regards the money as nothing more than a preventive measure .
Coincidentally , these were the exact same words used by the Hungarian government last year .
Indeed , the Hungarian prime minister went so far as to say that they probably would n't even touch the money .
Needless to say a few weeks later the government began drawing on the cash and recent reports now claim that Hungary will have already used up all the money by the end of this year .
As in Hungary and elsewhere that IMF money and influence has made inroads , few in Romania seem to know how the money will be used and whether it will even have a positive effect .
One of the main criticisms against the IMF deal is the sparse information on the conditions Romania agreed to .
As elsewhere , the Romanian authorities are reluctant to publicize in detail the IMF conditions .
As one observer noted , " if we want to have national solidarity in the face of the crisis , we need transparency . "
IMF policies have left shattered economies
Yet transparency is the last thing that the IMF wants when dealing with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
This is because the IMF is renowned for having a constraining effect on the countries it deals with .
It 's so - called " structural adjustment programs " have been known to do more harm than good .
These programs consist of a set of policies aimed at keeping developing economies subservient to leading world economies such as the US , Germany , and Japan .
Hence , what is often recommended by the IMF are the slashing of government budgets , the sale of government assets to local elites and foreign corporations ( " privatization " ) , deregulation of the economy , promoting exports and trade at the expense of local needs , removing protections for local producers growing food or manufacturing for the local market , removing labour rights protections , and more .
It goes without saying that these policies have left shattered economies around the world and consigned untold millions to poverty .
Mass privatization has led to enormous concentrations of wealth and encouraged corruption while deregulation has contributed to local financial crises that are independent of , yet exacerbated by , the global credit crunch .
Forced government budget ceilings and inflation targets , meanwhile , have prevented countries from expanding desperately needed investments in healthcare and education thereby leading to decreased standards of living .
IMF is asking recipient countries in Central and Eastern Europe to adopt measures that will lead their economies to contract
Although the IMF has operated these structural adjustment programs under different names in the past , there is no doubt that what is now going on is the same form of exploitation .
This can be clearly seen in what the IMF is asking recipient countries in Central and Eastern Europe to do : adopt measures that will lead their economies to contract - which is exactly the opposite of the policies carried out by rich countries ( and supported by the IMF , for rich countries only ) .
Thus , in order to receive loans from the IMF countries like Romania will have to agree to austere conditions including sharp budget cuts , increased interest rates , regressive tax increases , currency devaluation and other measures which will make these poor countries of the EU even poorer .
Likewise , the IMF 's concept of " capital account liberalization " ( CAL ) will be duly enforced .
Stripping away its high - sounding , technical jargon , CAL is nothing more than corporate welfare in the form of insurance for banks and other large investors .
In many ways , the money given to Romania and other Central and Eastern European countries is merely a cover for bailing out western banks and financial corporations that attempted to make super - profits from an economic liberalization program which operated as nothing more than a fancy pyramid scheme .
In essence , money was poured into these countries in order to help stimulate growth which was driven solely by increased consumption .
Such a form of economic development was no doubt a risky venture , but one that carried with it colossal returns .
It goes without saying that this model has since collapsed ; in Romania , as elsewhere , the country 's capital - inflows - driven boom has come to an abrupt end and the real economy , in turn , has slowed down .
Having come off an investment and consumption bubble , Romania 's reliance on foreign capital has put the country in a very vulnerable position .
The threat of redundancy looms large in both the private and the state sectors .
The housing market has slowed down considerably , and many construction projects for apartment buildings and luxury residential complexes have been abandoned .
Romanian producers have also been hit hard because the country 's major trading partners are the rest of the EU , all of whom are also suffering from the effects of the global financial crisis .
As a result of this , non-performing loans have increased substantially and bank capital has begun to erode .
Consequently the banking sector , made up mostly of Western European banks , has become reluctant to give loans .
" To enable banks to lend again " , this is the main purpose for which IMF money is to be used according to official statements from Bucharest .
This follows a pattern already established in other countries within the region where similar loans were granted , such as in Hungary .
Accordingly , IMF money is first and foremost needed to help soften requirements on reserves to be deposited by banks for the credits granted ; this would then make banks more inclined to lend again .
In conjunction with this , IMF money would be used to help stabilize the national currency .
There is a fear that countries such as Romania may cause a chain reaction , negatively affecting trade within the EU between those countries that use the euro and those that do n't .
The weakness of the Hungarian forint recently has already demonstrated how the weakness of one currency within the region could drag down the rest along with it .
While such arguments for the need to secure IMF loans to help cushion the effects of the financial crisis may sound persuasive , there are yet other , more effective ways at invigorating an economy and stabilising a currency than in the way which the IMF recommends .
Among them is the use of capital controls , which could limit the ability of foreign investments to enter and flee a country easily .
As Robert Weissman , editor of the Multinational Monitor and director of Essential Action points out , " this is of central importance , because it is concern about a currency attack that is the rationale for why poor countries cannot undertake stimulative measures . "
He goes on to add : " Capital controls would be the obvious remedy .
But since the Fund rules them out a priori , countries are helpless , and denied the right to use the same Keynesian tools available to the rich countries . "
Whereas the IMF deals with Hungary and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe were done with little or no public consultation whatsoever , it appears that in Romania at least some effort was made to mitigate some of the negative effects of the loan .
In particular , the Romanian Social - Democrat Party ( PSD ) , a member of the governing coalition , demanded provisions to protect the population from any immediate social costs associated with the deal .
The PSD insisted there should be no cuts in salaries and no layoffs in the public sector as had been with similar IMF loans in other countries .
" The program contains explicit provisions to increase allocations for social programs , as well as protection under the reforms for the most vulnerable pensioners and public sector employees at the lower end of the wage scale , " stated an IMF press release when the deal was made .
For its part the government has started negotiating with the trade unions , pensioners , and students to prevent layoffs and cuts in incomes .
The government so far agreed to cut bonuses but not salaries , and to increase some scholarships by as much as 15 percent .
The global financial crisis has suddenly become a major business opportunity for the IMF
Still some are sceptical .
They point out that while one of the conditions of the loan and subsequent government deals with the public sector was not to decrease the incomes of state employees , at the same time neither will these same incomes be increased so as to meet IMF conditions for constrained budgetary expenditures .
Coupled with inflation which will no doubt increase as a result of the financial crisis and IMF recommendations , this wage freeze will in fact represent a net loss for workers .
Such an approach has already been adopted by Hungary where a wage freeze for the next few years means that state employees will continue to experience a substantial drop in real wages .
Thus , it 's highly unlikely that the IMF deal will give Romania the cushioning it needs against the global financial crisis .
Political leaders themselves also seem uncertain of the consequences of the IMF deal and it's questionable whether the government will be able to pursue a coherent anti-crisis strategy as a result .
This is one of the main failings of some other countries which have already received IMF funding , such as Hungary and Latvia .
Despite receiving loans early on , these governments have been unable to pursue a coherent anti-crisis strategy and are thus now in a worse position than when they had first acquired the loans .
As for the IMF it does n't seem to really matter whether a country will be able to properly manage the money it receives or not .
The global financial crisis has suddenly become a major business opportunity for the IMF and other international lenders .
Over the last few years many countries have risen up against the IMF to the extent that it has severely affected its business .
For instance , Latin American countries joined together to launch the Bank of the South in an effort to create a viable alternative to the structural adjustment dictates of the World Bank and the IMF .
Not only this , almost all middle - income countries paid back their loans to the IMF and refused to have anything to do with the institution , leaving only poor countries ( mostly from Africa ) under their control .
Since the IMF depended heavily on the interest payments from middle - income countries to support its budget , the loss of this revenue stream was acutely felt .
In fact , last year the IMF 's governing body went so far as to approve a proposal for cutting its staff by about 20 percent and selling some of its gold stock so as to create a trust fund that would fund administrative operations in the future .
Sadly , it appears that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have now filled the gap left by middle - income countries , breathing new life into the IMF and other international lending institutions which had been reeling from the financial crisis - a crisis which they had in many ways provoked .
Meanwhile , the ignominious role of the IMF as a multi- pronged corporate welfare machine for big business is once again being successfully smothered by the global media establishment .
In doing so , the true nature of the credit crunch is being concealed , making progressive solutions to the global financial crisis that much more difficult to introduce .

If the shoe fits : World 's shortest man meets world 's biggest shoe
The world 's shortest man He Ping Ping took Tokyo by storm while visiting the city on Friday to launch the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records .
Mr Ping Ping , who was born with a form of dwarfism and is 74.1 cm tall and 7kg in weight , easily slipped into the shoe of the world 's tallest man .
He has been officially named by the book as the world 's shortest man .
He lives in Inner Mongolia , China , and Tokyo is just one of many places around the world he has visited , including London and New York .
He Ping Ping holds a shoe of the world 's tallest person at The Guinness World Records Museum in Tokyo on Friday
Mr Ping Ping said : ' I 'm not particularly envious of someone who is tall .
If you 're tall it is hard to move and it's very inconvenient , ' according to reports .
' I can weave my way through tight spots if I 'm short .
It 's much better to be short , ' he added .
Mr Ping
Ping stands in front of a statue of the world 's tallest person at the exhibition
Surrounded by photographers at a press conference in Tokyo
He is friends with another title holder , Bao Xishun , who was once the world 's tallest man at 2.36 m .
Mr Xishun also lives in China 's Inner Mongolia .
The current title holder for world 's tallest man is Leonid Stadnyk , a 37 - year - old former veterinarian from the Ukraine .
At 2.57 m , he is taller than Mr Xishun by 0.22 cm .
[ I would like to plug Dartagnan 's piece : New York Times Capitulates to Limbaugh , Hannity now curently sharing the rec list with this humble piece .
More good perspective on a newspaper that has lost its way . ]
The New York Times has a feature today purporting to explore " What would happen if marijuana was decriminalized " .
The attitude of the author of the article regarding the " decriminalization " of marijuana can be summed up here :
( unlikely , let ’s be honest )
Oh yes .
This is America .
It is " unlikely " that we will ever correct the basic blunder that is " cannabis prohibition " .
Many people have wanted reform for 40 years , the issue has gained huge traction in recent months but we 'll just leave it like it is , costing us tens of billions of dollar a year accomplishing absolutely nothing but feeding criminal organizations and harassing otherwise harmless Americans .
Most people , outside of foaming - at - the - mouth ideologues like Republicans and DEA agents , know " pot " is NOT the evil scourge of society we are supposed to somehow believe .
Tobacco and alcohol wreak great havoc on peoples lives and families yet we barely hear a peep about them .
We do n't have to pass laws to get a letter from a doctor to fire up a cancer stick - or 10 or 20 per day , 7 days a week - nor do we need a note from mommy to drink a six - pack of beer a night .
It 's all legal .
Go for it .
There is no salient , logical , scientific , or otherwise defensible reason from cannabis to STILL be illegal and so demonized in an otherwise intelligent and developed nation .
None , other than a concerted effort of lies , demonizing propaganda and political inertia .
But all other things being equal , it is the absence of proper cannabis information in the mainstream media ( namely the TV ) that causes the American public discourse to be overwhelmingly dominated by bullshit arguments and information .
Today 's NYT goes just a bit beyond the normal coverage we have seen in the past 40 years , not they they are doing anything remarkable .
This is still a standard " Pro vs Con " argument with those being against the reform of cannabis law beautifully demonstrating the best in both willful ignorance and foam - at - the - mouth reefer madness idolatry .
But they do have 3 " Pros " balanced by 2 " Cons " , with the Cons getting the last froth - covered word .
It is a lengthy article , suitable for a good cup of coffee : I am only highlighting the backwards , numbskulled , mouth - breathing arguments and briefly at that .
This is n't rocket science .
I merely intend to point out a few ideas about marijuana that progressive Democrats SHOULD NOT HAVE IN THEIR NOGGINS nor should they be repeating them , even if they actually - for whatever amazing reason - they still cling to such fictions .
We have freedom to believe as we wish .
If you want to believe the earth is flat and 6000 years old - so be it .
But stay out of rational conversations with your nonsense because we do n't have time for flatly disproven hogwash .
And reefer madness IS flatly disproven hogwash .
This is why it sounds so ridiculous .
# 1 : Joel W. Hay is professor of Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy in the School of Pharmacy at the University of Southern California .
With all of our current problems , Americans do not need more marijuana .
Pot combines mind - altering and judgment - clouding qualities ( like alcohol ) with carcinogenic , respiratory , and second - hand smoke qualities ( like tobacco ) ; it is emphatically not a safe or benign substance .
Daily pot smokers have a 30 percent increased risk of accidents , and one study found that more emergency - department trauma admissions were associated with pot use than alcohol .
We do n’t need hundreds of billions of dollars in new medical - care costs , traffic and other accident costs , reduced worker productivity , and lower educational achievements in an increasingly competitive global marketplace .
This guys entire screed is Classic Reefer Madness propaganda .
His credentials are impeccable and he has done good things to help people .
But he does repeat standard marijuana propaganda topic in his 3 - paragraph screed .
He packs his short piece full of them .
I can't repost all of it and there 's no need .
His tripe is what gets blasted into the media all the time .
The ER - trauma bit is known to be false , a complete misuse of ER data .
The 30 % risk of accidents is a new one on me .
I have NEVER seen such a study yielding such data and it's not linked in the man 's screed .
Probably proprietary research .
Nudge , nudge .
# 2 : Mike Braun recently retired from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) as the Assistant Administrator and Chief of Operations .
Ex-DEA .
Whew .
Surprise , surprise , surprise :
Marijuana legalization advocates love to say that we can tax the sale of the drug and generate revenue to cover all the costs associated with legalization , but a few more questions need to be asked .
Will the taxes pay for the significant increases in health and casualty insurance the experts tell us will be levied if marijuana is legalized ?
Is the government going to hand out free marijuana to those who ca n’t afford it ?
If so , who pays for that ?
Is it O.K. with you if the government or corporate America opens a marijuana distribution center in your neighborhood , or should they only establish them in the economically depressed areas of town ?
Which government agency will be responsible for rigorous testing to ensure that marijuana sold in the marketplace meets the strictest of consumer standards and is free of pesticides and drugs such as LSD and PCP ?
Which government agency is going to be responsible for taxing your next - door neighbor when he starts growing marijuana in his back yard , adjacent to your prized roses , of course ?
What happens when the taxes on marijuana become so excessive from covering all the ancillary costs of legalization that the vast majority of users simply grow the product themselves ?
Then who will pay for all of this ?
Waaaaaah !!!
An army of bullshit strawman arguments predicated on years of DEA propaganda dogma that he actually appears to believe .
Note he just mainly asks questions in that excerpt .
He fudges the time and space he is given to ask bullshit questions mostly designed to be intimidating , since that is what the DEA has to offer .
Intimidation and lying .
Who 's going to " lace " the weed with bad illegal drugs ?
Well , probably NOBODY .
What a stupid thing to say , but , again , this is a DEA spokesperson .
This is standard crap for them .
What government agency will see to it that it is free of pesticides ?
Oh ... I do n't know .
Who certifies other agricultural products to be Organic ?
The stupidity sucks the air from my lungs .
I can't excerpt it all and it is my general philosophy to present reefer mad froth like this for what it is and to not spend too much time " debunking it " .
The purpose of my presenting this particular information is to say that people who talk and think like these two people are free to say these things but they are flat - out wrong .
I do n't represent anybody .
I take no money from anybody to write what I do .
I do n't contribute to NORML or MPP or any other organization .
I am not a member of any such organization .
When cannabis laws are reformed I shall not make a penny .
Cannabis prohibition is indefensibly stupid , it solves nothing and creates vast amounts of crime simply because it supports a black market .
Marijuana reform will probably NOT greatly enhance tax - collection profits but it will doubtless save more in revenue outlays than it brings in in tax revenue , which will be outstanding .
Among other things , it will free up the nation 's collective police force .
Arresting 850000 people a year - 1 person every 42 seconds - for more or less NOTHING is very expensive and time - consuming .
It 's just too backwards for an intelligent country .
( We ARE intelligent , are n't we ??? )
And then consider that every single act of enforcing cannabis prohibition - every one of those 850000 arrests - translates into support for the profits of the black market ; removing such supports should be seen as a good thing .
Regulated properly like we CAN regulate it , cannabis can be available at exactly the same places booze and tobacco are sold , with the same guidelines and laws .
Aside from all the deaths caused by tobacco and alcohol , the regulation of its sales work smoothly .
Regarding " legalizing all drugs " - since some people will invariably bring this up - to try and kill the black market :
In the end , prohibition supports a black market .
A black market can't exist without it .
It 's like a Law of Physics .
the truth is MOST people do NOT use real drugs .
This is a minority of people and a change in the " war on drugs " can result in decreasing those numbers significantly , as is being demonstrated in European countries that have decriminalized the Herb .
The market for hard drugs here , while serious , remains a small minority of people relative to the numbers who smoke pot .
America is long overdue to get it's act together on cannabis prohibition , to stop the lying , to end the bullshit , to act like educated adults and to regulate cannabis and use the rewards of increased revenue and resources to tackle far more important issues .
( Updates with limits on Palestinians , previous BEN - GURION AIRPORT )
JERUSALEM , May 11 ( Reuters ) - Israel shut a Palestinian media centre in Jerusalem and limited entry to Christians from the Gaza Strip on Monday as Pope Benedict , on a historic visit to the Holy Land , urged open access to the city .
Shortly before the pontiff 's arrival , Israel handed a written order to a hotel in East Jerusalem barring the opening of a media centre for the 5 - day papal visit sponsored by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 's government .
In Gaza , Christian clerics and Palestinian officials said some 150 of 250 Christians who applied to leave the Hamas - ruled coastal territory to attend a papal mass in Jerusalem or Bethlehem had been denied permits to do so .
Israel confirmed that about 100 had been permitted entry from Gaza .
Israeli officials have said they do all they can to ensure free access to holy sites , but have imposed some restrictions because of security concerns .
On his arrival at Ben-Gurion Airport , Pope Benedict said Christianity , Islam and Judaism all held Jerusalem sacred .
" One thing that the three great monotheistic religions have in common is a special veneration for that holy city , " he said .
" It is my earnest hope that all pilgrims to the holy places will be able to access them freely and without restraint . "
The order blocking the launch of the Palestinian media centre was signed by Israel 's minister for internal security and cited an interim peace deal from the 1990s , which Israel says left it in charge of Arab East Jerusalem .
Israel has controlled all of Jerusalem since the Middle East war of 1967 and claims the city as its undivided capital .
Its annexation of Arab East Jerusalem , including the Old City with its many holy places , is not recognised internationally .
Palestinian official Hatem Abdel - Qader said the closure of the press office " shows the situation in Jerusalem is abnormal " .
He said he hoped the pope , who has called for a Palestinian state to be established alongside Israel , would intervene .
The selection of Gaza Christians was done on the basis of age .
Only Palestinians older than 35 were permitted entry to Israel for the visit , Israeli and Palestinian officials said .
" I wanted to take the children to visit Bethlehem and Jerusalem so they can have some joy and attend the prayers , " said Samia Tarazi , one of those denied a permit .
" I wanted also to see the Pope and spend the whole day praying . "
Some 3,000 Christians live among 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , the majority of whom are Muslim .

When the news came this past Sunday that the U.S. Navy had freed Capt .

A world that too often now seems upside down was for one day right - side up .
The spectacle of rag - tag pirates bobbing on the ocean for days with their American captive was described in some quarters as displaying the " limits " of U.S. military power .
It did , for as long as it lasted .
Had the U.S. failed against such opposition , national self - confidence would ...

Pimp My Star Wars Van
Record numbers of Britons who are suffering from terminal illnesses are queueing up for assisted suicide at the controversial Swiss clinic Dignitas , the Observer can reveal .
Almost 800 have taken the first step to taking their lives by becoming members of Dignitas , and 34 men and women , who feel their suffering has become unbearable , are ready to travel to Zurich and take a lethal drug overdose .
The tenfold increase in the number of Britons who have joined Dignitas since 2002 will raise questions about the law that bans assisted suicide in Britain .
On Tuesday , 46 - year - old Debbie Purdy , who suffers from progressive multiple sclerosis , will go to the House of Lords , the UK 's highest court , asking it to determine whether her husband Omar Puente will be prosecuted if he helps her to travel abroad to die .
The 34 Britons given what Dignitas calls a " provisional green light " to die have provided documentary evidence of their condition and been interviewed by both a doctor and Ludwig Minelli , the founder of Dignitas , and satisfied them that they are mentally fit to make such a decision .
One of the 34 is due to undertake an accompanied suicide very soon .
Four have already secured fixed dates for their deaths , but adjourned them .
The remaining 29 have not yet arranged a specific date .
A further four British people failed to get Dignitas 's permission after the Swiss doctor who examines all applicants said they should not be helped , either because they did not have an incurable illness or were judged not of sound enough mind to reach such a decision .
Dignitas figures also show that 15 Britons took their lives there in 2003 , 26 in 2006 , eight in the first five months of 2008 and 23 in the past 12 months .
The disclosures will reopen the highly charged debate about euthanasia .
This week , an influential group of peers , led by two former ministers in Tony Blair 's cabinet , will seek to end what they see as the outdated and inhumane situation in which relatives or friends risk up to 14 years in prison if they travel with a loved one undertaking assisted dying overseas .
The peers - led by Lord Falconer , a former lord chancellor , and Baroness Jay , a former leader of the House of Lords - will table an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill in an attempt to lift the threat of prosecution from people in England and Wales who want to support someone in their final moments .
The 1961 Suicide Act criminalises anyone who aids , abets , counsels or procures someone else 's suicide , and some relatives who have travelled have been questioned by police on their return .
However , government law officers have already admitted that no one who goes abroad for that purpose is likely to face prosecution .
" It 's a tragic anomaly that people who are giving a last loving assistance to a loved one find themselves under threat of 14 years ' imprisonment if they do , " Jay said last night .
" Having made the very difficult decision to travel abroad to somewhere like Switzerland , where assisted dying is legal , someone would want the sort of support they would expect here from a husband , wife or loved one .
The law in this area is a fudge and parliamentarians are lagging behind public opinion on this . "
Prominent peers with legal or medical backgrounds are backing the move , including Lib Dem barrister Lord Lester , Baroness Greengross , the former head of Age Concern England , and Lord ( Naren ) Patel , chairman of the National Patient Safety Agency .
If they win - and they are increasingly confident - it would force the government to take a view .
It used parliamentary procedure to prevent voting in March on an identical amendment in the Commons , which had been proposed by Patricia Hewitt , the health secretary until 2007 .
Lesley Close , who travelled to Dignitas with her brother , John , in 2003 when he ended a life overshadowed by motor neurone disease , said : " More and more British people will be joining Dignitas and travelling to Switzerland to die because more people are aware of the compassionate and peaceful death you can achieve there .
" The interest in Dignitas among Britons underlines the case for reform of the law here .
We need the same facility here [ as Dignitas ] .
It 's a perfectly rational and humane decision to end your life if you are suffering intolerably at the end of a terminal illness . "
Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying , which campaigns for a new right to assisted dying , said : " These figures show that the situation in this country is forcing people into difficult and dangerous decisions - to go abroad for an assisted death , or ask their doctor or a relative to help them die , or to attempt suicide themselves , some of which end up being botched .
" There is clearly a growing demand in this country for a well regulated , legal right for people with terminal illness , who are mentally competent , to end their life if they choose to . "
Edited to include a reference to Orkut .
Google wants to conquer the social networking world without creating an explicit social network .
Rather than trying to revive its
Orkut networking site , which has been a flop outside of Brazil , Google is weaving the various components of social networks through its existing services .
Your contacts in Gmail and Google Talk , for example , are being turned into a list of “ friends ” with whom you can share photos from Picasa or blog posts from Blogger .
Another piece of Google ’s decentralized social network is an option that lets people create a profile page with photos and the usual tidbits about where you went to school and so on .
On Tuesday , Google began a campaign to get people to create these profiles , using its biggest gun : the Google search engine .
If you want to control what people see when they search for your name , create a profile and click the box to have it included in Google search results .
While some people may well want to do anything they can to hide from the prying eyes of surfers around the world , many more in this narcissistic era will want to ascend to the stage Google is offering them .
There are good write - ups of the nuances of this feature from Danny Sullivan , of Search Engine Land , and John Battelle , the author and ad - network entrepreneur .
Are the new profile pages enough to get Google ’s ersatz social network to rival Facebook and MySpace ?
I do n’t know .
But it does n’t hurt .
As much Google ’s strategy makes a lot of business sense , I think it has some real problems for users .
Social networks are not just software with features they are –really — communities .
What you do on MySpace , Twitter and Facebook are different because each has different rules about who can see what about you and different norms that have evolved for what is acceptable behavior .
Facebook , for all its missteps , has really defined a high standard of control for users .
It ’s easy to change which group of people sees what information about you .
And you can see how this plays out .
Google lets you have a little control over who sees your phone number and other contact information .
Otherwise , everything in the profile is public .
More troublesome to me is that the rules and norms of all of Google ’s features are hard to figure out .
That is in keeping with the company ’s style .
It evolves products over time , and tends to offer limited options hoping that default settings work for most people .
That may be the best way to make a search engine , map site and maybe even an e-mail service .
But I do n’t think it ’s the best way to create services where people share sometimes very intimate details about themselves .
For me , I do n’t really want strangers to see pictures of my kids .
But I love to show pictures of my kids to my friends .
Maybe Google lets me do this , but the interface is too hard for me to figure out .
I also find Google ’s version of the social graph Google Friend Connect inscrutable .
I think Google has a huge set of advantages in becoming a hub of social communications and media sharing , with YouTube , Blogger , Gmail and of course its search engine .
But the company and its users may well be served by bringing all these features into a more coherent interface around which user expectations can be built .
When it comes to your personal thoughts , contact information and your photos — be they of your kids or your bachelor party — saying trust the black box just is n’t good enough .
So last night ’s Lakers–Rockets game was one for the ages .
In other words , when the two teams meet next , probably someone ’s gonna die .
Hint : it wo n’t be Ron Artest .
You see , everything was fine for the first half .
Close game and all , but bah , who am I kidding , I was n’t watching it — it ’s the NBA .
But apparently the elbows started to fly in the second half , and Kobe Bryant and Artest were both in the middle of it — not a smart fight for Mr. Bryant to pick .
Artest was sent off the court by referee Joe Crawford with 6:57 remaining in the game after he pointed across the court at Bryant and made a gesture near his throat .
Artest complained that he was elbowed in the throat by Bryant under the basket .
Artest had this to say about the situation :
I knew I was going to get a technical foul .
The point was to let the refs know this guy was elbowing me .
I know I went over there with no punches , no shoves to the face , just a confrontation .
I told him , ` You ’re hitting the wrong person .
Do n’t you know you ’re hitting Ron Artest ’ .
Seriously , Kobe , WTF ?
You ’re hitting RON ARTEST !
He ’s actually insane !
As we linked to above , he ’s the guy who actually ran into the stands in Detroit to fight people — FANS !
And you , Kobe Bryant , now want to fight him ?
Apparently to Artest , though , the Wednesday incident was really no big deal .
Why ?
Because he once saw a man get stabbed in the heart during a game of pick - up basketball :
After being ejected against the Lakers on Wednesday night , the Houston Rockets forward told reporters that he once watched as a player was killed during a game “ back home in the neighborhood . ”
“ It was so competitive , they broke a leg from a table and they threw it , ” said the Queens native .
“ It went right through his heart and he died right on the court .
So I ’m accustomed to playing basketball really rough . ”
A look at the front with the cover taken off .
Inside , the PSU sits in a separate chamber , along with space for a couple of 3.5 in bays .
The 140 mm fan , in the middle , draws in air from the meshed bottom and pushes it around the chassis .
To the right sit four 3.5 in bays with hot - swappable connectivity provided , and a separate 120 mm , just in front , pushes air over them to the motherboard section .
Five 5.25 in bays complete the expansion options , so there should be room for practically every enthusiast 's kit .
We like the fact that cables can be tidied by pushing them through sections of the motherboard tray , and there 's space to mount either three 120 mm fans or a triple - wide radiator at the very top .
Corsair 's entry into the chassis market will be at the high end of the pricing spectrum , with prices of around £ 250 / $ 300 bandied about .
The extra -large model on display seemed reasonable on first glance , but competition at this space is fierce , with SilverStone , Antec , and Cooler Master all having proven designs and a wealth of experience .
Looking forward to seeing which changes implement in the shipping model , due out in April this year , Corsair 's big - boy chassis may pique the interest of the enthusiast who hankers after space above all else .
This was absolutely hilarious when I thought of it - half delirious at 3 am after slamming the freezer door into my head while trying to negotiate the fridge in pitch black .

It 's just a gaudy LED filled bra ..

Ladies , I 'd better see some flashing breasts the next time we meet .
I 'm serious .
In a nutshell , the state has used the technique of mass Transmarginal Inhibition to render the bulk of people passive , apathetic , submissive and confused .
For those who truly run the world there are no boundaries , for them there are no nation states , no laws , no morals ; there is just power .
Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security .
Deliberate employment of weapons of mass destruction or other catastrophic capabilities , unforeseen economic collapse , loss of functioning political and legal order , purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency , pervasive public health emergencies , and catastrophic natural and human disasters are all paths to disruptive domestic shock .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , who heads the Metropolitan police 's public order branch , told the Guardian that middle - class individuals who would never have considered joining demonstrations may now seek to vent their anger through protests this year .
He said that banks , particularly those that still pay large bonuses despite receiving billions in taxpayer money , had become " viable targets " .
So too had the headquarters of multinational companies and other financial institutions in the City which are being blamed for the financial crisis .
Hartshorn , who receives regular intelligence briefings on potential causes of civil unrest , said the mood at some demonstrations had changed recently , with activists increasingly " intent on coming on to the streets to create public disorder " .
The warning comes in the wake of often violent protests against the handling of the economy across Europe .
In recent weeks Greek farmers have blocked roads over falling agricultural prices , a million workers in France joined demonstrations to demand greater protection for jobs and wages and Icelandic demonstrators have clashed with police in Reykjavik .
In the UK hundreds of oil refinery workers mounted wildcat strikes last month over the use of foreign workers .
Intelligence reports suggest that " known activists " are also returning to the streets , and police claim they will foment unrest .
" Those people would be good at motivating people , but they have n't had the ' footsoldiers ' to actually carry out [ protests ] , " Hartshorn said .
" Obviously the downturn in the economy , unemployment , repossessions , changes that .
Suddenly there is the opportunity for people to mass protest . "
It is obvious that in the US and the UK those that control the military , police and intelligence apparatus are seeking widespread conflict
Each piece on the chessboard is there for a reason .
" Men are quick to tremble before imaginary dangers and slow to see the real ones "
It may seem blindingly obvious , but I 'm going to say it anyway as we often seem to forget , that clear communication is essential to mutual understanding .
Without a common understanding of what we say to each other we find ourselves adrift in Babel - land .
The risks to us all from a lack of common understanding cannot be overstated .
In the midst of the deluge of bailouts , rescues and stimulus packages there is no clear communication as to just why these measures are being taken and how they are meant to improve the lives of ordinary people .
It is abundantly clear that this is deliberate .
If we , the normal people of the planet , were to gain a common understanding of what is really happening , we would decide that we do n't approve , we would agree on exactly why we do n't approve and we would likely agree on what we wish to see happen instead .
Those that control our world know this so they ensure that no common understanding is reached ; they need the confusion .
In fact , they create the confusion .
They do this because should enough people truly understand the reality of what is happening on this planet a critical mass might be reached such that collectively we decide that we will no longer tolerate the world being the way it is and , more importantly , we would have a common direction to get out of the mess .
In order to ensure that we do not develop this common direction the controllers , or as Douglas Reed called them , the Managers , continuously ensure that we are in a state of confusion .
wherein we see " others " as threatening to us whether to our property , our social status , our position at work , our position in our community , our economic position and even to our very survival .
Our societies have been engineered so that the wealthy fear the poor , the middle class fear the unionized workers , one race fears another , one religious creed fears another , and so on and so on almost ad infinitum .
We compete rather than cooperate and we fear and hate rather than loving and empathizing .
All our religions , all our political parties , all our beliefs have been engineered to keep us in a constant state of fear .
For most people in the so called " free " countries of the western world our fear is typically of each other and of foreigners , whether immigrant or " terrorist " , but this has been changing as we have become increasingly aware of the awesome power of the state as it manifests its brutality against our protests , as it whittles away our " freedoms " and commits our nations to criminal and immoral wars and theft .
In order to amass greater power for itself the state has manipulated people 's fears under the guise of the " war - on - terror " , the " war - on - drugs " , immigration and economic insecurity .
Overlaying the fear is a constant barrage of conflicting information , misinformation and disinformation constructed so as to ensure that no clear picture of reality can be discerned .
There is a struggle taking place which will determine the future of this planet and the people on it .
Arrayed against normal people is a pathological system dominated by psychopaths of all races , creeds and colours .
These psychopaths have no purpose that normal people can properly comprehend , for their purpose is power ; power for its own sake .
They seek no strategic political or economic goal , there is no specific land they covet or a level of wealth which they seek , for there is not enough land nor enough wealth to satisfy them .
Neither is there a limit to the suffering they will cause for they seem to revel in bloodbaths , in torture and starvation .
They seek infinite control , no bargain nor parlay can assuage them , there is no treaty that can halt their rapacious advance nor law that can limit them .
We have grown up and bring our children up in a world dominated by this pathology and these beings .
Yet the psychopath has a fundamental weakness , like any stalking predator in the wild that depends on concealment to eat : .
It is this innate fear of exposure that dominates much of what they do and explains the immense fear and confusion that we are kept in .
The fear and confusion of the world is the deliberate ploy of the psychopaths to avoid discovery .
We cannot fight the psychopaths and the diseased system they have created with weapons of war for they control the greatest war machines the world has ever known ; we cannot succeed by any means other than through a simple and all powerful revolution , a revolution of truth .
The truth , as famously stated by St Paul , will also set us free .
It will set us free from fear and confusion , because the truth has no political , religious or any other affiliation , it stands on its own .
But finding the truth is no easy task , for it remains hidden behind veil after veil .
Our task therefore is to strip away every veil without pity ; especially without pity for ourselves and the warm fuzzy religious and philosophical lies we have used as wool over our eyes .
We will discover horrors about the world and about ourselves that will challenge everything we have taken for granted but if we do not have the courage to face these horrors , these truths about ourselves and our world , we will lose , and the world will sink into darkness , a darkness from which it may never recover .
Psychopaths have dominated the world for millennia , but now they have the power to destroy this world and no capacity to understand what that really means .
As Andrew M. Lobaczewski put it in Political Ponerology , " Germs are not aware that they will be burned alive or buried deep in the ground along with the human body whose death they are causing .
" When we strip away the lies , the system we find ourselves captive in does not resemble the world in which we thought we lived .
Money and the economy are mere tools for the attaining of power so that everything we observe in the field of economics and money is simply part of the perpetual garnering of power .
Yet we have to understand that the system , the Matrix , is not something that we will one day suddenly find and be able to point to and say " see , there it is " , for it surrounds us ; all we see are at best mere reflections of what is happening at levels which we cannot penetrate .
With this in mind , let us return to the matter of confusion .
It seems to us that the immense confusion surrounding the economic crisis is a key to perceiving the Matrix .
It seems to us that those that run the world , the Managers , are relying on this confusion to ensure that we take a particular path which is to their advantage .
We think that the path they are sending us down is one of near total economic collapse resulting in the breakdown of the existing social order and the imposition of overt military dictatorship .
That is the obvious end result of what they are doing and thus is their intent .
This is precisely the scenario envisaged in a monograph from the Strategic Studies Institute in a November 2008 entitled " Known Unknowns : Unconventional ' Strategic Shocks ' in Defense Strategy Development , " in which it is stated : - It is also the reason that in the UK the Metropolitan Police have begun a propaganda war against the people of the UK when they had the Guardian newspaper report :- This violence will be used to justify dictatorship , civil repression , mass arrests and incarceration without trial .
Douglas Reed , in From Smoke to Smother ( 1948 ) foresaw this exact scenario when he wrote of the World Dictatorship that he saw arising under the guise of the United Nations implemented through ' emergency powers ' , ' labour direction ' and ' bread rationing ' .
We have the ' emergency powers ' in place now : the Patriot Act , the Military Commissions Act etc in the US , the Terrorism Acts in the UK ( to name but a few ) .
Soon we will have ' labour direction ' as the economy crumbles in ruins and labouring for the state or via the state for the global corporations will become a necessity in the face of starvation .
In due course , with the breakdown in global trade and social structure there will no doubt be ' bread rationing ' of some sort .
Whether it will truly be rationing or rather the simple expedient of starvation of those that do not bow down before the might of the US and Israeli empire .
Yet we now see that the United Nations may have been a foil all along .
For 50 years , Christian fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists in the US and elsewhere , have been ranting about the New World Order under the United Nations while the US was portrayed as the bastion of freedom and the only power that can stand against the UN and the World .
This has rendered those who see a great deal incapable of seeing where the real danger lies .
Even Douglas Reed saw the United Nations as the supra-national body to impose the first World Dictatorship and how wrong was he when one looks at the invasion of Iraq based on wholly imaginary weapons , the bullying of Iran for being in the way of the global hegemony of the US and Israel while the barefaced genocide perpetrated by Israel goes unremarked let alone addressed by an impotent United Nations ?
So too will we be faced with one or more supra-national bodies based , as the United Nations was , on the justification of " never again " .
This time the " never again " is economic but will become military on the heels of social unrest and state violence .
The same lies will be trotted out to justify these institutions now as in the 1940's and yet again these will be foils behind which the real rulers of the world , the US and Israel , will hide .
The Managers have engineered this crisis , its form , scope and magnitude such that there is nothing that our governments could do , within the constraints imposed upon them , even if they had the vision and understanding to comprehend the trap we are all in .
The nature of the banking system is such that it would inevitably lead to the debt driven asset price bubble that has made prisoners of debt out of millions and slaves out of billions .
Years of banking merger upon banking merger resulted in a small number of banks coming to dominate the globe with the inevitable result that the very existence of the entire system now rests upon their shoulders .
Yet these banks were deliberately allowed to be run in a cavalier and immoral fashion with precious little proper oversight .
Similarly , the world has become dominated by a small number of global corporations that control our access to energy , food , and the other essentials , and non-essentials , of life .
Our political systems have become hostage to the interests of these banking and corporate empires , our governments so dominated by them that the US government has been referred to as " Government Sachs " , a reference to the number of positions in the US government held by Goldman Sachs people .
Our national governments are now simply puppets of the banks and corporations that dominate the globe who are in turn the puppets of the hidden Managers , their rule imposed through military might and the police state .
This was all a trap , designed to lead to exactly this situation from which there is no apparent escape .
Our political leaders , our civil servants , our leading bankers and corporate managers are all the products of a system that has provided them with a framework of reality which is false , limited and engineered such that the psychopathic rise to the top and the non-psychopathic become so hopelessly infected that they might as well be psychopathic .
Their beliefs about the world are so diseased that they justify to themselves the rape and destruction of entire peoples and nations and will justify to themselves the repression and destruction of their own people .
Yet it is to these people that we are told we must defer in leading us out of the mess that they have created .
The vast majority of these people did not consciously create this mess , they simply participated in its creation because that is how they are , it reflects their nature , they can be and could do nothing else .
But behind them lie those who are very conscious of the actions they take and who have a very clear and specific agenda .
The way these Managers work is simple , they understand the nature of psychopaths , for that is their nature , and the weaknesses of normal people and they play them .
They establish environments in which psychopaths will flourish and in which the weaknesses of normal people such as greed and avarice will become dominant .
The free market capitalist system is just such an environment ; an environment easily manipulated by the Managers to create whatever result they wish .
The result they desired and have crystalised is the collapse of the system in exactly the manner we see ; the inevitable scrambling by their minions for ' solutions ' , which are themselves part of the plan , including the setting up of the simultaneous pillaging of national treasuries across the globe in a manner designed to extract maximum wealth , exponentially increase debt and create figures of hatred , in the banks and bankers , for the masses to direct their anger at .
At no time can the Managers be identified for they are never on the chessboard .
For many the idea that our entire world is a giant chessboard is too much .
These people fall back on the illusions of the Matrix always seeking a more comfortable , a more reassuring explanation .
As Douglas Reed said , We are being driven towards economic apocalypse , societal collapse and totalitarian dictatorship ; it is as simple as that .
Denial makes victims , facing reality makes the people of the future .

We ’ve all had the same thought .
With the enourmous library of PlayStation One titles at Sony ’s disposal , why have n’t more PSOne Classics made their way to the PS Store ?
Well soon enough , you wo n’t have to ask that question again , as the word is that Sony will be bringing a big chunk of PSN classics to the North American PS Store .
Even more specific , they plan on bringing 3 of the titles which helped make PlayStation king .
Those 3 titles are Metal Gear Solid , Resident Evil : Director ’s Cut , and ( drum roll please … ) Final Fantasy VII .
No mention of when exactly this is going to happen , but you can expect them soon .
Celebrity Toilet – The Neorest
The great thing about having a bunch of extra money lying around is that you get to buy all sorts of ridiculous things .
Unfortunately , if you are not a celebrity or extremely wealthy and you save your money only to buy a $ 5000.00 toilet people think you are crazy .
However , the more you learn about the Toto Neorest 600 the better you understand the fine line that separates crazy and genius .
Will Smith is one Hollywood star that knows how to drop a comfortable deuce !
If you check out the Neorest website here you see how seriously the people at Neorest take their toilets .
Their website alone makes you feel like you are embarking on a magical journey into the unknown .
Here are a few product details on the toilet that we pulled from the Neorest site :
Full wireless remote options Automatic hands - free lid opening and closing Heated SoftClose seat Remote Flush Automatic hands - free flush First tank - less toilet with integrated wash - less seat Cyclone flushing system Rear / front / soft front cleanse Oscillating comfort cleanse Self - cleaning mode Dual flush water conservation mode Warm air dryer Adjustable wand positioning Automatic wand cleaning Catalytic air purifier Sana gloss glaze on the bowl for more hygienic , easy - to clean surface
I do n’t even know what half of that stuff means , but this toilet has more features and screams of more luxury then anything I own , including my entire apartment and car .
I do n’t know about the rest of the NTG readers but I feel like my life now has a distinct purpose .
I must try one of these !
With a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work , one day I might even be the proud owner of my own oscillating comfort cleanse toilet .
One can dream .
Call it ' music tourism ' with a touch of nostalgia .
It might also bring a steady stream of visitors to the city , many Japanese ?
I like the upbeat 2
Tone at 30 message ' created in Coventry , given to the world ' ( see picture below , from their site ) .
They remind us that on 27th March The third 2 - Tone plaque will be unveiled at " The Birthplace of 2 - Tone " , 51 Albany Road .
The 2 - Tone at 30 Facebook Group created by Pete Chambers informs us that " throughout 2009 there will be eight 2 - Tone plaques unveiled at various locations on Coventry 's 2 - Tone Trail .
Each one will give a glimpse of the fascinating history of bands like The Specials and the Selecter .
As well as the iconic 2 - Tone record label itself , a label that helped to launch the careers of other ska - based bands such as Madness and the Beat .
With each unveiling it is hoped that various other events will combine to create a fitting tribute to this incredibly infectious and extraordinary aware brand of music that is marking its 30th anniversary in 2009 . "

For two decades , researchers have been using a growing volume of genetic data to debate whether ancestors of Native Americans emigrated to the New World in one wave or successive waves , or from one ancestral Asian population or a number of different populations .
Now , after painstakingly comparing DNA samples from people in dozens of modern - day Native American and Eurasian groups , an international team of scientists thinks it can put the matter to rest :
Virtually without exception the new evidence supports the single ancestral population theory .
“ Our work provides strong evidence that , in general , Native Americans are more closely related to each other than to any other existing Asian populations , except those that live at the very edge of the Bering Strait , ” said Kari Britt Schroeder , a lecturer at the University of California , Davis , and the first author on the paper describing the study .
“ While earlier studies have already supported this conclusion , what ’s different about our work is that it provides the first solid data that simply cannot be reconciled with multiple ancestral populations , ” said Schroeder , who was a Ph.D. student in anthropology at the university when she did the research .
The study is published in the May issue of the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution .
The team ’s work follows up on earlier studies by several of its members who found a unique variant ( an allele ) of a genetic marker in the DNA of modern - day Native American people .
Dubbed the “ 9 - repeat allele , ” the variant ( which does not have a biological function ) , occurred in all of the 41 populations that they sampled from Alaska to the southern tip of Chile , as well as in Inuit from Greenland and the Chukchi and Koryak people native to the Asian ( western ) side of the Bering Strait .
Yet this allele was absent in all 54 of the Eurasian , African and Oceanian groups the team sampled .
Overall , among the 908 people who were in the 44 groups in which the allele was found , more than one out of three had the variant .
In these earlier studies , the researchers concluded that the most straightforward explanation for the distribution of the 9 - repeat allele was that all modern Native Americans , Greenlanders and western Beringians descend from a common founding population .
Furthermore , the fact that the allele was absent in other Asian populations most likely meant that America ’s ancestral founders had been isolated from the rest of Asia for thousands of years before they moved into the New World : that is , for a period of time that was long enough to allow the allele to originate in , and spread throughout , the isolated population .
As strong as this evidence was , however , it was not foolproof .
There were two other plausible explanations for the widespread distribution of the allele in the Americas .
If the 9 - repeat allele had arisen as a mutation multiple times , its presence throughout the Americas would not indicate shared ancestry .
Alternatively , if there had been two or more different ancestral founding groups and only one of them had carried the 9 - repeat allele , certain circumstances could have prompted it to cross into the other groups and become widespread .
Say that there was a second allele — one situated very close to the 9 - repeat allele on the DNA strand — that conferred a strong advantage to humans who carried it .
Natural selection would carry this allele into new populations and because of the mechanics of inheritance , long stretches of DNA surrounding it , including the functionless 9 - repeat allele , would be carried along with the beneficial allele .
To rule out these possibilities , the research team , which was headed by Noah Rosenberg at the University of Michigan , scrutinized DNA samples of people from 31 modern - day Asian populations , 19 Native American , one Greenlandic and two western Beringian populations .
They found that in each sample that contained the 9 - repeat allele , short stretches of DNA on either side of it were characterized by a distinct pattern of base pairs , a pattern they seldom observed in people without the allele .
“ If natural selection had promoted the spread of a neighboring advantageous allele , we would expect to see longer stretches of DNA than this with a similarly distinct pattern , ” Schroeder said .
“ And we would also have expected to see the pattern in a high frequency even among people who do not carry the 9 - repeat allele .
So we can now consider the positive selection possibility unlikely . ”
The results also ruled out the multiple mutations hypothesis .
If that had been the case , there would have been myriad DNA patterns surrounding the allele rather than the identical characteristic signature the team discovered .
“ There are a number of really strong papers based on mitochondrial DNA — which is passed from mother to daughter — and Y - chromosome DNA — which is passed from father to son — that have also supported a single ancestral population , ” Schroeder said .
“ But this is the first definitive evidence we have that comes from DNA that is carried by both sexes . ”
Other authors of the study are David G. Smith , a professor of anthropology at UC Davis ; Mattias Jacobsson , University of Michigan and Uppsala University in Sweden ; Michael H. Crawford , University of Kansas ; Theodore Schurr , University of Pennsylvania ; Simina Boca , Johns Hopkins University ; Donald F. Conrad and Jonathan Pritchard , University of Chicago ; Raul Tito and Ripan Malhi , University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign ; Ludmilla Osipova , Russian Academy of Sciences , Novosibirsk ; Larissa Tarskaia , Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow ; Sergey Zhadanov , University of Pennsylvania and Russian Academy of Sciences , Novosibirsk ; and Jeffrey D. Wall , UC San Francisco .
The work was supported by NIH grants to Rosenberg and Smith and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to Schroeder .

Student strip - search case before Supreme Court U.S. Supreme Court
When Savana Redding , now 19 , talks of what happened to her in eighth grade , it is clear that the painful memories linger .
She speaks of being embarrassed and fearful , and of staying away from school for two months .
And she recalls the " whispers " and " stares " from others in this small eastern Arizona mining town after she was strip searched in the nurse 's office because a vice principal suspected she might be hiding an extra-strength ibuprofen in her underwear .
The Supreme Court will hear her case on Tuesday .
Its decision , the first to address the issue of strip searches in schools , will set legal limits , if any , on the authority of school officials to search for drugs or weapons on campus .
If limits on searches are imposed , the school district warns , its ability to keep all drugs out of its schools would be reduced .
In this case , said district lawyer Matthew Wright , the vice principal was concerned because one student had gotten seriously ill from taking unidentified pills .
" That was the driving force for him .
If nothing had been done , and this happened to another kid , parents would have been outraged , " Wright said .
In California and six other states , strip searches of students are not permitted .
Only once in the past has the high court ruled on a school - search case , and it sounds quaint now .
It arose in 1980 when a New Jersey girl was caught smoking in the bathroom , and the principal searched her purse for cigarettes .
The justices upheld that search because the principal had a specific reason for looking in her purse .
But they did not say how far officials could go - and how much of a student 's privacy could be sacrificed - to maintain safety at school .
That 's the issue in Safford Unified School District vs. Redding .
Savana was an honors student , shy and " nerdy , " she says , when the eighth grade began .
She first learned she was in trouble when Kerry Wilson , the vice principal , came into a math class one morning and told her to come with him to the office .
He was in search of white pills .
Wilson knew a boy had gotten sick from pills he obtained at school .
And that morning , another eighth grader , Marissa Glines , was found with what turned out to be several ibuprofen 400 pills tucked into a school planner .
A few days before , Savana had lent Marissa the folder .
When asked where she got the pills , Marissa named Savana Redding .
These " could only be obtained with a prescription , " Wilson reported .
Commonly used for headaches or to relieve pain from menstrual cramps , ibuprofen is marketed under brand names including Advil and Motrin with recommend doses of 200 to 400 mg .
" District policy J-3050 strictly prohibits the nonmedical use or possession of any drug on campus , " he explained later in a sworn statement .
Savana said she knew nothing of the pills in the folder .
" He asked if he could search my backpack .
I said , ' Sure , ' " she recalled .
When nothing was found , Wilson sent Savana to the nurse 's office where the nurse and an office assistant were told to " search her clothes " for the missing pills .
Savana said she kept her head down , embarrassed and afraid she would cry .
After removing her pink T - shirt and black stretch pants , she was told to pull her underwear to the side and to shake to see if any pills could be dislodged .
It was " the most humiliating experience , " she said .
" We did not find any pills during our search of Savana , " Wilson reported .
When her mother arrived at the school to pick her up , another student called to her : " What are you going to do about them strip searching Savana ? "
Upset and angry , April Redding said she marched to the principal 's office , then to the superintendent 's office nearby .
Both denied at first knowing that a student had been strip searched .
" It was wrong .
I did n't think anything like that could happen to my daughter at school , " she said , wiping a tear .
Contacted at the school last week , Wilson declined to discuss the case , as did other school officials .
When no one apologized , April Redding sued the school district for damages .
Her lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union say the strip search went far beyond the bounds of reasonableness , especially when there was no imminent danger .
So far , judges have been almost evenly divided over whether Savana 's rights were violated .
A federal magistrate in Tucson held the search was reasonable because the vice principal was relying on the tip from Marissa .
In a 2 - 1 decision , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed .
Last year , however , the full 9th Circuit took up the case and ruled 6 - 5 for the Reddings .
Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw said the vice principal 's action defied common sense as well the Constitution .
" A reasonable school official , seeking to protect the students in his charge , does not subject a 13 - year old girl to a traumatic search to ' protect ' her from the danger of Advil , " she wrote .
Last autumn , the school district appealed to the Supreme Court , saying it " finds itself on the front lines of the decades - long war against drug abuse among students . "
Weightlifting Workout Charts : Tips for Ensuring Variation
Weightlifting workout charts are a dime a dozen .
In fact , you will find hundreds of them on the internet , free .
The challenge is not really finding effective weightlifting workout charts , but modifying basic charts to target your desired areas and varying your routines from time to time to keep your muscles growing .
Read on to learn tips for ensuring variety in your weightlifting workout charts so that you can make the most them .
Those new to the topic of workout routines schedules and workouts in general will come across the term weightlifting workout charts  and know from commonsense what these charts are for .
But what do they contain , exactly , and how does one benefit from them ?
Weightlifting workout charts consist of weightlifting and bodybuilding techniques explained step - by - step .
Ideally , they should detail the correct form and movement , as well as the number of sets and repetitions for each exercise aimed at developing a specific muscle group or body part .
These charts provide structure to a body - building workout and are especially helpful to beginners .
Weightlifting workout charts are a dime a dozen .
Since you re already online , you probably already know by now that there are hundreds of them on the internet .
The challenge is not really finding effective weightlifting workout charts , but modifying basic charts to target your desired areas and varying your routines from time to time so as not to bore  your muscles , so to speak .
Read on to learn tips for ensuring variation in your weightlifting routines so that you can make the most of your weightlifting workout charts .
Start with a few basic charts for a whole - body workout targeting every major muscle group .
Although its good to aim high , its not wise to overburden the body just because you want to see immediate results .
Instead , you want to break in your muscles gradually .
Slow and sure is the way to go , especially if you re a beginner .
It s best to organize your weightlifting exercises around a 3day workout routine .
Again , dont be overeager and make weightlifting a part of your daily workout schedules .
It s important to allow the muscles at least 48 hours to heal and build themselves , or at least until they dont feel sore anymore .
After a few months , your body will get used to your routine , allowing you to execute all the exercises with little difficulty .
This should be a signal for you to introduce changes into your routine by doing any of the following from time to time : * Split your workout into two , targeting two different areas of the body .
This way , you can devote more attention to each muscle group , resulting in more definition .
This naturally requires a longer period of rest in between workout sessions .*
Introduce two to three different exercises .*
Change the order of your exercises .*
Lessen your weights and increase the number of repetitions for each exercise . *
Add to your weights and decrease the number of repetitions for each exercise .
As you can see , the name of the game is variation .
As already mentioned , you dont want your muscles to get familiar with any one routine because once this happens , they stop growing , and your weightlifting workout charts lose their effectiveness .

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Long Eaton , a tough little former railway town in Derbyshire , is still coming to terms with the closure of its local paper , the Long Eaton Advertiser , which owner Trinity Mirror pulled the plug on last October , blaming " difficult trading conditions " .
Brian Keen , who I catch at an emotional moment in the Lockstone pub in the centre of town , becomes almost tearful at the loss .
The paper was there for him to place the notice of his mother 's death last year ; it is no longer there for the in memoriam .
" A lot of people are missing the Advertiser , " says Keen .
" This used to be a beautiful town .
But it 's not the town it was : it 's got scruffy , it 's got rough , and now we even lose the paper . "
For the older generation , these things matter .
" They want to know who 's passed away , " says the barman at the Corner Pin down the road , " and to check it 's not them . "
But the younger generation do n't much care .
Carl and Katrina Smith , a married couple in their mid-30s , not only did n't know the paper had closed ; they did n't even know its name - and they were born nearby and have lived in the town most of their lives .
They did , though , occasionally buy the Nottingham Evening Post - mainly for the jobs .
For this generation , Long Eaton as a place has almost ceased to exist , lost in a more amorphous Nottingham - Derby conurbation .
" It 's only the older people who think of communities now , " says Carl .
" For us it 's more a place to live than a community . "
He was an electrician 's mate and worked all over the country ( until he was laid off two months ago - people are as vulnerable as papers in the slump ) ; Katrina works in Leicester .
Long Eaton is a dormitory for them ; they rent a house and say they have no idea who their neighbours are .
" It used to be a proper community , with the railway , the canals and the upholstery industry , " says Carl , " but look round at the shops now .
You 've got Tesco and Asda , and everything else is in decline . "
There is one new shop in Long Eaton - selling Polish , Russian and Lithuanian food , to cater for migrants from eastern Europe .
The shop even has free papers in those three languages , as well as Ukrainian .
But they are UK - wide and wo n't record deaths in Long Eaton , in any language .
Philip
White , who runs a newsagent in Long Eaton , says the Advertiser began to lose its way a couple of years ago , when Trinity Mirror cut back on local reporting and started printing in distant Tamworth .
" It started to lose its identity when they moved it out of town , " he says .
" Before that , it had more of a local slant on things .
It had its finger on the pulse .
They had an office in the town , and you could go in and give them a story .
People would come out and take local pictures . "
It 's a terrible cliche , but local and regional papers are caught in a perfect storm ( national titles are having a hard time , too , but that 's for another day ) .
The local readership is ageing ; high streets are losing their shops ; the three key regional advertising markets - property , cars and jobs - have dropped dramatically .
The Newspaper Society , which represents the local press , estimates the year - on - year ad slump at between 10 % and 20 % , but in those three key sectors all the big groups put the fall at more like 40 % , with the bubble - deflating south - east the worst affected .
Sixty - plus papers , mostly " frees " , have already been closed - the Long Eaton Advertiser is unusual in being a paid - for casualty ; 1,000 or so UK journalists have lost their jobs .
This is an assignment in which I take a particular interest .
Michael Pelosi is well placed to describe what it 's like out there for the 90 - plus city - based and regional dailies and 1,200 - plus weeklies struggling to survive in this new , net - driven world .
Pelosi is managing director of Northcliffe Media - one of the big four regional press groups - and president of the Newspaper Society .
On the day we meet he has just announced that Northcliffe will cut 1,000 staff - more than 20 % of its workforce .
The majority will be compulsory redundancies .
" This is a very difficult time for everyone in our industry , " he tells me in his office at the Daily Mail HQ in Kensington , London ( the Daily Mail and General Trust owns Northcliffe ) .
" It 's not easy for managers having to make people redundant ; it 's not easy for me .
If you like doing this , then it 's time to hang up your pen and stop coming in to work . "
Pelosi is an engaging Scot who , I suspect , means what he says .
He insists this is the only way the group can stay in profit .
Northcliffe made £ 80 m three years ago ; even with all the staff cuts , it will make a fraction of that this year .
These big corporations do n't believe in recording losses , even in unprecedentedly bad times ; what happened to the £ 80 m is not immediately clear .
Everywhere , papers are under pressure , staff are being sacked , and there is talk of a crisis in local democracy if the local press is further eroded .
The situation is not yet as perilous as in the US , where some famous big -city papers have gone to the wall and plenty of others are hanging by a thread , but even here there are mutterings about the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post , two famous titles that the debt - laden Johnston Press bought at the top of the market , and which now are worth a fraction of what they paid for them .
I visited Birmingham and had a tour of Trinity Mirror 's impressive Fort Dunlop facility , which now houses the Birmingham Mail , Birmingham Post and Sunday Mercury .
Trinity claims a circulation of 65,000 for the Mail , a traditional evening paper that has three editions a day ( these days many other evening papers are printed overnight ) .
It is robust , in touch with its predominantly white , working - class audience , and will be around for a good while yet .
The more upmarket Birmingham Post , with a circulation of just 12,000 , looks more vulnerable : another of our famous regional morning titles that no one seems to want any more .
The Sunday Mercury ( that Birmingham has its own Sunday reflects how strongly the Midlands is committed to its own press ) will be secured by the fact that reading behaviour is different on Sundays , and that it offers no fewer than 40 pages of local sport .
If you support Villa or the Blues , the name by which Birmingham City FC are universally known here , this is truly heaven .
Trinity Mirror reorganised its journalistic resources in the Midlands when it moved to Fort Dunlop last year , losing 70 of its 295 journalists ( all through voluntary redundancy ) and integrating the staffs of the three papers so that , apart from a few " brand champions " , everyone now works on everything .
Whereas previously , Mail and Mercury journalists would virtually have killed each other to protect a scoop , now an overall " head of content " decides what goes where .
It is a model being adopted by papers all over the country , on national titles too .
Birmingham Mail editor Steve Dyson , who oversaw the reorganisation , says it was a case of adapt or die .
" When we announced the changes [ in August 2008 ] and how many roles we had , we effectively made everyone redundant and said we wanted people to apply for these new roles , " he says .
" There was some anger and we faced that down .
It was brutal , but it was a case of survival .
If we had n't done that , we'd be making compulsory redundancies now . "
In Bath , the response to falling circulation was to switch the Chronicle from daily to weekly publication , backed up by a rolling news service online .
It seems to have worked : sales have risen from around 11,000 for the daily version to 19,000 for the weekly , even though at 70 p the latter retails at double the price .
The Chronicle is a Northcliffe title , and Pelosi says that , had the switch not been made in 2007 , this famous old paper ( it will celebrate its 250th birthday in 2010 ) might now be dead .
" If it was a daily newspaper today , it would be losing very considerable sums of money and it might just go - we might just put the key in the door , " he says .
" Obviously , advertising markets are extremely challenging and the Bath Chronicle is not making much money , but I believe we 've given it a chance to be on a sound economic footing by coming out once a week rather than six days a week . "
The switch was overseen by editor Sam Holliday , who joined the Chronicle in 2005 .
He says he met initial resistance from locals who felt Bath merited a daily .
" A local newspaper in a community is a bit like a local church in a village , " Holliday says .
" Very few people go to it , but everyone feels part - ownership of it , and if the vicar comes in and says , ' Right , we 're going to throw away the pews and have a new , modern church , ' a load of people who do n't even go to the church object .
When we first announced the change , I met people who said : ' Oh you can't go weekly , it 's terrible , it deserves to be a daily paper . '
And I 'd say : ' Well if only more people like you were buying it every day , it would be great ... '
And they 'd say : ' I do n't buy it every day ... '
They regarded it as an institution . "
My visit to Bath is instructive .
Metro ( another DMGT title ) - free , generic , rootless and thus emblematic of our deracinated age - is in a dumpbin by the lift in the Chronicle 's offices ; an unusual example of inviting an accomplice to your murder into your house .
The centre of Bath itself is devoid of newsagents ; they have been squeezed out by food shops and a Sainsbury 's .
" That has n't helped us , " says Holliday .
" The newsagents have been very loyal in the past , but they 're struggling . "
The signage on a former newsagent , called The Editor , in Westgate Street still gleams , but it is - for one week only - a charity shop raising money for guide dogs .
The weekly Bath Chronicle will soldier on : it will celebrate its 250th birthday , and will almost certainly still be there in a decade .
But it will never be the force it was .
When I 'm searching in vain for a newsagent , I meet a local school caretaker , Dave Stephens , and ask if he knows of any nearby .
He starts describing where I might find one , but I never could follow directions , so ask him instead what he thinks of the paper .
" I rarely buy it now , " he says .
" I just find the news is a week old by the time you 're getting it , which to me seems a bit of a waste of time .
I look at the website occasionally , but I rarely buy the print version unless my kids are in it because of something their school 's done . "
If Stephens wants information on local planning issues , he says he looks at the council website .
The paper alerted him to a new park - and - ride scheme proposed for the town - thanks for that , now he 'll follow it up online .
" If there 's something going on , " he says , " there 's always a website run by a support group or people who are against something . "
But they 'll be biased , I protest , echoing what every local newspaper editor says .
" Every paper has an agenda , too , " he counters .
He is happy to work it out for himself .
Back in Birmingham , I talk to some bloggers who have taken this a stage further : they have set up websites to cover local issues , discuss the plan to regenerate the town centre , and post documentaries about the lives of " active citizens " in the city .
OK , they can't begin to do the legwork of the Birmingham Mail 's 42 reporters - " You do n't meet many internet reporters down at the courthouse , " as The Wire creator David Simon said last week .
But what they have achieved is impressive , and anything but frothy .
Former BBC political reporter Nick Booth is a key figure in what I fear I must call the " blogging community " in Birmingham , and has the apostate 's disregard for conventional media .
" What got me back into making media [ after briefly running a quango ] was realising that you do n't have to use the tone of the conventional mainstream media , which is attempting to be impartial and slightly aloof , " he says .
" You can decide , ' I 'm just going to tell the stories of active citizens .
I 'm not going to control the editorial process as much as I might in my old job .
I 'll just give them access to the medium and access to the audience . '
And that suddenly felt more honest . "
Booth also believes this new media can change things .
" It rarely occurs to mainstream media to use its resources to make things better , " he says .
" It reflects them or carps about them , but does n't do anything about them .
That 's an awful lot of energy going into what ? "
He also likes the idea that you only publish when you have something to say .
It 's a light news day , all quiet on the Birmingham front - go out for a walk .
Booth is about to launch a Channel 4 - backed website in Birmingham called Help Me Investigate , a sort of investigative Wikipedia , where local people will raise issues - " What happened to the money that was supposed to be spent regenerating X ? " , " Why do the local hospital 's NHS contracts have gagging clauses , and is that legal ? " - and everyone else in the community will pool their knowledge and efforts to find out .
If successful , it will be rolled out nationally , part of the social - networking revolution which - if the internet zealots are to be believed - will transform information gathering and civic life over the next couple of decades .
Booth 's partner in the enterprise is Paul Bradshaw , senior lecturer in online journalism at Birmingham City University and someone much in demand as established media organisations thrash around to find a new model for their businesses .
For a man who likens the digital revolution to the Renaissance , he is surprisingly sanguine about the future of papers ; he reckons that many will survive for at least 20 years - although it will be 20 years of perpetual revolution as old and new media coexist .
Bradshaw puts the dilemma for newspaper groups , local and national , succinctly : " I think some people in most newspapers know where they 're going , " he says .
" The problem is they 're having to persuade everyone else in those organisations .
They also have enormous legacy systems of printing presses and distribution networks , and the majority of their profits still come from those legacy systems .
The next 20 years will be about that transition , and I do n't envy them .
If I was starting up a news organisation today - as in a way I am [ with Help Me Investigate ] - I would n't want those enormous costs of printing presses . "
Pundits on the future of the press range from the optimistic - former Guardian editor Peter Preston , for instance , who in his Observer media column this week attacked " self - feeding hysteria " - to investigative reporter Nick Davies , who , at the start of our interview , tells me it can be a short one .
How so ?
" As far as anyone with any sense knows , " he says , " there is n't a future for local media .
There is n't actually much of a future for national media . "
Both are right .
The newspaper industry is not going to disappear overnight .
It wo n't be like Woolworths : there one minute , boarded up the next .
In a way , it will be more painful than that : death by a thousand mutilations as reporters are cut , subeditors are centralised ( or just eliminnated ) , dailies go weekly or - as the Guardian Media Group plans for the Reading Evening Post - bi-weekly , proud paid - fors go free , while copies of the Metro and thelondonpaper litter the streets and train carriages .
Because the old business model - lots of readers attracting lots of advertising , two fast - flowing revenue streams - is , indeed , bust .
For local papers , the next 20 years will be about managing decline .
They are of course developing ancillary websites , buying specialist jobs and car websites , to try to capture the digital market .
But they can never exercise the same power as their control of infrastructure gave them in print , and the advertising model online - search - engine dominated and dependent on cash by results - means the ad revenue will never return in the same quantities .
Even if big media organisations survive this revolution , the switch from mediation of information by a professional elite to a more dispersed and , if we are being optimistic , egalitarian and organic model will have a profound effect on journalism .
What the bloggers like to call the " priesthood " ( us lot ) have to give way , with active citizens ( you lot ) doing it for yourselves .
Here Comes Everybody , as US internet guru Clay Shirky so prophetically put it .
The New York Times has recognised that the news - gathering of the future is likely to be a partnership between professional and citizen journalists , and the paper is mentoring community websites in the city .
This is not just a philanthropic exercise ; it knows it has to catch the new wave to reach shore .
There are , however , potential class and age issues here : the blogging community is young and middle - class , readers of local papers older and more working - class .
If the transition is out of synch and tracts of the country are deprived of their papers before this more organic network of news - gathering , information - sharing and social action is properly developed , the great unplugged will be left in limbo , sitting in pubs fretting about their declining communities and lost relatives .
Mark Dodson , head of regional media at the Guardian Media Group , is exercised by the possible disenfranchisement of the most vulnerable section of society .
" A whole swath of the population will not be catered for by this so - called revolution , " he says .
" The people who can least afford to be connected to the new world are also those keenest on being involved in their local communities .
Everybody has a right to be informed locally .
Local news should not be means - tested . "
He conjures up a vision of a group of middle - class bloggers , obsessed by a series of single issues , pursuing them to the exclusion of what really matters to the wider community .
A valid point , perhaps , but one weakened by the fact that , in order to stay in profit , he recently announced that the group ( which also owns this paper ) was cutting 245 jobs in the north - west and south - east of England , shedding 113 journalists ( including 39 on the Manchester Evening News ) , shutting 22 local offices serving its weekly titles in and around Manchester , and closing the Esher News & Mail and the Aldershot Mail , as well as reducing the Reading Evening Post from daily to bi-weekly publication from the summer .
That announcement led GMG journalists in Manchester to take out an advertisement in this paper on Tuesday complaining of " the decimation of a great regional newspaper in the city which was the birthplace of the Guardian " and appealing to the Scott Trust , which oversees GMG , to reconsider the redundancies .
Dodson is sure the Manchester Evening News will still exist in 10 years , but says it will have changed character .
" It will look fundamentally different from the way it does now , " he says .
" It 'll be a different kind of product : it could be totally free , or part - paid and part - free ; it could be two days a week , or three days a week , or weekly .
There 'll be a product that serves Manchester , serves it properly and is of high quality , but what it will look like ... "
The sentence trails away .
" It 'll be a mixture of products that serve the community , and I expect to see the same in Birmingham , Glasgow and other places as well .
You have to be totally open - minded , because three years ago no one would have believed we would be in this position . "
This is not yet a requiem for papers , and anyone who tells you they know when they will die is fibbing .
Even at what we have to assume is the bottom ( or close to the bottom ) of the deepest recession since the 1930s , most local papers are still making a profit , admittedly because they have shed many good journalists and other staff .
The Tindle Group , run by the redoubtable 82 - year - old Sir Ray Tindle , has lost virtually no one from its widely distributed 900 staff , yet he insists his network of 230 " hyper- local " titles ( which includes such glories as the Barry Gem , the Ceredigion Business News , the Faringdon Folly and Diary , the Forest of Dean Prime of Life , the Hay - on - Wye Express and the Wiveliscombe Messenger ) is holding its own .
On the day we meet at his office in Farnham , Surrey , where I get a tour of the Farnham Herald and lunch in the boardroom , he has just bought four troubled papers in Devon .
Times are tough : the Herald 's advertising in key sectors has halved .
But Tindle - who , after surviving throat cancer in the 1990s , has to keep his thumb pressed against his voice box to speak - is undaunted .
Churchill is his hero , and his words are couched in the same cadences : " We 've been though quite a few recessions and two world wars .
Our oldest papers were there before Napoleon ! "
He says he has never - and will never - close a paper , and loves to tell the story of the way he saved the Tenby Observer in 1978 .
" I told the staff I would buy it , provided they could bring it out by Friday morning so there was no gap , " he tells me , chortling .
" They said , ' We 'll do it . '
I said , ' But I want no news from outside Tenby .
Cut out Haverfordwest , cut out Milford Haven , cut out Pembroke Dock .
I do n't want to know .
Every line must be about Tenby .
The circulation went up from 3,700 to 6,000 - odd ; the paper went from a loss of £ 50,000 to a profit of £ 140,000 . "
Tindle looks through the printout on his desk .
" The Tenby Observer has made £ 108,605 in this financial year , and that 's in a recession ! " he proclaims .
" Yet the paper had been dead for three days when I resuscitated it . "
The debt - laden corporations could learn a thing or two from Tindle , who says he has never borrowed a penny .
The plaque on the wall of his reception in Farnham reads : " The Tindle Group of 200 newspapers and radio stations was built by launch and purchase from absolutely nothing apart from the £ 300 given to a soldier at the end of the second world war , and by the dedication of loyal staff . "
Personal mythologising it may be , but the staff tend to stay with him for a lifetime - Corina Larby , chief reporter at the Farnham Herald , has been with the paper " since God was a boy " , or 1973 to be precise - even though the salaries are very low .
That loyalty is now being repaid , though job cuts are not completely ruled out .
The group has just announced a pay freeze but , before that announcement , he showed me a letter from the NUJ chapel at one of his home counties papers saying it had agreed to ask for no pay rise this year , so grateful were its members to hold on to their jobs .
Tindle 's papers , serving small communities and with , for the most part , low overheads , are likely to be around for a generation or more , though it is far from clear what happens when this Churchillian figure dies .
The great morning dailies , with resounding names and pathetic sales , could be gone in a few years , unless some rich businessman fancies them as a trophy .
Meanwhile , the new decentralised , decorporatised media models will be emerging .
The revolution may not be televised , but it will be analysed , mocked , videoed and remorselessly blogged about on a wide variety of local news and crowd - sourcing websites .
Even Long Eaton now has a web replacement for the Advertiser .
Former railwayman Tony Fountain , who is 57 , has added news to his existing What 's On in Long Eaton site , and trails round the streets looking for stories .
His site is not yet the New York Times , but I like the fact he publishes poems by local people - newspapers have always despised unsolicited poems - and there is no denying his passion .
He plans to start a births , marriages and deaths column , which may bring some comfort to Brian Keen .
In 20 years ' time , perhaps this site will be magnificent , with local people using it to work together to smarten up their town .
There will also be sections in Polish , Russian , Lithuanian and Ukrainian , and thirtysomethings might have heard of it .
At the Birmingham Mail , I meet a thoughtful young reporter called Paul Bradley , a 26 - year - old who joined the paper as a trainee two years ago on £ 10,000 a year .
Last week he came back from Basra , where he had been tracking the Queen 's Royal Hussars , which draws many of its recruits from the Midlands .
During his time in Iraq , he had written three differently angled stories for the Mail , Post and Mercury .
On another visit to Basra last autumn , he wrote stories , blogged , took photographs and made a video .
Or at least tried to : in a war zone , Trinity Mirror 's expectations of what the modern , multi-platformed , multimedia journalist can achieve seem a little optimistic .
I find Bradley interesting because he has opted to enter this profession at a time of such uncertainty , when all the media rules are being rewritten .
" I think it will take 20 years for things to settle down enough for people to be able to breathe easily again , " says Paul Bradshaw at Birmingham City University .
How does young , mustard - keen but far from misty - eyed Bradley feel about being in on the start of a revolution ?
" I suppose you see the brave new world , but brave new world that 's going where exactly ? " he says .
" I can do all the skills , I can do the videoing , I can take the not - very - good photos , I can file for three different papers .
But are those papers going to be around in five years ' time for me to continue working for them , or am I going to have to look for a job abroad because they can't work out how to get the advertising ? "
Does that panic him ?
" You 've just got to have some kind of faith that someone , somewhere knows what 's going on and has some kind of plan .
There 's still a thirst for news ; there 's still a demand for good journalism . "
The bad news is that , despite online guru Bradshaw 's optimism about newspaper visionaries , no one does seem to have a plan .
Barry Fitzpatrick , head of publishing at the National Union of Journalists and a man currently trying to put sandbags around organisations that are leaking jobs all over the place , puts it well : " At the moment , regional managing directors are like corks bobbing around in a stormy sea .
They 're not actually steering anything ; they have no business plan other than cuts , and inevitably if that 's the only strategy you have , quality suffers .
They try to make out there 's been no damage done , or it's a better product , but we all know it 's a lot worse . "
The good news is that the Birmingham Mail and Sunday Mercury , Bradley 's current employer , surely will still be around in five years ' time , though it would be sensible if they started reaching out beyond their white working - class heartlands given the nature of the Midlands demographic .
And , in the longer term , if someone like Bradley could only join forces with railwayman - turned - web enthusiast Tony Fountain in Long Eaton - which should n't be much more dangerous than Basra , except perhaps on a Saturday night - I 'm convinced the town would have a journalistic vehicle far more powerful than the old stripped - down , clapped - out Long Eaton Advertiser .
Local advertisers and well - wishers would flock to it ; maybe the government could start an Arts Council - type fund to facilitate local news - gathering .
And then Long Eaton could say it was in at the rebirth not just of local journalism , but of a revitalised civic life .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration put the nation ’s biggest banks on notice Monday that the government could become their biggest shareholder if regulators decide they are not strong enough to weather a deeper - than - expected downturn in the economy .
In an unexpectedly assertive joint statement , the Treasury Department , Federal Reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies announced that the government might end up demanding a direct ownership stake in major banks after they undergo a tough evaluation of their strength , which is to begin shortly .
“ The capital needs of major U.S. banking institutions will be evaluated under a more challenging economic environment , ” the administration said .
“ Should that assessment indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted , ” it continued , the banks could be required to give the government a right to acquire common shares , with voting rights .
The statement came as federal regulators confirmed that they were in discussions with Citigroup over precisely that kind of swap .
Citigroup , which has received $ 45 billion in direct assistance and given the Treasury nonvoting preferred shares that pay a guaranteed dividend  is negotiating to swap the preferred shares for common shares that would give the government a stake as high as 40 percent .
ABC shocked that average Americans come to the defense of gays
You homophobic Americans just are n’t following the script that ABC News expects you to follow .
Once again , the network ’s bigoted “ What Would You Do ? ” program staged a phony scene designed to demonstrate that regular Americans as the worst sort of jerks .
They set up their cameras in a sports bar and had two gay actors portray flaming homosexuals .
Then they planted planted other actors to heckle them .
Uh-oh .
Instead of proving that Americans hate gays , the bars patrons ejected the heckler and defended the gay couple ’s right to be in “ their ” bar .
ABC had suggested anyone who objected to the gay displays of public affection were “ intolerant of the gay lifestyle . ”
Instead , their hidden cameras proved that the average American will come to the defense of anyone ’s whose rights are begin taken away — straight or gay or who knows what .
Now give us a big kiss , ABC , and say you ’re sorry .

This is the same A.I.G. that , unable to honor its promises to pay off other financial institutions when bonds default , has already received $ 150 billion in aid and just got a commitment for $ 30 billion more .
The truth is that the Bernanke - Geithner plan  the plan the administration keeps floating , in slightly different versions  is n’t going to fly .
Take the plan ’s latest incarnation : a proposal to make low - interest loans to private investors willing to buy up troubled assets .
This would certainly drive up the price of toxic waste because it would offer a heads - you - win , tails - we - lose proposition .
As described , the plan would let investors profit if asset prices went up but just walk away if prices fell substantially .
But would it be enough to make the banking system healthy ?
No .
Think of it this way : by using taxpayer funds to subsidize the prices of toxic waste , the administration would shower benefits on everyone who made the mistake of buying the stuff .
Some of those benefits would trickle down to where they ’re needed , shoring up the balance sheets of key financial institutions .
But most of the benefit would go to people who do n’t need or deserve to be rescued .
And this means that the government would have to lay out trillions of dollars to bring the financial system back to health , which would , in turn , both ensure a fierce public outcry and add to already serious concerns about the deficit .
( Yes , even strong advocates of fiscal stimulus like yours truly worry about red ink . )
Realistically , it ’s just not going to happen .
So why has this zombie idea  it keeps being killed , but it keeps coming back  taken such a powerful grip ?
The answer , I fear , is that officials still are n’t willing to face the facts .
They do n’t want to face up to the dire state of major financial institutions because it ’s very hard to rescue an essentially insolvent bank without , at least temporarily , taking it over .
And temporary nationalization is still , apparently , considered unthinkable .
But this refusal to face the facts means , in practice , an absence of action .
And I share the president ’s fears : inaction could result in an economy that sputters along , not for months or years , but for a decade or more .
The race to write global warming legislation continues this week with two House hearings on how to help Americans cope with the higher energy costs that inevitably would result from a new U.S. climate policy .
In almost simultaneous hearings Thursday morning , the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee will study different proposals designed to help low - and moderate - income households deal with the projected price increases on energy and energy - intensive goods and services that comes from implementation of a cap - and - trade program .
President Obama and the Democrat - led Congress are trying to craft legislation this year that would set up a program requiring mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Government studies conclude that for a new U.S. climate law to work , it must stem the demand for carbon - based energy by increasing prices -- not exactly the most politically popular thing to do during an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression .
Low and middle - income households would face a much greater economic burden from a new global warming law compared with richer Americans because they spend a larger proportion of their budgets on energy , according to testimony delivered last summer by Peter Orszag , Obama 's White House budget chief who at the time was director of the Congressional Budget Office .
But that economic reality is not stopping Obama and his allies on Capitol Hill from pushing for climate legislation , in large part due to growing international demands for U.S. leadership on the issue and mounting scientific warnings about accelerated global warming .
In his budget proposal released last month , Obama spelled out the broad outlines of a cap - and - trade approach that links his signature environmental agenda item to tax relief for Americans .
Under Obama 's plan , the government would auction off all of the emission credits , generating at least $ 650 billion in cumulative government revenue by 2019 .
The president 's budget would then dedicate $ 15 billion per year to fund the " clean " energy technologies needed to transform away from a fossil fuel - based economy .
And it also would set aside $ 65 billion of the auction revenue for tax cuts to middle - income Americans .
Additional auction proceeds would also " be used to further compensate the public , " the White House said .
Lead authors of this year 's House and Senate climate legislation have not said yet how they will respond to Obama 's call for a 100 percent auction or the president 's ideas for where to send such revenue .
Last year , House Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey ( D - Md. ) wrote a cap - and - trade plan that would have sold 94 percent of the program 's allowances with the proceeds directed toward many of the same concepts supported by Obama , including tax cuts for low - and middle - income Americans , energy technology research , energy efficiency and adaptation .
Senate cap - and - trade legislation debated last summer on the floor also tried to help low - and middle - income Americans with tax credits .
Sponsors of that bill estimated $ 911 billion over a roughly 40 - year period for consumers to help with their energy costs and also to fund energy efficiency projects .
' The greatest political challenge '
CBO estimates from last year 's Senate climate debate suggest the permits from a cap - and - trade system could raise around $ 50 billion in the initial years of its operation and up to $ 300 billion a year by 2020 .
Those are funds that lawmakers face the perilous task of trying to divide up among a raft of competing interests , from low - carbon technology deployment to wildlife adaptation and tax relief for low - and middle - income Americans .
Powerful interests are lined up behind many of the different ideas for how to distribute the allowances , let alone what to do with the new government revenue if it did go with an auction .
" The enormous value of the allowances makes this high - stakes issue perhaps the greatest political challenge in designing climate policy , " according to a July 2008 report by Resources for the Future , a nonpartisan think tank .
For starters , electric utility companies insist that they should be given emission credits for free to help them compensate shareholders for the higher operation costs .
Power plants produce about 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse emissions .
Supporters for the free allowance approach include the Edison Electric Institute and Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - Va. ) , the former chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the climate bill .
In an interview , Boucher recalled Congress ' decision in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments to give power plants free credits for sulfur dioxide .
" My preference is we follow the process that we know works , and this is the free allocation process , " he said .
To help protect consumers , the electric utility companies now support the allowances being given to retail local distribution companies that deliver electricity to households -- an approach long advocated by the National Commission on Energy Policy , the California Market Advisory Commission and the Natural Resources Defense Council .
But the utility companies face growing opposition to getting any of their credits for free .
Advocates for a 100 percent auction recall that they were often ridiculed as the climate policy debate lurched through the Bush administration .
They now claim traction spawned in large part by Obama , who advocated for their approach during last year 's presidential campaign .
" I feel like the pendulum is swinging very , very fast , " said Stephen Smith , a 100 percent auction supporter and the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy .
In testimony last week before the House Budget Committee , Orszag warned of corporate windfall profits should Congress write cap - and - trade legislation without an auction .
" If you did n't auction the permits it would represent the largest corporate welfare program that has even been enacted in the history of the United States , " Orszag said .
" All of the evidence suggests that what would occur is that corporate profits would increase by approximately the value of the permits . "
Even House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , a longstanding skeptic of global warming science , acknowledged that he sees the reasoning behind a complete auction of the emission credits .
" If you 're going to do it , I support the auction because I think that 's more equitable , " Barton said last week in an interview .
" The whole point of it is to try to reduce the amount of what it is that 's being auctioned .
And the way to do that is to charge for it , and not give it away . "
What to do with the revenue ?
When it comes to helping low - and middle - income Americans , supporters for a 100 percent auction are divided about what to do with the revenue .
Peter Barnes , an environmental entrepreneur and the founder of the Working Assets long - distance telephone service , calls for a " cap and dividend " approach .
Under Barnes ' system , all of the auction revenue would be returned to U.S. households on a per capita basis .
Barnes has likened his idea to the Alaska Permanent Fund -- the program that sends residents annual checks from oil and gas proceeds .
But critics of Barnes ' plan warn that it would require use of all 100 percent of the emission allowances , a prospect unlikely to occur given competing demands for the credits .
And it also would come with new administrative burdens , especially for people without bank accounts or who do not file income taxes .
Another high - profile proposal to offset higher energy costs comes from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a Washington - based group that projects a 15 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions equals about a $ 750 increase every year in energy bills per household .
To compensate about 60 million of the poorest Americans , the center advocates returning about 14 percent of the cap and trade 's auction funds through direct deposits onto electronic debit cards similar to what states now use for food stamps and other low - income assistance programs .
" The rebates would equal the loss in purchasing power " for a family of three making below $ 27,500 , the group said in Feb. 19 white paper ( pdf ) .
For other low - and middle - income Americans , the center proposes a " climate tax credit " based on the size of a family , with increases over time as the emissions cap get stronger and energy prices go up higher .
Overall , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ' plan would use about 55 percent of the total allowances .
That leaves 45 percent for other needs , including alternative energy , conservation , energy efficiency and adaptation .
The center also takes into account a CBO projection that 25 percent of the auction proceeds will need to be kept in the Treasury to make sure the climate program does not increase the federal deficit as federal revenue shrinks from other areas .
Fuzzy turf lines
Both House committees holding hearings Thursday are planning to draft climate legislation by Memorial Day , though it is unclear exactly where the lines will be drawn in terms of which panel takes on which set of issues .
Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) has more pieces of a climate bill under his panel 's jurisdiction than Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) , said Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D - Texas ) , a senior member on Rangel 's panel .
But Doggett added , " We believe it 's the mechanics for raising revenue and allocation of revenue that fits in our committee . "
Waxman and Rangel have pledged to work together when it comes to bill writing , a position echoed by many of the Democrats on the two committees .
" I think the obstacles are so great and so many that this is not the time for any kind of differences over turf , " Doggett said .
" It 's a time to work together and come together . "
Several other House committees have also expressed interest in the climate bill as it proceeds to a first - ever floor vote later this year , including the Agriculture , Appropriations , Banking , Foreign Relations and Natural Resources committees .
" We 're going to want to know how that 's going to work , " Rep. Norm Dicks ( D - Wash . ) , the chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee , said last week .
" We 'll definitely want to be involved in that . "
Of course , the political obstacles that House Democrats face in crafting a successful climate bill go well beyond jurisdiction .
Regional , racial and other demographic issues are guaranteed to surface as the global warming debate unfolds , forcing sponsors to take into the economic implications of a new climate program that mandates emission cuts over the next several decades .
" People do n't feed families over a generation , " said Rep. Artur Davis ( D - Ala . ) , a member of the moderate New Democrat Coalition .
" People do n't feed their families based on a commensurate job rate in California .
They feed their families based on their job and the next paycheck .
So I think we 'll be very sensitive to those concerns . "
Energy and Commerce schedule : The Energy and Environment Subcommittee hearing is Thursday , March 12 , at 9:30 a.m. in 2322 Rayburn .
Ways and Means schedule :
The committee hearing is Thursday , March 12 , at 10 a.m. in B - 318 Rayburn .
Witnesses : TBA for both hearings .

Danger threatens the bespectacled brethren in their anoraks , who hang about on railway platforms with their spiral - back notebooks and sandwiches in polythene bags .
The train company National Express is clamping down on people boarding trains without tickets , which union leaders say means trainspotters will be barred from their favourite platforms .
But the company claimed yesterday that the clampdown need not affect trainspotters , who will be able to use platform tickets to pursue their hobby .
Gerry Doherty , the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staff Association ( TSSA ) , pointed out that platform tickets had not been offered for sale since railways were privatised more than 10 years ago .
He accused National Express of having no respect for a tradition almost as old as the railways .
" Sir John Betjeman will be turning in his grave , " he said .
" It means that the barbarians have finally taken over the industry .
Only people with no sense of history would commit such an act of mindless vandalism .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Young trainspotters have been with us since Victorian times .
Now National Express are saying they should be banned because they are a nuisance .
These people know the price of everything and the value of nothing .
They do not respect the industry or its values .
They should go back to running buses .
" One of National Express 's managers actually told one of our reps that trainspotters were now a security issue .
Do they think a 10 - year - old boy with a pencil and notebook is in possession of a dangerous weapon ?
You do wonder what planet these people are on sometimes . "
The TSSA , which represents 20,000 clerical and professional staff on the railways , has promised to contact the chief constable of the British Transport Police to ask him to enforce guidelines introduced during the privatisation that guaranteed trainspotters access to railway stations .
National Express said it was obliged to tackle the problem of people travelling without paying , and that one of the most effective deterrents is electronic gates which prevent people without tickets from getting on to the platform .
A spokesman said : " This is more mischief - making by the unions .
Platform passes will be issued to people , including our trainspotters , who wish to go on to the platforms but are n't travelling .
Gating is part of a contractual agreement with the Government .
Gating will prevent fraudulent ticketless travel and protect revenue .
This substantial lost revenue will be channelled back into the rail industry including investment in enhanced facilities . "
Well - known former trainspotters include Michael Palin , the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke , W H Auden , who in 1935 wrote the poem Night Train , and Betjeman , whose bronze statue adorns St Pancras station , which he saved from demolition .

Maritime experts were given a rare glimpse of the underlying capabilities of the Chinese navy on Sunday , when crewmen involved in a stand - off with a US surveillance ship in the South China Sea revealed the fleet 's previously hidden firepower .
The exposure came as the American vessel USNS Impeccable was attempting to defend itself against what the Pentagon claimed was co-ordinated harassment and aggression from five Chinese ships .
Being unarmed , the Impeccable turned its fire water hoses against two of the Chinese vessels that had come within 50 feet in a threatening posture .
Then , the Pentagon records in the admirably restrained language of international diplomacy , " the Chinese crew members disrobed to their underwear and continued closing to within 25 feet . "
In the annals of great naval battles , the contretemps may not rank alongside Trafalgar or Jutland .
But it must be a contender for this year 's award for naked aggression .
The Chinese Foreign ministry has remained silent on the incident , which in the circumstances is probably sensible .
According to the Pentagon , the targetting of the Impeccable came at the end of several days in which Chinese naval vessels had been stepping up their harassment in international waters .
The Pentagon insisted the Impeccable was engaged in " routine " and legal operations in international waters .
" The Chinese navy pursues peace and safeguards the security of the country , " navy deputy chief of staff Major General Zhang Deshun told China Daily .
Still , the incident has raised alarm as it illustrated how far the Chinese are prepared to go in the name of " defensive " tactics .
Right down to their underpants .
Imagine if the Nazis had bombed New York City the same way they bombed London .
Imagine if they had a fleet of aircraft carriers rivaling , at least , Japan ’s fleet .
Imagine if they fielded a jet fighter in large numbers well before D - Day .
Imagine that they had guided missiles , an assault rifle like the AK - 47 and ( gulp ) “ the bomb . ”
Well , you do n’t have to imagine , because Nazi Germany developed many weapons systems and programs that could — COULD — have been game changers had they been completed , completed sooner , or fielded in large numbers .
These 10 weapons listed below show just how close - run WWII was .
Fortunately , the weapons were never fully developed , built in small numbers or deployed too late to seriously affect the course of the war .
Nazi politics , strategic materials shortages , the Allied bombing campaign , production problems and even boneheaded interference from Hitler himself fortunately relegated these systems to mere idle speculation , instead of the tools that won the war for the Nazis .
But it boggles the mind to imagine what might have happened if Hitler did n’t go to war in 1939 , but waited several more years .
10 “ The bom b ”
It ’s a matter of minor debate concerning how far along the Germans were in developing an atomic bomb before Allied bombers wiped out the efforts for good .
But make no mistake , they were trying to build one .
Could you imagine Hitler having atomic bombs ?
America , of course , developed the atomic bomb first — to be used initially against Germany .
This is number 10 rather than number one because everything else on this list actually existed , either as prototypes or as operational weapons .
9 The Focke Achgelis Fa 223 helicopter
The “ Dragon ” helicopter was invented some time before the war , but the Germans were the first ones to actually put a whirlybird into production .
The Fa-223 was the latest in Focke ’s helicopter designs and was a good aircraft .
And , for once , interference from Nazi bigwigs actually only played a minor part in production and deployment .
Twenty examples were built by the winter of 1942 - 43 when Allied bombers plastered the only factory making them .
Attempts to resume production failed , and resources were directed to more critical systems .
But imagine if the Nazis had succeeded in deploying such an aircraft in large numbers before the war turned against them .
The clip is from Military Channel ’s Top Ten Helicopters .
Fascinating fact :
When German paratroopers rescued Mussolini in 1943 , they were supposed to go in using a Fa 223 .
But the helicopter developed engine trouble , and the troopers used gliders instead .
8 He -100 fighter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cGC47uHwZk
In March 1939 , Luftwaffe pilot Hans Dieterle achieved an absolute average speed record of 463.9 mph , the last such speed record set before the war .
His aircraft was the Heinkel He -100 V8 , a fighter prototype .
Although possessing excellent flight characteristics ( speed , dive , maneuverability , range , etc. ) the He-100 never entered production .
Nazi officials decided to stick with the Messerschmitt BF - 109 as its primary fighter and ordered Heinkel to focus on making bombers .
Aviation enthusiasts and historians disagree as to why the He-100 died : Was it politics , poor decisions by Heinkel , production problems or something else ?
The He-100 prototypes were retired or sold to other nations , especially Japan , whose decent mid-war Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter — the only non-radial fighter Japan fielded — was based on the He-100 .
Why could this have been a game - changer ?
Because had the Nazis and Heinkel gone ahead with production of this fighter , which was supposedly superior to even the hot Focke Wulf FW - 190 introduced later in the war , events such as the Battle of Britain could have turned out much differently .
The He -100 , for example , had much greater range than the 109 and was far superior to the Me-110 , and could have easily fended off British fighters trying to get at German bombers .
Note :
The clip appears to be a Japanese film of Dieterle ’s record flight .
7 Type XXI U - boat
The U - boats ( submarines ) used in World War II were superior in every way to their WWI counterparts , and the Type XXI vessel outclassed every other submarine of every navy .
The Type XXI , dubbed the Elektoboote , was the first operational submarine designed to run totally submerged for extended periods — meaning , far longer than the submerged operational viability of the Type VIIC , the most numerous U - boat type .
The Elektroboote could stalk Allied ships with far more impunity than earlier models thanks to its greatly improved batteries and “ stealth ” modifications that made it difficult to detect by Allied sonar .
The type ’s weapons systems were superior , including hydraulically - loaded torpedoes and torpedoes aimed by sonar , which eliminated the need to raise the U - boat to periscope depth for attack .
Between 1943 and 1945 , German shipyards built 118 Type XXI boats .
But only four were combat - ready by the time the Germans surrendered , and only one ever went on patrol .
Boneheaded production decisions , including those by Albert Speer , and Allied bombing prevented this deadly boat from ever becoming a menace .
6 Strategic bombers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOjvZXSok4g
After its successful debut in the Spanish Civil War , the Luftwaffe set on a strategy of using only tactical bombers ( light , medium and dive bombers ) , eschewing the four - engine heavy bombers being developed in England and America .
This concentration on highly vulnerable and lightly armed bombers meant that the Luftwaffe never had a true strategic heavy bomber .
Although in possession of some four - and six - engine planes at war ’s start , none was truly suitable for strategic bombing .
Luftwaffe attempts to finally build long - range city - killers were either disasters or abandoned .
The Heinkel He -177 , the only Luftwaffe strategic bomber to enter into production , was a disastrous failure .
It was a flawed four - engine design featuring two engines mounted in tandem on each wing , which frequently cased fires .
Hitler also demanded that massive plane be capable of dive - bombing , which was totally wacky , and contributed to its serious problems .
Along the same lines was the “ New York bomber ” program , which featured two aircraft , the Junkers Ju-290 and the Messerschmitt Me-264 , with designs to bomb New York City .
But the program never went beyond the prototype stage .
The few models of the decent Ju-290 were used not as bombers but long - range couriers between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan late in the war .
Meanwhile , one complete Me-264 , which curiously looked like the American B - 29 Super Fortress , was completed and another two were under construction when the “ New York bomber ” program was abandoned permanently .
The clip , which does n’t have sound , is of a J - 290 .
5 Heinkel He - 219 “ Owl ” night fighter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FLEnG07pXE
This superb , purpose - built , 2 - engine night fighter was the best Axis night fighter of the war , and one of the finest piston aircraft made prior to the jet age .
Just one He -219 downed 25 Allied bombers in a matter of * days * during the prototype period ; the plane was that good .
While possessing excellent flight characteristics , formidable weaponry and radar guidance , the plane was somewhat complex to build .
Heinkel only built a few hundred , partially because they were ordered to concentrate on bombers .
Instead , the Luftwaffe relied on modifying existing aircraft , namely Me-110s and Junkers Ju-88s .
In far larger numbers , the He-219 could have brought nighttime RAF bombing operations to a close .
The clip , which does n’t have sound , appears to be of a captured He -219 with USA markings .
4 Graf Zeppelin aircraft carrier
The Kriegsmarine ( German navy ) never had an aircraft carrier during WWII , but it came close .
In 1935 , Hitler deemed that the Kriegsmarine would build aircraft carriers .
At this point in naval history , the battleship was still the primary naval vessel , and aircraft carriers something of a novelty ; therefore , naval treaties concentrated on limiting battleship tonnage .
In 1937 , shipbuilders laid the keel for the 33,500 - tonne Graf Zeppelin and launched her the next year .
However , she was never completed .
Herman Goering thought that the carrier would intrude on the duties of his Luftwaffe , and Admiral Karl Doenitz championed U - Boats over surface vessels .
Such territorial fights and the increasing shortage of war materials led to her abandonment at 80 % completion .
The Soviets captured the Graf Zeppelin in 1945 , but it was n’t learned until 2006 that the Soviets used her for target practice and sank her in 1947 .
3 V - 2 and other guided weapons
Germany employed many radio - controlled weapons during the latter half of the war , including the V - 1 Buzz bomb , a slow , primitive cruise missile that was easy to shoot down .
Radio - controlled air - to - surface missiles , such as the Henschel Hs 293 guided bomb , were a hassle for Allied shipping until techs found ways to jam the signals .
Of all the German radio - controlled weapons , the V - 2 ballistic missile was the most successful .
However , the Nazis used the V - 2 primarily to terrorize London , Antwerp and elsewhere during the last full year of the war .
Much more powerful and faster than the V - 1 “ buzz bomb , ” the Hs - 293 and the “ Mistel ” ( an old bomber packed with explosives literally flown by remote to a target ) , the V - 2 was quite difficult to shoot down and packed a powerful explosive punch .
One wonders what could have happened if the Germans had used such weapons exclusively against Allied troops instead of civilians .
Considering that by summer 1944 the Allies had near total air domination in the west and the Soviets were closing hard from the east , such a weapon could have proven costly to the Allies — and cheaper than sending in fighters and bombers .
With a mobile launch platform and a high - speed flight , the V - 2 could — COULD — have gone a long way to negating Allied air power .
But almost all of the 10,000 V - 2s launched directly targeted civilians .
2 Sturmgewehr StG - 44 assault rifle
Germany fielded many powerful weapons systems for the Wehrmacht , including the fearsome Tiger and Panther tanks and the 88 - mm cannon .
( My wife ’s late grandpa had many stories about being fired on by those % # [ email protected ] !
88s . )
The Wehrmacht ’s small arms inventory was good , though a little unwieldy .
The basic German soldier went to war equipped with the Karabiner Kar98 , an old but powerful and reliable bolt - action rifle with a 5 - shot cartridge .
( The Kar98 is still in use ! )
Elite German troops , such as the paratroopers , as well as the SS and Gestapo , were often equipped with the MP - 40 or 41 machine pistol / submachine gun .
German armories , however , created a very powerful and versatile submachine gun * almost * akin to the famed postwar Soviet AK - 47 .
In trained hands , the StG - 44 could lay down a devastating hail of 7.92 mm bullets ( the same as used by the Kar98 ) , and provided the power of the Kar98 and up - close versatility of the MP - 40 .
During the last year - and - a - half of the war , they proved their effectiveness , so much so that when Hitler asked his generals in July 1944 what they needed , one of them exclaimed , “ More of these rifles ! ”
However , the StG - 44 came too late in the war to have any appreciable effect .
East German police units used them as late as the early 1960s .
The clip is from Military channel ’s Top Ten Combat Rifles .
1 Messerschmitt Me-262 “ Swallow ”
The Me-262 was the world ’s first operational jet fighter .
Despite frequent engine problems , the Me-262 was a fast and deadly aircraft , and outpaced almost all Allied fighters ( only the P - 51D Mustang could match it . )
It could have gone operational in the fall of 1943 , when the war was still pretty much in the balance .
At that time , the Luftwaffe still had not lost most of its veteran pilots and Allied escort fighters could not penetrate too far into the Reich .
The Me-262 could have swept Allied bombers and fighters from the sky , giving Germany critical air dominance once more .
Fortunately for the world , Hitler himself demanded that the new fighter aircraft be modified for dive - bombing use — a purpose for which it was not designed .
This meddling delayed construction and deployment for more than a year .
By the time the Me-262 took to the skies operationally in late 1944 , it was far too late .
The clip shows a restored Me -262 at a 2006 air show in Berlin .
In Afghanistan , 300 brave women marched to demand a measure of equal rights , defying a furious mob of about 1,000 people who spat , threw stones and called the women “ whores . ”
The marchers asserted that a woman should not need her husband ’s consent to go to school or work outside the home .
In Pakistan , the Taliban flogged a teenage girl in front of a crowd , as two men held her face down in the dirt .
A video shows the girl , whose “ crime ” may have been to go out of her house alone , crying piteously that she will never break the rules again .
Muslim fundamentalists damage Islam far more than any number of Danish cartoonists ever could , for it ’s inevitably the extremists who capture the world ’s attention .
But there is the beginning of an intellectual reform movement in the Islamic world , and one window into this awakening was an international conference this week at the University of Notre Dame on the latest scholarship about the Koran .
“ We ’re experiencing right now in Koranic studies a rise of interest analogous to the rise of critical Bible studies in the 19th century , ” said Gabriel Said Reynolds , a Notre Dame professor and organizer of the conference .
In honor of National Pet Week and Walmart ’s recent service animal policy change we ’re declaring Saturday May 9th “ Bring Your Pet to Walmart Day ” .
The new policy makes it much easier to bring a service animal ( or any other animal for that matter ) into a Walmart .
“ What is a service animal ? ” you ask .
Well according to Walmart ’s policy :
Service animals are individually trained to work or perform tasks for individuals with disabilities .
Service animals are not always dogs ; other animals may assist people with disabilities .
Service animals come in all breeds and sizes , may be trained either by an organization or by an individual with a disability , and need not be certified or licensed .
Service animals do not always have a harness , a sign , or a symbol indicating that they are service animals .
The new policy only allows Walmart employees to ask the owner a single question , it can be asked only once , and according to the policy that question is :
Is this a service animal required because of a disability ?
Not only can the question only be asked once , but the only employees allowed to ask that question is the Greeter , the Manager , or ( if the manager is not present ) an Assistant Manager .
So , if you can slip past the 84 year old man at the door , you might never hear that question at all .
Here are a few service animals you might want to bring along to Walmart :
Translator Parrot – Mine speaks Mandarin .
Helper Monkey –
He can grab things from high places , flip light switches and rub your feet when they ’re sore .
( Homer Simpson can tell you all about it in the video at the bottom of the page . )
Pack Mule –
For those that have a fear of shopping carts , bring along your mule to handle your purchases .
Golden Retriever –
For the lazy , this will retrieve your merchandise from the aisles for you , while you wait at the McDonald’s .
Sanitation Dog –
As a germaphobe , you ca n’t really trust the paper towel dispenser , wiping your hands on your dog as you exit the bathroom is a requirement .
Stress Relieving Seal – Anyone who has ever spent any time in Walmart can understand the need for a little clubbing .
Ribbit Alert Frog – Mine emits a high pitched shriek when THE SASQUATCH !
is approaching , that guy freaks me out .
Lactating Cow –
For the lactose deficient .
Security Tiger –
For those that are unable to protect themselves against white trash with shopping carts .
And anything else you can come up with …
You might argue that those are n’t service animals because those are n’t disabilities , but Monolingualism , or living life in debilitating fear of the THE SASQUATCH ! , sound like disabilities to me .
Walmart changed this policy due to a lawsuit brought by the United States Government over violations of the ADA ( Americans with Disabilities Act ) .
This looks like another case of a big company doing something wrong and then the courts ( in this case the settlement ) trying to correct the problem , but going a bit too far .
“ Contents may be hot ” anyone ?
We ’ll see you all at Walmart on Saturday , I ’ll be there with my seeing eye cats .
Let us know in the comments section what service animal you will be bringing .
Haskell has been my favorite programming language in the past month , and for good reason .
Its ( purely ) functional and has strong , static typing .
The language feels more graceful to me , where design and function are key .
It is a joy to program in and I would love to keep exploring it .
On my path to learning a new language , I usually try to implement something to get some real - world experience .
In this instance , I have chosen to implement an Open AIM client .
AIM operates on the legacy TOC ( text based ) protocol , or the feature full OSCAR protocol , which is what most AIM clients use .
I decided that OSCAR would be more fun to do , especially with the three step login process .
The client that I wrote is very simple – handles login to AIM and just sits there .
It can get IM ’s though .
The bulk of the AIM client that I enjoyed writing was the protocol handlers , and implementing the login process .
It would be very easy to extend this client to be a bot , if you are looking for a practical use for it .
For me , the learning experience is enough .
The main function is listed below .
start_aim = do putStrLn " Haskell AIM Client - OSCAR Protocol " appKey <- getAppKey screenName <- getScreenName password <- get Password let clientInfo = AIMClientInfo 1 " HaskellClient " appKey result <- aim_open_auth clientInfo screenName password case result of Just info -> do boss_result <- aim_boss_session clientInfo info case boss_result of Just si -> aim_oscar_login si Nothing -> putStrLn " Unable to authenticate with BOSS server . "
Nothing -> return ()
If you want to try out this AIM client , you must have an Open AIM Developer key .
The first step is to download the source and use cabal to configure , build , and install it .
# wget http://www.moostrax.com/cmoos/haim.tar.gz
# tar - xzf haim .
tar.gz # cd haim # cabal configure && cabal build && cabal install
And then run it .
# ~/.cabal/bin/haim
The output will look something like this :
Haskell AIM Client - OSCAR Protocol An Open AIM
Developer key is required : http://developer.aim.com/manageKeys.jsp
Open AIM Key > AIM Screen Name > AIM Password > Connected to AIM server .
Entered OSCAR client loop .
Login accepted by OSCAR server .
Setting up rights .
Max Watchers : 2000 Max Buddies : 1000 Max Temp Buddies : 160 Max Denies : 1000
Like I said , the client is very simple , and just sits and waits .
When you login you will see some information about your buddy list , and other AIM login data .
( CNN ) --
A few weeks ago , when violence and kidnappings along the U.S. - Mexico border were all over the news , Todd Sotkiewicz took a group of high school students to Tijuana , Mexico .
Gary Arndt traveled to Cambodia to see a temple .
He also found soldiers , but says he was n't afraid .
The teens ' parents had to be warned that the service - oriented spring break trip might go against a federal travel alert , he said .
But , in his view , the value of the experience , which involved building homes for impoverished families , trumped any perceived threat .
" These poor families really needed these houses , " said Sotkiewicz , a parent of one of the students and also the president of Lonely Planet in the Americas .
" We went down there and we took the appropriate precautions like we all should . "
While the H1N1 flu virus has stirred fears about international travel and has brought renewed attention to government travel advisories , there remains a hearty group of travelers who say such official advice does n't dictate whether they will or wo n't take a trip .
For some , voyages into warned - against places are less motivated by adrenaline and more by a genuine desire to experience the world in a new way .
Danger is part of the human experience , some of these travelers say .
It 's something that can't be avoided entirely and should be assessed by well - informed individuals , not just by governments .
" It was not a draw that there was a dangerous element to it , " Sotkiewicz said of the Mexico trip .
" The draw was that [ the students ] wanted to have a transformative experience . "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends U.S. residents avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico because of swine flu .
The U.S. State Department still has an alert out concerning violence in the country .
A spokeswoman for the CDC said travelers should follow official government guidance when making their plans .
Robert Young Pelton , an author who has traveled to 120 countries and seen 36 wars , said people can and should travel wherever they want to , regardless of warnings .
Such adventures offer intellectual stimulus and have the potential to draw meaningful connections between people , he said .
" The reason why it 's important to go to places that you dreamed of or are intensely interested in is because it matters , " he said .
" I could send you to Disney World for a week and I do n't think you would change a bit , but if I sent you to a Rwandan refugee camp , I think you would change peoples ' lives , and you would be changed by it . "
He says travel warnings , like those concerning H1N1 , are politicized .
The hysteria about this strain of flu is driven more by an irrational fear than by actual danger , he said .
" It 's a fascinating fear .
It 's not a danger , " he said of the flu .
" So when people say , ' Oh , it 's dangerous in Afghanistan , ' or , ' It 's dangerous in Mexico , ' what are they basing that on ?
They obviously have n't been there . "
Sotkiewicz said travel deals tend to pop up in destinations that are stigmatized by a health outbreak or a terrorist attack .
This was true after the Madrid , Spain , attacks , as well as the SARS and bird flu epidemics , he said .
In a statement to CNN , Expedia , the travel Web site , said a travel warning like the one for swine flu " ultimately creates travel values for consumers . "
" As the swine flu subsides in Mexico , we expect travel suppliers in the area to offer significant deals to increase demand for the region , " Expedia said .
When asked if some people might wish to travel to Mexico despite the advisory , perhaps for a hotel deal , CDC spokeswoman Shelly Diaz said travelers should heed the warning .
" Your health should come before your wallet .
There 's nothing more valuable than your health , " she said .
" We are recommending that people avoid travel to Mexico unless it 's essential .
I do n't know that a really good travel bargain makes it essential . "
Melvin Francisquini , a 31 - year - old from Miami , Florida , who is volunteering in Mexico City , said this actually would n't be a bad time to visit Mexico except everything is closed .
On Tuesday , only a handful of people were still wearing flu masks in the subway , he said .
Follow Francisquini's video posts on iReport
" Come if you 're fine with everything being closed , " he said .
" I mean , even museums are being closed , but do n't be afraid of the flu .
It 's nothing out of the ordinary . "
Avoiding Mexico specifically because of the flu is ridiculous , he said .
People who travel into potentially dangerous places seem to have their own rules for deciding what 's safe and what is n't .
Several said they factor in government warnings and news reports .
Others consider crime rates and statistics .
The trend seems to be for people to look for online information that comes directly from travelers in the country where they want to go .
These on - the - ground observations are important because U.S. news stories about foreign countries tend to focus on crime and terrorism and not what life is actually like for people , said Pelton .
" Millions of people get up every morning and go through their entire day with nothing actually happened to them , but the media will never write a story that says , ' Nothing happened , everything 's fine , ' so we tend to be inundated with stories about " violence , he said .
He added : " Yes you can order a latte in Kabul and Somalia has hotels for 40 bucks a night . "
Gary Arndt , a 39 - year - old who sold his assets and has been blogging about his world travels since 2007 , said many American travelers have a " fear of the unknown . "
Arndt was in Israel when swine flu broke out .
He said he would have no qualms about traveling to Mexico because of the swine flu .
He recently traveled to a region of Cambodia that is considered dangerous by some .
He also went to Thailand at a time when most travelers were " freaked out " by government protesters .
Prices for hotels at the time were lower because the country was emptied of tourists , he said .
" I 'm not the kind of person that is an adrenaline junkie , " he said .
" I did bungee jump once [ but ]
I 've never gone skydiving , I do n't go rock climbing .
It 's not like I want to go into these places because they 're dangerous .
" I just think the risk is often overhyped . "

So you just got your unemployment check and have a bit of free time ?
Let 's go to the movies then .
What do you want to see ?
Beats me , too .
Let 's check what 's out .
No , of course I do n't have today 's paper .
Do n't make me laugh .
I 've got my iPhone , though .
I 've got a couple of movie apps on it .
Just downloaded Fandango the other day , as a matter of fact .
I used Fandango all the time when my wife and I would go to the movies almost every Friday night .
Of course , that was before we had kids .
Good Web site , decent service .
The Fandango app for the iPhone and iPod touch is pretty solid , too .
It 's functional and convenient .
I wish it had a few more features , but the app carries out its raison d'être with aplomb .
A movie ticket app really only needs to do two things seamlessly and well :
It must let you search for movies near your location ; more important , the app must let you buy the tickets with minimum effort .
Most movie apps do a good job with the former by taking advantage of the handheld 's GPS locator function , but trip over the latter .
Fandango does both very well .
When you launch the Fandango app , you 'll see a list of movies currently playing in theaters .
When you find a movie that interests you , tap the listing and a window will pop up with information about stars , running time , and where the film is playing near you .
Most movies will have a trailer that you can watch by tapping the movie 's poster .
You can also tap the Theaters button at the bottom of the screen to browse all the features playing at your nearby multiplex .
You can save your favorite theaters , which is a nice addition for creatures of habit .
The app will show that day 's movie times , but you can also look up times days in advance .
The difference between Fandango and , say , Flixster 's Movies app ( Macworld rated 3 out of 5 mice ) is that you can enter and save your credit card information in the app itself .
Once you 've done that , buying tickets is a mere matter of a few taps .
I was generally kind to Flixster 's Movies when I reviewed it in October , but I detested the way the app walked you through buying tickets .
You ended up in Safari at Movietickets.com , trying to navigate several fields .
It 's an enormous pain .
Fandango 's solution is much simpler and more convenient .
There are a couple of clear trade - offs with Fandango 's approach , however .
First , if you save your credit card information in the app and you happen to lose your phone , somebody could enjoy a night at the movies at your expense .
( But that 's all -- the full credit card number does not display . )
Second , Fandango will only let you buy tickets from Regal Entertainment Group theaters and that 's about all .
Fandango will show you movie times for other chains , but you wo n't be able to purchase tickets .
That might be a deal - breaker for some moviegoers .
Fandango does n't have the frills and features of some other movie apps .
The app does n't link to news and reviews , show fan ratings or list this week 's box office take .
( Fandango 's Web site does . )
You can watch trailers for some current and future releases , but the app only lists attractions coming to theaters in the next week or two .
Flixster 's app , on the other hand , has trailers for movies months in advance and has a robust DVD section , too .
The bottom line : Lacking the news features of Fandango.com and putting limits on the theaters from which you can buy tickets hampers Fandango 's convenience and ease of use .
Here 's hoping any sequel to this iPhone app turns out to be better .
Fandango is compatible with any iPhone or iPod touch running the iPhone 2.2 software update .

I do n’t even know if this would ever have occurred to me if I had n’t seen it in magazines .
I usually like to poop on the rules , yet for some reason even I am feeling slightly uncomfortable about it .
I looked up from the House Beautiful Magazine at Sarah ’s house and asked her and she was 100 % “ SURE !!! ”
I ’d really love to go into someones ’ home and get smacked upside the head with this surprise in real life .
Have you done it !?
What do you think about it ?

Nawaz Sharif has been locked in a power struggle with President Zardari Pakistan opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has been placed under house arrest in the city of Lahore , his party has said .
The interior ministry told the BBC there were no curbs on Mr Sharif 's movements - police were protecting him .
Ex - prime minister Mr Sharif had planned to lead a rally in Lahore ahead of a march on the capital , Islamabad .
Police fired tear gas at protesters in Lahore .
Mr Sharif told those gathered outside his home the entire country had been turned into a " police state " .
" They have blocked all roads , they have used all sorts of unlawful tactics , " Mr Sharif told reporters on the front step of his home , Reuters news agency reported .
Mr Sharif has thrown his weight behind a nationwide " long march " by lawyers demanding the reinstatement of judges removed by the former government .
The authorities have banned rallies , citing a security threat
The demonstrators are planning to converge on the capital on Monday for a sit - in outside parliament .
But the government has set up roadblocks to seal off Islamabad and banned rallies , saying they could trigger violence .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says the campaign over the judges has become a power struggle between Mr Sharif and current President Asif Ali Zardari .
President Zardari - the widower of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto - promised to bring back the judges when he took office last year following his wife 's assassination .
Riot police surrounded Mr Sharif 's home on Saturday night before blocking all access roads and reportedly baton - charging his supporters when they came to protest .
Pervez Rasheed , a spokesman for the detained politician 's Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) , said a senior police officer had said Mr Sharif would be detained for three days .
Mr Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , also a senior politician , is said to be in hiding in the garrison city of Rawalpindi near Islamabad at a property also surrounded by police .
PML - N says a number of opposition leaders have also been placed under house arrest .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
PML - N spokesman Ahsan Iqbal told the BBC President Zardari was using " undemocratic measures ... to crack down on a very peaceful movement " .
But interior ministry chief Rehman Malik told the BBC Mr Sharif was free to go anywhere and the police outside his house were for his own protection .
" I categorically confirm no restraining orders , no arrest warrant , no house arrest .
He 's totally free to move anywhere in the country , " Mr Malik said .
He added : " We are under heavy threat of the terrorists ... and that has been conveyed to Mr Nawaz Sahirf , Shahbaz Sharif and other political leaders . "
Long - running tensions Gen Musharraf led a military coup in 1999 that ousted then - Prime Minister Sharif , and ruled until 2008 .
Deja-vu in crackdown Q&A : Pakistan political instability
The tensions between Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif date back to the 1990s , but the two formed a brief partnership in government after parliamentary elections in February 2008 .
Mr Sharif 's PML - N left from the alliance in August 2008 , complaining about the PPP 's reluctance to reinstate former Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and other judges sacked by President Musharraf .
Relations have been further strained in recent weeks by a Supreme Court decision to ban Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz from elected office , and President Zardari 's decision to put their stronghold in Punjab province under direct rule from Islamabad .
Shahbaz Sharif was Punjab 's chief minister .
But on Saturday , in a move seen as a conciliatory gesture , the government agreed to seek a review of the Supreme Court ruling .
The political instability comes as Pakistan faces an economic crisis and a growing militant insurgency based in the north - west .

Now it comes down to five votes .
Almost seven months after a U.S. Senate election that was too close to call , five justices of the Minnesota Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether problems with absentee ballots justify reversing a lower - court ruling that declared DFLer Al Franken a 312 - vote winner over Republican Norm Coleman .
Partisans across America will be watching , pronouncing judgment on a thousand blogs .
The case may cast a blinding national spotlight on the state Supreme Court .
A decision upholding the lower - court ruling could end the protracted struggle and allow Franken to join the Senate , giving Democrats an invincible majority .
A ruling for Coleman would n't return him to the Senate , but could keep his hopes alive and delay a final decision for months .
Minnesotans want the dispute to end , recent polls show .
Most people say Coleman should concede .
Nearly two - thirds believe that Franken ultimately will be declared the winner .
But several former Minnesota Supreme Court justices say current members will consider the case carefully , ignoring outside publicity and pressure .
" The impatience of the people just has to be put aside , " said former Associate Justice Jim Gilbert , who served on the court for seven years with most of the justices hearing the case .
" You want a correct decision at this stage , not a fast decision .
" They will not be reacting to talking heads or political action groups ... or anything like that , " Gilbert said .
" This decision has to stand the test of time .
It will be gone over with a microscope . "
Former Chief Justice Russell Anderson agrees .
" They understand every decision they make has the potential to go to the United States Supreme Court , " Anderson said .
" They 're not going to decide this on the publicity .
They 're going to decide this on the law . "
One former Minnesota justice knows what it 's like to issue an opinion in a politically overheated election case .
Five days before the 1990 gubernatorial election , then - Associate Justice A.M. ( Sandy ) Keith , once one of the state 's most prominent DFL politicians , agreed with others on the court on a key issue : that Arne Carlson should take the place of Jon Grunseth on the ballot after Grunseth withdrew as the Republican candidate for governor .
The ruling paved the way for Carlson to defeat Gov. Rudy Perpich , a DFLer who had just elevated Keith to take over as chief justice .
" I still carry that with me , " said Keith .
" The governor [ Perpich ] thought I was responsible for it .
He tried to take the position away from me -- thought about it .
He would n't even come to my swearing - in .
" I think it was the right decision , and I never had any hesitation about that , " Keith said .
While Monday 's hearing will produce yet another dramatic climax in this seven - month saga , some believe it will be mostly anti-climactic for the justices , who weeks ago received detailed briefs from the lawyers in the case .
" These justices will have had over two weeks , including three weekends ... to work on the case , " said Richard Hasen , an elections expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has followed the case closely .
" It would not be surprising to me that they would come into the arguments with their minds mostly made up , [ and ] also with drafted opinion or opinions in front of them . "
Keith said arguments delivered in court rarely swayed him in the end .
" In many instances , I had made up my mind in the sense I thought it was going in this direction , " he said .
The court and the challenge
The court will have two fewer members hearing the case than its usual seven because Chief Justice Eric Magnuson and Associate Justice G. Barry Anderson sat on the state Canvassing Board for the recount and have declined to participate in related court proceedings .
Minnesota Supreme Court expert Peter Knapp , a William Mitchell law professor , has watched the remaining five in action .
His thoughts : • Alan Page : " Well aware of the importance common sense plays in the life of the law .
You 'll see opinions of his that remind the court , sometimes gently and sometimes not so gently ... that when a decision does n't reflect that kind of common sense it may be out of kilter with where the law should go . "
• Paul Anderson : " Really appreciates the value of history in shaping the law ... to a greater degree than some of the other justices . "
• Lorie Gildea : Dissented when she " believed the court was making a decision that really belonged to the trial judge . "
• Helen Meyer : " Writes opinions that I think reflect her experience and her values . "
• Christopher Dietzen : A recent appointee with fewer written opinions , " It 's much harder to tell ... anything about his particular cast of mind . "
The five have ruled unanimously on earlier matters in the case , but split on the issue of allowing Coleman and Franken to veto the counting of some disputed absentee ballots .
Paul Anderson and Page dissented .
On Monday , each side will have 25 minutes for arguments , with Coleman allowed an additional 10 minutes for rebuttal .
He has the burden of proving that the three - judge panel that heard the trial made sufficient mistakes to overturn their verdict .
His legal team turns to Joe Friedberg to make their case , a veteran , high - profile criminal defense attorney but relative novice at election law .
" Norm decided ...
Joe is the best guy to make the argument , " said Coleman legal spokesman Ben Ginsberg .
Franken will rely on Marc Elias , a national Democratic Party lawyer who specializes in election law .
Court experts will watch to see whether the justices direct more skeptical questions to either Coleman 's or Franken 's team .
But such questioning could merely reflect a devil 's advocate approach , in which judges interrogate the very side they are leaning toward .
Wide discretion A Supreme Court decision could take days to months , with the prime options being upholding the lower court ruling for Franken or reversing it and ordering the panel to reconsider aspects of the case .
The court " cannot say that Coleman won , " said University of Minnesota constitutional law expert Fred Morrison .
" A Coleman ' victory ' in the Supreme Court would mean several more weeks or months of more recounting - type stuff . "
Aside from attacking the merits of Coleman 's case , Franken argues that the Republican 's key claims should be dismissed because he did n't bring them early enough in the trial .
More Problems With Bank - Owned Homes : Sometimes You Can’t Really Buy Them
Created : April 13 , 2009 10:59 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
As we ’ve noted previously , neglected and abandoned bank - owned foreclosed homes have caused problems with neighborhood blight and falling property values , in some areas .
The Washington Post today reports on another difficulty with these Real Estate Owned ( REO ) properties .
Sometimes banks are so overwhelmed by the number of REOs in their inventories that they can’t even keep up with all the paperwork , which holds up sales of the homes — and leaves buyers in limbo , stuck with thousands of dollars in additional costs .
As bargain hunters turn their attention to foreclosures , many are discovering the toughest challenge is dealing with the banks that repossessed the homes .
These banks are usually quick to accept a bid and write a contract .
But the closer buyers get to the settlement table , the greater the potential for bureaucratic bungling and the chance the buyers will give up .
The housing market stands little chance of recovering until the foreclosures are sold .
Distressed properties make up roughly a quarter of U.S. homes for sale .
Moving them would go a long way toward stabilizing home prices .
But working with the banks , which are typically based far from the homes they ’re selling , is not as simple as buying from a regular homeowner .
“ Things go wrong , and it takes the bank a lot longer to deal with them , ” said Vivianne Couts , a Virginia real estate agent .
“ There are a lot more people involved , many more layers .
The Realtor ca n’t always call the bank and say , ‘ What ’s going on here ? ’ “
Banks may end up with a record 1.5 million REOs this year .
Clearly , they ca n’t get them off their hands as fast as they should .
That means more trouble ahead for communities where these properties are located .
The longer they stay vacant , the worse things get , as the homes are often vandalized or trashed .
No one paid much attention to this issue when it was limited to declining neighborhoods in softer housing markets , and buyers for the homes were limited to speculators and flippers .
But maybe now that nicer neighborhoods are faced with the problem , outraged would - be buyers and angry real estate agents may finally force banks and servicers to step up their management of foreclosed properties .
The insurgency in Afghanistan will never be defeated only by maintaining an international troop presence in the country , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a U.S. television interview Sunday .
" We 're not going to ever defeat the insurgency .
My reading of Afghanistan in history is that it 's probably had an insurgency forever of some kind , " Harper told Fareed Zakaria of CNN .
Harper would n't say absolutely whether Canada would agree to an extension of its combat mission , set to end in late 2011 , but he did say emphatically that Afghanistan cannot be governed or controlled by any foreign power indefinitely .
" Ultimately the source of authority in Afghanistan has to be perceived as being indigenous , " he said .
" If it 's perceived as being foreign — and I still think we 're welcome there — but if it 's perceived as being foreign , it will always have a significant degree of opposition . "
Harper said he welcomes plans to boost the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan , but was cautious about entertaining any request for Canada to alter its commitments .
On Feb. 17 , U.S. President Barack Obama said he 'll send an additional 17,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan this spring and summer , a 50 per cent increase to the 36,000 soldiers who are there already .
Harper said if Obama were to ask Canada for a larger contingent or a continuation of the existing contingent of about 2,500 Canadian soldiers , he would ask the president what his plans are for leaving Afghanistan and allowing Afghans full control over security .
" If we think that we are going to govern Afghanistan for Afghans , or over the long - term be responsible for day - to - day security in Afghanistan and see that country improve , we are mistaken , " Harper said .
Tories have come around : NDP
The NDP and its leader , Jack Layton , were attacked by the government for saying that fighting the insurgency is unwinnable .
" They called him Taliban Jack , " NDP MP Dawn Black told CBC News on Sunday .
" They called me Burka Black , and now after all these years — three years , the many sacrifices , the enormous cost — Mr. Harper is saying exactly what many people have been saying over the years . "
The Liberals supported the Conservatives ' decision to extend the Afghanistan mission , but they too complain that Harper has had the emphasis wrong .
" It 's clear that Mr. Harper 's coming to the right conclusion , but he's not following it up with the right kinds of actions , " Liberal MP Bob Rae said Sunday .
" And he 's not taking the steps that would be logical for Canada to take , which is to upgrade its diplomatic effort and its political effort and its development effort . "
The idea the insurgency will never be defeated is not new and the United States , which is increasing its military efforts there , is careful to define limited objectives , the CBC's Keith Boag said .
" Afghanistan is still winnable in the sense of our ability to ensure that it is not a launching pad for attacks against North America , " Obama said in an exclusive interview with the CBC's Peter Mansbridge last month .
" I think it 's still possible for us to stamp out al - Qaeda . "

Many Eastern European migrant workers are going home
The number of Eastern and Central Europeans leaving the UK doubled in the year to September 2008 , figures show .
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said that more foreign nationals left during the same 12 months than compared with the previous year .
The population is still growing from migration - but the rate has slowed because of the numbers now leaving .
Home Office figures show there was a 27 % rise in asylum seekers , but the total is well below record levels .
Over the first three months of 2009 , there were 8,380 asylum applications , the highest number since 2004 .
Including family members , the number of people seeking refuge was 10,285 .
While this represents a significant increase , it is below the record levels of approximately 25,000 arrivals every quarter in 2002 .
Almost half of the applications were from Zimbabweans and Afghans - with significant numbers of Iraqis , Iranians , Eritreans and Sri Lankans also seeking protection .
Registered workers
Officials use a number of measures to count foreign workers .
Provisional figures from the International Passenger Survey , a limited sampling exercise at ports , suggests 56,000 people from eight key Eastern and Central European countries left in the year to September 2008 .
NEW POLISH WORKERS REGISTERING IN UK 2008 - 09 Jan - Mar 2008 : 32,365 Apr - Jun : 28,625 Jul - Sept : 25,130 Oct - Dec : 16,895 Jan - Mar 2009 : 12,480 Note : Poles comprise almost 60 % of all Eastern European workers in the UK ; Source : ONS / Home Office
That was more than double the 26,000 who left in the previous 12 months - but overall 44,000 more Central and Eastern European workers still arrived than left .
The ONS says that over the year to last September , 720,000 National Insurance numbers were issued to foreign nationals - down 7 % on the previous year .
The ONS said the " key factor " in the fall in National Insurance registrations was the decline in applications from eight Eastern and Central European nations .
It said that 265,000 of the National Insurance numbers went to these nationals in the year to September - a fall of 71,000 registrations on the previous year .
Over the same period , the government recorded 180,000 Eastern and Central Europeans joining the Worker Registration Scheme , a means of counting their presence in the UK .
That was down from 223,000 registrations between September 2006 and September 2008 .
The most recent provisional figures show that registrations are continuing to fall , said the ONS - totalling 133,000 in the year to March 2009 .
The figures do not include self - employed workers who do not need to register .
Overall , an estimated 469,000 Poles remain the largest single group of foreign passport holders living in the UK - although there are many more people born in India and Pakistan who long ago became British citizens .
Separate figures from the Home Office show that almost 16,000 people were removed from the UK in the first three months of 2009 - 6 % fewer than in the previous year .
The majority of the removals , some 13,000 people , were non-asylum cases .
Citizenship figures show that 129,000 people became British during 2008 .
Immigration minister Phil Woolas said : " Today 's figures show that immigration levels are balancing as more Eastern Europeans are now leaving the UK to return home .
" This suggests that increasing prosperity in post Soviet Eastern Europe in the long term can only be beneficial for the UK . "
But Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK said : " There is a small reduction in net migration .
But the key to all of this is the impact of immigration on our population .
" The numbers are quite close to what the ONS expected and that in turn means that the population will go up by 10 million in the next 20 years - and seven million of that will be a result of immigration . "

( CNN ) --
She said she was a scapegoat .
She said she was just following orders .
She said she was demoted unfairly .
Retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski was one of two officers punished over Abu Ghraib .
Now , retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski can say : I told you so .
Karpinski was one of two officers punished over the aggressive interrogations at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
Pictures of detainees caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004 .
The photos showed naked prisoners stacked on top of each other or being threatened by dogs or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution .
Throughout the ordeal , Karpinski maintained that she and her troops were following interrogation guidelines approved by top brass .
Today , Karpinski has found validation in a few Bush - era memos released last week by the Obama administration .
" The outrage was over the photographs , because the photographs were living color of what those top - secret memorandums authorized , " Karpinski said in an interview Wednesday .
" So , it is unfair ... the soldiers may have moved through [ the military justice ] system , but they never had a fair court - martial .
Not any one of them , because they were condemned as one of the ' bad apples . ' "
Karpinski , then a brigadier general and commander of Abu Ghraib , was demoted to colonel because of the scandal .
A second officer , Col. Thomas Pappas , the commander of the military intelligence unit assigned to Abu Ghraib when the offenses occurred , was relieved of duty and fined in May 2005 .
Seven low - ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then - Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz as " bad apples " -- were disciplined .
The memo , by then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and then - Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury , allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper , and putting detainees on a liquid diet .
One memo said aggressive techniques such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain .
" I will tell you that when I read those memorandums , when they were first released a few days ago , I did -- I did feel this sense of being able to exhale after five years , " Karpinski said .
" That is what we have been saying from the very beginning , that , wait a minute , why are you inside pointing the finger at me , why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here ?
There 's a bigger story here . "
The Senate Armed Forces Committee released a report Tuesday , five days after the memos were released , stating that senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists , despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys .
The report points to then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's approval of such techniques -- including stress positions , removal of clothing , use of phobias ( such as fear of dogs ) , and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli -- in December 2002 for detainees at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
His OK prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques .
The guidance was delivered to Abu Ghraib by then - Maj .
Gen. Geoffrey Miller , who was summoned to Baghdad from Guantanamo to evaluate the prison system .
" We had a myriad of problems in our -- in the prison system , not with detainees who were undergoing interrogations , but with Iraqi criminal prisoners , " Karpinski said .
" And instead of coming to give us support , he was sent specifically to work with the military intelligence interrogators to teach them the harsher techniques that were being used down in Guantanamo . "
Shortly before he left office in late 2006 , Rumsfeld said the day the Abu Ghraib scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary .
" Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib , and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened , " he said at the time .
" I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse . "
But Karpinski said the condition of detainees at the prison should have come as no surprise for the Bush administration .
" I think it was torture , absolutely .
You know , I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations , but I read the memorandums many times over , " she said .
" Waterboarding is torture . "
Karpinski said that while she was the commander of Abu Ghraib , she did n't personally witness any of the interrogation techniques .
" The first time I saw the photographs was at the end of January [ 2004 ] , " she said .
Karpinski said she was ordered by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez , the U.S. commander of operations in Iraq at the time , not to discuss the photographs or the investigation with anybody .
Now , despite any relief felt by the release of the memos and the Senate report , Karpinski said she will have a hard time shaking off the humiliation and disgrace brought on by the Abu Ghraib scandal .
" I think that , you know , you cannot dismiss five years of having to live under these accusations , " she said , " and people associating my name and these soldiers ' names with what they were so unfairly accused of . "
CNN 's Rick Sanchez contributed to this report .

会社でオフィス移転が決まったら、色々忙しくなります。まずは、移転作業を円滑に行われなければなりません。会社の業務に影響がでないように、スケジュールを調節して、新たなオフィスに移転を行い、なるべく時間のロスを防いで、移転を完了させます。いままで使用していた、オフィスの最終チェックが終わったら、オフィスの手続きは終わりになります。大家に挨拶を済ませ、新たなオフィスで、業務につきます。オフィスのチェックも、違反などをしていなければ、すぐに終わります。難しく考える必要はありません。何故ならば、普通に使用して汚れるぐらいで、揉めることはないからです。新たなオフィスでは、社員のモチベーションも上がっていきます。オフィス移転を、実行したことで得られる、一番の手応えともいえます。会社の業務が進められ、業績という結果を出すようになります。
オフィス移転の基本は手早く
オフィス移転の基本は手早くやることです。これはすぐに決めたほうが良い、ということではないです。決めたのであれば、ダラダラと移動をしないことであるわけです。それこそ、徹夜でもよいですから、一両日中に完結させるのが基本です。そうしたほうが業務に支障がでないことが多いからです。あまりにも大きな企業ではそれは難しいでしょうが中小企業ではそれができます。コンピュータの配置などを最初からしっかりと決めておくことによって、かなり効率的に行うことができます。業者に委託できるならばそれにこしたことはないですが、それでも差配をする人は必要になりますし、従業員がそれなりにいるのであれば、使った方が良いです。オフィスの移転ですが、意外とリスクもあります。その土地と家屋をよく調べてからにする必要がまず間違いなくあります。
オフィス移転の基本的な考え方としては
オフィスが手狭になってきたら、余裕があれば移転したほうがよいです。オフィス移転はそこまで珍しいわけではないです。大変ではありますが、作業効率が高くなるのであれば、それはやる価値があります。オフィス移転としては、まずは広さ、家賃、立地、そして作業に相応しい配置ができるのか、と言うのが重要になります。例えば電気の配線一つを見ても自社の業務に見合っているのかどうかを確認してからでないと駄目です。何度も下見をすることになります。それに住むわけではないですが、周りの治安なども気にしたほうが良いです。それなりに高価な品がオフィスは多いからです。セキュリティ関係に関する情報もしっかりと得ておくのが基本といえます。オフィス移転をする時には複合的に判断をしないといけないのでとても大変ですが、業績が上がり、手狭になってきたら必須です。
Tory MPs should admit to any “ mistakes ” they made , he said .
“ What I want is for Conservative MPs , as with other MPs , to come out and explain why they claimed what they claimed , to admit to any mistakes , if there have been mistakes , and collectively to say : ' Look , this system was wrong , we took part in it , we operated it . ’”

Yoo Brings History of Inconsistency and Hypocrisy to ' Inquirer '
Larry the Cucumber , with supporters , campaigning earlier this year for head of the RNC
RNC treasurer Randy Pullen who , at Limbaugh ’s suggestion , orchestrated the replacement excitedly imagines that this could push the GOP in a completely new direction with respect to brand recognition and voter registration .
" Just think , " says Pullen .
" We could have a " Silly Policies with Larry " webpage where Larry comes on and proffers a silly policy .
It ’s not too far from what the GOP is currently doing and my whole family loves Larry the Cucumber . "
Eric Ellenbogen , co-CEO of Boomerang Media which owns Big Idea Productions and controls the use of any VeggieTale image responded encouragingly to the news .
" This is typical of the Republican party , using art and media without proper licensing agreements and infringing on copyrights in a big way .
Christ , it ’s a children ’s cartoon character ! " said Ellenbogan .
" We are currently in touch with our lawyers and do not have anything more to add at this time . "
" I think it ’s perfect ! " effused James Dobson , formerly of Focus on the Family .
" With the National Prayer Day approaching and the Obama administration encouraging everyone to sin against God , having a well - respected Christian like Larry to help lead our party will rally our base .
I only wish we could get some of those peas , they ’re hilarious . "
Larry the Cucumber , being a fictitious children ’s cartoon character , was unavailable for comment at the time of this writing .
If you 've seen a single second of Abrams ' Star Trek you know the film is stuffed with audience blinding lens flashes .
J.J. Abrams admitted he got a bit carried away , but explained why they 're there .

At the Star Trek press conference this weekend , J.J. Abrams addressed the press and when it was io9's turn , we asked him the one thing that had been plaguing us since the first shiny
Trek clip was released :
I 'm curious to hear more about why you decided to use so many lens flares , and exactly when you decided to use them ?

[ Smiles ]
I do n't know what you 're talking about .
[ Laughs ]
I 'm kidding .
I know what you 're saying with the lens flares .
It was one of those things ...
I wanted a visual system that felt unique .
I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think , " Oh that 's ridiculous , that was too many . "
But I love the idea that the future was so bright it could n't be contained in the frame .
The flares were n't just happening from on - camera light sources , they were happening off camera , and that was really the key to it .
I want [ to create ] the sense that , just off camera , something spectacular is happening .
There was always a sense of something , and also there is a really cool organic layer thats a quality of it .
They were all done live , they were n't added later .
There are something about those flares , especially in a movie that can potentially be very sterile and CG and overly controlled .
There is something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them .
It is a really fun thing .
Our DP would be off camera with this incredibly powerful flashlight aiming it at the lens .
It became an art because different lenses required angles , and different proximity to the lens .
Sometimes , when we were outside we 'd use mirrors .
Certain sizes were too big ... literally , it was ridiculous .
It was like another actor in the scene ....
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
We had two cameras , so sometimes we had two different spotlight operators .
When there was atmosphere in the room , you had to be really careful because you could see the beams .
So it was this ridiculous , added level of pain in the ass , but I love ... [ looking at ] the final cut , [ the flares ] to me , were a fun additional touch that I think , while overdone , in some places , it feels like the future is that bright .
So now you know , and honestly after hearing his reasoning and his admission that maybe he got a little carried away in some scenes — like the above Spock meets Scottie moment — I can see what he 's saying , especially about keeping it from looking too greenscreen or fake .

Also , Abrams touched on what he had to cut from the movie and will be appearing on the Trek DVD :
What 's going to be on the DVD and BluRay , we heard something about the character Uncle Frank ?

[ Kirk 's ]
Stepfather and young Kirk have a scene , there is a Nero prison scene , young Spock as a baby , and more ... there are a couple scenes that were brought out of the movie .
Some things , like that prison sequence , just confound the audience .
Every time we screened the movie for a group , that sequence threw them , even though it had some of my favorite design in the entire movie .
The wardrobe , the location , some of the visual effects were really fun .
But you know it was better without it , when we cut it .
A Canadian who demanded courtesy from a U.S. border security guard says he was pepper sprayed and held in custody for three hours for asking the disrespectful officer to " say please " when ordering him to turn his car off during a search .
" I refused to turn off the car until he said please .
He did n't .
And he has the gun , I guess , so he sprayed me , " said Desiderio Fortunato , a Coquitlam , B.C. , resident who frequently crosses the border to visit his second home in the state of Washington .
" Is that illegal in the United States , asking an officer to be polite ? "
The incident occurred on Monday at the Aldergrove border crossing , east of Vancouver , shortly after 12 p.m. Mr. Fortunato , a dance studio director , was travelling to his home in Blaine , Wash . , to retrieve a wallet his wife had left during their most recent visit .
He said he was questioned by a border officer who demanded he turn off his car and , when asked to make the request more politely , threatened to spray him with his pepper gun if he did not comply .
" I just felt I should stand my ground about it .
I should not be treated like that .
No matter what kind of position you are in , if you want respect you have to show respect , " he said yesterday .
" I asked him three times and when I did n't turn the car off , because he did n't say please , he pepper sprayed me ....
It was terrible .
For half an hour or so I could n't see anything . "
Mr. Fortunato said after he was sprayed he was forcefully taken into custody by several officers .
He was held for three hours before he was released without being allowed entry into the United States .
Mr. Fortunato says he was dismissed with a warning to be more cooperative in the future .
A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said officers are trained on how to handle confrontation , and refusal to comply with a direct order is justification to use capsicum spray , also known as pepper spray , or other " soft techniques " such as physical holds .
" The combination of training and experience is what our officers use to communicate with passenger on a day - today basis .
Our officers will give direct orders or commands to passengers , especially in situations where there may be a safety concern .
It is the obligation of the passenger to be compliant with those , " said spokesperson Mike Milne .
He added that officers order border passengers to turn of their vehicles when they want to take somebody from a car and , in such cases , further questioning would be conducted inside the building .
While he could not comment on the specific case , Mr. Milne said the use of force at a border crossing is very rare , very serious and subject to immediate review .
By his own admission , Mr. Fortunato is a stickler for courtesy and respect .
The Portuguese native , who has lived in B.C. for 25 years and has owned his second home in Washington for three , pulled a similar stunt at the same border crossing about one year ago .
In that case , he was ordered to wait hours to be questioned before being allowed to cross .
Once , he said , he asked a Canadian border agent to be more polite when requesting documents , to which the agent responded with a sheepish " please . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. watch list of terrorism suspects has passed 1 million records , corresponding to about 400,000 people , and a leading civil rights group said on Monday the number was far too high to be effective .
The " Tribute in Lights " shines on the skyline of lower Manhattan as the sixth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center is observed in New York , September 11 , 2007 .

The Bush administration disagreed and called the list one of the most effective tools implemented after the September 11 hijacked plane attacks -- when a federal “ no - fly ” list contained just 16 people considered threats to aviation .
The American Civil Liberties Union publicized the 1 million milestone with a news conference and release .
It said the watch list was an impediment to millions of travellers and called for changes , including tightening criteria for adding names , giving travellers a right to challenge their inclusion and improving procedures for taking wrongly included names off the list .
“ America ’s new million - record watch list is a perfect symbol for what ’s wrong with this administration ’s approach to security : it ’s unfair , out - of - control , a waste of resources ( and ) treats the rights of the innocent as an afterthought , ” ACLU technology director Barry Steinhardt said in a release .
President George W. Bush ordered in the current list in September 2003 as a way to wrap several growing terrorism watchlists into a single government database compiled and overseen by the FBI , through a Terrorist Screening Center .
Suspected terrorists or people believed to have links to terrorism are included on the list , which can be used by a wide range of government agencies in security screening .
About 50,000 individuals are included on the Transportation Security Administration “ no - fly ” or “ selectee ” lists that subject them to travel bans , arrest or additional screening .
Critics have pointed to troubles that figures such as U.S. Sen .
Edward Kennedy , 1960s civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis and singer Yusuf Islam ( formerly Cat Stevens ) have had with watch lists as evidence the consolidated database is poorly managed .
The Terrorism Screening Center , which maintains the list , has already put in place several steps to ensure the list is accurate and up - to - date , spokesman Chad Kolton said .
He cited a report last year by the Government Accountability Office that said there was general agreement within the federal government that the watch list had helped to combat terrorism .
“ The list is very effective .
In fact it ’s one of the most effective counterterrorism tools that our country has , ” he said .
About 400,000 individuals are included on the list , about 95 percent of whom are not U.S. citizens or residents , Kolton said .
The watch list also includes separate entries with aliases , fake passports and fake birth dates , bringing the total number of records to more than 1 million , he said .
TSA spokesman Christopher White said the agency ’s “ no - fly ” watchlists to screen travellers were “ scrubbed ” last year to remove about half of the names , leaving them with somewhat fewer than 50,000 .
He said Kennedy and Lewis were never on the list , and that problems they reported were due to their misidentification with names properly on it .
Did you know Hideo Kojima is an Apple whore ?
He said so when he made an appearance at a San Francisco Apple store on Friday .
Fans lined up outside just to get down .
In fact , we heard that the first few people were in line from the early morning , and Kojima did n't show up until about 3 p.m .
They packed several people in on the top floor of this store , where the famed game maker appeared on stage .
He was there to talk about his new game , Metal Gear Solid Touch .
Fans in line got an iPod Touch case plastered with a MGST theme and Snake 's face .
The whole thing was hosted by Geoff Keighley , who was either really run down or is not a fan of Metal Gear Solid at all .
Kojima talked about the game , fielded questions from the audience , and then was promptly stormed by fans armed with autograph - ready items .
He signed one or two things and then got the hell out of town -- the man must have learned a lot from his videogames as he seemed to disappear out of thin air .
He probably crawled out of some air duct or something .
Hit the jump to check out the epic video interview .
Hints of the next Metal Gear are dropped worse then Gecko's poo .
Alexa is the most popular free website ranking service .
It has been described as " a Nielson rating for the popularity of the website you are visiting . "
With a higher Alexa rank , more people will be attracted to reading your website ( on the theory that if its a popular site , it must be good ) , and advertisers will be more interested in paying to run ads on your site .
Those in the know have realized for some time that Alexa is n't perfectly accurate .
But it turns out that many people are also intentionally gaming the Alexa rankings .
How ?
Well , Alexa supposedly ranks the popularity of websites by how many people with Alexa the toolbar installed on their computer surf to a particular site .
Many techies have figured out tricks for increasing Alexa ranking .
More amusingly , people all over the world will happily surf to your site manually - or using automatic scripts - to make it look like you have more readers than you really do .
For example , the folks at Alexa Rank Team provide the following informative price list :
If you want your site ranks within 500 , we will make your site 's ranking listed within 500 everyday .
And after 3 months , your site will be ranked within 500 .

While we are all well - behaved boys and girls , patiently waiting for an onslaught of Via Nano - based netbooks and low - cost laptops so we can give the , well , you know , to Intel and AMD , those sneaky people over at Dell have unveiled an entirely different type of computer using the Nano platform : a server .
When talking about power - efficiency in processors and chips we often tend to think of laptops and especially netbooks , but that does n’t mean the server world cannot benefit from these types of chips as well .
Dell has realised that , and today unveiled its XS11 - VX8 server , which uses Via Nano processors .
Users can stick 12 of these servers into a 2U chassis .
Via Nano processors are clocked anywhere between 1.0 and 1.8 Ghz , using a 65 - nanometer manufacturing process , and only consume 15 W of power when the operating system is idle , and when running a full application load , it rises to only 20 - 29W ( quite impressive ) .
Nano chips are also fully 64 bit capable , and have hardware virtualisation extensions .
The XS11 - VX8 , codenamed “ Fortuna ” , is designed for what Dell calls “ hyper - scaling ” , a scenario where for instance search engine and web hosting businesses need to stuff as many servers into an as little a space as possible .
Often , these customers use 1U servers or simply tower models , but these are not space or power efficient .
As such , Dell ’s DCS team ( apparently known as a skunkworks team ) set out to design a solution specifically for this market :
The Fortuna solution was designed from day one to solve this specific customer problem without compromise .
Leveraging the Via Nano CPU , we can deliver an incredibly low - power solution of 20 - 29 Watts / server at full load ( that is n’t a typo ) , and 15 Watts / server at OS idle .
In addition , there are no compromises on enterprise features like 64 - bit operating systems , 1 - to - 1 virtualization , and remote management via IPMI .
However , what usually catches most customers ’ attention is the form factor .
With a size slightly larger than a 3.5 - inch hard drive , Fortuna is a “ hot - plug ” server with its own dedicated memory , storage , BMC , and dual 1 GbE NIC’s .
The chassis exists to provide power , cooling , and a mechanism to mount in a rack .
This provides unprecedented density â€ “ supporting six servers per rack unit ( U ) or 252 servers in a 42U rack .
This is a pretty interesting server , and priced at only USD 400 , it ’s not exactly expensive either .
It ’s also good news for Via , which has trouble competing with its Nano platform in a market dominated by Intel ’s Atom .
Since the 1950s , Topps has sold baseball trading cards filled with photos and stats , bringing the game to life .
Now the company is bringing its cards to life .
Beginning Monday , collectors who hold a special Topps 3D Live baseball card in front of a webcam will see a three - dimensional avatar of the player on the computer screen .
Rotate the card , and the figure rotates in full perspective .
It ’s called “ augmented reality , ” a combination of a real image with a virtual one .
“ This is the ‘ Beam me up , Scotty ’ version of a baseball card that will get kids to buy more .
We see this baseball season as a redefining moment for us , ” said Steve Grimes , chief digital officer at Topps .
Topps needs to augment reality because baseball cards are struggling in the Internet age .
Today ’s collectors , most of whom are still boys , can just as easily and less expensively find the sports facts they want online .

Toxic scandal in Somalia gave birth to new piracy November 25 , 2008
socialistworker.co.uk
The escapades of Somali pirates made headlines last week .
But the media has ignored the injustice behind the phenomenon , writes Simon Assaf
When the Asian tsunami of Christmas 2005 washed ashore on the east coast of Africa , it uncovered a great scandal .
Tonnes of radioactive waste and toxic chemicals drifted onto the beaches after the giant wave dislodged them from the sea bed off Somalia .
Tens of thousands of Somalis fell ill after coming into contact with this cocktail .
They complained to the United Nations ( UN ) , which began an investigation .
" There are reports from villagers of a wide range of medical problems such as mouth bleeds , abdominal haemorrhages , unusual skin disorders and breathing difficulties , " the UN noted .
Some 300 people are believed to have died from the poisonous chemicals .
Many European , US and Asian shipping firms – notably Switzerland 's Achair Partners and Italy 's Progresso – signed dumping deals in the early 1990s with Somalia 's politicians and militia leaders .
This meant they could use the coast as a toxic dumping ground .
This practice became widespread as the country descended into civil war .
Nick Nuttall of the UN Environment Programme said , " European companies found it was very cheap to get rid of the waste .
" It cost as little as £ 1.70 a tonne , whereas waste disposal costs in Europe was something like £ 670 a tonne .
" And the waste is of many different kinds .
There is uranium radioactive waste .
There is lead , and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury .
There is also industrial waste , hospital wastes , chemical wastes – you name it . "
But despite the evidence uncovered by the tsunami , an investigation into the practice of toxic dumping was dropped .
There was no compensation and no clean up .
In 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the UN that foreign fishing fleets were using the breakdown of the state to plunder their fish stocks .
These foreign fleets often recruited Somali militias to intimidate local fishermen .
Despite repeated requests , the UN refused to act .
Meanwhile the warships of global powers that patrol the strategically important Gulf of Aden did not sink or seize any vessels dumping toxic chemicals off the coast .
So angry Somalis , whose waters were being poisoned and whose livelihoods were threatened , took matters into their own hands .
Fishermen began to arm themselves and attempted to act as unofficial coastguards .
They began to seize ships in late 2005 .
These were released after a ransom was paid .
Among them were cargo vessels , luxury cruise liners and tuna fishing boats .
Januna Ali Jama , a Somali pirate leader , explained that their actions were motivated by attempts to stop the toxic dumping .
He said that the £ 5.4 million ransom they demanded for the return of a Ukrainian ship would go towards cleaning up the mess .
Ali Jama said the pirates were " reacting to the toxic waste that has been continually dumped on the shores of our country for nearly 20 years .
" The Somali coastline has been destroyed .
We believe this money is nothing compared to the devastation that we have seen on the seas . "
But the nature of this piracy soon began to change .
Members of the Somali government , who were part of the then Western - backed Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) , started to get involved .
They transformed the piracy operation into a multi-million dollar industry that funded their lavish lifestyles .
The TFG was ousted during a popular rebellion in July 2006 led by the Union of Islamic Courts .
Later that year the US backed Ethiopia 's invasion of Somalia to drive the Islamic Courts out .
This provoked an insurgency labelled by some as the " third front " of the " war on terror " .
The US became embarrassed when it emerged that its allies in the TFG were deeply involved in piracy .
As concerns grew for the safety of ships heading towards the Suez Canal , global powers began to take notice .
Indian and US warships began to sink Somali fishing boats if they sailed too close to cargo vessels or trawlers .
These warships transformed Somalia 's coastal waters into a " free fire zone " .
When a giant Saudi oil tanker was seized , these powers declared all - out war on the pirates .
British foreign minister David Miliband recently boasted that Britain would be taking the lead in cracking down on the pirates .
The Royal Navy will take command of a European fleet of warships as part of " Operation Atalanta " , he said .
The target will be the Somalis – not the vessels dumping waste or the illegal foreign fishing fleets .
As global powers dispatch their warships to the Somali coast , the problems that caused this outbreak of piracy remain unresolved .
European , US and Asian ships will continue to dump hazardous waste and plunder coastal fishing stocks – leading to continuing misery for Somalis .

French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra - fast lasers that could accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times , pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry .
The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany , who ushered in a revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s .
Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a large electric output .
These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored .
That discovery opened the way to " spintronics " , a form of electronics that uses not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to provide a more compact , denser storage on hard drives .
But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the relative slowness of magnetic sensors .
In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics , a team led by Jean - Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in Strasbourg employed a " femtosecond " laser , using ultra - fast bursts of laser light , to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage .
" Our method is called the photonics of spin , because it is photons [ particles of light ] that modify the state of the electrons ' magnetisation " on the storage surface , Bigot told AFP .
Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a second , said Bigot .
Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres ( 12 inches ) by 10 centimetres ( four inches ) which means they are too big for consumer electronics , he cautioned .
Bigot added , though , that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over the next decade .
IBM , Hitachi and other corporations are " extremely interested " by the research , Bigot said .

Nereus will switch between free - swimming and tethered configurations
A robotic submarine is undergoing final preparations to dive to the deepest - known part of the oceans .
If successful , Nereus will be the first autonomous vehicle to visit the 11,000 m ( 36,089ft ) Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean .
Only two other vehicles have ever visited the spot before , both of them human operated .
The $ 5 m submarine will make the attempt in late May or early June after a series of increasingly deep dives .
From 6,500 m to 11,000 m metres Nereus has the field pretty much to itself
Ian Rouse
National Oceanography Centre " Instead of jumping directly into the deep end of the swimming pool with the vehicle , we 'll probably dip our toe in first , " said Andy Bowen of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) and one of the designers of Nereus .
" We 'll work at 1,000 m , 4,000 m , 8,000 m and then take a deep breath and see if we can get to 11,000m . "
Ian Rouse , head of the deep platforms group at the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton , described the project as a " great technical challenge " .
" [ At less than ] 6,500 m deep ( 21,325 ft ) there are vehicles that can do a better job than Nereus due to its compromises in design , " he told BBC News .
" However from 6,500 m to 11,000 m Nereus has the field pretty much to itself . "
Other teams , notably the British , French , Russian and Japanese will be watching the mission " with interest " .
" The Nereus team [ is ] very experienced in designing and building other underwater vehicles , so I have no doubt they will succeed , " said Mr Rouse .
The tests will take place on a research cruise between the 23 May and 6 June .
Deep records
The Challenger Deep is the deepest - known part of the ocean , located in the Marianas Trench near the island of Guam in the west Pacific .
It is the deepest abyss on Earth at 11,000 m - deep , more than 2 km ( 1.2 miles ) deeper than Mount Everest is high .
At that depth , pressures reach 1,100 times the pressure at the surface .
Nereus aims to give researchers access to 100 % of the seafloor
As a result , only two vehicles have ever made the trip to its crushing depths .
" From an engineering perspective , building something to operate in such an extreme environment is a huge challenge , " said Mr Bowen .
In January 1960 , Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh made the first and only manned voyage in a Swiss - built bathyscaphe known as the Trieste .
The vessel consisted of a 2 m - diameter ( 6ft ) steel sphere , containing the crew , suspended below a huge 15 m - long ( 50 ft ) tank of petrol , designed to provide buoyancy .
During the nine - hour mission , the two men spent just 20 minutes on the ocean floor ; enough time to measure the depth as 10,916 metres ( 35,813 ft ) .
No manned submersible has ever repeated the dive .
However , 35 years later , a Japanese remote - controlled vehicle called Kaiko returned , setting a depth record for unmanned exploration .
During its dive , the vehicle recorded a depth of 10,911 m ( 35,797ft ) .
It was also able to recover a sediment core and record pictures of life , including a sea cucumber , a worm and a shrimp .
THE NEREUS SUBMERSIBLE
Weight on land : 2,800kg Payload capacity : 25kg Maximum speed : 3 knots Batteries : rechargeable lithium ion
Unlike Nereus , Kaiko had to rely on a cable connected to a ship at the surface for power and control .
The Japanese craft was lost in 2003 on an unrelated dive when a cable connecting it to its control ship snapped .
Shape - shifter Currently , the deepest - rated vehicles are able to descend to 6,500 m , allowing scientists access to 95 % of the seafloor .
Nereus aims to change this to 100 % , whilst also allowing scientists to survey a much larger area than vehicles like Kaiko .
It is able to do this by switching between two different configurations - free - swimming and tethered - depending on the type of mission .

Advertisement " The autonomous vehicle , as the name sounds , has autonomy from the human operators onboard the ship , " explained Mr Bowen .
In this configuration , Nereus is able to fly pre-programmed missions , mapping vast swathes of the seafloor .
" It has sufficient onboard intelligence and batteries to find areas of particular interest through the use of chemical sensors , sonar and digital photography , " said Mr Bowen .
Once complete , the submarine will automatically return to the ship where it can be converted to a remote - operated vehicle ( Rov ) .
This involves adding a mechanical arm , which allows Nereus to gather samples and deploy instruments , as well as a single , 40 km - long ( 25 mile ) fibre optic cable that allows scientists to control the vessel from the ship .

Pressure gauge Although hybrid vehicles have been designed before , Nereus will be the first to visit the entire ocean floor .
It will also be the only vehicle currently in operation with this capability .
To do this , the engineering team has had to use new technologies and materials .
" We have had to throw away almost all of the extant technologies that we 've been using for decades , " Professor Chris German , also of WHOI , told the BBC .
For example , the team had to do away with conventional cables for the tethered vehicle .
" They typically had a steel casing , copper for conducting power down them and optical fibres for collecting data , " he said .
" None of that works because we can't build cables that are strong enough to go down to 11,000 m and not break at the top and yet be flexible enough to allow us to move around when we get there . "
As a result of limitations like these , he said , the Japanese craft Kaiko had limited manoeuvrability and needed a custom - built ship for spooling out the reams of heavy cable required to attach it to the ship .
Nereus , on the other hand , uses rechargeable lithium - ion batteries , similar to those used in laptop computers , for power and a single hairs - width fibre optic cables - borrowed from Torpedoes - for control and telemetry .
Each charge allows the vehicle to remain submerged for 20 hours .

In addition , the engineers have replaced traditional materials used to build similar craft , such as titanium and glass , with new , lightweight materials .
" We have very thin - walled and light ceramic material which has had to be made to withstand these huge pressures , " explained Professor German .

However , the mission is about more than just proving new technology .
Scientists are keen to get their hands on the new vehicle to explore the ocean depths .
" I think we are going to see all kinds of new life forms , " said Tim Shank , a biologist at WHOI .
" There are going to be novel habitats , novel species and novel adaptations . "
Previous discoveries at shallower depths have taught scientists to " expect the unexpected " , he added .
" There are shrimps that are found at vents in the Atlantic that swarm by the millions that have lost their eyes . "
Instead of eyes , the creatures have a U - shaped sensory structure on their back , which may be used to detect heat , Professor Shank explained .
Scientists plan to use Nereus to study destructive Earth processes " Nobody would have anticipated that this one species would have evolved this kind of adaptation . "
Geologists are also hoping to use the vehicle to directly study destructive Earth processes , such as where the oceanic crust is recycled into the planetary interior .
" We can study mid-ocean ridges where new ocean crust is produced , but we cannot study the other end in the same way , " explained Professor German .
These subduction zones , as they are known , are commonly found along the edge of the Pacific , where oceanic crust plunges under buoyant continental crust .
The Marianas Trench - the location of the Challenger Deep - was formed when the Pacific Plate was thrust beneath the smaller Mariana Plate .
Professor German added : " Given that , among other things , it is in these subduction zones that the world 's largest earthquakes ever recorded , [ these areas ] are potentially , really quite significant . "

I 've done a lot of writing that has offered some analysis of the debate that has broken out about torture .
This has included the emphasis on understanding that torture is a moral issue -- torture is wrong , period -- and it can not be excused or defended .
I have written that the people in this country have a moral responsibility to act visibly in the millions to end torture and to hold those responsible for it accountable .
Over the last month the debate on torture has been raging on .
Most of the terms of the debate have been very bad whether we are getting the perspective of top Democrats who defend not prosecuting war criminals because it would distract from the work ahead or whether it's top Republicans who say that if we do n't keep torture that there will be another attack .
Both arguments reek of American Chauvinism .
Nowhere was this more evident than in Obama 's speech on Guantanamo and detention which Andy Worthington posted on his website Transcript of Obama 's speech .
And then we had former Vice President 's speech immediately following Obama 's that defended the crimes of the Bush Regime Cheney 's speech from AIE website .
Obama is working furiously to keep intact the very things he said he would change .
He is putting a nice veneer on the ugliness that Dick Cheney is spewing .
Obama is merely replacing the rhetoric used by the Bush Regime while keeping in place its practices .
Fortunately , it seems there is a segment of society that is n't allowing its conscience to be over - ridden with the terms of this debate ; that actually wants to see the horror of torture stopped and wants to see those responsible held to account .
An example of this can be found in reader 's comments to a New York Times article in which its headline announces that 1 in 7 detainees released returned to terrorism .
Readers comments ranged from pointing out that the headline is misleading in that 1 in 7 seems pretty low , to questioning how the U.S. knows these were terrorists to begin with since they were never charged with anything , to pointing out how torture can fuel anti-American sentiment .
When one reads the comments , one sees that not everyone is buying into the lies nor is everyone willing to go along .
Read article and comments here .
But this sentiment among the people , and it's a correct and just sentiment , has yet to break out visibly in a mass way .
There is still a sense that nothing can be done about it especially since Obama has done an about - face on these issues .
Two days into his Presidency he signed an executive order that keeps rendition in place , his Department of Justice blocked evidence in the lawsuit against Jeppesen Data Plan for the extraordinary rendition of four detainees , he went to the C.I.A to assure them that no one would be prosecuted for having tortured people , he said that the detainees at Bagram detention center will have no right of habeas corpus , and Guantanamo remains open .
Some detainees will be tried here in the states but others will face indefinite detention primarily because the evidence coerced through torture would prove so embarrassing that to try them would expose the complete and utter farce the " war on terror " has been .
Just recently , the Department of Justice has said it will not prosecute those who authored the torture memos nor those who authorized torture .
Obama has reversed his decision to release some 2,000 more photos of torture .
His explanation that it would fuel anti-American sentiment therefore putting our troops in danger when really it is the torture that is in those photos that fuels this sentiment and puts troops at risk .
Yes , it is no wonder that the many who hate what has been done in their name feel that nothing can be done to stop it .
They see the leadership of this country not only excusing and covering up the crimes of the Bush Regime , but also keeping intact the very criminal policies of that Regime .
No wonder it would seem that no one cares or that the majority of people here in this country find all this acceptable .
But let 's reframe this .
It is true that the leadership does not care and is carrying forward these crimes , but it is not true that no one in this country cares .
Millions in this country do care and hate all this .
It is not true that no one is doing anything to end torture and hold war criminals accountable .
It is true that the numbers of people that are doing something is not what it needs to be , but that does n't translate into no one is doing anything .
There are those who recognize that the people themselves must take on the leading role in stopping the crimes of their government .
Those who are challenging , opposing , and resisting are inviting the millions to join with them in this struggle .
So here I want to give readers the opportunity to see what activists in World Ca n't Wait have been doing in the last month .
I 'm providing links to articles about bold actions that WCW has done ...
Protest : Prosecute Jay Bybee Read Here Fire John Yoo Protest At Berkeley Law School Commencement Read Here Anti-Torture Protest : This is About Humanity Read Here
These are the kind of actions the people of this country who hate what is being done in their name must take the responsibility to take part in .
My hope is that , after reading about these actions , many of you will be inspired and encouraged to step forward and join us in this righteous struggle .
The people who have suffered because of these crimes need millions of us to act .
It is only we in our millions who will end the torture state and stop the crimes of our government .
On Thursday , May 28 , World Can't Wait and War Criminals
Watch will be going out with the demand that the torture photos be released and demand prosecutions for the war criminals responsible for what these photos show .
Here is a link which includes the basis for these protests and lists locations where these protests will be happening .

Thousands of civilians fleeing fighting in Sri Lanka have been interned by the government in cramped , makeshift camps with overflowing drains , water shortages and the threat of disease looming large in the sweltering , unsanitary conditions .
The government allowed a small group of international journalists into Menik Farm camp , which is regarded by aid agencies as by far the best - equipped of the camps .
But even here , people complain bitterly about their treatment and the lack of freedom of movement .
In the camp people are herded behind coils of razor wire strung out between sharp wooden stakes and are not allowed to leave .
Rows of tents stretch as far as the eye can see .
Those who have been given shacks made of sheet metal bake in the scorching heat .
Soldiers armed with automatic rifles patrol inside and outside the camps .
" This is a jail , " one woman told the Guardian .
As Sri Lanka 's army pounds a no - fire zone where the last remnants of the Tamil Tigers are cornered , its government says it expects the tens of thousands of civilians still trapped alongside the rebels to start to make their way to safety in the next few days .
But while it had attempted to portray the decision to place displaced civilians in the camps as a humanitarian gesture , the woman in charge of one of them yesterday admitted that the intention was to keep those inside shut off from the rest of the population .
Piency Charles , the government agent at Menik Farm , near the town of Vavuniya , said the authorities believed that Tamil Tiger fighters had entered the camps alongside civilians .
" Our concern is the security of these people and the security of the whole country .
If we release people from here they may cause damage outside , " she said .
Sasi Kumar fled here with his fmaily from Kilinochchi , the former Tamil Tiger stronghold , weeks ago as fighting intensified around the city .
They were promised security and food , but were not expecting what they found .
They sleep on mats on the bare concrete floor in a tin- walled hut that soaks up the heat of the sun .
Kumar , 34 , gestured at his two - month - old baby , Vigee , sleeping fitfully on the floor surrounded by flies .
" It is very hot and the health problems are very bad .
The children have coughs and diarrhoea , " he said .
" We can't go out , we have to stay inside the fences .
Ask the forces why they brought us here , " he said angrily .
" They say we can only go back when it is safe , maybe in a year . "
Gordon Weiss , the UN spokesman in Sri Lanka , said of the camps : " It is a nasty place to be and it is distinctly uncomfortable . "

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
Gun owners are watching a Utah congressman 's bill with interest in the hopes this spring 's supply - and - demand issue does n't make a comeback .
In March , the Department of Defense stopped re-selling spent shell casings to be reloaded and resold to the commercial market .
" Instead of selling the spent ammunition to commercial reloaders , that spent brass had to be shredded or crushed first , " explains Charles Hardy , public policy director for Gun Owners of Utah ( GO Utah ) .
Four days later , the Defense Logistics Agency issued a news release saying it was reversing that decision after a review .
Regardless of how the decision came about , those four days created a virtual run on ammo .
According to Hardy , " this change was made , and did n't require any congressional review whatsoever , did n't require any public hearings .
It was a unilateral decision that just happened overnight . "
Jason Chaffetz is introducing a bill that would make sure there is a check and balance on a situation like this , in case there is a next time .
Its legislation that Hardy and other gun enthusiasts will be watching carefully .
" I think how the bill is received , " he says , " is going to be a little bit of a litmus test for how the current democratically - controlled congress and how the Obama administration view the individual right to keep and bear arms . "
Whether it 's accurate or not , Hardy says there is a perception out there that the new administration wants to tighten gun controls , and the four days in March only exacerbated the perception .
Chaffetz describes what happened last month as a form of back - door gun control .
" They were trying to drive up the price of ammunition , thinking there would be less ammunition sold , " he said .
The Department of Defense usually sells over 100 million used shell casings a year for reloading and resale to the public .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Actor Kiefer Sutherland has been charged with misdemeanor assault after he was accused of head - butting fashion designer Jack McCollough at a New York nightclub early Tuesday , police said .
Kiefer Sutherland , center , turns himself in to police in New York on Thursday .
Sutherland was charged after he arrived at a New York police precinct Thursday afternoon to answer investigators ' questions about the incident .
McCollough claims that he was " the victim of a vicious , violent , unprovoked assault , " according to a statement from his publicist .
Sutherland and his publicist have not responded to several calls for comment .
A police statement issued this week did not name Sutherland or McCollough but identified those involved only by sex , race and age :
" Male white 42 , speaking to female white when a male white 30 walked in between them to get to the bar .
There was a verbal altercation and the suspect head butted the victim , causing injuries to the victim 's nose . "
Sutherland is 42 , and McCollough is 30 .
Watch an expert analyze Sutherland 's alleged behavior »
Media reports have said the woman involved was actress Brooke Shields .
" Anyone who knows Jack McCollough knows that he would not hurt a fly , " McCollough 's spokesman said .
" All we can say at this point is that he was the victim of a vicious , violent , unprovoked assault and that the matter is in the hands of the authorities . "
CNN 's Doug Ganley , Marc Balinsky and Rob Frehse contributed to this report .

Two unidentified gunmen carjacked a vehicle last night from United Nations - African Union ( AU ) peacekeeping operation in Darfur ( UNAMID ) , the mission in the violence - torn region of Sudan reported today .
The driver of the vehicle , an international UN staff member , was unhurt by the two armed men who stole the car in El Fasher , the capital of North Darfur .
Over the past month , UNAMID has reported a rise in attacks on peacekeeping staff , carjacking , other banditry , and harassment of civilians in Darfur .
There has also been concern over the safety of humanitarian workers , many of whom have been ordered to leave the region following the indictment on 4 March of Sudanese President Omar Al - Bashir by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the region .
Speaking to reporters in New York today , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon reiterated that the situation in Sudan has been one of his top priorities , particularly humanitarian issues in the wake of the ouster of the aid groups .
“ I have made a sincere appeal and also urged many African and Arab leaders to influence President Bashir to reverse the decision to expel humanitarian workers , ” he said , following a briefing to the General Assembly on his recent travels , which included a stop in Doha for the Arab League Summit .
Meanwhile , in the past day UNAMID conducted 22 confidence - building patrols , 19 escort patrols and five night patrols covering 35 villages and camps for internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) .
The mission ’s police also conducted close to 100 patrols in and around villages and IDP camps .
As part of its capacity building efforts , UNAMID police began a five - day training programme in criminal investigation for Sudanese police in Nyala , South Darfur .
UNAMID was set up by the Security Council to protect civilians in Darfur , where an estimated 300,000 people have been killed and another 2.7 million have been forced from their homes since fighting erupted in 2003 , pitting rebels against Government forces and allied Janjaweed militiamen .
More than one year on from transferring the task of suppressing the violence to UNAMID from the AU Mission in Sudan ( AMIS ) , over 12,000 of the 19,555 military personnel authorized by the Security Council are in place across Darfur .
I ’ve said it before and now I ’ll say it again , “ The Bible is it ’s own worst enemy ” .
I think this rings true for any former Christian that decided to read it as if it were not a perfect book , thats one of the steps I took before I got to where I am today .
In my recent plea for someone to ask questions of me for better inspiration one OscarGecko asked me the following :
In your post , “ Ex - Timony , ” you said , “ … alot of the stories , the book of Job in particular , really make g-d look like a huge asshole if you think about it more critically … ” can you explain this further ?
~ OscarGecko
First let me just say thanks to Oscar for being my muse for this round of Ask the Atheist … I appreciate your cooperation very much sir !
Next , I want to clarify my position a little bit and then we will go through the specific example of Job , as the picture it paints of God to the unfaithful .
My position is that the Bible and Job in particular are testaments to the character of YHVH , that they exemplify who he is at his very core rather than who he is when you look at the prettier picture painted by the story of Christian “ salvation ” .
This , not the sacrificial god found in Jesus , is who YHWH truly is , everything else is just what he needs to be to be more acceptable to the masses .
I say that the intent of the new testament is like a huge Public Relations campaign to make YWHW more palatable to those that may not be “ God ’s Chosen People ” .
Of course this is a rather rudimentary simplification of my view , but it should serve my purpose here .
Please note that I am going to present this as if it were not a work of fiction .
As far as I can tell that was not the intention of the author , but many people actually read it that way , so I will do the same .
Job ’s Wealth ( Job 1 )
For those unfamiliar , the book of Job starts off with a description of Job ’s properties and family , he is relatively wealthy for the time period and location in which he lived ( Uz ) .
He had seven sons and three daughters , 7000 sheep , 3000 camels , and 1000 oxen , etc .
Job was so dedicated to YHWH and his family that he would offer up burnt offerings to God just in case his family sinned in their hearts or cursed God without his knowledge .
Job was dedicated … but he also had no real reason not to be , in his view all things come from God ( as later revealed in his debates with his friends in the next few chapters ) .
YHWH makes a wager with an old friend
Though it is n’t well explained in the Bible , part of my former indoctrination was an understanding that Satan is not and never was actually physically in Hell , most of that understanding comes from Job 1 : 6 - 7 and experience as an exorcist ( you know , that thing I wo n’t talk about on this blog ?… that ’s it ) .
My understanding of Lucifer , anthropologically speaking , going back into the early theology of the Jewish cult is that he is much less an actual enemy of god than modern Christianity accepts , but he is more known as a servant of YHVH who ’s job it is to temp man …
I am not going to get into all the details nor am I going to debate it , it ’s just a side note in this thing … but I know someone will gripe about it .
So in Job 1 : 8 YHVH , unprompted by Lucifer , asks if he had considered his servant Job .
He just up and says it …have you considered Job and trying to test him ?
God even continues to talk about how good of a servant Job is , about how Job loves him , and is a righteous man .
Despite the goodness of Job , God just wants Satan to reek havoc on the man and his family .
Permission is then granted for Lucifer to have his way with Job .
Lucifer then opens up the gates of hell on Job .
All of his cattle , all of his servants ( innocent people in this wager ) , all of his children … killed .
Just because YHWH wanted to prove Lucifer wrong .
( Is n’t an omnipotent deity supposed to just know what is true and what is not ?
Suddenly he want ’s proof that Job loves him — and I ’m the bad guy because I do n’t believe Creationism ?????
Give me a break ! )
Is this acceptable behavior for our loving Creator ?
So , to begin my examination of the problem of Job I would like to simply ask :
Is it OK for a ( loving )
God to offer our wealth , happiness , and the lives of our loved ones and other innocent bystanders just for the sake of proving a point ?
I will let you answer that one on your own .
Job defies all logic
All this turmoil befalls Job ; who by the way has no clue that this wager between God and Satan has been made –he does n’t know what do think , he does n’t have any way to know that this is nothing more than a pissing match between two beings far more powerful than he .
The next many chapters are devoted to Job having debates with his acquaintances .
Some of them thing that Job must have been doing something bad for God to allow all of this bad stuff to happen to him , others think that Job should just say “ Screw God ” since he wo n’t protect him from all of it .
Job does not fall unto this temptation though , he simply continues to praise YHWH even in the rubble that was left in his life …
What Job does defies all logical thinking , he worships God , he barely questions God and he submits to God … while everything in me would be giving YHVH the finger Job is on his face before him .
Job neglects his own need for real answers and justice …
My guess is that he does this out of a mixture of fear and devotion .
God makes it all better !
So this whole book ends with God pulling Job out of the ashes of his former glory and providing his status back to him .
YHVH decides to provide Job with all his cattle , donkeys , servants , and his camels … and he doubles them !
Afterward God even gives job a new set of daughters ( prettier than the others ) and sons .
His life is restored to it ’s former glory and beyond ….
HOW WONDERFUL !!!!
But … but wait …
So , all that sounds well and good , I know … God let Job get tested by Satan , Job was faithful to God , so God rewards Job with more stuff … that ’s good right ?
Of course it is , until you think about all that blood … you know , from Satan ’s trials on Job … .
What about all of Jobs dead kids and servants and cattle and such ?
Are their lives so worthless that Job will just forget about them after being provided with shiny new models ?
We are n’t talking about the Lamborghini you wrapped around a tree last year , these are people ’s lives – Living , breathing , talking , loving people .
Can you really justify
God ’s decision to allow all of those deaths ( which , to me , is just as good as pulling the trigger himself ) just to prove a point to a fallen angel and servant Lucifer ?
Does that not fly in the face with Luke 12:7 :
“ But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows . ”
According to this verse mankind is of value to God , the same mankind destined for hell if his lordship is denied , yet he would use our lives as wagering chips in a bet against someone he is supposed to be far more powerful than .
I think Job is the perfect example of the fallacy of the benevolent Biblical model of God , and an assault on my sensibilities .
Stumble , digg , etc please .

Imagine if you crossed Barbarella with Benny Hill and slapped them down in a steampunk universe .
You 'd get weirdo British flick Pervirella , an epic about a damsel who can sex you so hard you explode .
In this alternate universe , full of silly but wonderful steampunk effects , Queen Victoria is a Paul DiFillipo - esque cyborg who is rotting away and keeps spitting weird half - formed babies out of a giant tube that snakes out from under her skirts .
She sends a party of explorers ( including Pervirella and her dad ) out to find some sort of elixir that will either save her , save her babies , or save Pervirella .
I 'm not sure which - maybe all .

S -99 : Ninety - Nine Scala Problems
These are an adaptation of the Ninety - Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne , Switzerland .
I ( Phil Gold ) have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala .
Feedback is appreciated , particularly on anything marked TODO .
The problems have different levels of difficulty .
Those marked with a single asterisk ( * ) are easy .
If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to solve them within a few ( say 15 ) minutes .
Problems marked with two asterisks ( ** ) are of intermediate difficulty .
If you are a skilled Scala programmer it should n't take you more than 30 - 90 minutes to solve them .
Problems marked with three asterisks ( ***) are more difficult .
You may need more time ( i.e. a few hours or more ) to find a good solution .
The difficulties were all assigned for the Prolog problems , but the Scala versions seem to be of roughly similar difficulty .
Your goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems .
Efficiency is important , but clarity is even more crucial .
Some of the ( easy ) problems can be trivially solved using built - in functions .
However , in these cases , you learn more if you try to find your own solution .
Solutions are available by clicking on the link at the beginning of the problem description .
[ I do n't have example solutions to all of the problems yet .
I 'm working on getting them all done , but in the meantime , contributed solutions , particularly from seasoned Scala programmers would be appreciated .
If you feel a particular problem can be solved in a better manner than I did , please let me know that , too .
< PMG >]
Working with lists
In Scala , lists are objects of type List [ A ] , where A can be any type .
Lists are effective for many recursive algorithms , because it 's easy to add elements to the head of a list , and to get the tail of the list , which is everything but the first element .
The solutions to the problems in this section will be in objects named after the problems ( P01 , P02 , etc. ) .
You can compile the source files with scalac and thereafter use import to bring the functions into scope .
Some of the problems can be solved easily by using imported solutions to previous problems .
In many cases , there 's more than one reasonable approach .
The files linked here may include multiple solutions , with all but one commented out .
They 'll also indicate whether there 's a builtin method in Scala that accomplishes the task .
P01 (*)
Find the last element of a list .
Example : scala > last ( List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) ) res0 : Int = 8 P02 (*)
Find the last but one element of a list .
Example : scala > penultimate ( List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) ) res0 : Int = 5 P03 (*)
Find the Kth element of a list .
By convention , the first element in the list is element 0 . Example : scala > nth ( 2 , List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) ) res0 : Int = 2 P04 (*)
Find the number of elements of a list .
Example : scala > length ( List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) ) res0 : Int = 6 P05 (*) Reverse a list .
Example : scala > reverse( List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) ) res0 : List [ Int ] = List ( 8 , 5 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 1 ) P06 (*)
Find out whether a list is a palindrome .
Example : scala > isPalindrome ( List ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) ) res0 : Boolean = true P07 (**)
Flatten a nested list structure .
Example : scala > flatten ( List ( List ( 1 , 1 ) , 2 , List ( 3 , List ( 5 , 8 ) ) ) ) res0 : List [ Any ] = List ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) P08 (**)
Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements .
If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element .
The order of the elements should not be changed .
Example : scala > compress ( List ( 'a , 'a , 'a , ' a , 'b , 'c , 'c , ' a , ' a , 'd , 'e , 'e , 'e , 'e ) ) res0 : List [ Symbol ] = List ( 'a , 'b , 'c , 'a , 'd , 'e ) P09 (**)
Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists .
If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists .
Example : scala > pack ( List ( 'a , 'a , 'a , ' a , 'b , 'c , 'c , ' a , ' a , 'd , 'e , 'e , 'e , 'e ) ) res0 : List [ List [ Symbol ] ] = List ( List ( 'a , 'a , 'a , ' a ) , List ( 'b ) , List ( 'c , ' c ) , List ( 'a , ' a ) , List ( 'd ) , List ( 'e , 'e , 'e , 'e ) ) P10 (*) Run-length encoding of a list .
Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so - called run-length encoding data compression method .
Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as tuples ( N , E ) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list .
Only elements with duplicates are transferred as ( N , E ) terms .

Run -length encoding of a list ( direct solution ) .
Implement the so - called run-length encoding data compression method directly .
I.e. do n't use other methods you 've written ( like P09 's pack ) ; do all the work directly .

Extract a slice from a list .
Given two indices , I and K , the slice is the list containing the elements from and including the Ith element up to but not including the Kth element of the original list .
Start counting the elements with 0 .

Generate a random permutation of the elements of a list .
Hint : Use the solution of problem P23 .

Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list .
In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people ?
We all know that there are C( 12,3 ) = 220 possibilities ( C( N , K ) denotes the well - known binomial coefficient ) .
For pure mathematicians , this result may be great .
But we want to really generate all the possibilities .
Example : scala > combinations ( 3 , List ( 'a , 'b , 'c , 'd , 'e , 'f ) ) res0 : List [ List [ Symbol ] ] = List ( List ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) , List ( 'a , 'b , 'd ) , List ( 'a , 'b , 'e ) , ... P27 (**)
Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets .
a)
In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups of 2 , 3 and 4 persons ?
Write a function that generates all the possibilities .
Example : scala > group3 ( List ( " Aldo " , " Beat " , " Carla " , " David " , " Evi " , " Flip " , " Gary " , " Hugo " , " Ida " ) ) res0 : List [ List [ List [ String ] ] ] = List ( List ( List ( Aldo , Beat ) , List ( Carla , David , Evi ) , List ( Flip , Gary , Hugo , Ida ) ) , ... b)
Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a list of group sizes and the predicate will return a list of groups .
Example : scala > group ( List ( 2 , 2 , 5 ) , List ( " Aldo " , " Beat " , " Carla " , " David " , " Evi " , " Flip " , " Gary " , " Hugo " , " Ida " ) ) res0 : List [ List [ List [ String ] ] ] = List ( List ( List ( Aldo , Beat ) , List ( Carla , David ) , List ( Evi , Flip , Gary , Hugo , Ida ) ) , ...
Note that we do not want permutations of the group members ; i.e. ( ( Aldo , Beat ) , ... ) is the same solution as ( ( Beat , Aldo ) , ... ) .
However , we make a difference between ( ( Aldo , Beat ) , ( Carla , David ) , ... ) and ( ( Carla , David ) , ( Aldo , Beat ) , ... ) .
You may find more about this combinatorial problem in a good book on discrete mathematics under the term " multinomial coefficients " .
P28 (**)
Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists .
a)
We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves .
The objective is to sort the elements of the list according to their length .
E.g. short lists first , longer lists later , or vice versa .
Example : scala > lsort ( List ( List ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'f , 'g , 'h ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'i , 'j , 'k , 'l ) , List ( 'm , 'n ) , List ( 'o ) ) ) res0 : List [ List [ Symbol ] ] = List ( List ( 'o ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'm , 'n ) , List ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) , List ( 'f , 'g , 'h ) , List ( 'i , 'j , 'k , 'l ) ) b)
Again , we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves .
But this time the objective is to sort the elements according to their length frequency ; i.e. in the default , sorting is done ascendingly , lists with rare lengths are placed , others with a more frequent length come later .
Example : scala > lsortFreq ( List( List ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'f , 'g , 'h ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'i , 'j , 'k , 'l ) , List ( 'm , 'n ) , List ( 'o ) ) ) res1 : List [ List [ Symbol ] ] = List ( List ( 'i , 'j , 'k , 'l ) , List ( 'o ) , List ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) , List ( 'f , 'g , 'h ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'd , 'e ) , List ( 'm , 'n ) )
Note that in the above example , the first two lists in the result have length 4 and 1 and both lengths appear just once .
The third and fourth lists have length 3 and there are two list of this length .
Finally , the last three lists have length 2 .
This is the most frequent length .

The arithmetic1 file contains the starting definitions for this section .
Each individual solution will show the relevant additions to the S99Int class .
The full class will be given at the end of the section .

See problem P34 for the definition of Euler 's totient function .
If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of problem P36 then the function phi(m > ) can be efficiently calculated as follows : Let [ [ p 1 , m 1 ] , [p 2 , m 2 ] , [ p 3 , m 3 ] , ...] be the list of prime factors ( and their multiplicities ) of a given number m.
Then phi(m ) can be calculated with the following formula : phi(m ) = ( p 1 - 1 ) *p 1 ( m 1 - 1 ) * ( p 2 - 1 ) *p 2 ( m 2 - 1 ) * ( p 3 - 1 ) *p 3 ( m 3 - 1 ) * ...

Goldbach 's conjecture .
Goldbach 's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers .
E.g. 28 = 5 + 23 .
It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case .
It has been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers ( much larger than Scala 's Int can represent ) .

In most cases , if an even number is written as the sum of two prime numbers , one of them is very small .
Very rarely , the primes are both bigger than , say , 50 .
Try to find out how many such cases there are in the range 2..3000 .
Example ( minimum value of 50 for the primes ) : scala > printGoldbachListLimited ( 1 to 2000 , 50 ) 992 = 73 + 919 1382 = 61 + 1321 1856 = 67 + 1789 1928 = 61 + 1867

An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according to certain rules .
For example ,

n = 2 : C( 2 ) = ( " 00 " , " 01 " , " 11 " , " 10 " ) .

P50 (***) Huffman code .
First of all , consult a good book on discrete mathematics or algorithms for a detailed description of Huffman codes !
We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies , given as a list of ( S , F ) Tuples .
E.g. ( ( " a " , 45 ) , ( " b " , 13 ) , ( " c " , 12 ) , ( " d " , 16 ) , ( " e " , 9 ) , ( " f " , 5 ) ) .
Our objective is to construct a list of ( S , C ) Tuples , where C is the Huffman code word for the symbol S. scala > huffman( List ( ( " a " , 45 ) , ( " b " , 13 ) , ( " c " , 12 ) , ( " d " , 16 ) , ( " e " , 9 ) , ( " f " , 5 ) ) ) res0 : List [ String , String ] = List ( ( a,0 ) , ( b,101 ) , ( c,100 ) , ( d,111 ) , ( e,1101 ) , ( f,1100 ) )
Binary Trees
A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and two successors , which are binary trees themselves .
We shall use the following classes to represent binary trees .
( Also available in tree1.scala . )
An End is equivalent to an empty tree .
A Branch has a value , and two descendant trees .
The toString functions are relatively arbitrary , but they yield a more compact output than Scala 's default .
Putting a plus in front of the T makes the class covariant ; it will be able to hold subtypes of whatever type it 's created for .
( This is important so that End can be a singleton object ; as a singleton , it must have a specific type , so we give it type Nothing , which is a subtype of every other type . )
sealed abstract class Tree [ + T ] case class Node [ + T ] ( value : T , left : Tree [ T ] , right : Tree [ T ] ) extends Tree [ T ] { override def toString = " T ( " + value.toString + " " + left.toString + " " + right .
toString + " ) " } case object End extends Tree [ Nothing ] { override def toString = " . " } object Node { def apply [ T ] ( value : T ) : Node [ T ] = Node( value , End , End ) }
The example tree on the right is given by
Node ( 'a ' , Node ( 'b ' , Node ( ' d ' ) , Node ( 'e ' ) ) , Node ('c ' , End , Node ( 'f ' , Node ( 'g ' ) , End ) ) )
A tree with only a root node would be Node ( 'a ' ) and an empty tree would be End .
Throughout this section , we will be adding methods to the classes above , mostly to Tree .
P54 Omitted ; our tree representation will only allow well - formed trees .

Construct completely balanced binary trees .
In a completely balanced binary tree , the following property holds for every node :
The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of nodes in its right subtree are almost equal , which means their difference is not greater than one .
Define an object named Tree .
Write a function Tree .
cBalanced to construct completely balanced binary trees for a given number of nodes .
The function should generate all solutions .
The function should take as parameters the number of nodes and a single value to put in all of them .

Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line through the root node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of the left subtree .
Add an isSymmetric method to the Tree class to check whether a given binary tree is symmetric .
Hint : Write an isMirrorOf method first to check whether one tree is the mirror image of another .
We are only interested in the structure , not in the contents of the nodes .
scala > Node ( 'a ' , Node ( 'b ' ) , Node ( 'c ' ) ) .

Hint :
The abstract definition of addValue in Tree should be def add Value [ U > : T .
The > : T is because addValue 's parameters need to be contravariant in T .
( Conceptually , we 're adding nodes above existing nodes .
In order for the subnodes to be of type T or any subtype , the upper nodes must be of type T or any supertype . )
The allows us to use the < operator on the values in the tree .
Use that function to construct a binary tree from a list of integers .
scala > Tree.fromList( List( 3 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 1 ) ) res3 : Node [ Int ] = T ( 3 T ( 2 T ( 1 . . ) . ) T( 5 . T ( 7 . . ) ) )

Construct height - balanced binary trees .
In a height - balanced binary tree , the following property holds for every node :
The height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree are almost equal , which means their difference is not greater than one .
Write a method Tree.hbalTrees to construct height - balanced binary trees for a given height with a supplied value for the nodes .
The function should generate all solutions .
scala > Tree.hbalTrees ( 3 , " x " ) res0 : List [ Node [ String ] ] = List ( T(x T(x T(x . . ) T(x . . ) ) T(x T(x . . ) T(x . . ) ) ) , T(x T(x T(x . . ) T(x . . ) ) T(x T(x . . ) . ) ) , ... P60 (**)
Construct height - balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes .
Consider a height - balanced binary tree of height H . What is the maximum number of nodes it can contain ?
Clearly , MaxN = 2H - 1 .
However , what is the minimum number MinN ?
This question is more difficult .
Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a function minHbalNodes that takes a height and returns MinN. scala > minHbalNodes ( 3 ) res0 : Int = 4
On the other hand , we might ask : what is the maximum height H a height - balanced binary tree with N nodes can have ?
Write a maxHbalHeight function .
scala > maxHbalHeight ( 4 ) res1 : Int = 3
Now , we can attack the main problem : construct all the height - balanced binary trees with a given nuber of nodes .

Collect the nodes at a given level in a list .
A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the node has length N - 1 .
The root node is at level 1 .
Write a method atLevel to collect all nodes at a given level in a list .
scala > Node ( 'a ' , Node ( 'b ' ) , Node ( 'c ' , Node ( 'd ' ) , Node ( 'e ' ) ) ) .atLevel ( 2 ) res0 : List [ Char ] = List ( b , c) Using atLevel it is easy to construct a method levelOrder which creates the level - order sequence of the nodes .
However , there are more efficient ways to do that .
P63 (**) Construct a complete binary tree .
A complete binary tree with height H is defined as follows :
The levels 1,2,3 , ... , H - 1 contain the maximum number of nodes ( i.e 2 ( i - 1 ) at the level i , note that we start counting the levels from 1 at the root ) .
In level H , which may contain less than the maximum possible number of nodes , all the nodes are " left- adjusted " .
This means that in a levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come first , the leaves come second , and empty successors ( the End s which are not really nodes ! ) come last .
Particularly , complete binary trees are used as data structures ( or addressing schemes ) for heaps .
We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree by enumerating the nodes in levelorder , starting at the root with number 1 .
In doing so , we realize that for every node X with address A the following property holds :
The address of X's left and right successors are 2* A and 2 * A+1 , respectively , supposed the successors do exist .
This fact can be used to elegantly construct a complete binary tree structure .
Write a method completeBinaryTree that takes as parameters the number of nodes and the value to put in each node .

Layout a binary tree ( 1 ) .
As a preparation for drawing a tree , a layout algorithm is required to determine the position of each node in a rectangular grid .
Several layout methods are conceivable , one of them is shown in the illustration on the right .
In this layout strategy , the position of a node v is obtained by the following two rules : x ( v ) is equal to the position of the node v in the inorder sequence
) is equal to the position of the node in the inorder sequence y( v ) is equal to the depth of the node v in the tree
In order to store the position of the nodes , we add a new class with the additional information .

Find out the rules and write the corresponding method .
Hint : Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor nodes .
How tight can you pack together two subtrees to construct the combined binary tree ?

P67 (**) A string representation of binary trees .
Somebody represents binary trees as strings of the following type ( see example opposite ) : a ( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) Write a method which generates this string representation , if the tree is given as usual ( in Node s and End s ) .
Use that method for the Tree class 's and subclass 's toString methods .
Then write a method ( on the Tree object ) which does this inverse ; i.e. given the string representation , construct the tree in the usual form .
For simplicity , suppose the information in the nodes is a single letter and there are no spaces in the string .
scala > Node ( 'a ' , Node ( 'b ' , Node ( ' d ' ) , Node ( 'e ' ) ) , Node ('c ' , End , Node ( 'f ' , Node ( 'g ' ) , End ) ) ) .
toString res0 : String = a ( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) scala > Tree.fromString ( " a( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) " ) res1 : Node [ Char ] = a ( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) P68 (**)
Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees .
We consider binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower - case letters , as in the example of problem P67 . a )
Write methods preorder and inorder that construct the preorder and inorder sequence of a given binary tree , respectively .
The results should be lists , e.g. List ( 'a ' , 'b ' , 'd ' , 'e ' , 'c ' , 'f ' , 'g ' ) for the preorder sequence of the example in problem P67. scala > Tree.string2
Tree ( " a( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) " ) . preorder res0 : List [ Char ] = List ( a , b , d , e , c , f , g ) scala > Tree.string2
Tree ( " a( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) " ) . inorder res1 : List [ Char ] = List(d , b , e , a , c , g , f ) b)
If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes of a binary tree are given , then the tree is determined unambiguously .
Write a method preInTree that does the job .
scala > Tree.preInTree( List( 'a ' , 'b ' , 'd ' , 'e ' , 'c ' , 'f ' , ' g ' ) , List ( 'd ' , 'b ' , 'e ' , 'a ' , 'c ' , ' g ' , 'f ' ) ) res2 : Node [ Char ] = a ( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) )
What happens if the same character appears in more than one node ?
Try , for instance , Tree.preInTree( List ( 'a ' , 'b ' , 'a ' ) , List ( 'b ' , 'a ' , ' a ' ) ) .
P69 (**)
Dotstring representation of binary trees .
We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower - case letters , as in the example of problem P67 .
Such a tree can be represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (. ) are inserted where an empty subtree ( End ) is encountered during the tree traversal .
For example , the tree shown in problem P67 is represented as " abd..e..c.fg ... " .
First , try to establish a syntax ( BNF or syntax diagrams ) and then write two methods , toDotstring and fromDotstring , which do the conversion in both directions .
scala > Tree.string2
Tree ( " a( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) ) " ) .
toDotstring res0 : String = abd..e..c.fg ... scala > Tree.fromDotstring (" abd..e..c.fg... " ) res1 : Node [ Char ] = a ( b ( d , e ) , c( , f( g , ) ) )
The file containing the full class definitions for this section is tree. scala .
Multiway Trees
A multiway tree is composed of a root element and a ( possibly empty ) set of successors which are multiway trees themselves .
A multiway tree is never empty .
The set of successor trees is sometimes called a forest .
The code to represent these is somewhat simpler than the code for binary trees , partly because we do n't separate classes for nodes and terminators , and partly because we do n't need the restriction that the value type be ordered .
case class MTree [ +T ] ( value : T , children : List [ MTree [ T ] ] ) { def this ( value : T ) = this ( value , List ( ) ) override def toString = " M ( " + value.toString + " { " + children.map(_.toString ).mkString ( " , " ) + " } ) " } object MTree { def apply [ T ] ( value : T ) = new MTree ( value , List ( ) ) def apply [ T ] ( value : T , children : List [ MTree [ T ] ] ) = new MTree ( value , children ) }
The example tree is , thus :
MTree ( 'a ' , List ( MTree ( 'f ' , List ( MTree ('g ' ) ) ) , MTree ('c ' ) , MTree ( 'b ' , List ( MTree ( 'd ' ) , MTree ( 'e ' ) ) ) ) )
The starting code skeleton for this section is mtree1.scala .
P70B Omitted ; we can only create well - formed trees .
P70C (*)
Count the nodes of a multiway tree .
Write a method nodeCount which counts the nodes of a given multiway tree .
scala > MTree ( 'a ' , List ( MTree ( 'f ' ) ) ) .
nodeCount res0 : Int = 2 P70 (**)
Tree construction from a node string .
We suppose that the nodes of a multiway tree contain single characters .
In the depth - first order sequence of its nodes , a special character ^ has been inserted whenever , during the tree traversal , the move is a backtrack to the previous level .
By this rule , the tree in the figure opposite is represented as : afg^^c^bd ^e^^ ^
Define the syntax of the string and write a function string2MTree to construct an MTree from a String .
Make the function an implicit conversion from String .
Write the reverse function , and make it the toString method of MTree. scala > MTree ( 'a ' , List ( MTree ( 'f ' , List ( MTree ( 'g ' ) ) ) , MTree ('c ' ) , MTree ( 'b ' , List ( MTree ( 'd ' ) , MTree ( 'e ' ) ) ) ) ) .
toString res0 : String = afg^^c^bd^e^^^ P71 (*)
Determine the internal path length of a tree .
We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the total sum of the path lengths from the root to all nodes of the tree .
By this definition , the tree in the figure of problem P70 has an internal path length of 9 .
Write a method internalPathLength to return that sum . scala > " afg^^c^bd^e^^^ " .internalPathLength res0 : Int = 9 P72 (*) Construct the postorder sequence of the tree nodes .
Write a method postorder which constructs the postorder sequence of the nodes of a multiway tree .
The result should be a List . scala > " afg^^c^bd^e^^^ " .
postorder res0 : List [ Char ] = List ( g , f , c , d , e , b , a ) P73 (**)
Lisp - like tree representation .
There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp .
Lisp is a prominent functional programming language .
In Lisp almost everything is a list .
Our example tree would be represented in Lisp as ( a ( f g ) c ( b d e ) ) .
The following pictures give some more examples .
Note that in the " lispy " notation a node with successors ( children ) in the tree is always the first element in a list , followed by its children .
The " lispy " representation of a multiway tree is a sequence of atoms and parentheses '(' and ' ) ' , with the atoms separated by spaces .
We can represent this syntax as a Scala String .
Write a method lispyTree which constructs a " lispy string " from an MTree . scala > MTree ( " a " , List ( MTree ( " b " , List ( MTree ( " c " ) ) ) ) ) .lispyTree res0 : String = ( a ( b c ) )
As a second , even more interesting , exercise try to write a method that takes a " lispy " string and turns it into a multiway tree .
[ Note : Much of this problem is taken from the wording of the same problem in the Prolog set .
This is certainly one way of looking at Lisp notation , but it 's not how the language actually represents that syntax internally .
I can elaborate more on this , if requested .

Graphs
A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges , where each edge is a pair of nodes .
The class to represent a graph is mutable , which is n't in keeping with pure functional programming , but a pure functional data structure would make things much , much more complicated .
[ Pure functional graphs with cycles require laziness ; I think Scala can handle it , but I think that would add too much of a barrier to the following questions .
< PMG >]
Our Graph s use an incidence list internally .
Each has a list of nodes and a list of edges .
Each node also has a list of edges that connect it to other nodes .
In a directed graph , nodes that are the target of arcs do not have references to those arcs in their adjacency list .
abstract class GraphBase [ T , U ] { case class Edge ( n1 : Node , n2 : Node , value : U ) { def toTuple = ( n1.value , n2.value , value ) } case class Node ( value : T ) { var adj : List [ Edge ] =
Nil def neighbors : List [ Node ] = adj.map(edgeTarget(_ , this ) . get ) } var nodes : Map [T , Node ] = Map ( ) var edges : List [ Edge ] = Nil //
If the edge E connects N to another node , returns the other node , // otherwise returns None. def edgeTarget(e : Edge , n : Node ) : Option [ Node ] override def equals ( o : Any ) = o match { case g : GraphBase [ T , U ] => ( nodes.keys.toList -- g.nodes.keys.toList == Nil && edges.map(_.toTuple ) -- g.edges.map( _.toTuple ) == Nil ) case _ => false } def addNode ( value : T ) = { val n = new Node ( value ) nodes = Map( value -> n ) ++ nodes n } } class Graph [ T , U ] extends GraphBase [ T , U ] { override def equals ( o : Any ) = o match { case g : Graph [ T , U ] => super.equals ( g ) case _ => false } def edgeTarget(e : Edge , n : Node ) : Option [ Node ] = if ( e.n1 == n ) Some ( e.n2 ) else if ( e.n2 == n ) Some ( e.n1 ) else None def add Edge( n1 : T , n2 : T , value : U ) = { val e = new Edge ( nodes ( n1 ) , nodes ( n2 ) , value ) edges = e :: edges nodes ( n1 ) .adj = e :: nodes ( n1 ) .adj nodes ( n2 ) .adj = e :: nodes ( n2 ) .adj } } class Digraph [ T , U ] extends GraphBase [ T , U ] { override def equals ( o : Any ) = o match { case g : Digraph [ T , U ] => super.equals ( g ) case _ => false } def edgeTarget(e : Edge , n : Node ) : Option [ Node ] = if ( e.n1 == n ) Some ( e.n2 ) else None def add Arc( source : T , dest : T , value : U ) = { val e = new Edge ( nodes ( source ) , nodes ( dest ) , value ) edges = e :: edges nodes ( source ) .adj = e :: nodes ( source ) .adj } }
The full initial Graph code , which also includes objects for creating graphs , is in graph1.scala .
There are a few ways to create a graph from primitives .
The graph - term form lists the nodes and edges separately :
Graph.term( List ( 'b ' , 'c' , ' d ' , 'f ' , ' g ' , ' h ' , ' k ' ) , List ( ( 'b ' , ' c ' ) , ( 'b ' , 'f ' ) , ( ' c ' , 'f ' ) , ( 'f ' , 'k ' ) , ( ' g ' , ' h ' ) ) )
The adjacency - list form associates each node with its adjacent nodes .
In an undirected graph , care must be taken to ensure that all links are symmetric -- if b is adjacent to c , c must also be adjacent to b .
Graph.adjacent( List ( ( 'b ' , List ( 'c ' , 'f ' ) ) , ( ' c ' , List ( 'b ' , 'f ' ) ) , ( ' d ' , Nil ) , ( 'f ' , List ( 'b ' , ' c ' , ' k ' ) ) , ( ' g ' , List ( ' h ' ) ) , ( 'h ' , List ( ' g ' ) ) , ( ' k ' , List ( ' f ' ) ) ) )
The representations we introduced so far are bound to our implementation and therefore well suited for automated processing , but their syntax is not very user - friendly .
Typing the terms by hand is cumbersome and error - prone .
We can define a more compact and " human - friendly " notation as follows :
A graph is represented by a string of terms of the type X or Y - Z separated by commas .
The standalone terms stand for isolated nodes , the Y - Z terms describe edges .
If an X appears as an endpoint of an edge , it is automatically defined as a node .
Our example could be written as :
[ b - c , f - c , g- h , d , f- b , k - f , h- g ]
We call this the human - friendly form .
As the example shows , the list does not have to be sorted and may even contain the same edge multiple times .
Notice the isolated node d .
When the edges of a graph are directed , we call them arcs .
These are represented by ordered pairs .
Such a graph is called directed graph .
To represent a directed graph , the forms discussed above are slightly modified .
The example graph opposite is represented as follows :
graph - term form :
Digraph.term( List ( 'r ' , 's ' , 't ' , 'u ' , 'v ' ) , List ( ( 's ' , 'r ' ) , ( 's ' , 'u ' ) , ( 'u ' , 'r ' ) , ( 'u ' , 's ' ) , ( ' v ' , 'u ' ) ) )
adjacency - list form :
Digraph.adjacent( List ( ( 'r ' , Nil ) , ( 's ' , List ( 'r ' , 'u ' ) ) , ( 't ' , Nil ) , ( 'u ' , List ( 'r ' , 's ' ) ) , ( ' v' , List ( 'u ' ) ) ) )
( Note that the adjacency - list form is the same for graphs and digraphs . )
human - friendly form :
[ s>r , t , u>r , s>u , u>s , v>u ]
Finally , graphs and digraphs may have additional information attached to nodes and edges ( arcs ) .
For the nodes , this is no problem , as we can put any type into them .
On the other hand , for edges we have to extend our notation .
Graphs with additional information attached to edges are called labeled graphs .
graph - term form :
Digraph.termLabel( List ('k ' , 'm ' , ' p ' , 'q ' ) , List ( ( 'm ' , 'q ' , 7 ) , ( ' p ' , 'm ' , 5 ) , ( ' p ' , 'q ' , 9 ) ) )
adjacency - list form :
Digraph.adjacentLabel(
List ( ('k ' , Nil ) , ( 'm ' , List ( ( 'q ' , 7 ) ) ) , ( ' p ' , List ( ( 'm ' , 5 ) , ( ' q ' , 9 ) ) ) , ( 'q ' , Nil ) ) )
human - friendly form :
[ p>q/9 , m>q/ 7 , k , p>m/5 ]
The notation for labeled graphs can also be used for so - called multi-graphs , where more than one edge ( or arc ) is allowed between two given nodes .

I know we wrote about Boehner 's tobacco ties when he fought to become minority leader ...
In this 1996 documentary by PBS called " The People and the Power Game , " John Boehner is caught red - handed in an amazing act of corruption , and his biggest critics are fellow Republicans .
Boehner : Mine asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied .
I did it on the House floor which I regret and I should not have done , it 's not a violation of the House rules , but it 's a practice that 's gone on here for a long time .
Were the checks from tobacco companies ?
Boehner : Ahh , I think if my memory serves me correctly , I think it was a tobacco company , yes .
Q ) .... but in this case tobacco 's well timed contributions helped save its subsidy .
The people that were passing out the checks won .
So how did he become their leader in the HOUSE ?
Oh right , being corrupt is just fine for Republicans , but they put a hold on the Solis nomination for something her husband is involved in and she had nothing to do with .
And yet the media uses John Boehner as a spokesman bashing the stimulus package as if he 's been a clean member of the Republican party .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Saturday the United States would not accept a nuclear - armed North Korea and he warned Pyongyang against transferring nuclear material overseas .
A South Korean newspaper reported that Pyongyang was preparing to move an intercontinental ballistic missile from a factory near the capital to a launch site on the east coast .
In a speech to the Asia Security Conference in Singapore , Gates said the threat from North Korea , which this week detonated a nuclear device and launched a series of missiles , could start an arms race in Asia .
“ We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us , ” he said .
“ We will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state . ”
North Korea -- one of the world ’s last remaining Communist states -- has said it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
It threatened further actions in response to any U.N. censure .
Gates said Washington would hold North Korea accountable if it transferred any nuclear material outside its borders .
Impoverished North Korea has earned billions of dollars from exporting missile technology to Pakistan and the Middle East , defense analysts say .
Gates did not elaborate on how the United States might respond .
He had earlier said no additional troops were being deployed to the peninsula , where 28,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed , and he emphasized diplomacy in his remarks .
HEIGHTENED ALERT
South Korean and U.S. troops were on heightened alert over the possibility that Pyongyang may provoke an incident along their heavily armed border .
North Korea has said it might test an intercontinental ballistic missile in response to U.N. punishment for what Pyongyang said was a satellite launch on April 5 .
“ Preparations to move an ICBM from the Saneum Weapons Research Center near Pyongyang by train have been captured by U.S. spy satellites , ” South Korea ’s Dong -a Ilbo newspaper quoted a source in Washington as saying .
The research lab is the North ’s main center of research and manufacture of long - range missiles , the newspaper said .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
South Korea ’s defense ministry had no immediate comment .
A U.S. defense official said the United States had observed “ above average activity ” at a site in North Korea that has previously been used to test - fire long - range missiles .
In New York , the United States and Japan circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the claimed nuclear test and demanding strict enforcement of sanctions imposed after the North ’s first atomic test in October 2006 .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
In Moscow , the Kremlin said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso agreed on the need for a serious response to North Korea .
“ The parties shared the view that there is a need to most seriously respond to these steps , representing a challenge to the international security system , ” a Kremlin statement said .
Gates said North Korea was not a direct military threat now .
“ If ( the North Koreans ) continue on a path they are on , I think the consequences for stability in the region are significant and I think it poses the potential for some kind of an arms race in this region , ” Gates said .
He met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the Singapore conference .
Western diplomats said permanent Security Council members Russia and China have agreed in principle that North Korea should be sanctioned for its nuclear test but it was not clear what kind of penalties they would support .
Both are generally reluctant to approve sanctions .
“ Our hope is that all parties concerned will remain cool - headed and take measures to address the problem , ” Ma Xiaotian , The Chinese army ’s deputy chief , told the conference .
“ Our view is that the Korean peninsula should move toward denuclearization . ”
U.S. officials have urged China to pressure North Korea to step back from nuclear brinkmanship and return to stalled disarmament talks .
But many Chinese analysts say Washington overstates Beijing ’s sway over Pyongyang , as well as their government ’s willingness to use that influence .
North Korea was celebrating the nuclear test in rallies and meetings across the country , “ highly proud and honored with the status of the country as a nuclear weapons state , ” the official KCNA news agency said .
I found it surprising that this WSJ story on “ red light camera ” rage — and I ’m waiting for the moment some fool checking his “ Trapster ” on his PDA blows a light and crashes — made it through an entire article without mentioning a. ) the number of people killed in red - light running crashes ( uh , more than 9/11 every year ) ; b. ) how countries with an increased adoption of the technology have made more impressive gains in their traffic safety records and c. ) that rear - end crashes , which critics always cite as rising after installation of the cameras , are relatively minor in nature ; while side impact crashes , which studies have shown have been reduced after installation of the cameras , tend to be more serious , and often fatal — to compare them so casually is typical of myopic mainstream - media reporting when it comes to traffic safety .
The story notes the study that found that “ governments use traffic tickets as a means of generating revenue ” ; it might also go to the trouble to cite the related study that , while finding truth in that , also found jurisdictions had improved their traffic safety .
Traffic fatalities and injuries in and of themselves are a hidden “ fine , ” or “ tax ” if you will , that each year cost the U.S. more than the much - touted productively losses due to congestion .
Looking also at studies that show tickets reduce the likelihood of a driver subsequently being involved in a fatal crash , fines can also be viewed as expenditure reducers .
Not to mention that the fact that I was taught , as every driver is , to maintain a sufficient following distance from the vehicle ahead — so much so that you could stop in time if the person ahead had to do something like slam on their brakes ( particularly at complicated places like intersections ) .
The administration 's comprehensive climate change announcement today is being cast in bold , efficacious terms : through 2016 , new CAFE standards will take the equivalent of 177 million cars off the road -- or shut down 194 coal plants .
Mindful of the economy , administration officials point to a change in the way standards are measured .
No longer will they be corporation - wide ; reductions will be expected in each type of automobile , which the White House believes will preserve an element of consumer choice .
Vehicles will cost about $ 600 more , on average , to ratchet up the standards .
As for California , its waiver request is still percolating through the federal bureaucracy .
But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will reportedly defer to the new federal standard .
Auto companies are also on board with this -- they 'll issue a statement supporting the federal standard today .
( " Chrysler welcomes the President 's announcement of a framework for a single national approach for fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards .
We thank the Administration for their leadership . " )
The administration and stakeholders have been meeting about this for weeks , although they say it is not a direct offspring of similar talks between environmental activists and auto companies brought together by the Aspen Institute .

Conservative leader says he wants people with no background in Tory politics to consider standing as candidates for parliament
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
David Cameron today hinted at a desire to clear out the Conservative old guard when he said he wanted people with no background in Tory politics to consider standing for parliament as Conservative MPs .
In a move that suggests he feels the modernisation of the Conservative party has not gone far enough , Cameron said he would change party procedures to allow new people to put their names forward .
His comments are significant because the Tories will have to find candidates to stand in safe seats where MPs are standing down as a result of the expenses scandal .
Four backbenchers have already said they will not seek re-election as a result of the revelations , and more are expected to follow .
In an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr programme today , Cameron said he did not want parliament to be full of " robots " .
" What I 'm going to do today is I 'm going to reopen the Conservative candidate list to anybody who wants to apply , " he said .
" They may not have had anything to do with the party before .
" But I 'm saying , if you believe in public service , if you share our values , if you want to help us clean up politics , come and be a Conservative candidate . "
The development suggests he would like to use the expenses controversy as an opportunity for a clearout of some of his party 's MPs .
He has been concerned that recent stories about the lifestyles of Tory MPs have reinforced perceptions that his party is out of touch with ordinary voters , and he knows some of his older MPs have little enthusiasm for his modernising policies .
Cameron also said he wanted his party to use more " open primaries " – selection contests open to people who are not party members – to select Tory candidates and that , if he were prime minister , he would allow more free votes in parliament if bills were not part of his party 's manifesto .
He added that the decision of his former aide , Andrew Mackay , to announce that he would stand down from parliament was the correct one .
The Tory leader said he had had a " straightforward conversation " with Mackay about it yesterday before the announcement was made .
" It was absolutely the right thing for him to retire , " he said .
" It was one of the most serious cases .
It was a misjudgement and he is paying the price for that . "
Mackay 's departure , marking Cameron 's first loss from his inner circle , came after two weeks in which Labour had appeared more damaged than the Conservatives by the stream of revelations in the Telegraph .
His expenses claims came to light as a result of checks by Tory officials ahead of publication in the Telegraph .
Paperwork showed that while he claimed the London home for which both he and his wife , Julie Kirkbride , the Tory MP for Bromsgrove , were named on the mortgage , as his second home , he did not appear to have a main home of his own since he did not have a house in his Bracknell constituency .
MPs with only one home are not entitled to a second home allowance .
The spotlight will now inevitably turn on Kirkbride , who came under further pressure today after the News of the World reported that her brother , Ian , had lived at the couple 's Worcestershire home since 2004 .
She rushed out a statement saying her brother spent time at both of their homes , but insisted she had nothing to apologise for .
" My brother Ian stays in my Bromsgrove apartment and in my London home from time to time to help look after my son , " she said .
" I claim no expenses for my brother and neither do I pay him or claim for his help .
He also acts as a volunteer in helping me with office work and administration . "
Claims that he had been living there " rent - free " at taxpayers ' expense were a " total distortion , " she said .
Yesterday , shoppers queued in Bromsgrove town centre to sign a petition calling for her to resign , but the Tory leader said : " She genuinely lives in London , her children go to school in London .
We have to look at that case separately . "
Cameron said the party had already used open primaries to select candidates in some constituencies , and they had been very successful .
" It worked fantastically well and I want to see more of it , " he added .
He suggested that the use of primaries could lead to celebrities such as such as Joanna Lumley becoming MPs .
The three main parties fear they could be severely punished as voters desert to smaller parties untainted by the expenses scandal .
With dozens of MPs across all parties now said to be considering stepping down , the former cabinet minister Ian McCartney announced he would quit at the next election .
Colleagues said although he was not regarded as having been a particularly excessive claimant , he had suffered a furious backlash from constituents in Makerfield over his published expenses .
He had already offered to pay back around £ 15,000 after purchasing items including champagne flutes .
McCartney was for many years regarded as an invaluable and trusted bridge between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown .
The Sunday Telegraph has placed senior Liberal Democrat MP Malcolm Bruce in the spotlight , saying he claimed for thousands of pounds towards the running of both his London flat and his constituency home , where his wife worked for him .
Normally MPs can only claim expenses for their second homes .
The newspaper said he was one of 200 MPs who had been able to claim money for a main home , in addition to their second home , because their spouses worked there on parliamentary business .
It said Derek Conway , the MP expelled last year from the Tory party over payments to his two sons , was able to claim for office expenses at a family home in Morpeth , Northumberland , as well as mortgage interest on his designated second home in London , although the Morpeth house is more than 300 miles from his Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency .
The Labour minister Quentin Davies is said to have claimed more than £ 10,000 to repair window frames at an 18th - century mansion in Lincolnshire designated as his second home .

Showcasing photos of St Michael ’s Mount from photographers who ’ve beautifully captured this iconic landmark in Cornwall where I live .
Before we begin , here ’s some brief information about St Michael ’s Mount .
About St Michael ’s Mount
The island is set a few hundred yards from the shore at Marazion , Cornwall , England and is only accessible by foot at mid to low tide .
Set atop the island is the Castle overlooking the whole of Mounts Bay and the Lizard .
Little is known about the village before the beginning of 18th century , save that there were a few fishermen ’s cottages and monastic cottages .
After improvements to the harbour in 1727 , St Michael ’s Mount became a flourishing seaport , and by 1811 there were 53 houses and four streets .
In 1954 , the 3rd Baron St Levan gave most of St Michael ’s Mount to the National Trust , together with a large endowment fund .
The St Aubyn family retained a 999 - year lease to inhabit the castle and a licence to manage the public viewing of its historic rooms .
This is managed in conjunction with the National Trust .
St Michel ’s Mount Photography
Here are some stunning photographs of St Michael ’s Mount , Cornwall
Whilst all of these photographs are of St Michael ’s Mount , there are dozens more villages , landmarks and places throughout Cornwall that are a photographers paradise and we ’ll be showcasing these in the coming months .

BEMIDJI , Minn .  Ziggy Zerott arrived at his modest downtown clothing store , Cool Threads , in this small northern Minnesota city on Thursday morning to find something he had never seen in his 27 years of business : a line .
Fifteen to 20 people , he said , were waiting for him to open .
Four days earlier the men ’s hockey team from little Bemidji ( Be - MIDGE - ee ) State University , Zerott ’s alma mater , had advanced to the Frozen Four , the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. hockey tournament , for the first time .
Zerott stocks Bemidji State apparel , and once Beavers fans heard Frozen Four T - shirts had come in , a run was on .
Unwilling to let customers stand in the cold , Zerott opened his store with the imitation log cabin front a half - hour early , at 9:30 a.m .
“ By 10:15 we were wiped out , ” Zerott said .
The day ’s receipts , he said , exceeded his previous best day by 50 percent .
“ And Friday was a little bit better , ” he said .
So on Saturday , when Cool Threads is normally closed , Zerott and an employee manned the register while customers perused racks of green B.S.U. gear .
Image Senior forward Tyler Scofield scored nine of his 22 goals on Bemidji States strong power play , which ranks sixth in Division I. Credit ...
Bemidji State University
“ We ca n’t even keep up with our regular Bemidji State stuff , ” he said .
“ We did n’t expect this .
I was in Grand Rapids for the regional .
I did n’t think we ’d beat Notre Dame . ”
The economy tanks , war in Afghanistan heats up and spreads to a nuclear Pakistan , and climate change escalates even faster than scientists originally predicted .
But the real controversy , the real issue of the moment facing Americans ?
Carrie Prejean ( currently Miss California , runner - up to Miss USA ) takes on gay marriage .
She ’s opposed , in the name of God and her Christian faith — “ no disrespect intended . ”
Clearly the culture wars wage on , though pressure continues to build on President Obama to weigh in on same - sex marriage , in which case all bets are off .
A Supreme Court appointment may even be at stake .
For those who do n’t follow this sort of thing , three weeks ago Miss USA contestant Carrie Prejean was asked by judge Perez Hilton whether she thought gay marriage should be legal , to which Miss California responded “ I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman . ”
Later , in a videotaped response to questions over whether her position on gay marriage cost her the contest , Hilton unloaded , saying that she did n’t lose because she opposed gay marriage but because she ’s “ a dumb b***h. ”
In the following days , Ms. Prejean became something of a cause célèbre for many on the religious right , including James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family .
Bad Theology Leads to Bad Ethics
For my part , beauty pageants ceased to be of interest some time ago .
In my opinion they are exercises in the banality of soft - core pornography ; a feminist critique that appeared over thirty years ago .
So it would normally be ridiculous to weigh in on this brouhaha , except that in this case the ethical and theological implications of opposition to same - sex marriage — always in the name of God and Christian faith — are horrible for those who do n’t agree with her position , at least some of whom understand themselves to be Christian .
Furthermore , the ironies and inconsistencies that riddle her claims and those of her defenders reveal a deep ambivalence toward human embodiment that extends , beyond the fatuousness of their assertions and their religious loyalties , to the culture at large .
Of course , each citizen has guaranteed rights to religious expression and free speech , but what are the implications of what we express in terms of what we actually practice ?
And how do our practices affect one another ?
In the last analysis , this is a matter of bad theology and cultural hypocrisy leading to bad ethics .
Regarding cultural hypocrisy , Carrie Prejean had breast implant surgery just weeks before the pageant , bought and paid for by the California Pageant people at her request .
More recently , photos of Prejean bare - breasted have surfaced ( and keep surfacing — see left half of story image ) .
She was seventeen at the time they were taken .
Apparently unaware that the country is currently debating whether to criminalize “ sexting ” by minors as the transmission of pornography ( a conviction that could label them as sexual predators for the rest of their lives ) , her response is quite simply that she was a model at the time and that everyone makes mistakes .
And , she asserted once again that she is now a Christian .
Oblivious to the possibility that theological consistency might lead to a conclusion that a god who prohibits homosexuality and homosexual marriage would not look favorably upon her interventions with her own body , she stands by her claim that God intends heterosexual marriage exclusively .
The responses from her defenders exhibit the same theological inconsistencies and cultural hypocrisy , by and large portray her as a victim of the liberal entertainment industry , praising her courage , hailing her as their spokeswoman , and by extension God ’s .
Jerry Falwell Jr. , Chancellor of Liberty University , has offered her a free ride at Liberty to complete her college education .
He noted that all of the male students currently enrolled , having seen her bikini pictures , would line up to donate the funds personally .
( It ’s not entirely clear whether she can meet the dress code , once she were to arrive , however . )
Shrouding Sexual Titillation and Drooling Voyeurism with the Patina of Beauty and Virtue
One commenter on the Miss USA site , a budding theologian identified only as “ CF , ” asserted that it was obvious that God intended heterosexual sex only , based on anatomy and electricity ( not election ) .
CF likened male - female intercourse to plugging in a television set , writing , “ If you look at the anatomy of a male and female , you ’ll notice that it works in the same way .
The male end goes into the female end .
And , you need to know that the ‘ inward ’ end on a male , is NOT a female end !
That is an ‘ EXIT ONLY ’ end , just as it is for a female . ”
( What would Thomas Aquinas say ?
Or , alternatively , Joe the Electrician ?
Is this the price we pay for lack of sex education in the public schools ? )
One obviously exasperated respondent to CF ’s wisdom wrote back emphatically :
Quite simply , gay relationships are not meant to be , period .
Thus , “ gay marriage ” does not exist with God… HOWEVER , A GIRL IN BIKINI IN FRONT OF MILLIONS OF MEN , IT ’S OK ?
HEY CF , WHAT RELIGION DO YOU BELONG TO , OR WHO ’S YOUR GOD FIGURE ?
Two very astute theological questions .
The sad truth is that neither a feminist ’s nor a theologian ’s work is ever done .
The critique still holds .
We as a nation promote biologically reductionistic , soft - porn views of human bodies and human sexuality , views that do real violence to real people .
Do n’t get me wrong ; my objection is not to naked bodies and eroticism , but to shrouding sexual titillation and drooling voyeurism with the patina of beauty and virtue , a phenomenon hardly restricted to the religious right alone .
We do n’t have to be right - wing evangelicals to be confused about our own flesh ; bought , marketed , and consumed through various print and electronic media .
Indeed , the Carrie Prejeans and Jerry Falwells Jr. of the world are just more transparent .
Another case in point , Sarah Palin ’s daughter Bristol recently appeared on the Today show , sitting next to her father , her aptly named son Trip nestled asleep on her arm .
She struggled to articulate her sense of her newfound mission to travel around the country urging adolescents to abstain from sex in order to avoid early pregnancy and motherhood .
She tried to find words to express how baby Trip himself was a blessing not a mistake , but premarital sex and pregnancy were to be avoided .
She simply kept repeating to Matt Lauer , “ It ’s hard work all the time [ to rear a child ] . ”
Her father stepped in and simply spoke for her , though he struggled as well .
If You See Someone Ugly - Looking , Do n’t Judge ’Em
Almost concurrently , the news broke on the first face transplant in America .
Connie Culp , shot in the face five years ago by her husband , standing with shotgun a mere eight feet from her , appeared on the screen .
Her new face , still a work in progress , is a grotesque image in no way resembling her earlier likeness , though a definite improvement over the face her husband left her with .
Before the transplant ( but 30 plastic surgeries after the assault ) , she had no palate , no sense of smell ; she could take food only through a straw .
Now blind in one eye , she , like Bristol , struggled for words : “ If you see someone [ ugly - looking ] , do n’t judge ’em , ” she pleaded , “ because you never know what happened to ’em . ”
Of her husband ’s upcoming release from prison in 2012 , she said , “ Do n’t go there , ” adding , “ I ’ll always love him ; he was my first love . ”
I am left with sad musings rather than great , profound responses to the messiness of our attitudes toward our bodies and the loves with which we love one another .
This much is clear : Marriage as we know it is all too often a nasty arrangement .
Nearly half of American heterosexual marriages end in divorce ( down from an earlier era ) .
Irrespective of its nastiness , it is first and foremost a legal determination , essentially for economic purposes , a matter of State , not Church , and in this country the State is banned from establishing religion in any form .
Nastiness notwithstanding , to bear and rear children outside the institution of marriage in this country is , as Bristol Palin declared so plaintively , “ hard work all the time ” at best , and especially cruel for mothers ( unless , of course , you are Angelina Jolie or Madonna ) .
As for Carrie Prejean , no disrespect intended , I believe it presumptuous to speak on the subject of marriage so easily , for God and all Christians .
Nevertheless , she too is a victim of a cultural pornography that cuts across the political spectrum , masking itself as beauty , virtue , and moral outrage .
Both Prejean and Palin are being used , albeit with their own cooperation ; we might do well to consider Connie Culp ’s plea :
“ If you see someone [ ugly - looking ] , do n’t judge ’em , because you never know what happened to ’em . ”
We project gods , secular as well as religious , that bear remarkable resemblances to ourselves and proceed to absolutize our most cherished values as universal , binding to all , whether they share those values or not .
We proceed to act accordingly in their name , punishing those who resist .
Thus , our gods say much about who we are , what we hold dear , what we dream for the future .
I think the exasperated respondent got it right when asking CF , “ WHAT RELIGION DO YOU BELONG TO , OR WHO ’S YOUR GOD FIGURE ? ”

Under the fuel through artificial photosynthesis scenario , nanotubes embedded within a membrane would act like green leaves , using incident solar radiation ( Hγ ) to split water molecules ( H2O ) , freeing up electrons and oxygen ( O2 ) that then react with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) to produce a fuel , shown here as methanol ( CH3OH ) .
The result is a renewable green energy source that also helps scrub the atmosphere of excessive carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels .
Credit : Robert Flavio , Berkeley Lab Public Affairs
( PhysOrg.com ) --
For millions of years , green plants have employed photosynthesis to capture energy from sunlight and convert it into electrochemical energy .
A goal of scientists has been to develop an artificial version of photosynthesis that can be used to produce liquid fuels from carbon dioxide and water .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) have now taken a critical step towards this goal with the discovery that nano - sized crystals of cobalt oxide can effectively carry out the critical photosynthetic reaction of splitting water molecules .
" Photooxidation of water molecules into oxygen , electrons and protons ( hydrogen ions ) is one of the two essential half reactions of an artifical photosynthesis system - it provides the electrons needed to reduce carbon dioxide to a fuel , " said Heinz Frei , a chemist with Berkeley Lab's Physical Biosciences Division , who conducted this research with his postdoctoral fellow Feng Jiao .
" Effective photooxidation requires a catalyst that is both efficient in its use of solar photons and fast enough to keep up with solar flux in order to avoid wasting those photons .
Clusters of cobalt oxide nanocrystals are sufficiently efficient and fast , and are also robust ( last a long time ) and abundant .
They perfectly fit the bill . "
In this video , an aqueous solution contains silica particles that have been embedded with photooxidizing cobalt oxide nanocrystals plus a sensitizer to allow the water - splitting reaction to be driven by visible light .
When laser light hits the solution it turns from gold to blue as the sensitizer absorbs light .
Bubbles soon begin to form as oxygen gas is released from the spilt water molecules .
Frei and Jiao have reported the results of their study in the journal Angewandte Chemie , in a paper entitled : " Nanostructured Cobalt Oxide Clusters in Mesoporous Silica as Efficient Oxygen - Evolving Catalysts . "
This research was performed through the Helios Solar Energy Research Center ( Helios SERC ) , a scientific program at Berkeley Lab under the direction of Paul Alivisatos , which is aimed at developing fuels from sunlight .
Frei serves as deputy director of Helios SERC .
Artificial photosynthesis for the production of liquid fuels offers the promise of a renewable and carbon - neutral source of transportation energy , meaning it would not contribute to the global warming that results from the burning of oil and coal .
The idea is to improve upon the process that has long - served green plants and certain bacteria by integrating into a single platform light - harvesting systems that can capture solar photons and catalytic systems that can oxidize water - in other words , an artificial leaf .
" To take advantage of the flexibility and precision by which light absorption , charge transport and catalytic properties can be controlled by discrete inorganic molecular structures , we have been working with polynuclear metal oxide nanoclusters in silica , " Frei said .
" In earlier work , we found that iridium oxide was efficient and fast enough to do the job , but iridium is the least abundant metal on earth and not suitable for use on a very large scale .
We needed a metal that was equally effective but far more abundant . "
Green plants perform the photooxidation of water molecules within a complex of proteins called Photosystem II , in which manganese - containing enzymes serve as the catalyst .
Manganese - based organometallic complexes modeled off Photosystem II have shown some promise as photocatalysts for water oxidation but some suffer from being water insoluble and none are very robust .
In looking for purely inorganic catalysts that would dissolve in water and would be far more robust than biomimetic materials , Frei and Jiao turned to cobalt oxide , a highly abundant material that is an an important industrial catalyst .
When Frei and Jiao tested micron - sized particles of cobalt oxide , they found the particles were inefficient and not nearly fast enough to serve as photocatalysts .
However , when they nano - sized the particles it was another story .
" The yield for clusters of cobalt oxide ( Co 3 O 4 ) nano - sized crystals was about 1,600 times higher than for micron - sized particles , " said Frei , " and the turnover frequency ( speed ) was about 1,140 oxygen molecules per second per cluster , which is commensurate with solar flux at ground level ( approximately 1,000 Watts per square meter ) . "
Frei and Jiao used mesoporous silica as their scaffold , growing their cobalt nanocrystals within the naturally parallel nanoscale channels of the silica via a technique known as " wet impregnation . "
The best performers were rod-shaped crystals measuring 8 nanometers in diameter and 50 nanometers in length , which were interconnected by short bridges to form bundled clusters .
The bundles were shaped like a sphere with a diameter of 35 nanometers .
While the catalytic efficiency of the cobalt metal itself was important , Frei said the major factor behind the enhanced efficiency and speed of the bundles was their size .
" We suspect that the comparatively very large internal area of these 35 nanometer bundles ( where catalysis takes place ) was the main factor behind their increased efficiency , " he said , " because when we produced larger bundles ( 65 nanometer diameters ) , the internal area was reduced and the bundles lost much of that efficiency gain . "
Frei and Jiao will be conducting further studies to gain a better understanding of why their cobalt oxide nanocrystal clusters are such efficient and high - speed photocatalysts and also looking into other metal oxide catalysts .
The next big step , however , will be to integrate the water oxidation half reaction with the carbon dioxide reduction step in an artificial leaf type system .
" The efficiency , speed and size of our cobalt oxide nanocrystal clusters are comparable to Photosystem II , " said Frei .
" When you factor in the abundance of cobalt oxide , the stability of the nanoclusters under use , the modest overpotential and mild pH and temperature conditions , we believe we have a promising catalytic component for developing a viable integrated solar fuel conversion system .
This is the next important challenge in the field of artificial photosynthesis for fuel production . "

A Wall Street Journal blog piece reports that angel investors while still interested in funding startups are scaling back on their average investment size and demanding lower valuations .
In other words , if you should be so lucky as to find a serious angel investor , he will offer you less money for a bigger stake in your company .

The Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire yesterday released its year - end report of angel investing in 2008 , showing that angel investing dollars fell 26.2 % over 2007 , to $ 19.2 billion .
The total number of angel deals fell only 2.9 % , to 55,480 .
What this means : Interest among affluent individual investors to invest in small growing companies has n’t abated much – but those investors are willing to devote fewer dollars to each deal .
“ They are committing less dollars resulting from lower valuations and a cautious approach to investing , ” said Jeffrey Sohl , the Center ’s director , in a news release .
With bank financing so tight , many entrepreneurs hope to find angel investors to provide them some seed money .
But there ’s new evidence that even angel investors are scaling way back – and will continue to .

What all this means is that entrepreneurs will have to become more sophisticated about how they cobble together their financing .
The days of merely writing a business plan and hoping that some kind stranger writes a check are over .
For those willing to learn there are sources for more sophisticated financing lessons .
Pluto is a weird place .
On average , it 's about 6 billion kilometers from the Sun , so it 's very , very cold there .
It 's amazing it has an atmosphere at all ... but even that is weird .
Pluto 's orbit is an ellipse , and right now -- even though it 's slowly pulling away from the Sun -- it 's still near the point in its orbit when it 's closest to the Sun .
The ever - so - slight increase in heat has warmed the solid surface , turning it into gas , pumping up Pluto 's thin air .
And now astronomers have been able to measure that atmosphere with uncanny accuracy , all the way down to the surface .
Using the ESO 's Very Large Telescope together with a spectrometer that has extraordinary resolution -- the ability to distinguish very small differences in the wavelength , or " color " , of infrared light -- they 've been able to make a map of the whole atmosphere from the surface of Pluto all the way up to the top .
What they 've found in general is interesting : the atmosphere is about - 170 Celsius , or 50 degrees warmer than the surface !
That 's not exactly warm , of course ; it 's just barely above the condensation temperature of nitrogen .
What 's really odd , though , is that the atmospheric temperature goes up with height , which is more or less the opposite of the Earth , where the temperature ( in the lower atmosphere ) decreases with increasing height .
In a sense , Pluto 's atmosphere is upside down .
This temperature inversion is due to a process like sweating : as sweat evaporates , it cools our skin .
On Pluto , the frozen gas sublimates ( turns directly to gas ) when warmed , removing heat from the surface .
So the surface cools , and the atmosphere warms .
And there 's more : they found that by number , about 0.5 % of the atmosphere is methane , a number which was previously not known .
In other words , there is one methane molecule for every 199 nitrogen molecules .
This is a pretty astonishing measurement to make .
Pluto is a long way off , and its atmosphere is about 1/100,000 ^th as thick as Earth 's ; it 's almost , but not quite , a vacuum .
Yet there 's enough there , with the right constituents , to profoundly affect how the object behaves .
To be able to make confident measurements of such a thin soup from so far away is another testament to how advanced our science really is .
Because we 're curious apes , we have reached out to an iceball 40 times farther from the Sun than we are and taken its measure .
And we 're doing even more .
In 2015 , the New Horizons probe will fly past Pluto and its small cadre of moons , taking close up pictures and sampling its environment .
These new observations using the VLT will help scientists prepare even better for the fleeting encounter , so that we can maximize the brief time the spacecraft will be near this signpost of the outer solar system .
It 's truly incredible to think of what we can do , simply because we 're curious .

This is based on the previous idea by MrSparkle , but instead of actors playing hippies you hire Mexican actors to say things like " I am a lieutenant within a Mexican drug cartel and have murdered 24 people .
Your country 's marijuana prohibition gives me the money and weapons that allow me to thrive . "
I think stuff like that might actually hit home for a lot of Americans , yet the marijuana reform movement has n't even begun to try aggressive techniques like this .
I think a national anti-prohibition campaign that plays hardball in this way is a great idea .
Chimps are , like us , given to occasional violent outbursts , but they have exponentially greater strength .
Chimps also have , like us , minds enough to lose and memories that can hasten the process .
Wild chimps “ recruited ” by poachers for entertainment watch as their mothers are gunned down  the only way a chimp mother would ever relinquish a child .
Chimps born in captivity are spared that experience , but they suffer the same premature separation from their mothers , isolation from their normal social groups and often mistreatment from trainers and keepers , all traumatic events that have been shown to cause deep psychological scarring and , as in human beings , can lead an animal to overreact to the slightest stimuli : the look in someone ’s eye , the color of someone ’s hair or , as with Ms. Herold ’s friend that day , hair done up in an unaccustomed style .
These are , in short , deeply conflicted beings , evolutionary anomalies that only we could have created : chimps with names and yet no recollection of trees .
The most tragic example of this is Lucy , who lived in the late 1960s and early ’ 70s .
Raised from infancy to age 10 as a human child by the psychologist Maurice Temerlin and his wife , Jane , Lucy made her own meals , mixed her own cocktails , flipped through magazines , slept on soft mattresses , raised a pet cat , learned sign language  and had no contact whatsoever with other chimpanzees .
By the time she reached sexual maturity , however , she became more and more difficult to handle , and the Temerlins decided they had to let Lucy go .
They chose to send her to a place that was the complete opposite of what she knew , a refuge that reintroduces captive chimps into the wild .
Lucy , it will perhaps come as little surprise , struggled mightily .
She refused to socialize with the other chimps , to climb trees , forage for food , make nests .
She took to waiting beneath trees for the others ’ crumbs to fall .
Eventually , Lucy adopted an orphan baby chimp and mothered him until he died three years later of a stomach parasite .
She herself barely survived a bout of hookworm , then began to show enough positive signs of socializing with the others that they were all left for a time to their own devices .
A year later , however , Lucy ’s skeleton was found near the shores of the island refuge , without , some reports said , her hands or feet .
The cause of her death is n’t known , but speculation is that Lucy , always the first to greet human visitors , one day unwittingly approached a group of poachers , who readily seized upon their overeager prey .
Lucy , Travis and all the others died for the same reason that Tulp could n’t draw the actual being seated before him : our ongoing inability to see animals outside our own fraught frame of reference .
The chimp that Tulp , in fear of science , preserved as a mythic human , Temerlin tried to make a human , in science ’s name .
Lost in the shuffle of either agenda were the animals themselves , creatures we still can’t regard and respect for what they are and just leave alone .
What is procrastination ?
Procrastination is defined as putting off something that should be done , intentionally and habitually .
Procrastination is a virus that poisons the mind or soul .
Is it really a virus ?
It is , because it can infect every area of your life .
Once it gets a hold on your life you always find ways to let it rule over you .
You will always be looking for ways to rationalize .
I ’m not talking about going to the gym or painting your living room .
You are an adult and you can decide which of these things have priority in your life .
I am talking about telling someone you forgive them , telling someone you love them , working in your dream job , and even getting straight on what you are going to do for eternity .
I once heard it said “ To know and not to do is not to know ” Repeat twice …
It is actually worse to know and not to do .
At least if you do n’t know you can plead ignorance .
Like a child , “ But I did n’t know ”
The other option is admitting fault .
You willingly participate in the act of not doing .
I know I should go to church but …I know my brother is in town but …I know I should call my Mom but …
These are excuses that we create for us to feel better about the decision we made .
Everyone suffers from a form of Procrastination ; it is just a matter of what degree the disease has affected you .
Why do we procrastinate ?
We have an unfounded belief that there will be a tomorrow .
There I said it .
There may not be a tomorrow .
Do n’t get me wrong I am not preaching that the end of the world is coming .
I am merely stating that for any one of us , there may not be a tomorrow .
You can not argue that there is no guarantee .
You could get hit by a bus leaving work tonight .
You could have a heart attack sitting at your desk this afternoon .
Do you think the victims of 911 had any idea that they would not be returning home that night ?
I am not trying to be morbid but I am trying to make a point .
If you are completely honest , you put off the really important stuff because you feel like you can get to it later “ I ’ll do it tomorrow . ”
Well we all are ticking ; ticking time bombs .
When it comes to death the odds are 1 to 1 that we will all make it .
Let ’s not get too depressed thinking about the end .
What can you do to make sure your case of Procrastinationitus does not go untreated ?
Where do you start ?
The first stage in rehab is admittance .
So once you admit to yourself that you have been procrastinating , then what ?
What can you do about it ?
Action !
Action is the only cure for Procrastination .
Make a decision and make it happen .
Decide what is really important and make sure it does not go undone .
Do n’t let anyone wander about what your intentions are .
Do n’t let anyone wander what your feelings are .
You have to make it happen .
You can always rely on you .
What is your dream job and why are n’t you doing that ?
Les Brown the great motivator said “ You should do something you love so much you would do it for free but you do it so well they pay you to do it . ”
Call your mom , apologize to your brother , and forgive yourself .
Gather up the family and go on that dream vacation .
I would love to but I ca n’t afford that .
You could start saving , work extra , start making plans .
You can do it .
Start today .
Do n’t be a victim .
Tell all of your friends and family about your plans and tell them to hold you accountable .
I ’m not saying quit your job this afternoon and start weaving baskets from your basement .
But if weaving baskets is your dream then start making plans to make that transition .
Start laying the ground work for Melissa ’s Baskets and Accessories , International .
Do n’t just be luke warm , turn up the heat and make sure the people around you can see the boiling pot of activity you call your life .
If you think you can you can and if you think you ca n’t you are probably right .
Now is the time , now is your chance , now not later .
The Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory ( AKA the RoMeLa Project ) at the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech has designed and built a prototype robotic hand that is controlled and operated by compressed air .
Called RAPHaEL ( Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments ) , the robot can hold heavier , solid objects , as well as light or delicate ones such as a light bulb or an egg .
The hand is powered by a compressor air tank at 60 psi and an accordion style tube actuator , with microcontroller commands operating and coordinating the movements of its fingers .
It uses no other motors , and the strength of the grasp is controlled by a change in air pressure , making the hand quite dextrous .
RAPHaEL -- which is part of a larger RoMeLa robot project named CHARLI -- has already won several awards , including grabbing first prize at the 2008 - 2009 Compressed Air and Gas Institute Innovation Award Contest .
RoMeLa researchers envision CHARLI one day roaming the VT campus making friends with students and visitors .
We look forward to that day , but until then , check out RAPHaEL holding some stuff after the break .
The article presents a framework for the analysis of reciprocal effects of mass media — in this case , their impact on subjects of media reports , especially on decision makers in areas of politics and business .
It outlines a feedback model with three sets of variables referring to ( 1 ) media coverage and media as institutions , ( 2 ) awareness and processing of information , and ( 3 ) observable effects on subjects and others .
The article presents several theories that explain effects on decision makers and illustrate the relevance of this approach with empirical data from a broad range of quantitative studies .
In the final section , theoretical and methodological problems of such an approach are discussed .

Breed selection :
One size does n't fit all So many choices . . . but which one 's best for me ?
Introduction
Babe the pig wanted to be a Border Collie , and the popularity of Border Collies soared .
The evil Cruella deVille kidnapped bright - eyed Dalmatians for nefarious purposes , and Dalmatians made it into the top 10 breeds registered by the American Kennel Club .
Lady and the Tramp made Cocker Spaniels more sought after than ever .
The top 10 breeds in AKC registrations in 1995 were Labrador Retriever , Rottweiler , German Shepherd , Golden Retriever , Beagle , Poodle , Cocker Spaniel , Dachshund , Pomeranian , and Yorkshire Terrier .
The Dalmatian has fallen to 11th , but the soon - to - be released live version of 101 Dalmatians should bring numbers up .
More than 130,000 Labs were registered with AKC in 1995 , up from almost 106,000 in 1991 .
The Labrador Retriever gained its reputation as an all - around family companion , great with children , friendly to people and other dogs , an easy - keeper for an active family .
But a Labrador Retriever in a family that is not prepared for a large , boisterous , energetic dog that retrieves everything that 's not nailed down and can clear a coffee table with a swing of the tail is a dog that quickly becomes a liability .
Labs with no manners end up in animal shelters and in rescue , their owners disillusioned with the breed .
Many dogs , purebred and mixed , meet the same fate , a fate that can be avoided by careful selection of a breed , a source , and a dog that matches the family 's needs and personal preferences .
Obviously , dogs come in many shapes , sizes , coat types , and temperaments .
If a family truly wants a canine companion , there will be several that will fit the bill .
Those who cannot — or do not want to — cope with the Labrador 's bulk , destructive tail , and bustling , cheery demeanor can likely find a variety of smaller , less active dogs to meet their needs .

When looking for a dog , Jones narrowed her choices to Dalmatians and Weimaraners , both large , high energy breeds well - suited for an athletic owner , breeds that need little grooming and are always ready to go .
She found a Dalmatian puppy , bought a crate , enrolled in a training class , and began taking Dash to the softball games where he sat in his crate and watched her play .
Paul Adams works 10 - hour days and loves to relax when he returns to his apartment each evening .
His weekends are spent puttering with his computer and dinner with friends .
The idea of a dog appeals to him , but he does n't want to housetrain a puppy and the landlord only allows dogs under 30 pounds .
Then Adams heard about a Miniature Schnauzer rescue organization , and he added a young male Schnauzer to his life .
He taught Max to beg for treats , play dead , fetch , and he began taking walks each morning to exercise the dog .
Lisa Smith has three children , all under seven years of age .
The six - year - old twin girls are relatively sedate youngsters , but their three - year - old sister is a ball of fire , prone to screaming and running .
The Smiths want a dog for the family , not too big a dog , of course , and one that does n't shed too much .
They checked on Brittanys , Beagles , standard Dachshunds , Petit Bassets , and Border Terriers , and settled on the Border for its hardiness , small size , and adaptability .
Nigel learned quickly to sit , lie down , and walk on a leash .
He withstood the antics of the youngest child with steady character and greeted the older girls every day after school .
The Brookharts bought an Afghan Hound puppy to decorate their condominium .
Sandstorm was elegant enough ; she was also a constant runaway - the Thomases paid several citations and bailed Stormy out of the animal shelter four times in less than a year .
Tammy Johnson bought a Chow Chow puppy on her way home from work .
For several days , she had driven by the sign tacked to a utility pole : Chow puppies , $ 100 .
She 'd always toyed with the idea of having a purebred dog and these little teddy bears were so adorable .
So Bandit came to live with Tammy , and , in less than a year , had his mistress terrified .
He growled when she touched his food dish , when she told him to get off the bed , when she snapped a leash on his collar .
The Richardsons bought a Labrador Retriever puppy that was supposed to lie by the fire on winter evenings and play with the kids during the day .
But Max had other ideas :
He knocked the kids down in his exuberance , ran off down the street to play ball with the Martin children , and brushed everything off the coffee table when he wagged his tail .
Steve and Mary Roberts took the children to see Disney 's 101 Dalmatians and a few weeks later stopped at the pet store and bought the kids their very own Pongo puppy .
The Roberts family was completely unprepared for the high - pressure personality of their puppy ; Pongo ruined the carpet , chewed the cabinets , nibbled human body parts , urinated on Cynthia 's bed , chased the cat , and ran out the door whenever it opened a crack .
In short order , parents and kids hated the little beast , who was getting bigger and more unruly by the day .
When Sandstorm was two , she was turned over to Afghan Rescue .
The Richardsons built a dog run where Max spent most of his days watching the kids play and his evenings listening to the family 's laughter and the drone of the television through the closed windows of the house .
At six months old , Pongo went to the animal shelter to find a new home .
At 15 months , Bandit was put down at the animal shelter for biting his mistress .
Not as easy as it looks
The choice of a breed is not always as easy at it seems when a family decides to get a dog .
Sarah Jones , Paul Adams , and the Smith family have an excellent chance of building a compatible relationship with the dogs they have chosen to share their lives .
They made thoughtful choices of a pet to fit their personalities and their circumstances .
If the Brookharts had realized that an Afghan needs room to run , they might have chosen another breed .
If Edwards knew that Chows are dominant dogs completely unlike their teddy - bear appearance , she probably would have done likewise .
And if the Richardsons had known that Labs are boisterous , active dogs that retain puppy characteristics for two years or more , they would also have chosen more wisely .
Dog breeds are not interchangeable .
For centuries , man has bred dogs to do particular jobs .
Today , few dogs do those jobs , but they still harbor the skills and adaptations that made them successful in their original careers .
Breeds require different types and amounts of care , training , food , and exercise .
They have different " personalities " and drives .
Some are laid back and gentle , some are dominant ; some are noisy ; some dig holes , climb fences , and escape through doorways to satisfy their need to run .
Others are always busy and can be destructive if not given enough to do .
And still others are bright , but more or less difficult to train .
Some are good watchdogs and others are over - friendly .
A puppy budget
To increase chances of a successful match , potential puppy buyers should first establish a budget of time , money , and convenience and then research the breeds that are most likely to fit their personal situation .
Consider what type of dog you want and what you expect the dog to contribute to your life .
Activity level , trainability , and grooming needs should be part of the equation .
If you hike or jog and would like a companion , look at medium or large breeds that can accompany you .
If you hate the thought of dog - hair tumbleweeds skittering across the floor , consider a short - coated breed .
If you have children and cannot spend a lot of time training or exercising a dog , look at the quieter breeds that are easy to train .
Once you have decided on a general type , you can narrow it down by considering cost , suitability for the household , and time involved in training and grooming .
Purebred dogs generally cost more than mixed breeds , and they are more predictable as to size , coat type , and temperament .
Purebred puppies are more expensive than adult dogs available from rescues or shelters .
Whatever the original cost of the animal , money spent on maintenance depends on size , coat type , and training needs .
Big dogs generally cost more to feed , medicate , and spay or neuter , and .
their toys , bowls , collars , and leashes are more expensive .
Groomers and boarding kennels charge usually charge more for their services because large dogs take more time and space than small dogs .
Dogs with dominant personalities generally need more training sessions than mild - mannered dogs , and heavy - coated dogs , Poodles , hard - coated terriers , and some others may need professional grooming to keep their coats in good shape .
Even if dogs do n't need professional grooming , they need home grooming , which requires buying specific types of combs and brushes and can take considerable time if the dog has a long coat , a double coat , or a soft coat that tangles easily .
Those who dismiss a dog out of hand as shedding too much , needing too much exercise , barking too much , or as too destructive might be pleasantly surprised to find a number of breeds that are quiet and relatively non-shedding and that they can train a dog to be quiet and to not chew the furniture .
Apartment dwellers who think small dogs are wimps may be surprised at the number of small - dogs - with - big - dog - auras .
Narrowing the choice
First , potential puppy buyers should determine whether small , medium , large , or giant breeds fit their living space and financial budget and whether an active or laid back dog fits their lifestyle .
Then all members of the family should read as much as possible about breeds that fit the bill .
( See reading list for books that assist in breed selection . )
Then find a local breeder .
Kennel clubs , veterinarians , boarding kennels , groomers , and pet supply stores will often refer buyers to responsible local breeders .
Or contact AKC , 51 Madison Ave. , New York , NY 10010 for a list of breed clubs ; then contact individual clubs for a list of breeders in your state or region .
Before making a final decision on a breed , visit a couple of breeders and , if possible , a dog show to see puppies and adults of the breeds you are considering and talk to several breeders ( long before or a bit after they go into the ring ) about the advantages and disadvantages of the breed .
Behavior of dogs at a show is not necessarily a good clue to the temperament of the breed , for show dogs are usually the best a breeder has to offer and have been conditioned to behave in crowds .
It is , however , better than not seeing the dogs close up and personal at all .
Be sure to visit obedience rings as well as conformation rings ; if there are no representatives of your chosen breed in the ring , it may be a clue that the breed is difficult to train .
Budget money for puppy purchase , feed , veterinary attention , and training .
If the breed has a long or difficult coat , add the cost of professional grooming .
Purebred puppies cost anywhere from $ 100 for a pet of a small breed to $ 2000 or more for a show dog of a rare breed or a pup from exceptional bloodlines .
Most purebred puppies cost $ 200 - $ 600 for pets .
Food costs increase with the size of the dog .
Price several premium feeds - generic or house brand foods are the equivalent of junk food and can cause health problems related to poor nutrition .
Veterinary services often cost more for large dogs than small dogs .
A large crate is more expensive than a small one , and boarding and grooming services are often based on the size of the dog .
The buyer 's health and physical condition is important as well .
Someone with arthritis , chronic back problems , allergies , asthma , or other limiting ailments would be wise to choose a small - to - medium - sized dog needing moderate exercise to avoid the physical stress involved in maneuvering large canine bodies or providing sufficient activity for the pet .
Easy care , wash and wear dogs take less time than long - coated or double - coated breeds .
Breeds that need lots of exercise take more time than couch potatoes .
Selecting the right breed takes time and effort .
After all , a puppy becomes a dog that will be part of the family for a dozen years or more .
A puppy should never be purchased on a whim , because it looks lonely in the pet store , or because the retailer will take plastic money .
Animal shelters are full of puppies that became dogs that did n't fit their family lifestyle or were too hard to train or too expensive to keep .
It 's so much easier to do the homework necessary to find a compatible breed before the purchase than to subject family and dog to the heartaches that result from incompatibility .
Sporting Group
The AKC divides dogs into seven groups : sporting , hound , working , terrier , toy , non-sporting , and herding .
The non-sporting group includes several breeds that could easily fit elsewhere ; the Dalmatian and Standard Poodle have sporting dog personalities and energy level ; the Chow , Finnish Spitz , and Shiba were originally hunting dogs ; and the Boston Terrier is by rights a terrier .
Dogs in the sporting group include the setters , pointers , spaniels , retrievers , and a handful of others , all bred to hunt game birds .
Some work in water , others on land , and still others in both .
Their personalities range from mild to hard - headed to tough , but all are suitable family dogs for an active household of patient owners .
However , if you do n't want to train your sporting breed , forget about the Weimaraner or Chesapeake Bay Retriever , for these breeds can be domineering if not taught to toe the line .
If you have boisterous or overzealous children , cross the Cocker Spaniel off the list , for Cockers will not abide rough handling or teasing .
If you cannot keep your dog confined in a securely fenced yard when he's not under direct supervision , choose a breed that is more willing to be a homebody ; the sporting dogs were bred to hunt , and most will take advantage of every opportunity to follow their noses up hill and down dale .
The stars of the sporting group are the Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever .
They enjoy the attention of well - behaved children and will usually put up with some bratty behavior .
They are relatively easy to train , easy to care for , and often seem to be perpetually young .
The Brittany and the English Springer Spaniel are smaller and far less popular but have the same great personality traits and sparkling manner .
The setters are very high energy dogs that are fine for active families , and the pointers are working dogs that tolerate children but are not particularly easy to train as house pets .
Hounds
The hounds come in many sizes and in two basic types -- scent hounds , who follow their noses anywhere , and sighthounds , whose gaze lingers on the horizon in the search for game .
Some of the scent hounds are lethargic , others are almost frenzied to get about the business of following a trail .
Most are difficult to obedience train because their noses are always responding to the pungent world of odors far beyond the ken of humans .
The scent hounds are friendly critters accustomed to working with their handlers in the field .
Sighthounds , bred to work independently of the hunter , tend to be aloof and rather tough to obedience train .
The scent hounds are Basset ; Beagle ( in two sizes , up - to - 13 inches , and 13 - 15 inches ) ; Black and Tan Coonhound ; Bloodhound ; Dachsunds ( three coats types -- wire , smooth , and long --- and two sizes -- standard and miniature ) ; American and English Foxhounds ; Harrier ; Norwegian Elkhound ; Otterhound ; and Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen .
The Elkhound looks more like a sled dog than a hound ; it was bred to hunt moose in snow - covered mountains and has the typical northern dog thick undercoat that sheds profusely .
The sighthounds are pictures of grace and elegance with their long legs , slender bodies , and long noses .
They are Afghan Hound ; Basenji ; Borzoi ( Russian Wolfhound ) ; Greyhound ; Ibizan Hound ; Irish Wolfhound ; Pharaoh Hound ; Rhodesian Ridgeback ; Saluki ; Scottish Deerhound ; and Whippet .
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are also used as guard dogs , and Greyhounds still race at tracks in several states .
Many sighthound owners participate in lure coursing , a chasing sport that mimics the hunts for which their dogs were originally bred .
In lure coursing , the dogs chase a plastic bag pulled along a wire on a marked course .
Working breeds
The working dogs are medium - to - giant size and are often independent and difficult to manage ..
Some were developed to guard palaces , homes , and livestock , occupations that require true grit .
Others were draft animals , hauling carts of fish or cheese or carrying the worldly goods of nomadic tribes .
Several of these breeds are jacks of many trades ; the Sammy was born as a bed - warmer , sledge - hauler , and reindeer herder ; the Newf as a sea - going rescue dog as well as a cart - pulling draft dog ; the Rottweiler as a cattle drover and farmer 's protector ; and Akitas as palace guards and big game hunters .
Many of these breeds are aloof and independent with strangers .
Working dogs should be accustomed to children at an early age , for a child 's staring , quick and unpredictable movements , and high - pitched voice can trigger prey drive in unsocialized or poorly socialized adults of these breeds .
Of the working breeds , the Samoyed , Saint Bernard , Portuguese Water Dog , Newfoundland , and Siberian Husky have the mildest temperaments , and the Akita , Rottweiler , Boxer , Komondor , and Doberman can be the most domineering .
The remaining working breeds are Alaskan Malamute , Bernese Mountain Dog , Bullmastiff ; Giant Schnauzer ; Great Dane ; Great Pyrenees ; Kuvasz ; Mastiff ; and Standard Schnauzer .
A working breed that is not socialized as a puppy and young adult can easily become a domineering pet prone to jumping on people and furniture , growling at children and unconfident adults , and refusing to come when called or lie down on command .
With few exceptions , working breeds are not suitable for first time dog owners without a commitment to formal obedience training and a willingness to establish and maintain control from the moment the puppy walks in the door .
Many of the working breeds have thick , downy undercoats and moderately long topcoats that shed once or twice each year .
The undercoats are fine and drift everywhere ; the topcoats are somewhat coarse and can pierce human skin .
During shedding , these dogs should be combed daily .
Owners need a laissez - faire attitude about neatness as the hair gets into every nook and cranny and on every piece of clothing in the house .
semi-annually .
Those who are unprepared for the volume of hair involved will wonder just how all that fuzz fit on one dog , so be sure you do n't mind ubiquitous hair if you consider one of these breeds .
The immensely popular Rottweiler , a breed that is at once maligned and praised for it 's ability as a family guardian , suffers from supply - and - demand run amuck — too many ignorant breeders are producing too many poor - quality puppies that are being purchased by too many ignorant buyers .
A guard dog is more than teeth and toughness ; a good guard dog has a stable personality and a sense of judgment to combine with his loyalty and territorial imperative .
If you decide on a Rottie , be sure to buy from a reputable breeder .
Other working breeds that need a firm hand are Akita , Alaskan Malamute , Boxer , Great Pyrenees , Kuvasz , Bullmastiff , Mastiff , Giant Schnauzer , Doberman , Komondor , Siberian Husky , and Standard Schnauzer .
Akitas , Malamutes , Boxers , Komondor , and the Schnauzers can be dog aggressive , and Akitas and Mals will hunt small game and cats .
Working dogs that are easier to handle are Newfoundland , Portuguese Water Dog , Samoyed , Bernese Mountain Dog , Greater Swiss Mountain Dog , Great Dane , and Saint Bernard .
Actually , folks who like the look of the Rottweiler but do not want the responsibility of owning a guardian breed should consider the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog .
It is similar to the Rottie in looks ( big , muscular , and black and tan , but with white on the chest , neck , face , and feet ) but was developed as a draft dog , not a protector , and has a milder attitude .
Many working dogs are susceptible to degenerative joint disease , particularly hip dysplasia , and should only be purchased from breeders who clear their breeding stock of this genetic abnormality .
Terriers
The terriers are also hunting dogs , but their game is generally vermin , not birds and animals for the dinner table .
With few exceptions , terriers developed in the British Isles to control rats , mice , foxes , and other predatory animals that raided farmer 's grains and chickens , shopkeepers storage bins , and housewives ' kitchen larders .
The terriers come in wire , smooth , and soft coats and in short - and long - legged body types .
Terrier temperament is fiery .
The smallest terriers are scrappy , ready to take on even giant sized adversaries .
This attitude stood them well in vermin- hunting and gives them an earnest and often boisterous attitude towards life as a pet .
On the down side , some terriers are yappy and can be nippy with overactive children .
They can also be quite independent and difficult to train for the weak - of - will .
The wire - haired terriers have special grooming needs .
Dead hairs must be pulled out of their coats to maintain good coat color and texture .
The hard - coated terriers are Airedale , Australian , Border , Cairn , Irish , Lakeland , Miniature Schnauzer , Norfolk , Norwich , Scottish , Sealyham , Skye , Welsh , West Highland White , and Wirehaired Fox .
The soft - coated terriers are the Soft - coated Wheaten and Kerry Blue .
Terriers with both soft and hard hairs are the Bedlington and Dandie Dinmont .
Smooth - coated terriers are the American Staffordshire , Bull , Standard Manchester , Smooth Fox , and Staffordshire Bull .
Terriers are not generally good for rowdy children , for they will give back as good ( or better ) than is dished out .
Three terriers , the Border , Irish , and the Soft - coated Wheaten , are considered to be generally good with children .
The others are recommended only for families with older , well - behaved youngsters .
Hard - coated terriers are often preferred by families with allergies because they do not drop their dead hairs throughout the house .
Instead , the dead hairs must be pulled out in order to keep the skin healthy and maintain the coats ' rich colors and bright whites .
Many terrier owners prefer to have a groomer do the job .
Most terriers are tough to train , for they have their own idea of how the world works and that idea frequently differs from the owners ' .
Few will back down from a confrontation with another dog .
Toy breeds
Toy dogs , often smaller versions of other breeds , were developed as companions to the ladies and gentlemen of the courts in various nations .
In the Orient , they rode inside the great sleeves of noblemen 's robes ; in Europe , they rode in baskets carried by noblewomen ; everywhere , they sat on laps and warmed beds in cold castles and palaces .
Diminutive size does not mean a mildness of temperament ; many little dogs are as tough as their larger cousins .
As a rule ( Pug excepted ) , they do not like small children , and their movements can be too quick for elderly family members .
Many breeders of toy dogs keep their puppies until they are 10 - 12 weeks old instead of selling them at the more - typical eight weeks .
And many will not sell to a family with young children or very active children .
Toy dogs are generally easy care pets .
Some ( Shih - Tzu , Pomeranian , Yorkshire Terrier , Maltese , and Pekingese ) require heavy grooming ; some ( Japanese Chin , Toy Poodle , and English Toy Spaniel ) require moderate grooming ; and other require little or no grooming .
The important thing is to keep the long , fine hairs free of tangles and mats to avoid pain and skin problems for the dog and a big grooming or vet bill for you .
Some need relatively more exercise than larger breeds and are frantic apartment dwellers .
Most are less than 12 inches tall and weigh less than 12 pounds .
Many toy breeds are mass - produced for pet stores .
Several Chihuahuas or Italian Greyhounds can be kept in a chicken cage or shopping cart , so even though their litters tend to be small , they are far easier to house than Akitas or German Shepherds .
Toy breeds purchased in pet stores are often hard to housetrain .
The toy breeds are Affenpinscher , Brussels Griffon , Chihuahua ( long - haired and smooth - coated ) , English Toy Spaniel , Italian Greyhound , Japanese Chin , Maltese , Toy Manchester Terrier , Miniature Pinscher , Papillon , Pekingese , Pomeranian , Toy Poodle , Pug , Shih Tzu , Silky Terrier , and Yorkshire Terrier .
Several of the toy breeds are often crossbred to produce - poo dogs .
These are not purebred dogs and should never be purchased as such .
Many - poo dogs are fine pets , but some are yappy , hyper , or ill - tempered .
Non-sporting dogs
This is a diverse group of dogs ranging in size from the small Bichon Frise to the 60 - pound Dalmatian and including the northern - type Keeshonden and Finnish Spitz and two of the three Poodle varieties .
There 's no unifying theme here ; in fact , several of these breeds could easily fit another group .
These dogs have come to be known as companions even though they started out with a variety of jobs in their native lands .
The so - ugly - it 's - adorable English Bulldog was designed to grab a bull by the snout and hang on for dear life until the animal could be killed .
The Dalmatian was a Gypsy camp dog in Europe and then a coach dog in England .
The Standard Poodle was a German hunting dog , the Tibetan Terrier alerted the monastery to the approach of strangers , the Shiba hunted small game in Japan , the Keeshond oversaw the start of a new political party , and the Finnish Spitz hunted large game birds .
Of the non-sporting dogs , the Dalmatian and Chow Chow are probably the most misunderstood .
The Dal is an active , independent , athletic dog that needs a firm hand ; the Chow 's adult attitude is not as soft and fuzzy as an adorable Chow puppy would lead one to believe .
Unfortunately , these two breeds suffer from their popularity when people purchase them without appreciating their personalities and needs .
The personalities of these dogs range from the calm of the Bulldog to the high energy of the Dalmatian and cover about everything in between .
The Dalmatian has been overbred to satisfy the market created by the movies and by the popularity of black - and - white fashion design .
Families looking for a Dalmatian should choose their source very carefully to avoid getting a hyperactive , fearful , aggressive , or deaf puppy .
The remaining non-sporting breeds are Boston Terrier , Bulldog , French Bulldog , Lhasa Apso , Schipperke , Tibetan Spaniel , Tibetan Terrier .
Herding dogs
About a dozen years ago , the AKC separated herding dogs from the working group .
These are the dogs who began their careers as livestock herders in the British Isles , on the European Continent , and in the US , the indispensable farmers ' dogs that could work dawn - to - dusk to bring the sheep to the barn or to market .
Several of these breeds have gone on to excel in police work , search and rescue , tracking , service to handicapped owners , and as sentries and couriers during wartime .
Most herding dogs are active , intelligent , courageous , and determined .
Many are favorites for obedience competition for their strong working bond with their owners .
They are mostly medium - to - large in size , but include the smaller Shetland Sheepdog and the two Corgis .
The German Shepherd , a versatile working dog , is part of this group , as is the Border Collie , the new darling of the Babe set .
The Border Collie is not a breed for everyone .
It is very smart and must be kept very busy .
Unless you can spend lots of time playing Frisbee or fetch , find someone with agility equipment you can use , or teach the dog to herd sheep or ducks , forget the Border Collie .
This dog does n't just need exercise , he needs meaningful exercise .
A walk wo n't do unless he gets to fetch something , herd something , or climb over , under , around , and through something .
Border Collie rescue always has several dogs whose owners did not realize these things before they bought the dog .
The other herding breeds are calmer .
The German Shepherd is prone to temperament problems because of overbreeding , so it is imperative to seek out a responsible breeder who deals only in dogs of good temperament .
The German Shepherds from European working lines tend to have higher drives than the US dogs ; these dogs also must have work to do or they can become destructive .
The Australian Cattle Dog , the Briard , and the Australian Shepherd can be hard - headed .
The puli is a happy ball of fire .
The rough - coated Collie is a true family companion .
If grooming is not in your repertoire , try smooth - coated version of the breed .
The Old English Sheepdog must be groomed often to prevent mats and is somewhat hard - headed .
The three Belgian breeds are relatively easy to train ; the Malinois requires little grooming , but the Tervuren and Shepherd must be brushed a couple of times a week .
Herding dogs are subject to hip dysplasia and should be purchased only from breeders who x-ray their stock .
Some herding breeds suffer from overpopularity and have flighty or fearful temperaments .
The herding breeds are Australian Cattle Dog , Australian Shepherd , Bearded Collie , Belgian Malinois , Belgian Sheepdog , Belgian Tervuren , Bouvier des Flandres , Briard , Collie , German Shepherd Dog , Old English Sheepdog , Puli , Shetland Sheepdog , Cardigan Welsh Corgi , and Pembroke Welsh Corgi .
Popularity
When a particular dog earns headlines or has a movie or television role , sales on the breed often surge .
101 Dalmatians brought an increase in the spotted dogs , and poor breeding practices produced some overactive Dals with quirky temperaments .
Turner and Hooch featured a Dogue de Bordeaux , a large , drooly mastiff , and everybody wanted one of these huge , slobbery dogs .
Beethoven popularized St. Bermards , and the television comedy Fraser shows off the delightful character of a little Jack Russell Terrier known as Eddie .
And then there 's the Border Collie family in the aluminum foil commercial , the Golden Retriever in the Oreo ad , and the Siberian Huskys that eat whatever dog food .
Take your time and find a breed that 's right for you
Take your time and examine the incredible variety of canines large and small , short - haired , long - haired , and wire - haired ; active and sedate ; loving and aloof ; strong , loyal , and independent or soft , cuddly , and intuitive ; sloppy and prissy ; dignified and silly .
There 's a breed for everyone -- all that remains is to examine your own wants and needs and match them with the breed that captures your mind 's eye and your heart .
Simple , eh ?
Books can help
The books listed here are but a few of the many that provide information about breeds of dogs .
A dog show book stall is the best place to find dozens of titles , including general - information breed selection books and breed - specific volumes .
Most breeds are profiled in two or three separate volumes that range in cost from $ 7 - $ 9 up to $ 40 .
Some breed profile books can be found in public libraries , book stores , or pet supply stores .

Most prospective owners of purebred dogs look to AKC as the country 's most prominent registry , even though the United Kennel Club has existed almost as long and registers more breeds , than those recognized by AKC .
But UKC 's strength lies in working events for sporting breeds and hounds and in obedience trials , not in the high profile conformation shows sanctioned by AKC .
Still , the AKC division of dog breeds into groups is helpful in making some general observations about breeds .

Erotic game Tech48 is using face tracking technology to let players do things like look at in - game heroines from various angles — that , and up their skirts .
Developed by eroge maker Teatime , the game uses a special webcam and face tracking software to locate players ' faces .
So when players move left to right , the in - gamer character follows them with her eyes .
We 've seen technology used in gaming before .
The erotic game spin ?
When players crouch down , it 's possible for players to peek up the heroine 's dress .

PyOpenGL is the traditional OpenGL binding for the Python language ( Python 2.x series ) .
This release is the first major release of the package in more than 4 years .
PyOpenGL 3.x is a complete rewrite of the PyOpenGL project which attempts to retain compatibility with the original PyOpenGL 2.x API while providing support for many more data - formats and extensions than were wrapped by the previous code - base .
It attempts to retain the " easy " approachable API of the original PyOpenGL bindings , focusing more on ease of development ( both for client code and the library itself ) than speed .
Build and installation has been dramatically simplified .
It is possible
to work directly from a PyOpenGL bzr branch or to merely unpack the
package into your PYTHONPATH .
To install from source and / or participate
in development :
bzr branch lp: pyopengl
bzr branch lp: pyopengl - demo
easy_install PyOpenGL
easy_install PyOpenGL -Demo
then add the pyopengl / OpenGL directory to your PYTHONPATH .
You can also download the source distributions from : and use standard distutils commands to install .
PyOpenGL 3.x is already supported by the PyInstaller " exe " packaging utility , and can be made to work with Py2exe with inclusion statements .
PyOpenGL may be installed using the easy_install script if desired .
There are no setuptools / package - resources dependencies in PyOpenGL 3.0.0 final .
You can install PyOpenGL on supported platforms ( currently Linux , Win32 and OSX ) with the following if you have setuptools , PIL and Numpy installed : You can then run the scripts in the PyOpenGL - Demo package .
PyOpenGL 3.x introduces package - level configuration flags which allow you to modify the behavior of the entire PyOpenGL package , e.g. by introducing extremely verbose logging , or turning off all error - checking to improve performance .
Of particular note is a flag which allows you to disable APIs which have been deprecated by the ARB in OpenGL 3.0 .
Other flags allow you to control the trade - off between ease - of - use andperformance during the development and release process .
PyOpenGL 3.x provides access to the entire OpenGL 3.0 API , as well as most extensions which have been entered in the OpenGL extension registry .
Commonly used extensions can have " Pythonic " wrappers written easily , and many of the commonly used extensions already have simplified APIs provided .
It also provides wrappers for the GLUT , GLE and GLX libraries .
The AGL and WGL modules are not provided with PyOpenGL 3.x , as most devs are using window - manager - based GL operations .
PyOpenGL 3.x provides a simple plug - in API that allows you to write data - format or platform plugins .
These can be used to easily add " native " support for your array - friendly data - formats ( vector classes and the like ) .
There is a sample data - format plug - in which wraps the " Vertex Buffer Objects " extensions ( in the OpenGL / arrays / vbo.py module ) .
PyOpenGL 3.x's documentation has been regenerated and the build process for the documentation has been updated so that it can be easily regenerated to include pointers to other Open Source PyOpenGL project 's online code viewers .
If you would like to add your project to the list of referenced projects , please contact the author with details of yourcode viewer 's url , code license and project name .
Notes in the reference documentation indicates the deprecated entry points for OpenGL 3.0 .
If you have a PyOpenGL code - base you should be looking at reworking the code in order to eliminate the use of " legacy " APIs before OpenGL 3.1 drivers become mainstream .
At minimum you should be converting away from per-vertex operations and the use of display lists toward using array - based geometry .
You should expect a performance decline with the use of PyOpenGL 3.x versus PyOpenGL 2.x !
PyOpenGL 3.x will have an accelerator module released in time to provide better performance , but the development method ( ctypes ) is inherently slower than the C ( SWIG ) method previously used .
If your code is performance critical you should likely use the accelerator module when it becomes available .
Also consider using the package - level configuration flags to remove " support " functionality as you near release , use of these flags can provide more than 2x speedup in most cases .
The 3.0.0 final release has a few bugs fixed from the previous 3.0.0c1 release .
Users of the release candidate should upgrade .
PyOpenGL 3.0.0 is intended for use with the Python 2.x series , porting to Python 3.x is not currently on the roadmap .
There will likely be a PyOpenGL 3.0.1 release in the near future which will introduce a few more optimizations and likely will be synchronized with the first public release of the accelerator modules .
Since the release of PyOpenGL 2.x another common OpenGL binding for Python has become popular and may be an appropriate choice for your projects .
The Pyglet project ( http://www.pyglet.org ) has a full OpenGL binding in " raw " C style , along with many higher - level utilities to aid in the development of games , all of which can be easily installed on common platforms .
NBC Universal 's Great Idea : Let 's Make It Harder And More Expensive To Watch The Olympics
from the this - is - a - joke , - right ?

During the last Olympics , we sat stunned as NBC Universal made mistake after mistake after mistake in making it incredibly difficult for fans who wanted to watch the Olympics online to do so .
And then , NBC Universal executives bragged about how difficult they made it to watch , when really they just shot themselves in the foot , since even the audience who could actually watch it online watched it more on TV .
In other words , everything about NBC Universal 's strategy backfired ... and then they talked about how great it worked .
It 's hard to understand how the folks involved still have jobs .
But ... rather than learn from that , it looks like NBC Universal has decided to make thingsfor the next Olympics .
NewTeeVee points us to the news that NBC Universal is working on a deal that will require online viewers to first prove they have a pay TV package before granting them the ability to watch buggy , limited , delayed online video of the event .
Oh , and of course , this will only apply to the cable or satellite providers who first pay NBC Universal for the privilege .
How a viewer will " prove " he or she is a customer is still being decided , but will likely involve an IP address if you 're at home , or some other convoluted system if you 're elsewhere .
This really is just an extension of the ongoing discussions between the networks and cable / satellite TV providers to lock up their content behind a paywall before online video wipes away the need for pay TV .
It 's like watching a trainwreck way in advance .
Any attempt to limit what can be done for the sake of keeping an old business model in place hasfailed miserably .
It 's always disappointing to see people who should know better make the same mistake over and over and over again .

News Pro-Pot Docs Organize Emerging Group Organized in Part by Goleta's Dr. David Bearman
In a move designed to lend another layer of legitimacy to the emerging national medical marijuana movement , the American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine ( AACM ) announced its formal formation this week .
Organized in part by Goleta - based physician David Bearman , the academy will , among other things , work to inform the professional medical community about the clinical utility of cannabis - based medicine , offer board certification - via written and oral tests - for physicians , and , as a result , work to curb the quasi-unethical practice of doctors giving recommendations to hopeful pot patients without adequate exams or appropriate medical conditions .
“ We want to ensure that there is only the highest quality of medicine being done by doctors , ” explained Bearman , who will serve as the vice president of credentialing and quality .
Including California , there are currently 14 states that legally recognize medicinal use of cannabis .
The AACM , however , is the first attempt to bring a set of standards and practices and assorted other professional gravitas to the doctors across the country who treat conditions like AIDS , chronic pain , and symptoms from cancer treatment with a plant that is illegal in the eyes of the federal government .
The first round of testing for board certification will take place in Seattle in August , according to Bearman .

The Lower House of Federal Parliament has passed legislation allowing the Government to keep the money it has already collected from the extra tax on alcopops .
The Government says the legislation will prevent more than $ 400 million from being returned to distillers .
Earlier this year Health Minister Nicola Roxon indicated the Government would not try to keep the money .
The Opposition 's health spokesman , Peter Dutton , says today 's vote is an embarrassing backflip for the Government .
" At the time of the last sitting period , we offered to the Government the opportunity to validate the collection of the taxes , " he said .
" Well , here we are today - the Minister offering up the same legislation that we were proposing seven or eight weeks ago . "
Tax validation
Today the Government wants both houses to pass the legislation to validate the already collected alcopops tax .
Ms Roxon says it is vital the money is not returned to the alcohol industry .
" The Government has collected now nearly $ 424 million in revenue , " she said .
" That would be a $ 424 million jackpot to the distillers if this bill is not passed today . "
The Opposition has already pledged support for the measure , while the Greens and independent senators Nick Xenophon and Steve Fielding are also expected to vote in favour of the bill .
Permanent increase
However , the Government is also planning to introduce legislation in a few weeks to make the tax increase permanent .
Senator Fielding says he is unimpressed .
" The Government 's got to stop hiding behind a blatant tax grab , " he said .
Mr Dutton says the Government needs to prove it is serious about tackling binge drinking .
" If the Government 's got the guts to do it , we 'll support it , " he said .
He says the Coalition has not yet seen the Government 's plan .
For years people have taken to the web to create comic strips without fear of censorship or having to answer to print media advertisers .
Now there are thousands of web comics , making it difficult to know where to start if you 're new to the genre .
From Garfield Minus Garfield to Homestar Runner , here are 20 great web comics to turn to for an entertaining read , in alphabetic order .
Have a favorite that 's not on this list ?
Tell us more about it in the comments .
8 - Bit Theater - Created by Brian Clevinger in 2001 , 8 - Bit
Theater takes the idea of doing 8 - bit artwork to the extreme .
All of his characters are sprites in a series that loosely revolves around the plot of the RPG game Final Fantasy I , but only in that it is a framework for the humor .
Most of the jokes are broadly drawn and take in all aspects of the RPG genre .
Ctrl +Alt +Del - Ctrl + Alt +Del is a strip that focuses primarily on video game related humor , but does branch out into other types of stories .
The strip is published every Monday , Wednesday and Friday , and also has the rare honor of earning creator Tim Buckley his primary source of income .
Cyanide & Happiness - Started by a then 16 - year - old Kris Wilson in 2004 , Cyanide & Happiness is now written on a daily basis by an alternating crew of four people .
While all four tend to maintain the peculiar stick figure style that Wilson started , the comic does occasionally deviate from that formula .
The humor in this cartoon is a little darker ; for example , a recent strip points out misspelled words in a suicide note .
Diesel Sweeties - Diesel Sweeties is about a world where robots and humans co-exist , and there are even instances of human / robot relationships .
The strip started off as being web only , but has shown up in some newspapers ' syndicated comic strips .
The series features an art style that is somewhat reminiscent of the 8 - bit video game style , but a bit more polished .
FreakAngels - FreakAngels is written by comic book fan favorite Warren Ellis and tells the story of a futuristic London that has been devastated by a massive flood .
There is one update a week , but it is done in comic book style with six pages per update .
garfield minus garfield -
What happens when you remove the title character from the comic strip series Garfield ?
You get an existential journey through Jon Arbuckle 's twisted mind and reality where there is nothing wrong with talking to yourself .
Easily one of the biggest hits ever in the world of web comics , having even gotten the blessing of original Garfield creator Jim Davis , and a book deal .
Girl Genius - Written and drawn by Phil and Kaja Foglio , Girl Genius has been a winner of multiple online awards , even though it started life as a comic book .
The series is set in a Victorian style with touches of Steampunk and the Industrial Revolution thrown in .
Homestar Runner - Homestar Runner is a Flash animated series that has gotten so big that it has its own wiki to keep track of the whole thing .
While it has always been popular , series co-stars such as Strong Bad and TROGDOR the BURNiNATOR have at times surpassed Homestar Runner in popularity .
Kevin and Kell - Kevin and Kell was created by professional cartoonist Bill Holbrook , and centers on the family life of Kevin ( a rabbit ) and his wife , Kell ( a wolf ) .
They live in a world totally populated by animals .
While animal humor does play into the series , it is mostly about life and relationships .
MegaTokyo - Based in a fictional version of Tokyo , MegaTokyo follows the adventures of a pair of American anime and video game enthusiasts .
The series started off as all humor , but as it shifted to having longer storylines since one of the creators left , and the remaining one , Fred Gallagher , decided to do the series by himself and take it in a more serious direction .
Penny Arcade - Celebrating its tenth anniversary , Penny Arcade is dedicated to geek culture .
From video games to television shows , nothing is sacred to this popular strip .
In a weird piece of synergy , the series has been turned into a series of downloadable games for the Xbox 360 .
PvP - Another in the long line of web comics based around geek culture , PvP has been running since 1998 and started off as a strip based around the employees of a gaming company .
With over 10 years under its belt , the strip still comes out five days a week and has even made its way to a printed comic series from Image Comics .
Questionable Content - Questionable Content started off as a strip with a heavy focus on indie music scene jokes , but with the added quirk of personal computers with an attitude that can walk around on two legs .
These days it is more about life in general , with some indie music references , and yes , the computers still walk around .
Jeph Jacques , the creator of QC , is one of the few web comic creators who is lucky enough to make his entire living from the revenue generated by the series .
Red Meat -
A popular alternative newspaper comic strip that is available in 75 publications and can also be found online .
The series uses static images of its characters that rarely , if ever , move and tends to be fairly dark in its humor .
There are few other places in the world where you can find a character like Milkman Dan , a sadistic dairy employee .
Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal - A single panel comic strip with a twisted and dark side .
It is almost Far Side - esque in style , but definitely benefits from the fact that it does n't have to go through censors to appear in a newspaper .
The Adventures of Dr. McNinja - Published in a comic book format , with new " pages " being released every Monday , Wednesday and Friday , Dr. McNinja follows the adventures of a doctor who happens to also be a ninja .
This is rather easy to figure out as he is always wearing a lab coat as well as a ninja mask .
The Joy of Tech - Created in 2000 by two Canadians , Liza Schmalcel and Bruce Evans , The Joy of Tech tackles all sorts of different technology related humor , with a heavy emphasis on jokes that make Apple fan boys the punchline .
UserFriendly - Written and drawn by J.D. Frazer since 1997 , UserFriendly is set inside a fictional ISP , Columbia Internet .
The humor tends runs on the geeky side , with some jokes that revolve around a Linux kernel .
What 's New with Phil & Dixie - What 's New by Phil Foglio was the must read strip of the role - playing game crowd in the 1980s .
Although it was originally published in the pages of Dragon magazine , it has now made its way onto the Internet where you can read the archives from the series spanning ( sporadically ) from 1980 to 1998 .
xkcd -
" A webcomic of romance , sarcasm , math , and language , " xkcd is quite popular with the tech crowd , mainly because its jokes usually make you scratch your head at least once .
For added fun , hover your mouse over the comic and you 'll find a bonus joke or an explanation for the head scratchers , in the images ' alt tags .
Let 's see we got Girls With Shotguns Johnny Wanderer ... I think that 's everybody .
Man .
See you tomorrow .
Jérôme Meizoz , a political researcher at the University of Lausanne , elaborated .
“ Culture is not the major part of the People ’s Party platform .
But it ’s been useful in spreading the view that the left controls the arts and the universities , so that there needs to be a counter model , more American , with private foundations , not public subsidies , except , of course , for exhibitions featuring nationalistic painters like the ones Blocher collects and concerts of yodeling or Glockenspiel . ”
Stress laughed at that remark , when it was later recounted .
“ Blocher ’s Switzerland is people in the mountains making cheese , ” he said .
“ But you also have a Switzerland where people struggle to make ends meet .
His party does n’t represent the Switzerland where I grew up , which is made up of people who came to build the country , literally to build its buildings and streets .
The Swiss People ’s Party campaigns by using Osama bin Laden in posters about the threat of immigration .
For me this is just unfair . ”

He added : “ Swiss people are not used to speaking their minds .
The left wing parties have n’t wanted to lower themselves by reacting to Blocher ’s tactics .
So I just felt there had to be some reaction . ”
Yuval and Shantala Dishon , a husband - and - wife duo , run a street theater company called Zanco in Geneva .
Zanco staged its own protest , after a different referendum making it especially tough to gain asylum here passed with 68 percent of the vote in 2006 .
The company put on a show that toured the city ’s public schools and neighborhoods .
It told the story of a village that closed its doors to a foreigner and ended up never even learning who he was .
“ Being politically outspoken is not usual for the cultural community here , we ’re a quiet country , but some things need to be said , ” Mr. Dishon said .
“ For more than 400 years , this city has been at least 30 percent foreigners .
We live on a street called Swiss Village .
Back in 1896 there was a fair here and bits of Swiss architecture from different cantons were combined to make houses on our street that supposedly represented Swiss culture .
It ’s the same thing Blocher ’s party is doing by saying that Swiss flag tossing and the Alpenhorn represent the real Switzerland . ”

Dell now provides its 10 " Mini 10 netbook with Ubuntu in the U.S. and Canada , with the rest of the world to follow shortly .
The Mini 10 netbook has been around with Windows XP for two months and now comes with Ubuntu at least in the U.S. and Canada , according to DELL - Anne C in Dell 's community blog .
The Ubuntu version costs $ 400 , while the XP model is steeper at $ 500 .
The Linux version provides a further benefit : because the netbook is n't bound by Microsoft 's requirements for Windows XP , the Mini 10 comes with a 32 - GByte ( $ 75 ) and even 64 - GByte ( $ 125 ) solid state disk ( SSD ) option .
The 6 - cell battery option ( $ 30 ) gives the netbook an 8 - hour battery life compared to the 3 hours or so for the standard battery , and a mid-range 3 - cell option with 28 WHrs and just under 4 hours battery life is also available for $ 15 .
Last but not least , the Mini 10 provides an edge - to - edge HD display option ( $ 35 ) at a 1366 x 768 resolution .
Ubuntu as the operating system of choice on Dell Mini 10 .
The Inspiron Minis run on the Ubuntu 8.04 Long Term Support ( LTS ) version , although Dell spiffed up the graphical interface somewhat and expanded the original 8.04 with NetworkManager .
The Community blog page includes a short video on the Mini 10 from Doug Anson , Dell 's Linux technology strategist .
Along with the built - in ATSC tuner , Dell promises that the Mini 10 will also make its appearance soon in Europe with a DVB - T tuner .
PBS has launched a new video portal containing loads of clips and full - length episodes of many of its shows .
The News Hour with Jim Lehrer , NOVA , Antiques Roadshow , and other PBS programs all have their own pages on the site , where users can view a variety of video in the organization 's own custom player .
You can also browse by topic to find video about culture , science , or history , for example .
As with the PBS shows you watch on TV , there are n’t commercial interruptions , but rather , corporate sponsors that are mentioned at the start of each clip .
Additionally , the player includes options to share the video on social sites like Facebook and Digg , though it just seems to post a link as opposed to the video itself .
There ’s also no embedding option .
The network is touting the ability for local PBS stations to use the site to bring their content to PBS ’ web viewers .
While it ’s not immediately apparent where this fits into the site , the organization says in a statement that the site “ will provide increased opportunities for local producers to be discovered by national audiences . ”
Overall , the PBS video portal is a good start , and should help with one of the organization ’s main needs – fundraising - as each video has a “ buy it ” link , in addition to other prompts to donate around the site .
PBS already has a fairly good YouTube channel that includes options its own site does n’t yet offer – like embedding – but ultimately it will be beneficial for the organization to have its own portal to drive viewers towards .
Here is a collection of 10 tips that are slightly more advanced than usual .
They are aimed at those who want to become more expert Mac users - and of course those who think they already are experts ...
In general these tips will help you save time and effort when carrying out day to day tasks and hopefully introduce some concepts and applications you may not have come across before .
1. Download Quicksilver
This is really the most important pro app for Mac OS X .
The principle of Quicksilver is simple , but it is amazingly powerful :
Hit a hotkey , then start typing what you want to do .
You can open an application .
Send an email to a certain contact .
Pause iTunes .
Anything ( more or less ) .
But what makes this so incredible is that Quicksilver learns over time so you can get what you want faster and more efficiently with less and less effort .
Head here for a more detailed explanation , or if you 've got some time to spare , watch this demo video .
Download it from the Blacktree site .
2 . Get to grips with keyboard shortcuts
This may seem like a really simple tip , but far too often I watch supposedly experienced computer users take forever performing simple tasks like copying and pasting .
The fact of the matter is keyboard shortcuts make everything easier , but not only do you have to learn them , you have to get into the habit of using them .
There is a hugely extensive list here , but to be honest nothing will save you more time than getting into the habit of using shortcuts for quitting , closing windows , copying and pasting and switching applications .
For the more adventurous , you can create your own keyboard shortcuts in the keyboard and mouse section of System Preferences .
And if you want to go even further , here are 10 AppleScripts that you can assign keyboard shortcuts to using Quicksilver .
3. Drag and drop everywhere
This is often a problem that comes from working in Windows a lot , where drag - and - drop does n't quite have the same power .
However in Mac OS X , you can use it almost anywhere .
Dragging folders onto open / save dialogs will make it display that folder .
Dragging text selections onto icons in the Dock does all sorts of useful things .
And you can just drag files onto " Choose File " buttons in web pages .
4. Change hidden settings with Terminal commands
Often developers choose not to include some settings in the preferences of an application in order keep things nice and simple for the user .
Luckily , they often leave these hidden settings accessible via the Terminal .
Although this will scare off a lot of people , being comfortable with the Terminal is really useful and it's the best way to get a higher level of customisation and enable hidden features on your Mac .
Luckily , modifying preference files is one of the easiest things you can do in the Terminal - just paste in a line of code and hit return .
Simple !
Here is a list of Terminal commands that will work with every version of Mac OS X , and here are some ones just for Leopard .
5. Download VLC
VLC is a multipurpose media player that can play pretty much any movie file you throw at it .
While Quicktime will serve you for most needs , VLC will handle anything that Quicktime struggles with , as well as stubborn DVDs and VIDEO_TS folders .
Download it here .
6 . Understand the concept of packages
In Mac OS X , packages are just folders disguised to look like single files .
In fact , almost every application is a package .
To look inside packages , just right - click on one and choose Show Package Contents .
Why would you want to do this ?
Inside application packages are all the files it needs to run .
Once inside , you can tinker about and change things .
Here 's a previous tip with a collection of things you can do , including changing the unexpectedly quit message , the iCal alarm message and the layout of System Preferences .
7. Quickly kill accidently opened applications
If you are clumsy like me , you will often accidently click the wrong icon in the Dock .
Or maybe you occasionally want to stop iTunes opening up when you plug in your iPod .
If you are quick enough , you can just right - click ( Control - Click ) on the icon in the Dock and choose Force Quit .
If you are too late , pressing the Option key will change Quit to Force Quit so you can close the unwanted application even faster .
8 . Make rectangular selections ( Cocoa apps only )
This is one of the best tricks for saving time when you are moving round chunks of text .
If you want to select a column in a table or remove the numbers from the start of each line in a list you would normally have to go through every line individually .
This can be hugely time consuming if you have a long list .
To get around this , just hold the Option key while making the selection .
Now you can draw a box around the stuff you want to copy or delete etc. and not worry about having to select entire lines .
9. Learn some AppleScript
Do n't be put off by the idea of a programming language - AppleScript is about as close to normal english as you can get .
AppleScript 's real power is it 's ability to automate repetitive tasks — in fact Automator is basically just a visual way to create AppleScripts .
The best way to get familiar with AppleScript is to download some example scripts , try and figure out how they work , and then try and extend them or customise them for your own needs .
If you are looking for scripts , I 've written loads of tips that use a small bit of AppleScript to solve a problem .
10 .
Get comfortable using the command line
While you might be fine pasting a single line into the Terminal to change some hidden settings , you might not be comfortable actually working from the command line .
I guess the whole point of Mac OS X is that it is a pretty graphical interface placed over the command line , but in reality some things are faster from the Terminal , and some things are n't possible without it .
Learning about using the command line requires a whole tutorial in itself so I wo n't go into it here .
O'Reilly have a great series of tutorials for beginners , and OSXDaily have a list of common commands .

Early this morning we launched a brand new cloud computing service .
This revolutionary new technology will change the way you think about the cloud .
For a while the cloud was simply a metaphor meaning “ a bunch of computers somewhere else . ”
Until now , somewhere else meant good old terra firma , the Earth itself .
After extensive customer research we found that this rigid , antiquated way of thinking just wo n’t cut it in today ’s post - capitalist world .
They need locational flexibility , the ability to literally instantiate a cloud where they need it , when they need it .
To solve this problem , we have designed and are now introducing the Floating Amazon Cloud Environment , or FACE for short .
Using the latest in airship technology , we ’ve created a cloud that can come to you .
The FACE uses durable , unmanned helium - filled blimps with a capacity of 65,536 small EC2 instances , or a proportionate number of larger instances .
The top of each blimp is coated in polycrystalline solar cells which supply approximately 40 % of the power needed by the servers and the on - board navigation , communication , and defense systems .
The remainder of the power is produced by clean , efficient solid oxide fuel cells .
There ’s enough fuel onboard to last about a month under normal operating conditions .
Waste heat from the fuel cells and from the servers is used to generate additional lift .
There are two options for ground communication , WiMAX and laser .
The WiMAX option provides low latency and respectable bandwidth .
If you have the ground facility and the line of sight access needed to support it , lasers are the way to go .
The on - board laser doubles as a defense facility , keeping each FACE safe from harm .
Using automated target detectors with human confirmation via the Mechanical Turk , competitors wo n’t have a chance .
Update : Based on popular demand , we will also implement RFC 1149 .
FACE can operated in shared or dedicated mode .
In dedicated mode , the FACE does its best to remain at a fixed position .
In shared mode , each FACE constantly optimizes its position to provide the best possible service to everyone .
As always , this amazing functionality is available via the EC2 API ( You ’ll need the new 2009 - 04 - 01 WSDL ) , the command line tools , and the AWS Console .
Derivative funds and large government - subsidized entities will be especially interested in FACEs transmodal operation .
They can allocate a dedicated FACE , load it up with data , and then send it out to sea to perform advanced processing in safety .
The government will have absolutely no chance of acting against them , because they will be too busy trying to decide which Federal Air Regulation ( FAR ) was violated , not to mention scheduling news conferences .
We believe that the FACE will be the perfect solution for LAN parties , tech conferences , and large - scale sporting events .
Availability is limited and this may be a one - time , perhaps even a one - day offer .
Get your FACE now .

Michelle Buteau is ' just exhausted ' but as funny as ever in her new special ' Welcome to Buteaupia '
Things got wild in D.C. today , as journalistic heavy hitters from across the country squared off in a new media vs. old media shoot out .
The session was highlighted by a saucy closing oration , during which blogging queen Arianna Huffington lambasted newspapers for engaging in the “ futility of resistance ”
The hearing , convened by Senator John Kerry , featured representatives from the Washington Post , the Dallas News and Google .
Kerry , who has expressed solidarity with newspapers –especially the plight of the Boston Globe–led things off by welcoming attendees to “ a brave new world ” and quoting Joseph Pulitzer ’s refrain , “ Our republic and its press will rise and fall together . ”
Maryland representative Ben Cardin ( D ) stumped for his recently proposed Newspaper Revitalization Bill , which would allow newspapers to receive 501 C - 3 classification and the beefy tax breaks that accompany them ( see past post on its flaws ) .
Former Washington Post Managing Editor Steve Coll struck a balanced tone by referring to the current state of journalism as “ creative destruction . ”
He complimented the innovation of online enterprise , but questioned if citizen journalists and bloggers could provide the same valuable public interest reporting as newspapers .
David Simon , a former journalist and producer of The Wire , was much more blunt .
He bashed blogging as “ repetition , commentary and froth , ” and content aggregation as leeching .
He laid much of the blame at the decision of newspapers to tie in with Wall - Street and “ unencumbered capitalism ”
However , his heated remarks were no match for Huffington .
In her thick Greek accent , the baroness of blog lacerated newspaper bosses for “ putting content behind walled gardens , ” “ sticking their fingers in the dike ” and “ pretending the last 15 years did n’t happen . ”
She stated her optimism that journalism would survive and flourish , but recommended that efforts be pulled away from saving newspapers and toward saving journalism .
She lauded the blogosphere for its ability to follow and hammer away at a story until it “ breaks through the static , ” and she excoriated the mainstream media for not doing its journalistic duty in covering the lead up to the Iraq War and the financial crisis .
The news industry has had “ far too many autopsies and not enough biopsies , ” she said .
It was a rousing performance .
I did n’t agree with all it , but Huffington clearly has the spunk and tenacity necessary to transform a crisis into a period of innovation and growth .
Considering the pessimistic state of journalism , I ’ll take it .

* U.S. male unemployment rate surges past national average
* Blue collar men take worst hit , wages keep falling
* Construction may recover ; many assembly jobs are gone
DALLAS , May 19 ( Reuters ) - Rodney Ringler is an unemployed blue collar male without a college degree .
He ’s hardly alone .
Men like him have been the main victims of the current recession in the United States .
“ I have n’t worked since December of 2007 , around the time this recession started , ” Ringler , a 49 - year - old computer technician , said as he walked his dog in a Dallas suburb .
He sees little light at the end of the tunnel .
“ I ’ve been looking to get into law enforcement because it ’s a growth area , ” he said , but had no immediate prospects .
One statistic that stands out in America ’s recession - stung economy is the unemployment rate for adult men : in April for the second month in a row it surged ahead of the national average to 9.4 percent versus 8.9 percent for all workers .
The jobless rate for adult women was 7.1 percent .
The reasons are clear : male - heavy sectors such as construction and manufacturing have been hard hit .
But the implications may be dire for the broader economy and hamper the recovery as families that once had male breadwinners struggle .
“ In the 2001 recession , 51 percent of all job losses were for men .
It was evenly split .
But in this recession 80 percent of the jobs that have been lost have been men’s , ” said Andrew Sum , a labor economics professor at Northeastern University who has studied this issue in detail .
Men also incurred about 80 percent of the job losses in the 1990 - 91 recession , but Sum said by his calculations the numbers this time were dramatically different .
In the 1990 - 91 recession , men lost 1.037 million jobs .
They have lost 4.5 million to date in this one .
“ This time around it is amazingly different in terms of the magnitude , ” Sum said .
It ’s difficult to compare to earlier recessions because women entered the workforce in big numbers from the 1970s , and industries that continue to grow such as health services favor women .
The male jobless rate is pumped up by white collar banking jobs lost during the global financial crisis .
A few of these may have been sent overseas but job growth in this sector should come back in time , analysts said .
HARD TIMES AHEAD
The fact that American males without a college degree are especially vulnerable in this cycle point to more hard times ahead for the U.S. working class , which has endured stagnant and declining wages for the last three decades .
The skilled and semi-skilled jobs they traditionally held have been moving overseas to places like China and Vietnam .
The jobs that remain pay less , amid declining union membership .
One study by Julia Isaacs of the Brookings Institution think - tank found median U.S. family income rose to $ 53,280 by the middle of this decade in 2004 dollars from $ 37,384 in 1964 .
But for males aged 30 to 39 , average annual personal income fell from the mid-1970s by around $ 5,000 to $ 35,000 .
The growth in family incomes is mostly from women entering the workforce .
But during this recession that will hardly compensate given the scale of male job losses .
For those without a college degree or better , it has been a bloodbath .
“ College - educated men have lost 1.4 percent of their employment levels since right before the beginning of the recession in November 2007 , but for men as a whole it has been nearly six percent , ” said Sum .
Sum said in the last recession the effects were felt more evenly across gender and occupational lines and that construction jobs grew from mid-2002 onward at a strong rate through 2007 .
But production and manufacturing jobs fell steadily through 2005 before making a modest recovery , and then falling swiftly .
EXPANDED WOMEN’S ROLE
This is grim news for struggling blue collar families .
While women ’s role in the workforce has expanded , by some estimates the male remains the main breadwinner in about 75 percent of two - income U.S. households .
“ When males lose their jobs ... women become more important to family income , and those that have not been working will re-enter the labor market to sustain family income , ” said Peter Doeringer , a Professor of Economics at Boston University .
Patti Sutton , 58 , a coffee shop worker in the Phoenix Valley , falls into this category .
Her husband Scott was laid off in October last year .
He had worked for 18 years for a company as a heavy equipment operator excavating the foundations for luxury homes , earning about $ 800 - 900 a week without overtime , and was among the last five workers to be laid off from a staff of 155 .
“ I am now the family breadwinner , ” said Sutton .
She went out to work to get health insurance coverage for her husband in the year before he was laid off after he lost coverage for a heart condition from his employer .
He needs a heart transplant , and was facing insurance costs of $ 1,800 a month .
“ It ’s not like I ’m exactly earning enough to be the breadwinner , ” she said .
“ Basically this job is for insurance , what I bring home barely covers food and maybe a utility . ”
Her situation may be permanent , she said , though construction jobs are seen coming back eventually , spurred in part by President Barack Obama ’s $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus plan that includes funds for road and bridge construction .
But many manufacturing jobs are gone for good , as huge sectors like the auto industry suffer profound cuts .
Doeringer said the recession will leave the economy “ sharply restructured ” .
“ The construction jobs will return , but we are seeing an unusually sharp drop in what is left of manufacturing and much of that drop will not be recovered when the recession ends , and much of what does remain will have be at lower wages with reduced fringe benefits , ” he said .
The agreements were signed in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing
China and Taiwan have agreed to allow investment across the Taiwan Strait in the latest sign of improving relations between them .
Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation signed agreements with Chen Yunlin of China 's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits .
In a joint statement they pledged to " realise the normalisation of cross- strait economic ties " .
It was the third set of deals since Taiwan 's new government came to power .
President Ma Ying - jeou has been in power for a year since running for election on a promise to improve the economy through closer ties with the Chinese mainland .
In the past , while there has been a great deal of mainland investment from Taiwanese firms , Chinese companies have needed permission from the Taiwanese government to invest in Taiwan .
In a joint statement , the two sides said that they faced a " rare and historic opportunity " and that they would " encourage and promote mainland businesses to ... invest in Taiwan " .
Taiwan 's economy went into recession late last year and both sides said they hoped their agreements would help both sides to weather the economic storm .

1. Greediness / Laziness
All regex repetition operators are greedy .
They try to match as much as possible in a string .
Unfortunately , this might not always be a desired effect .
Thus , lazy operators are used to solve this problem .
They only match the smallest possible pattern and are used by adding a ‘?’ after the respective greedy operator .
Alternatively , the ‘ U ’ modifier may be used to make all repetiton operators lazy .
Differentiating between greediness and laziness is key to fully understanding advanced regular expressions .
Greedy Operators
The * operator matches the previous expression 0 or more times .
It is a greedy operator .
Consider the following expression :
preg_match ( '/<h1 >.*</h1>/' , '< h1 > This is a heading .</h1 > < h1 > This is another one . </h1 >' , $ matches ) ;
Recall that a .
means any character except a new line .
The above regular expression is looking for an h1 tag and all of its contents .
It uses the .
and * operators to constantly match anything inside the tag .
This pattern will match :
< h1 > This is a heading .
</h1><h1 > This is another one .</h1 >
It returns the whole string .
The * operator will continuously match everything – even the middle closing h1 tag – because it is greedy .
Matching the whole string is the best it can do .
Lazy Operators
Let ’s change the above operator by adding a ‘?’ after it .
This will make it lazy :
/<h1 >.*?</h1>/
The regex now fulfills its duty and matches only the first h1 tag .
Another greedy operator that uses this same property is {n , } .
This matches the previous expression n or more times .
If it is used without a question mark , it looks for the most repetitions possible .
Otherwise , it starts from n repetitions :
# Set up a String $ str = ' hihi ' ; # Match it using the greedy {n , } operator preg_match ( '/ ( hi ) { 1, } / ' , $ str , $ matches ) ; # matches [ 0 ] will be ' hihi ' #
Match it with the lazy {n , }? operator preg_match ( '/ ( hi ) {1, } ? / ' , $ str , $ matches ) ; # matches [ 0 ] will be 'hi '
2. Back Referencing
What it does
Back referencing is a way to refer to previously matched patterns inside a regular expression .
For example , take a look at this simple regex that matches an expression in quotes :
# Set up an array of matches $ matches = array ( ) ; # Create a String $ str = " " This is a ' string ' " " ; # Traverse it with regular expressions preg_match ( " / ( " | ' ) .*? ( " | ' ) / " , $ str , $ matches ) ; # Print the whole match echo $ matches [ 0 ] ;
Unfortunately , this will not correctly match the string .
Instead , it will print :
" This is a '
This regular expression matches the opening double quote but finds a different type of quote to close it .
This is because it was given the option of picking a double or single quote at the end .
In order to fix this , you can use back referencing .
The expressions 1 , 2 , …. , 9 hold references to previously captured subpatterns .
The first matched quote , in this case , will be held by the variable 1 .
How to Use It
In order to apply this concept to the aforementioned example , use 1 in place of the last quote :
preg_match ( '/ ( " | ' ) .*?1/' , $ str , $ matches ) ;
This will now correctly return :
" This is a ' string ' "
Remember that back referencing may also be used by preg_replace .
Note that instead of 1 … 9 , you should use $ 1 … $ 9 … $n ( any number of these will work ) .
For example , if you want to replace all paragraph tags with text that represents them , use :
$ text = preg_replace ( '/< p>(.*? )</p>/' , " < p >$ 1</p > " , $ html ) ;
The $ 1 back reference holds the text inside the paragraph and is being used in the replace pattern itself .
This completely valid expression shows an easy way to access matched patterns even while replacing .
3. Named Groups
When using multiple back references , a regular expression can quickly become confusing and hard to understand .
An alternative way to back reference is by using named groups .
A named group is specified by using ( ? P< name > pattern ) , where name is the name of the group and pattern is the regular expression in the group itself .
The group can then be referred to by ( ? P=name ) .
For example , consider the following :
/(? P< quote > " |' ) .*?(?
P=quote ) /
The above expression will create the same effect as the previous back reference example , but by instead using named groups .
It is also significantly easier to read .
Named groups are also useful when sifting through the array of matches .
The name given to a specific pattern is also the key of the corresponding matches array .
preg_match ( '/(? P< quote > " | ' ) / ' , " ' String ' " , $ matches ) ; # This will print " ' " echo $ matches [ 1 ] ; #
This will also print " ' " , as it is a named group echo $ matches [ ' quote ' ] ;
Thus , named groups not only make code easier to read but also organize it .
4. Word Boundaries
Word boundaries are places in a string that come between a word character and a non-word character .
The specialty of these boundaries is the fact that they do n’t actually match a character .
Their length is zero .
The b regular expression matches any word boundary .
Unfortunately , boundaries are so often skimmed over that many do not recognize their real significance .
For example , let ’s say you want to match the word “ import ” :
/ import /
Watch out !
Regular expressions can be tricky .
The above expression will also match :
important
You may think it is as simple as adding a space before and after import to prevent these bogus matches :
/ import /
But what about this case ?
The trader voted for the import
When import is at the beginning or the end of a string , the modified regex will fail .
Thus , splitting this up into cases is required :
/( ^import | import | import $ ) /
i
Looking back at our regular expression , it does not take periods or other punctuation into account .
Just to match this single word , a regular expressions may look like this :
/( ^import ( : | ; | , ) ? | import ( : | ; | , ) ? | import ( .|?|! ) ? $ ) /
i
That ’s a lot of code to match just a single word .
This is why word boundaries are so significant .
To accomplish the above statement and many other variations with word boundaries , all that is necessary is :
/ bimportb /
This will match every case above and more .
b ’s flexibility comes from the fact that it matches a zero - length string .
All it matches is an imaginary space between two characters .
It checks if one of the characters is a non-word character and the other is a word character .
If so , it matches it .
If the beginning or end of a string is encountered , b treats it as a non -word character .
Because the i in import is still considered a word character , it will match import .
Note that the opposite of b is B .
This operator will match the space in - between two word or two non-word characters .
Thus , if you would like to match ‘ hi’ inside another word , you could use :
BhiB
5. Atomic Groups
Atomic groups are special regex groups that are non-capturing .
They are usually used to increase the efficiency of a regular expression , but may also be applied to eliminate certain matches .
An atomic group is specified by using ( ?> pattern ) :
/(?> his|this ) /
When the regex engine matches an atomic group , it will discard backtracting positions that came with all tokens inside it .
Consider the word ‘ smashing ’ .
Using the above regular expression , the regex engine will first try to match the pattern ‘ his ’ in ‘ smashing ’ .
It will not find a match .
At this point , the atomic group will kick in .
The engine will discard all backtracking positions .
This means that it will not search for ‘ this ’ inside ‘ smashing ’ .
Why ?
If ‘ his ’ did not return a match , then obviously ‘ this ’ ( which includes ‘ his ’ ) will not return positive either .
The above example did not have many practical uses .
We might as well have used / t? his ?/ instead .
Look at the following :
/b( engineer|engrave|end ) b/
If the regex engine is given the word ‘ engineering ’ , it will correctly match ‘ engineer ’ .
The next word boundary , b , will not match .
Thus , it will move on to the next match : engrave .
It realizes that the ‘ eng ’ matches , but the rest do not .
Finally , ‘ end ’ is attempted and also failed .
If you look carefully , you will realize that once the engine matches ‘ engineer ’ and fails the last word boundary , it can not possibly match ‘ engrave ’ or ‘ end ’ .
These two matches are smaller words than ‘ engineer ’ , and thus the regex engine should not continue with the other trials .
/b(?>engineer|engrave|end )b/
The above is a much better alternative that will save the regex engine time and improve the code ’s efficiency .
6. Recursion
Recursion in regular expressions can be used to match nested constructs , such as parentheses , ( this ( that ) ) , and HTML tags , < div></div > .
They require the use of ( ? R ) , an operator that matches recursive sub-patterns .
Consider the regular expression that matches nested parentheses :
/((( ? >[ ^( ) ] + ) |(? R ) ) * )/
The outermost parentheses in this regular expression match the beginning of the nested constructs .
Then comes an optional operator , which can either match non-parenthetical characters ( ? >[ ^( ) ] + ) or the whole expression again in a sub-pattern , ( ?R ) .
Notice that this operator is repeated as many times as possible to match all nested parentheses .
Another example of recursion at work is the following :
/<([w ] + ).*?>((?>[^<>]+ ) |((? R ) ) ) */
The above expression combines character groups , greedy operators , back - tracking , and atomic groups to match nested tags .
The first parenthesized group ( [ w ] + ) matches the tag name for use later in the regular expression .
It then proceeds to match the rest of the tag .
The next parenthesized sub-expression is very similar to the one above .
It either matches non-tag ( ? >[^<> ]+ ) characters or recurses over another tag ( ? R ) .
Finally , the last part of the expression matches the close tag .
7. Callbacks
Certain matches in a pattern may require special modifications .
In order to apply multiple or complex changes , callbacks can be used .
A callback is used for dynamic substitution Strings in the preg_replace_callback function .
They take in a function as a parameter to use when a match is found .
This function receives the match array as a parameter and returns a modified string that is used as a replacement .
As an example , consider a regular expression that changes all words to uppercase in a given string .
Unfortunately , PHP does not have a regex operator that changes a character to a different case .
To accomplish this task , a callback may be used .
First , the expression must match all letters that need to be capitalized :
/ bw /
The above uses both word boundaries and character classes to work .
Now that we have this expression , we can write a callback function :
function upper_case ( $ matches ) { return strtoupper ( $ matches [ 0 ] ) ; }
upper_case takes in an array of matches and returns the whole matched pattern in uppercase .
$ matches [ 0 ] , in this case , represents the letter that needs to be capitalized .
All of this can now be put together using the preg_replace_callback function :
preg_replace_callback ( '/ bw/ ' , " upper_case " , $ str ) ;
That is the power of a simple callback .
Commenting is not a way to actually match strings , but it is one of the most important parts of regular expressions .
As you dive deep into larger , more complex expressions , it becomes hard to decipher what is actually being matched .
Using comments in the middle of regular expressions is the perfect way to minimize such confusion .
To place a comment inside a regular expression , use the ( ?# comment ) format .
Replace “ comment ” with the word (s ) of your choice :
/(?#digit)d/
It is especially important to comment regular expressions that you release to the public .
Users of your regex will be able to easily understand and modify the pattern to meet their needs .
It can even go so far as to help you decode it when revisiting a program .
Consider using the “ x ” or ( ? x ) modifier for free - spacing mode with comments .
This causes a regular expression to ignore white space between tokens .
All spaces can still be represented with [ ] or ( a backslash and a space ) :
/ d # digit [ ] # space w+ #word /x
The above is the same as :
/d(?#digit ) [ ](?# space )w+(?#word ) /
Always create well - documented code .

March 27 , 2009 – Dr. Dime
There was a lot of hype heading into last night ’s game between the Phoenix Suns and the Portland Blazers , as the playoff hunt in the tight Western Conference has hit it ’s most critical point .
The Suns are battling hard coming off a 6 - game winning streak to knock either the Dallas Mavericks or Portland Blazers out of the 7th or 8th spot in the West .
After last night ’s very important win for Portland , the team gave themselves a little more breathing room .
If any of you tuned in to the game last night in the 4th quarter you would have interpreted the game as blowout .
Phoenix was getting spanked .
But if you tuned in during the first , second , or most of the third quarter it was a different story .
While the Blazers still led for the majority of the game , it was more of a slug fest back and forth with very little defense , lots of run and gun , and high percentage shooting from both teams .
So what happened to the Suns then in the fourth ?
Rudy Fernandez happened .
The Spaniard is good , damn good .
But the critical sequence that led the game to become an easy blowout for the Blazers was n’t actually in the fourth quarter , it was in the final seconds of the third quarter .
Coming off a series of games where the Blazers have been criticized for not closing out quarter ’s well , Rudy Fernandez made sure that did n’t happen last night .
In the final seconds of the third period he scored 5 points in 3 seconds !
That ’s right , 3 seconds .
It was n’t just the fact that he scored them though , it was HOW he scored them .
The first was an inside score on a sweet no look back door pass from fellow Spaniard and teammate Sergio Rodriguez who delighted the crowd with the nifty pass .
Immediately after that bucket , Rudy anticipated the inbounds pass perfectly and stole the ball launching a three pointer at the buzzer to break the game wide open heading into the fourth .
The crowd went nuts .
I ’m pretty sure the inbound passer , Jason Richardson , layed into the rookie Goran Dragic in the intermission for not ‘ coming to the ball ’ on the inbounds play .
But regardless of who was at fault , Rudy Fernandez is everywhere , and was stroking the outside shot last night on every critical play .
Every time he scored , Blazers GM Kevin Pritchard smiled more and more .
Happy with himself for landing arguably the most cost - effective player in the league in Rudy Fernandez .
What a gem :
Un precioso poema de uno de nuestros poetas preferidos .
Un patio
Con la tarde
se cansaron los dos o tres colores del patio .
Esta noche , la luna , el claro círculo ,
no domina su espacio .
Patio , cielo encauzado .
El patio es el declive
por el cual se derrama el cielo en la casa .
Serena ,
la eternidad espera en la encrucijada de estrellas .
Grato es vivir en la amistad oscura
de un zaguán , de una parra y de un aljibe .

I ’m referring not to an instrument of torture , nor industrial furniture for computers , but to the increasingly popular Rack Web server interface .
I ’ve found , first , that the explanations of what it does are n’t that great , and second , that it ’s ideal for my current at - work project .
I bet it ’d be useful for lots of others too , so here ’s my shot at an introduction .
What I ’m Doing · Helping implement the compute part of the Sun Cloud API ; my part is a bridge from the RESTful HTTP messaging in the API to the back - end infrastructure from our recent Q - layer acquisition .
It ’s short bridge , since the Q - layer semantics are pretty generic .
The shape of their API is quite a bit different , though , so there is some pipe - fitting required .
On the other hand , I ’m not doing any persistence to speak of .
Since I need to get this done in a hurry , I wanted to write the code in Ruby .
I also wanted a nice friendly - looking URI space , since this is apt to be the first implementation of the API that anyone sees .
So what I needed was something that would grab requests from a Web server and hand over the details to arbitrary Ruby code and let me figure out what to do .
Routing , bah .
MVC , pfui .
ORM , what ’s that ?
Rack ·
I knew this thing was out there , and I knew that it was being used in both Rails and Merb , and that the kool kids thought it was a kool tool .
But the explanations were sort of arm - wavey and I was having trouble figuring out what it actually did .
Most helpful was Dan Webb ’s 8 minutes on Rack .
Well , here ’s what it does : you wire it up to a Web server and give it an object with a call method , and for every HTTP request it calls call with one argument , a Hash containing everything you ’d ever want to know about the request .
How would I “ wire it up to a Web server ” , you ask ?
It comes with built - in wiring for most of ’em .
For example , here ’s how I wired it up to Mongrel .
web = ComputeAPI :: Web.new Rack :: Handler ::Mongrel.run(web , : Port= > 8080 )
Not much to it , is there ?
What ’s The Argument ?
· I was poking around trying to figure out exactly might be in that Hash that Web #call method was going to get , and decided that it ’d be easier to just print it out than find the docs :
class HelloWorld def initialize ( name ) @name = name end def call ( env ) r = [ " < html > < head >< title>#{@name} </title ></head > " + " < body > <h2>#{@name}</h2><ul > " ] env.each_pair do |n , v| r << " < li > < p > " r << " #{n} => # {v} " r << " </p></li > " end r << " </ul></body ></html > " [ 200 , { ' Content - Type ' => ' text / html ' } , r ] end end require ' rubygems ' require ' rack ' Rack :: Handler :: Mongrel.run( HelloWorld.new ( " Tim " ) , : Port => 4321 )
Notice the other Rack trick : that triple of HTTP status , HTTP headers , and message body that you have to return .
Anyhow , I ’m not going to reproduce the page of HTML this thing gives you ;
But I do recommend running this if you ’re going to play with Rack , to find out what ’s really in that hash .
To do that , put the above in a file called x.rb or some such , then say ruby x.rb , then point your browser at http://localhost:4321/foo?bar=baz .
Dispatching ·
So , here ’s that Web #call method that Rack calls for me :
def call ( env ) uri = path ( env ) case env [ ' REQUEST_METHOD '] when ' GET ' then get ( uri , env ) when ' POST ' then post ( uri , env ) when ' PUT ' then put ( uri , env ) when ' DELETE ' then delete ( uri , env ) end end # chop off the common prefix , leaving what we dispatch on def path ( env ) env [' REQUEST_URI '][@base.length .. - 1 ] end def get ( uri , env ) headers = {} type = nil case uri when ' / ' rep = VDC.new ( @cloud ) .representation type = ' VDC ' when %r{^/vnets /(.*) $} rep = get_vnet ( $ 1 ) type = ' VNet ' if rep # ... lots more regexps elided ... if ( type ) headers [ ' Content - Type ' ] = " application/vnd.com.sun.cloud.#{type}+json " [ 200 , headers , rep ] else headers [ ' Content - Type ' ] = " text / plain " [ 404 , headers , " Ca n't fetch # {uri} " ] end end
I ’ve omitted some error - handling .
It ’s hard to imagine how you could do this any more simply .
Intended Usage · I think the people who built Rack were looking at WSGI and thinking of something to slip in under big complicated frameworks like Rails and Merb and so on .
And I gather it works great for that .
But if you need to do some lightweight Web pipe - fitting , I think Rack is hard to beat .
And I was thinking how easy it might be to glue together Rack and the AtomPub protocol and something like Redis or CouchDB and have yourself a handy - dandy low - rent media publishing system .
Restrain yourself , boyo , you ’re a cloud - jockey these days .
Rather than letting Mr. Madoff remain free on bail and return to his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan , Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court ordered Mr. Madoff remanded as he awaited sentencing .
He has incentive to flee , he has the means to flee , and thus he presents the risk of flight , ” Judge Chin said .
“ Bail is revoked . ”
Some of Mr. Madoff ’s victims in the courtroom applauded his ruling .
The 11 counts of fraud , money laundering , perjury and theft to which Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty carry maximum terms totaling 150 years .
Sentencing was scheduled for June 16 .
Dressed in a charcoal - gray suit , Mr. Madoff , 70 , appeared in a downtown Manhattan courtroom packed with journalists , lawyers and some of his victims and , for the first time , described the scope of what was perhaps the largest fraud in Wall Street history .
Mr. Madoff was sworn in and reminded that he was under oath .
Noting that he had waived indictment , Judge Chin asked , “ How do you now plead , guilty or not guilty ? ”
“ Guilty , ” Mr. Madoff responded .
Flanked by his lawyers , Mr. Madoff began to answer questions from Judge Chin about whether he understood the ramifications of his guilty plea , whether he was satisfied with his legal representation and whether he was competent to enter the plea .
At first , Mr. Madoff ’s voice was barely audible as he acknowledged the litany of crimes .
“ Try to keep your voice up so that I can hear you , please , ” Judge Chin said .
At one point , Mr. Madoff asked for water .
In recounting how he sustained a 20 - year fraud whose collapse erased as much as $ 65 billion that his customers thought they had in their accounts , Mr. Madoff said , “ I believed it would end shortly and I would be able to extricate myself and my clients from the scheme . ”
“ As the years went by , I realized this day , and my arrest , would inevitably come . ”
“ I cannot adequately express how sorry I am for what I have done , ” he said .
“ I am deeply sorry and ashamed . ”
Although Mr. Madoff admitted to operating what he called “ a Ponzi scheme through the investment advisory side of my business , ” he said all other aspects of his enterprise , operated by his sons and brother , were legitimate , profitable and successful .
Mr. Madoff ’s fraud was a global scheme that ensnared hedge funds , nonprofit groups and celebrities , and devastated the life savings of thousands of people .
Some of them came to court on Thursday to speak during the 75 - minute court hearing .
One was Maureen Ebel , who said : “ If we go to trial we have more of a chance to comprehend the global scope of this horrendous crime .
We can hear and bear witness to the pain that Mr. Madoff has inflicted on the young , the old and the infirm . ”
A federal prosecutor , Marc O. Litt , said the government was continuing its investigation and was looking for assets and anyone else who might be criminally responsible .
It remains unclear where the billions of dollars that his victims lost has gone , and whether those victims will ever see any meaningful restitution .
Prosecutors have said the government is seeking $ 170 billion in forfeited assets from Mr. Madoff , apparently representing all the money that ran through Madoff accounts traceable to the crimes .
A court - appointed trustee liquidating Mr. Madoff ’s business has so far only been able to identify about $ 1 billion in assets to satisfy claims .
This week , the government said Mr. Madoff had 4,800 client accounts at the end of November supposedly containing $ 64.8 billion in customer savings .
But the government said Mr. Madoff ’s business “ held only a small fraction of that balance . ”
As Mr. Madoff arrived at the courthouse early Thursday morning , helicopters buzzed overhead and television news trucks lined the street .
The day ’s events marked a coda in the saga of a man whose name has become shorthand for an entire era of greed and deceit on Wall Street .
With the promise of steady , unwavering returns , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities enticed thousands of investors including boldface names like Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey , the Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax and a charity run by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel .
This week , the government offered more details on how Mr. Madoff ran the fraud that had financed his lush lifestyle of a beachfront mansion in the Hamptons , an estate near the French Riviera and yachts in New York , Florida and the Mediterranean .
Prosecutors said that Mr. Madoff concocted an elaborate charade to make it seem like he was running a legitimate investment business when , in reality , “ no such business was actually being conducted . ”
He hired employees with little training or experience and directed them to generate false monthly account statements .
He shuttled millions between banks in New York and London to make it seem as if he was “ conducting securities transactions in Europe on behalf of investors when , in fact , he was not conducting such transactions , ” prosecutors said .
And they said he repeatedly lied to regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission to cover up his scheme .
A second cabinet minister has urged Gordon Brown to hold a referendum on electoral reform to regain the political initiative .
John Denham said designing a system in which " every vote counts " would help rebuild the trust between MPs and their electors following the expenses scandal .
His call came after Alan Johnson , the Health Secretary , argued that the issue should be put to the vote at the next election .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Denham , the Secretary for Innovation , Universities and Skills , told The Independent : " One of the ways we can reconnect politicians with the voters is to increase the power of the voters .
Letting people choose the electoral system would be a huge step forward . "
He added : " The background ... is the need to look for ways of re-establishing better trust between the voters and the political system .
Because of that , it takes on added potency and urgency . "
Up to 100 Labour MPs could support the referendum plan .
The issue of proportional representation has been on ice within Labour ranks for a decade .
But supporters say the expenses furore – and the possibility of a hung parliament after the next election – could give it new momentum .
They are planning a Commons motion next week to gauge the extent of support .
John Grogan , chairman of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform , said : " The political kaleidoscope has been completely shaken up in the last few weeks . "
However , the majority of the Cabinet is thought to oppose discussion of electoral reform .
Senior figures such as the Justice Secretary Jack Straw believe trust will be better restored by reform of the Commons .
Denis MacShane , the former Foreign Office minister said PR allowed extremists into Parliament .

I ’ve been doing a bit of digging on a curious story a couple of weeks ago that simultaneously appeared in the Sunday Telegraph , Sunday Times and the next day in the Daily Mail .
The newspaper reports essentially said : a Channel 4 programmes commissioner has been tipped as the “ front - runner ” as the new Head of Religion at the BBC .
But oh no , he ’s Muslim !
Oh , and a Sikh guy makes Songs of Praise for the BBC !
Ethnics are taking over !
Who will think of the poor Christians ?
I wrote it up for Comment is Free .
Now , of course I do n’t want Christians to be sidelined but the record of Aaqil Ahmed ( the Muslim Channel 4 commissioner ) and Tommy Nagra ( Sikh producer of Songs of Praise ) does n’t offer any indication that they will .
Channel 4 has done tons of interesting programmes about Christianity in recent years .
It ’s just heavily implied that they got this far because of their race , and that if they get the job it will only be because of their backgrounds , and that they will discriminate against Christians .
The problem is that this media hit - job smacks of precisely the things that right - wingers complain about .
Firstly it ’s classic identity ( religious ) politics .
Secondly , it ’s their unwillingness to believe in meritocracy .
If ethnic / religious minorities do well then , for these newspapers , it ’s only thanks to political correctness gone mad .
I expect the Christian lobby in the UK to be strong – but why are the organisations spear - heading this campaign allowed to get away with such naked bigotry ?
The cause has also been taken up by Christian Concern for Our Nation .
They advise members to complain to the BBC :
Your letter or email could make a few of the following points , in your own words : – I am concerned that a Muslim or a Sikh may soon be appointed as head of religious programming at the BBC .
– Given that we are a Christian Nation , it is appropriate that the post of Commissioning Editor , Religion and Head of Religion and Ethics at the BBC should continue to be a Christian .
– I strongly object to the appointment of a person who does not belong to the Christian faith , as this appointment is not representative of the beliefs of the majority of licence holders .
This is the same organisation , by the way , that teamed up with Nadine Dorries MP during her campaign to restrict abortion rights , and most likely funded her website – 20 Reasons for 20 Weeks .
They ’re also very homophobic .
It ’s good to know the sort of company the tory MP likes to hang out with .
Let ’s see if the BBC capitulate to right - wing pressure from xenophobes , yet again .

McCain used to be so much more than a punchline
October 27 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
One of the few agreements I have with Sen. McCain is his opposition to ethanol subsidies and tariffs .
Ethanol is a boondoogle , a mistake and total bullshit .
It takes more energy to make ethanol than the fuel actually produces and the production of ethanol creates more greenhouse gases than are saved by using ethanol as a fuel .
It is stupid and our investment money can better be spent on other renewable technologies .
Since half the country grows corn , it made sense to look at it as a possible fuel source .
Unfortunately , it just does n’t work very well .
However , with Iowa being one of the opening rounds in the upcoming presidential contest , intelligent policy can take a back seat to the need to pander to farmers by promising them continued ethanol subsidies , even though these subsidies not only continue the farce of corn - based fuel but also ratchet up our food costs by diverting stuff we can eat – something corn is quite good it – in favor of something we can put in our cars – something at which corn is middling at best .
Obama , meanwhile , is from Illinois , which grows a pantload of corn ( Iowa ranks No. 1 , Illinois comes in at No. 2 ) so he ’s totally in the tank for ethanol .
Nobody ’s perfect .
Recognizing the folly of ethanol ( or at least taking a stand against stupid giveaways ) , John McCain is opposed to ethanol .
It was one of the reasons he lost the Iowa Caucus to Mike Huckabee .
Or at least , McCain used to be opposed to ethanol subsidies .
Back in 1999 he was opposed , although in this election season , McCain has said with the price of oil being so high , ethanol might make sense .
However , with Iowa polls showing a double digit Obama lead in a state with the “ real America ” profile Sarah Palin gets her panties in a bunch about , Johnny Mac is flip - flopping again :
But at a rally here Sunday afternoon , Mr. McCain seemed to suggest that government has a role in promoting corn ethanol .
“ We ’ll invest in all energy alternatives : nuclear , wind , tide , solar , ethanol , biofuels , ” he said at a rally at the University of Norther Iowa .
“ We ’ll encourage the manufacture of hydro and flex fuel and electric automobiles .
And on the subject of ethanol , my friends , I will open every market in the world to the best products in the world , and that ’s the American agriculture farm . ”
He did not say we should extend the tariffs – his out , no doubt – but as the story points out , that ’s the logical extension of his words .
Even if he said this in June :
“ We made a series of mistakes by not adopting a sustainable energy policy , one of which is the subsidies for corn ethanol , which I warned in Iowa were going to destroy the market ” and contribute to inflation , Mr. McCain told a Brazilian newspaper , O Estado de São Paulo , in June .
“ Besides , it is wrong , ” he added , to tax Brazilian - made sugar cane ethanol , “ which is much more efficient than corn ethanol . ”
But , in the rush to pander to every possible voter at every possible opportunity , Johnny Mac is willing to change every one of his stands and piss on just about every one of his core beliefs - religious intolerance , torture , tax cuts , hiring Bush ’s people who slimed him in 2000 , basing a campaign on experience and then selecting a neophyte moron as a veep , etc .
And it ’s too bad , because the pandering asshole out there on the stump is ruining the career of the principled , decent and honorable McCain that ran against Bush in 2000 , and made his name on “ straight talk . ”
Sad , really .
THAT John McCain was a hero .
The guy out there now is just a punchline .
Laptops come in all shapes and sizes .
Choosing which laptop screen size is best for you can be a difficult decision with so many options available to you .
Do you need a compact 11 ” – 13 ” laptop for school or travel or a huge 17 ” screen for all your gaming needs .
The size of the laptop screen you need basically depends on what you want to use your laptop for .
What is the normal laptop size ?
Laptop screen sizes tend to fall into 4 categories :
11 ” laptops
13 ” laptops
15 ” laptops
17 ” laptops
Some laptop manufacturers have made laptops that are 12 ” and 14 ” and so on but they tend to have the same attributes as their closest screen size neighbors .
These are the most popular sizes available on the market and the ones manufacturers make the most of .
Is an 11”,13 ”,15 ” , etc. laptop too big ?
This completely depends on your tastes and the work you ’re doing .
Some people scoff at the idea of lugging around a 17 ” laptop while others think a 13 ” laptop is rather tiny to get any work done .
15 ” laptops tend to be the industry standard with the smaller laptops being ‘ ultraportable ’ and larger laptops being ‘ desktop replacements ’ .
While 13 ” laptops tend to be better for portability and larger laptops have their place in the gaming realm , you can easily get a 17 ” laptop and still use it for travel .
I would n’t suggest gaming on a small laptop but it is n’t impossible .
It really comes down to your personal preference .
There is no too big or too small option .
Do bigger laptops have better screens ?
Not necessarily .
Just because the screen is larger does not necessarily mean that the resolution is better .
A 13 ” laptop can have a resolution of 3840 × 1260 ( 4K ) while a 17 ” laptop can have a screen resolution of 1920 × 1080 ( Full HD ) .
Newer laptops of all sizes are beginning to offer 4 K resolution but they are often much more expensive than their HD cousins .
Resolution neither suffers nor is enhanced by screen size .
Should I Buy An 11 - Inch Laptop ?
Pros
Ultralight
Ultraportable
Thin
Budget - friendly
Cons
Small storage space ( 32 GB to 128GB )
Small processor
Lacking port options and optical drives
11 ” laptops are growing more popular among manufacturers such as Apple , HP , Asus , and Lenovo .
These ultraportable , lightweight laptops are great for traveling as they are only just bigger than tablets and easily fit into regular - sized bags and backpacks .
They are often very budget - friendly which makes them a great option for cash strapped students and young professionals .
To make a cheap , lightweight laptop , a lot is often removed and / or downsized in these laptops .
Namely the processor and the hard disk .
Many of these laptops struggle to top 60 GB of storage although there are larger models available for a greater price .
The processors are often downsized as well which can cause slightly slower speeds than you may be used to on a larger laptop .
Should I Buy An 13 - Inch Laptop ?
Pros
Lightweight
Variety of options available
Budget - friendly ( mid-range )
Cons
Lack of performance for gaming
Often lacking ports and optical drives
The 11 ” laptop ’s a slightly beefier sibling , the 13 ” laptop is a highly popular ultraportable option .
13 ” laptops are great mid-range budget options although some can catch prices as low as $ 150 .
They offer larger storage capacity and far better processing than most 11 ” laptops .
They ’re just as lightweight and portable as 11 ” laptops .
13 ” laptops cross a large variety of manufacturers which gives potential buyers a range of options to choose from .
2 - in - 1s are a popular variation that often comes in this size which is great for versatility .
These laptops lack the performance for hardcore gaming but depending on the game and recommended specs , you may be able to pull a few low end , lightweight games on these laptops .
Should I Buy An 15 - Inch Laptop ?
Pros
Large variety
Range of options
Affordable
Great overall performance
Cons
Some can be bulky
15 ” laptops are the most common laptop size on the market .
Manufacturers make so many different models , customizations , and types of 15 ” laptops that your options are virtually endless .
They range in price from $ 200 - $ 2000 depending on the hardware that ’s inside .
You can get 15 ” laptops with the most basic processing , memory , and storage for an extremely affordable price .
On the flip side , you can get a 15 ” laptop with all the top of the line hardware the market has to offer for a higher end , yet still a portable machine .
Overall , 15 ” laptops have stunning performance options and most have the ability to run AAA games at decent speeds and graphics .
… It all depends on what pieces of hardware you would like , what brand you choose , and what your budget is …
Not all 15 ” laptops are created equal .
Some can have bulky chassis ’ , other large screen bezels , etc .
It all depends on what pieces of hardware you would like , what brand you choose , and what your budget is .
Should I Buy An 17 - Inch Laptop ?
Pros
Large display
Ports galore
Best for gaming
Outstanding Performance
Cons

Bulky
17 ” laptops are beloved by laptop gamers .
They make great desktop replacers if your laptop tends to stay on your desk for most of the day .
Their larger size allows them to have more hardware so you wo n’t be short of ports or drives .
Games look fantastic on these laptops .
There are entire series ’ of 17 ” laptops built with gamers in mind ( Alienware , MSI , ASUS ROG , etc ) .
Expect top of the line graphics cards and processing for playing all of today ’s top games .
These laptops can be on the heavier side , upwards of 6 - 8 lbs which makes them great desktop replacers but not the best for the traveling gamer .
Which Laptop Screen Size Is Best Based On Usage ?

College / Travel : 11 ” to 13 ”
Business : 13 ” to 15 ”
Gaming : 15 ” to 17 ”
What to choose ?

Students are likely going to go with a smaller laptop like an 11 ” or 13 ” that ’s super portable so it ’s easier to get from class to class , coffee shop to coffee shop .
This allows students to cut down on any bulk in their bags as well .
Nothing like lugging around a giant laptop on top of all of your textbooks .

Editor 's note : Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld , the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence .
Mexico police round up gang suspects in Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas .
CAMARGO , Mexico ( CNN ) --
There are no welcome signs on the approach to Camargo .
It 's a hardscrabble Mexican border town and home turf for " Los Zetas , " a gang of hitmen and corrupt former special forces cops on the bankroll of the Gulf Cartel .
Local journalists explained if we went there we'd be getting " tangled up in the hooves of the horse . "
They said Zeta gunmen recently smashed one reporter 's fingers with a hammer as a warning to the media to stay away .
The plaza was deserted -- for a few minutes at least .
Then the throb of engines broke the Sunday morning peace .
Scores of pickup trucks with heavily tinted windows began circling .
Occasionally a window would crack open .
We were clearly being watched .
A black SUV pulled up alongside the soda stand .
One of the occupants stepped out .
First I saw the ostrich skin cowboy boots , then the highly polished 9 mm pistol strapped to his side .
It was loaded with a longer - than - usual ammunition clip , custom - made to pack extra bullets .
It was a brazen flouting of Mexican law to carry a gun that way .
No words .
Not even a stare .
But his message seemed unequivocal .
Our visit to Camargo lasted just 20 minutes .
Taking the strong hint , we immediately left town .
Much as we wanted to explore the underbelly of the drug war raging in Mexico , it was clear the capos , or bosses , and their hired guns were in no mood to talk .
Their business thrives best in the shadows .
Our best chance of getting some insight was to track down a cast of peripheral characters who live in the gray areas , somewhere between the extremes of right and wrong .
The hospitality was little better in nearby Miguel Aleman .
Customers , even an argumentative drunk , fell silent as we ordered a beer in a dingy cantina .
A couple of tired - looking prostitutes retreated to a far corner .
They may have been down on their luck but they knew talking to outsiders was n't worth the cost .
Here the Zetas are well - known for enforcing their law of silence at gunpoint .
Watch Mexican cops on the hunt for gang members »
Along this stretch of the border Los Zetas are kings .
From here their bloody reach stretches far across Mexico and deep into Central America .
They run immigrant smuggling , drug trafficking , prostitution rackets , video piracy and local politics .
In the glitzy industrial city of Monterrey , we met a marijuana dealer smoking his own merchandise in the bathroom of a dance club .
The man , whom we can't name for his safety , explained how he had been recruited at gunpoint two years earlier by the Zetas to be what they call a " landowner " ( terrateniente in Spanish ) -- in charge of cocaine distribution in a handful of neighborhoods .
He said Zeta gunmen bundled him into a truck and with assault rifles aimed at his head they gave him three options -- pay them $ 100,000 , begin working for them or die .
Over the next few days , he said , the same gunmen scared off or killed rival drug dealers , leaving him in charge of what he said was a $ 4,000 - a - day business .
It all ended , he said , when Mexican soldiers kicked down his door .
He was never detained but his cover was blown .
Local Zeta commanders thanked him for not ratting on them by giving him permission to retire from the business .
But recently he 's gone into business for himself selling $ 2 bags of pot .
He realizes working independently of the Zetas may be fatal .
" Maybe I 'm stupid or something , but I do n't know how to do anything else .
If they catch me it 's simple , they 'll kill me .
It 's just not allowed to work freelance , " he said .
An old friend of mine in Monterrey knew the marijuana peddler well and vouched for his story .
He never made good on his promise to give us a recorded account .
He went on a 24 - hour drug binge .
When we caught up with him again he was smoking crack , sweating profusely and paranoid his former paymasters would exact revenge .
Mexico 's tit - for - tat vendettas look like uncontrolled chaos .
Mob assassins are no longer content with efficient execution - style killings .
Sinaloa cartel hitmen regularly place pig masks on the faces of their Juarez cartel victims .
And in a grim seasonal touch , killers in Juarez decapitated a cop and placed a Father Christmas hat on his severed head .
But in a sidewalk cafe in Guadalajara , " Jose " explains there is a clearly defined set of narco - rules that must be followed .
A small - time Latin American cocaine trafficker I 've known for years introduced me to Jose .
Jose is old school .
He tells me he 's been in the cocaine trade since the early 1980s almost since it began , has worked internationally and done a stretch in prison
" From the outside it might look like the cartels are just going around killing people .
But on the inside there 's a code of conduct , rules .
You might not want to kill somebody but you have to because it's all about respect , " he said .
" This can not work if there 's no respect .
Above all , the capos use logic to solve the problems . "
Jose added that he believed groups of corrupt officials and law enforcement officers were using the militarization of the border region not as a means to crush the drug cartels but as a way of forcing them to pay a bigger slice of the drug profits as bribes .
" The authorities and the cartels use the rule of 10 .
By that I mean for every 10 kilos of cocaine we move , we have to give three to the authorities and keep seven for ourselves , " he explained .
" When times are bad the authorities may arrest somebody or grab an entire consignment and that 's a way for forcing up their percentage take . "
Jose 's assertion might seem like feverish conspiracy theory if it were n't for the growing list of Mexican officials , ranging from local cops and foot soldiers to generals and men at the highest levels of law enforcement , who 've been busted for allegedly profiting from the drug trade .
In November , Mexico 's former drug czar was detained on suspicion that he may have accepted $ 450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers .
He had been in charge of the attorney general 's office that specializes in combating organized crime .

Italy muzzled scientist who foresaw earthquake ; warning removed from Internet RAW STORY
Published : Monday April 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Italy quake kills 92 , devastates historic town
A powerful earthquake tore through central Italy on Monday killing more than 90 people as Renaissance buildings in a historic town were reduced to rubble .
The quake had n't been completely unexpected .
Italy muzzled a scientist who foresaw it .
" Vans with loudspeakers had driven around the town a month ago telling locals to evacuate their houses after seismologist Gioacchino Giuliani predicted a large quake was on the way , prompting the mayor 's anger , " Gavin Jones reports for Reuters .
Jones adds , " Giuliani , who based his forecast on concentrations of radon gas around seismically active areas , was reported to police for ' spreading alarm ' and was forced to remove his findings from the Internet . "
The Telegraph reports he also " posted a video on YouTube in which he said a build - up of radon gas around the seismically active area suggested a major earthquake was imminent . "
A New York Times blog report notes , " The Italian version of PC World has an article about Mr. Giulianis warning , featuring an interview with him posted on YouTube , in which he repeated the prediction just a few days before the quake struck . "
Rescue workers quoted by the Italian media , said the provisional death toll had risen to 92 , updating an earlier toll of 50 dead , while officials said more than 1,500 people had been injured in the deadly quake .
Hundreds of rescuer workers scrambled to find victims trapped under collapsed homes in L'Aquila , which bore the brunt of the quake , and officials warned the toll would rise .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared a state of emergency and cancelled a trip to Russia so he could go to the city , the capital of the Abruzzo region , about 100 kilometres ( 60 miles ) northeast of Rome .
The quake struck just after 3:30 am ( 0130 GMT ) and lasted about 30 seconds , bringing down many Renaissance era and Baroque buildings , including the dome on one of the hundreds of years old churches in L'Aquila .
The city 's cathedral was also damaged .
Roofs caved in on sleeping inhabitants and boulders fell off mountain slopes blocking many roads .
At least five children were among the dead in L'Aquila , according to police quoted by ANSA news agency .
The quake measured magnitude 6.2 , according to the Italian geophysical institute .
The epicentre was only five kilometres ( three miles ) directly below L'Aquila which explained the heavy damage that was inflicted up to 30 kilometres away in all directions .
Sirens blared across the city as rescue workers with dogs raced to find survivors .
Many of the 60,000 residents fled into the streets as more than a dozen aftershocks rattled the buildings .
Some even left L'Aquila by foot with belongings in suitcases leaving behind the historic buildings with badly cracked walls and debris strewn across the streets .
Rescue workers pulled several people alive out of one four - storey building and said they could hear the cries of one woman still trapped .
They planned to try to lift the roof with a giant crane .
Doctors treated people in the open air outside L'Aquila 's main hospital as only one operating room was functioning .
L'Aquila resident Maria Francesco said : " It was the apocalypse , our house collapsed .
It 's destroyed , and there 's nothing left to recover . "
" It 's a scandal what 's happened , " she told AFP .
" For the past three months there have been regular tremors , and they 've been getting stronger and stronger ! "
Luigi D'Andrea , a student , was asleep when the quake struck .
" Everything shook really hard and bricks started falling on me .
Then it was an entire wall that collapsed in my bedroom , then a second . "
He escaped through a neighbour 's flat and returned to recover his computer .
" I 'm very lucky I was n't hurt , but now I do n't know what to do , whether I should leave here or not .
I 'll wait and see . "
L'Aquila suffered the biggest toll .
Other dead were reported in the surrounding towns and villages of Castelnuovo , Poggio Picenze , Tormintarte , Fossa , Totani and Villa Sant ' Angelo , said police quoted by ANSA .
US President Barack Obama , in Turkey as part of a landmark European tour , expressed concern .
" We want to send our condolences to the families there and hope that we are able to get rescue teams in , " Obama told a press conference .
Pope Benedict XVI was praying for the victims , the Vatican said .
But Guido Bertolaso , head of Italy 's public safety department , warned the toll would rise .
" It 's an event that will mobilise the nation for many weeks , " he said , adding that at least 10,000 homes or buildings had been damaged in the quake .
Some 15,000 people suffered a power outage and the L'Aquila to Rome highway was closed .
The quake came about five hours after a 4.6 - magnitude tremor shook the Ravenna district in Emilia - Romagna region , which was felt over a wide area , notably in the Marche region on the Adriatic coast , officials said .
A powerful earthquake in the region claimed 13 lives in 1997 and damaged or destroyed priceless cultural heritage .
Italy is criss - crossed by two fault lines , making it one of Europe 's most quake - vulnerable regions , with some 20 million people at risk .
An October 2002 quake killed 30 people including 27 pupils and their teacher who were crushed under their schoolhouse in the tiny medieval village of San Giuliano di Puglia .
On November 23 , 1980 , a violent quake struck the southern region of Irpiona near Naples , killing 2,570 , injuring 8,850 and displacing 30,000 .

The case of a 13 - year - old Arizona girl strip - searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain - reliever will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this week .
The Supreme Court has a mixed record when it comes to students ' rights .
The justices in January accepted the Safford school district case for review , and will decide whether a campus setting gives school administrators greater discretion to control students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed in cases involving adults in general public spaces .
The case is centered around Savana Redding , now 19 , who in 2003 was an eighth - grade honors student at Safford Middle School , about 127 miles from Tucson , Arizona .
Redding was strip - searched by school officials after a fellow student accused her of providing prescription - strength ibuprofen pills .
The school has a zero - tolerance policy for all prescription and over - the - counter medication , including the ibuprofen , without prior written permission .
" In this case , the United States Supreme Court will decide how easy it is for school officials to strip search your child , " Adam Wolf , an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Redding , told CNN Radio on Sunday .
Wolf told CNN Radio his client was traumatized by the search .
" School officials undoubtedly have difficult jobs , but sometimes they overreact -- and this was just a clear overreaction , " he said .
Redding was pulled from class by a male vice principal , escorted to an office , where she denied the accusations .
A search of Redding 's backpack found nothing .
Then , although she never had prior disciplinary problems , a strip search was conducted with the help of a school nurse and Wilson 's assistant , both females .
According to court records , she was ordered to strip to her underwear and her bra was pulled out .
Again , no drugs were found .
In an affidavit , Redding said , " The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had .
I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry . "
At issue is whether school administrators are constitutionally barred from conducting searches of students investigated for possessing or dealing drugs that are banned on campus .
A federal appeals court found the search " traumatizing " and illegal .
Some parents say older children deserve the same constitutional rights as adults , but educators counter a school setting has always been treated differently by courts , and a ruling against them could jeopardize campus safety .
While a federal magistrate and a three - panel appeals court found the search was reasonable , the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Redding last year .
" Common sense informs us , " wrote the court , " that directing a 13 - year - old girl to remove her clothes , partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area , for allegedly possessing ibuprofen ... was excessively intrusive . "
The court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug - and crime - free classroom .
" The overzealousness of school administrators in efforts to protect students has the tragic impact of traumatizing those they claim to serve .
And all this to find prescription - strength ibuprofen . "
In its appeal to the Supreme Court , the school district said restrictions on conducting student searches would cast a " roadblock to the kind of swift and effective response that is too often needed to protect the very safety of students , particularly from the threats posed by drugs and weapons . "
School officials said the court was " wholly uninformed about a disturbing new trend " -- the abuse of over - the - counter medication by teenagers .
The high court has a mixed record over the years on students ' rights .
In a famous 1969 ruling , the justices said students do not " shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate . "
But decisions in the 1980s gave administrators greater discretion , including one case that said officials need not be required to have a warrant to search a student 's locker .
Such a search was permitted if there were " reasonable " grounds for believing it would turn up evidence and when the search was not " excessively intrusive . "
Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes , and those participating in other extracurricular activities .
And in a well - publicized 2007 ruling from Alaska , the Supreme Court upheld the suspension of a student who displayed a large " Bong Hits 4 Jesus " banner at an off - campus , but school - sponsored , event .
The decision did not endorse a broader argument that students in general have limited free - speech rights when they interfere with a school 's vaguely defined " educational mission . "
The court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches , and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over .
The case is Safford United School District No. 1 v. Redding ( 08-479 ) .

MELBOURNE ( Reuters ) - Caught Twittering or on Facebook at work ?
It 'll make you a better employee , according to an Australian study that shows surfing the Internet for fun during office hours increases productivity .
The University of Melbourne study showed that people who use the Internet for personal reasons at work are about 9 percent more productive that those who do not .
Study author Brent Coker , from the department of management and marketing , said " workplace Internet leisure browsing , " or WILB , helped to sharpened workers ' concentration .
" People need to zone out for a bit to get back their concentration , " Coker said on the university 's website ( www.unimelb.edu.au/)
" Short and unobtrusive breaks , such as a quick surf of the Internet , enables the mind to rest itself , leading to a higher total net concentration for a days ' work , and as a result , increased productivity , " he said .
According to the study of 300 workers , 70 percent of people who use the Internet at work engage in WILB .
Among the most popular WILB activities are searching for information about products , reading online news sites , playing online games and watching videos on YouTube .
" Firms spend millions on software to block their employees from watching videos , using social networking sites or shopping online under the pretence that it costs millions in lost productivity , " said Coker .
" That 's not always the case . "
However , Coker said the study looked at people who browsed in moderation , or were on the Internet for less than 20 percent of their total time in the office .
" Those who behave with Internet addiction tendencies will have a lower productivity than those without , " he said .

It is 1 / 2 cup cooked rice , 1 / 2 cup cooked kidney beans , a handful of spinach , a handful of steamed broccoli topped with a half of an avocado .
It looks beautiful and tastes as good as it looks ! "
I sh*t you not .
She is really pushing this .
Here ’s what Bachmann said on Minnesota radio station KTLK - AM ( podcast ) this weekend ( in reference to The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act , a proposed expansion of the AmeriCorps program that Obama may sign into law this week ) :
It ’s under the guise of — quote — volunteerism .
But it ’s not volunteers at all .
It ’s paying people to do work on behalf of government .
... I believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service .
And the real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people , where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums .
Hear is the audio of the interview .
Not only is she pushing " re-education camps " but she 's trying to push a narrative that Obama is " ceding Global Soveriegnty " to the rest of the world .
I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander .
Does n't anybody notice this ?
I feel like I 'm taking crazy pills !
We just saw 3 Police Offices killed in the line of duty by a guy who completely believed this type of conspiracy theory fueled propaganda .
Who is going to say enough is enough !?
How long before we see this in Fox News ?
First by resident half wit Glenn Beck , and then spreading to Hannity and Rush and others ?

Sir John Sulston , Nobel prize winner and one of the architects of the Human Genome Project , has teamed up with Bloomsbury to edit a new series of books that will look at topics including the ethics of genetics and the cyber enhancement of humans .
The series will be the first from Bloomsbury 's new venture , Bloomsbury Academic , launched late last year as part of the publisher 's post - Harry Potter reinvention .
Using Creative Commons licences , the intention is for titles in the imprint to be available for free online for non-commercial use , with revenue to be generated from the hard copies that will be printed via print - on - demand and short - run printing technologies .
Publisher Frances Pinter is talking to " very high - level academics " across the disciplines to build up the list , which she hopes to reach 200 - odd titles a year by 2014 , but Sulston and his colleague John Harris , professor of bioethics at Manchester University , are the first editors of a series she 's signed up .
The books she hopes to publish are intended to appeal to the " educated layman " as well as to academic circles and should " help the academic world speak to people who should be listening to what they have to say , " she said today .
Sulston and Harris 's series , Science , Ethics and Innovation , will be aimed " at a very wide market " , covering subjects from " the interplay between science and society , to new technological and scientific discoveries and how they impact on our understanding of ourselves and our place in society " , and the responsibility of science to the wider world .
Authors they will be looking to commission will range from academics to policymakers , opinion formers , those working in commercial scientific roles , " and maybe even politicians " .
" They 'll be non-technical books which will appeal to any intelligent person , " said Harris .
" The proverbial Guardian reader . "
Sulston and Harris 's own current research into topics including genetic ethics and human enhancement is also likely to " find its way " into the series , said Sulston .
" Bloomsbury 's is a new business model and chimes absolutely with something I 've been involved with for years – open access to scientific data , " he said .
" We immediately hit common ground with Frances Pinter and felt if Bloomsbury was keen to go ahead , we were keen to be part of it . "
He stressed that the area he and Harris would be covering - the interface between science , ethics and innovation - was of international interest , and offering the books for free online would allow readers around the world to access them .
" Most of the world is very poor and access to literature is a real issue .
There are all sorts of ways of sorting this out , and this is clearly one of them , " he said .
Cyber enhancement , he said , was a likely topic .
" The use of machines and technology to enhance human functions is a very important new area . "
The first and only book Bloomsbury Academic has published so far , Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig 's Remix : Making Art and Commerce thrive in the Hybrid Economy , has been downloaded for free in 105 countries , said Pinter , but has also been selling well .
" Not everyone has enough money to buy a physical book so we 're delighted we can get Lawrence 's message to people who can't afford the book , " she said .
" And we 're delighted we can sell books too . "
Pinter estimates that Bloomsbury would have to sell around 200 copies of a highly technical monograph , priced at around £ 50 , to make a profit , but a more commercial title with a wider appeal and a lower price point would need to sell around 2,000 copies to be worthwhile .
" We believe there are enough people who are willing to purchase a hard copy that we will sell enough physical books to meet our needs , to cover our costs and make a modest profit , " she said .
" But we wo n't be able to judge whether [ the model is ] financially viable for the next two years . "
And with academics more and more frequently looking to publish their work themselves online , Pinter is adamant that " if
publishers are not willing to experiment with models , academics will bypass publishers " .
Sulston , who jointly won a 2002 Nobel prize for discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death , is the perfect launch editor for the series , she believes .
" I 've followed what John has been doing and I just think the world of him , " she said .
" He 's very forward looking in terms of what we can do with science – cyber enhancement , genetic manipulation – and all of these things need very sophisticated public debate . "
On the other hand regularly gumshoe police work by local law enforcement and the FBI DID succeed at protecting American citizens .
In an interview in London in April 2008 , I remind F.B.I. director Robert Mueller of the attacks planned against targets on American soil since 9/11 that his agents have disrupted : for example , a plot to kill soldiers at Fort Dix , New Jersey , and another to wreak mayhem at army recruiting centers and synagogues in and around Torrance , California .
These and other homegrown conspiracies were foiled by regular police work .
The F.B.I. learned of the Fort Dix plot from a Circuit City store where a technician raised the alarm when asked to copy firearms - training videos , while the Torrance cell was rounded up when cops probed the backgrounds of two of its members after they allegedly robbed a local gas station .
No waterborading , no wide - net of electronic surveillance , just a reasonable TIP and good follow up .
Like the tip by one Pheonix FBI Agent in 2001 that I 've got some guys where who want to fly planes , but do n't much care about landing them .
Time and time again we hear " The Tactics were Necessary " or " There was no other way " , but clearly there IS another way .
A way that works .
Furthermore , what seems more and more apparent from the various sources which are now coming forward in conjunction with the Levin Report from the Senate Armed Services Committee is that torture under the Bush Administration was n't used to provide information to save Americans , it was used to proved information to save Bush 's Foreign Policy , and justify the Iraq War
Several of those I interviewed point out the dearth of specific claims the administration has proffered .
" The proponents of torture say , ‘ Look at the body of information that has been obtained by these methods . ’
But if K.S.M. and Abu Zubaydah did give up stuff , we would have heard the details , " says Cloonan .
" What we got was pabulum . "
A former C.I.A. officer adds : " Why ca n’t they say what the good stuff from Abu Zubaydah or K.S.M. is ?
It ’s not as if this is sensitive material from a secret , vulnerable source .
You ’re not blowing your source but validating your program .
They say they ca n’t do this , even though five or six years have passed , because it ’s a ‘ continuing operation . ’
But has it really taken so long to check it all out ? "
Officials who analyzed Abu Zubaydah ’s interrogation reports say that the reports were afforded the highest value within the Bush administration not because of the many American lives they were going to save but because they could be cited repeatedly against those who doubted the wisdom of ousting Saddam by force .
" We did n’t know he ’d been waterboarded and tortured when we did that analysis , and the reports were marked as credible as they could be , " the former Pentagon analyst tells me .
" The White House knew he ’d been tortured .
I did n’t , though I was supposed to be evaluating that intelligence . "
To draw conclusions about the importance of what Abu Zubaydah said without knowing this crucial piece of the background nullified the value of his work .
" It seems to me they were using torture to achieve a political objective .
I cannot believe that the president and vice president did not know who was being waterboarded , and what was being given up . "
Oh , I think the did know .
Particularly since Zubaydah and KSM were n't the only ones this technique was used against .
Ibn Shayk Al - Libi , an associate of Zubaydah who was captured and tortured in Egypt , was the primary source of information that Iraq had provided chemical weapons training to Al Qeada .
Guess what , this information was false
Just like the information that Iraq posseses " Mobile Weapons Labs " come from a former Iraqi who had relocated to Germany named Rafid Alwan , aka Curveball .
( See this Report from BBC Newsnight ) who was also , like , al - Libi , Lying .
The information provided by Curveball and al - Libi together led us into unneccesary and tragic War with an Unarmed Nation .
And many others were coercively mistreated and suffered in The Black Sites , Gitmo , Abu Ghraib and Bagram AFB in order to help bolster their false claims .
Tortured to provide Lies to justify other lies .
We have to come to grips with the fact that the U.S. deliberately waged a Campaign of Terror across the middle - east all based on LIES !
What needs to be asked now is not just what information we received through " enhanced interrogation " but also - how much of that information was BULLSHIT and led us down rat - holes and on wild - goose chases like the " Liberty City Six " .
It really does n't matter if any of these claims were ever true , because if so it probably was n't necessary to go these lengths , most likely the reason they were " resistant " is because the questions being asked were bogus , and by using these methods all we 've done is get more bad information .
Bad information that cost far more lives than any of the " good " information ( assuming there somehow is any that the FBI director does n't know about ) may have saved .
Garbage
In , garbage out .

Farm state senators Max Baucus ( D - MT ) and Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , along with at least 13 other senators , are expected to announce legislation this week that would lift restrictions imposed by the Bush administration requiring all shipments of U.S. agricultural goods to Cuba to be paid for before they were left port .
If lifted , the change would increase U.S. agricultural exports to the island .
The move mirrors agriculture industry sentiment , and seeks to build on the opening created when President Obama eased travel , remittance and telecommunications restrictions .
Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , has introduced similar legislation in previous years .
In 2007 , he sponsored the Promoting American Agricultural and Medical Exports to Cuba Act , which would have prohibited restrictions on payments from Cuban financial institutions and directed the Agriculture Department to promote exports to the island .
According to Parr Rosson of Texas A&M University , agricultural sales to Cuba could reach $ 1 billion per year if restrictions were lifted .

Influenza A( H1N1 ) - update 17
6 May 2009 - As of 06:00 GMT , 6 May 2009 , 22 countries have officially reported 1516 cases of influenza A ( H1N1 ) infection .
Mexico has reported 822 laboratory confirmed human cases of infection , including 29 deaths .
The United States has reported 403 laboratory confirmed human cases , including one death .
The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with no deaths - Austria ( 1 ) , Canada ( 165 ) , China , Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( 1 ) , Colombia ( 1 ) , Costa Rica ( 1 ) , Denmark ( 1 ) , El Salvador ( 2 ) , France ( 4 ) , Germany ( 9 ) , Guatemala ( 1 ) , Ireland ( 1 ) , Israel ( 4 ) , Italy ( 5 ) , Netherlands ( 1 ) , New Zealand ( 6 ) , Portugal ( 1 ) , Republic of Korea ( 2 ) , Spain ( 57 ) , Switzerland ( 1 ) and the United Kingdom ( 27 ) .
It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international travel and for people developing symptoms following international travel to seek medical attention , in line with guidance from national authorities .
Individuals are advised to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and should seek medical attention if they develop any symptoms of influenza - like illness .
WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders .
There is no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well - cooked pork and pork products .
Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO website on a regular basis .

US President Barack Obama has approved measures that will allow Cuban Americans to travel more freely to Cuba , his spokesman has said .
Cuban - Americans will also be allowed to send more money to relatives in Cuba .
The move , announced by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , comes after Mr Obama last month signed a spending bill easing some economic sanctions on Cuba .
Mr Gibbs said the aim was to promote democracy and human rights on the Caribbean island .
" The president has directed the secretaries of state , treasury and commerce to carry out the actions necessary to lift all restrictions on the ability of individuals to visit family members in Cuba and to send them remittances , " said Mr Gibbs .
The changes fulfilled a pledge made by Mr Obama during his presidential campaign and would help bridge the gap between divided Cuban families , he added .
The US has had a full embargo on trade with Cuba since 1962 .
Regional summit Restrictions would also be lifted on US telecommunications companies applying for licences to operate in Cuba , Mr Gibbs added .
Cuban - Americans are eager to help their families in Cuba
That move could open the way for a greater flow of information to the island via the internet , says the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington , although much will depend on the attitude of the Cuban government itself .
" The president would like to see greater freedom for the Cuban people , " said Mr Gibbs .
" There are actions that he can and has taken today to open up the flow of information to provide some important steps to help that . "
The move comes as Mr Obama prepares for a summit with regional leaders in Trinidad later this week .
The US president has indicated he would be open to dialogue with Cuba 's leaders .
But he has said that , like previous American presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the US embargo once Cuba 's communist government makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
Cuba's President Raul Castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new US administration , providing there are no preconditions .
President Obama clearly believes that engagement may yet achieve what the half - century embargo never did , says our correspondent : real political change in Cuba .
But there is no talk for the moment of opening diplomatic relations or of lifting the general trade embargo , he adds .

Time Warner Backs Off Metered Billing Consumers : 1 Time Warner Cable : 0 According to local Rochester , NY ABC affiliate WHAM , Senator Chuck Schumer spoke in Rochester today .
While it was simply expected he'd be speaking out against Time Warner Cable 's metered billing trial , the Senator announced that he'd spoken with the carrier , and that Time Warner Cable would be backing away from caps and overages in response to unprecedented consumer outrage in trial markets .
Schumer 's appearance in Rochester was coordinated by Stop The Cap.com , a blog created by Broadband Reports user Phillip Dampier in response to a growing push toward metered billing .
Update 1 : Indications are Time Warner Cable is backing away from the plan in all markets .
" In the face of enormous community opposition and at Schumer ’s urging , Time Warner will shelve the plan for all of their test markets , " Schumer has stated in a prepared statement to be released shortly .
Time Warner Cable is expected to issue an announcement sometime this afternoon .
Update 2 : Time Warner Cable has confirmed the move and issued an official statement here , though the wording continues to use the same kind of disingenuous language that helped put the company squarely in the middle of a public relations quagmire to begin with .
According to Time Warner Cable , the company is stopping the trial because " there is a great deal of misunderstanding " concerning their metered billing trials , and the carrier wants to focus on the " customer education process . "
Says company CEO Glenn Britt : quote :
It is clear from the public response over the last two weeks that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about our plans to roll out additional tests on consumption based billing .
As a result , we will not proceed with implementation of additional tests until further consultation with our customers and other interested parties , ensuring that community needs are being met .
While we continue to believe that consumption based billing may be the best pricing plan for consumers , we want to do everything we can to inform our customers of our plans and have the benefit of their views as part of our testing process . "
Of course , customers who were angry with Time Warner Cable for trying to charge them $ 1 - $ 2 per gigabyte in the middle of a recession understood what was going on perfectly .
Should Time Warner Cable want to re-examine what went wrong the last few weeks , executives may want to take a look first at how they repeatedly insulted the intelligence of their customer base .
According to the statement , Time Warner Cable will still be doling out usage meters to all customers .
It 's pretty clear from the language used that their effort to dramatically reshape broadband billing is far from over , and when it resurfaces , it will be with a better public relations campaign and a lot of selective data .
However , what 's also pretty clear that the Internet gives consumers the collective power to shape company policy for the better .

Some of you need to step back and listen to what you 're saying .
If you are referring to Cable company 's 10 k 's then post a 10 k from a cable company showing outrageous , unreasonable profits .
Many of them are just struggling to survive .
If this is a company that is providing a service that you do n't really need or want , then by all means , run them into the ground .
I 've worked for companies in this business from DSL , to Cable , to Backhaul provision , and you know what ?
I 've never had my job outsourced to China .
I 've been a member of This forum since it was only DSLreports , and am pretty sure that I 'm not an idiot .
These are american companies trying to sell a service for a reasonable charge in a free market .
If you disagree with that , what are you saying ?
Are you the same people that are disagreeing with bailing out the Car companies that we all helped run into the ground by making our free market choices ?
I think we are all a confused public that have no idea what we are doing in the global economy .
But when you play out an industry that ran in the Red for a decade to install plant capable of providing digital services , I guess I 'm not sure where you are coming from .
I guess I should be looking for a new line of work because the public thinks that this should be non-profit .
You think there should be more competition , so do you have a plan for that ?
The previous company I worked for spent 5 million a month to construct a network before the money from Wall Street dried up .
Where do you propose that money to build " competion " come from ?
Your wishing and wanting does n't lash cable or bore understreets , Internet Providers do .
I 'll agree that TW should have provided the Bandwidth meters to the public for a few months , but I 'm sure the outcry would have been the same .
The problem with this board , or not necessarily the problem , but this board is made up of primarily power users , those that will be most affected .
Researchers from the U.K. and Portugal are developing a portable miniature magnetosphere to protect spaceships from high speed particles traveling through space , such as plasma from solar flares or cosmic rays .
The Earth ’s magnetosphere protects our planet from many of these particles , deflecting them harmlessly into space ; a miniature magnetic field surrounding a spaceship could serve exactly the same purpose .
Researchers from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , the Universities of York , Strathclyde in the U.K. , and the Institutio Superior Technico in Portugal have created a simulated solar wind inside their laboratory and successfully deflected it around a central spot using magnetic fields .
The result is a hole in the middle of the solar wind free of all harmful particles .
They managed this small - scale test – creating a one meter area devoid of particles – using a plasma jet and a simple $ 20 magnet .
The experiment was successful on the first attempt and the generated hole was observed to adjust itself based on the strength of the solar wind .
Stronger winds resulted in a smaller but more intense magnetic field , resembling their behavior in the real magnetosphere .
While wholly successful , these tests are just the first step to creating a successful magnetic shield for a spaceship .
It ’s unclear whether it ’s best to simply include a magnetic generator inside the spaceship or to use secondary ships accompanying primary ( manned ) spaceships to allow finer tuning of the field strength and direction .
It may also be possible to cycle the magnetic generators on and off in order to conserve power on a long journey where power may be at a premium .
The project head , Dr. Ruth Bamford of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , believes they are 15 to 20 years away from practical implementation of these magnetic shields .
In addition to protecting astronauts from long - term effects of exposure to these particles , a magnetic shield would also protect the spaceship itself .
There has already been one documented case of a solar flare damaging the electronic systems on a spaceship ( the Japanese Nozomi Mars mission in 2002 ) ; protection against such damage may be the difference between successful future missions and expensive failures .
TFOT has previously reported on innovative space technologies currently under development or in their testing stages .
Among others , you can find articles on the VASIMR plasma rocket , which is being developed by Ad Astra Rocket Company , the NanoSail - D solar sail developed by NASA , and the Lemur robots that were designed to aid astronauts in spaceship and space station maintenance tasks .
You can read more about the magnetic shield in the Science & Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) press release .
You can also read the abstract of the paper written by Dr. Bamford and her colleagues here .
The paper was published in the December 2008 issue of Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion .

Enlarge By Ken Williams , Concord Monitor Rep. Evalyn Merrick , a cancer survivor who once got relief from nausea by smoking pot , sponsored a bill that was just approved in New Hampshire 's state House .
Some states are moving to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes in response to the Obama administration 's decision to limit prosecutions of sick people or caregivers who use or dispense the drug .
Attorney General Eric
Holder said last week that his agents will seek criminal charges only when both state and U.S. laws are violated .
That signaled a shift from the Bush administration , whose agents raided several centers that dispense marijuana in California , where state law permits its medical use .
Twelve other states also allow medical marijuana , but U.S. law prohibits its use for any reason .
BETTER LIFE : Testicular cancer linked to marijuana use " The change in the federal government 's attitude ... speaks volumes , " says New Hampshire state Rep. Evalyn Merrick , a Democrat .
She is the author of a bill that would legalize medicinal use of marijuana if approved by a doctor .
It passed the state House on Wednesday , 234-138 .
Merrick , a cancer survivor who once got relief from nausea by smoking pot , pushed a similar bill three years ago , but it failed .
This year it is getting a warmer reception , and now heads to the Senate .
Holder 's announcement boosts state proposals for changing marijuana laws , says Bill Piper , national affairs director for the Drug Policy Alliance , which advocates legalizing marijuana .
" The politics around marijuana are changing , " he says .
Sen .
Chuck Grassley , an Iowa Republican who co-chairs the caucus on international drug control , says Holder is violating his oath of office if he fails to enforce federal marijuana laws .
" Marijuana is a gateway to higher drugs , " Grassley says .
Among states considering more relaxed laws : • New Jersey .
State Sen. Nicholas Scutari , a Democrat , in January introduced a bill that would permit medical use of marijuana .
It passed the Senate last month and its prospects are good in the House , Scutari says .
• Illinois .
A medical marijuana bill , introduced by state Rep. Lou Lang , a Democrat , is on the floor in both the House and Senate .
• Minnesota .
State Sen. Steve Murphy of the Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party reintroduced a medical marijuana bill this year after its failure last year .
It passed a House panel Wednesday , 9 - 6 .
In November , Michigan and Massachusetts voters adopted marijuana laws .
Massachusetts reduced penalties for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana to tickets and a $ 100 fine .
" The message it sends to young people is that it's not a big deal to use marijuana , " says David Capeless , president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association .
" That 's the wrong message . "

Gavin Newsom greenlights commission on Salton Sea lithium
Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday signed several new environmental laws , including one to study the potential for lithium and geothermal production .
While I was working on my final paper for the course on quivers that I ’m taking this semester , I came across the following result ( the notation means the finite field with elements , and is the field of complex numbers ) :
Theorem .
Let X be a variety defined over Z and assume for some prime p , and all r>0 , that the function is obtained by plugging in into some polynomial P( t ) .
Then P(t ) has integral coefficients , and P ( 1 ) is the Euler characteristic of .
If you ’re not comfortable with varieties , just think of the solution set of some collection of polynomials in multiple variables , and if you do n’t know what the rest of the words mean , that wo n’t matter much for the stuff starting with the next paragraph .
Here I ’m using the notation X ( F ) to denote the solutions for X over F , and I ’m thinking of as a complex analytic space .
The proof uses - adic cohomology ( with compact support ) and the Grothendieck –Lefschetz trace formula .
I wo n’t get into that , but I ’d like to use this as an excuse to talk about the q-analogues of the natural numbers .
Let ’s fix a field with q elements , and work over this field .
First let ’s use the theorem on projective space , whose points are the one - dimensional subspaces ( lines ) in an n-dimensional vector space V .
The number of lines of an n-dimensional vector space is because any nonzero vector defines a line , and each line is spanned by q - 1 different vectors .
Let ’s denote this number [ n ] because substituting q=1 gives n , which is the Euler characteristic of n - 1 dimensional complex projective space .
Now let ’s move onto complete flag varieties Flag ( V ) for V n-dimensional : the elements are just increasing chains where .
The number of flags is because to define a flag , we first pick nonzero to get , and in general , after we pick , we can pick any lift of a nonzero vector , and the space is independent of the choice of lift .
So let ’s call this number because specializing q=1 gives n! , which we now know is the Euler characteristic of the complex complete flag variety .
Let ’s take a look at the Grassmannian Gr( k , V ) , whose points are the k - dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space V .
To count its number of points , notice that we have a map Flag ( n ) to Gr( k , n ) which just sends a flag to the subspace .
This map is obviously surjective , but what are the fibers ?
It follows from the definitions that the preimage of a k - dimensional subspace W is Flag ( W ) x Flag ( V / W ) , so the number of points is just .
And we ’ll call this number because it specializes to upon setting q=1 , and as before , this is the Euler characteristic of the complex Grassmannian Gr( k , V ) where now V is a complex n-dimensional vector space .
Now we can even do partial flag varieties for tuples , whose points consists of partial flags where .
The number of points is going to be , and setting q=1 gives the analogous product of binomial coefficients for the Euler characteristic .
In all of the cases , it turned out that each of the polynomials in q had positive coefficients .
So we might ask what these numbers are counting , if anything .
It turns out that setting gives the generating function where X is whichever variety we are talking about , and H refers to plain old singular cohomology .
I can give a better answer though : in each of the cases of interest , there is an explicit cellular decomposition of variety in question , and the number of i-dimensional cells is exactly the coefficient of in the corresponding polynomial .
We could discuss this at length , but for now , I ’ll just refer the interested reader to William Fulton ’s book Young Tableaux .
And for those who do n’t know what a homogeneous space is : a homogeneous space is a manifold ( resp. algebraic variety ) with a transitive smooth ( resp. algebraic ) action of a Lie ( resp. algebraic ) group .
And one can verify that all of the examples I ’ve discussed are homogeneous spaces for the group of invertible matrices .
For fun , the reader can work out the counts for the symplectic and orthogonal groups and / or figure out what the right analogues of Grassmannians and flag varieties are .

It did to Australian cops who found this steering wheel lock while searching 18 - year - old Chad Hasting 's car after they pulled him over .
They called in backup and arrested him for possessing a gun .

Two more cops arrived in an unmarked car , and moments later , Chad Hastings was freed .
According to Hastings , the arresting officer muttered , " Get a new steering wheel lock , it looks like a bloody gun , " and told him he was a " a lucky boy , " since " any other cop would have had you at gunpoint . "
I have to say , if there was a gun that looked just like the Club , it would probably be a space death ray gun , so I think I 'd have probably done same thing .

Peter Saville did n’t keep the audience waiting long last night , writes Sara Martin , only fifteen minutes , but the crowd wanting to see him at the D&AD talk struggled to fit into the large auditorium ; a screen was set up outside for people who could n’t find a seat .
Adrian Shaughnessy had the tricky task of interviewing Saville .
Growing up in Manchester in the 1960s , Saville went to art school to do what he enjoyed most .
He was into punk and punk graphics , but yet also inspired by Jan Tschichold and other Modernist typographers , who influenced his first poster for The Factory , a music night in his local town .
When the Factory became Factory Records , he became the art director , designing their record covers .
His cover for Joy Division ’s Unknown Pleasures , was ‘ a cover I just wanted for myself ’ and when he asked if he could leave off the name of the band and the title they agreed .
Shaughnessy pressed him to talk about the sleeves .
Saville confessed that most of the time he did n’t know what he was doing in the early days .
He explained how he and his friend Malcolm Garrett ( see ‘ Malcolm , Peter . . . and Keith ’ , Eye no. 49 vol. 13 ) , carved a place for themselves on the London graphic design scene – coming from the North , they felt they had more to prove .
Moving on to his brief period at Pentagram ( see Reputations Eye no. 17 vol. 5 ) , he maintained that what he learned in this time has been useful to him every day since then : there is so much more than ‘ just designing ’ .
Controversially , for an audience full of designers working in the music industry he said : ‘ No one should be designing record covers after the age of 30 ’ , and ‘ Music covers are not graphic design , they do not communicate anything , they have no purpose in that respect . ’
Saville amused us with his directness – he was refreshingly opinionated .
Recent work includes ‘ branding ’ Manchester as an ‘ Original Modern city ’ , and the logo for Kate Moss ’s Topshop collection – an offer he could n’t turn down when it came from Moss personally .
Saville did n’t let us down – it was a fantastic start to the D&AD 2009 President ’s Lectures .
Extract from Dan Nadel ’s review of Designed by Peter Saville .
Eye is the world ’s most beautiful and collectable graphic design journal , published quarterly for professional designers , students and anyone interested in critical , informed writing about graphic design and visual culture .

" The 9/12 project is not for families directly affected by 9/11 , just people building their careers on it . " - Stephen Colbert .
Colbert Went Where the New York Times Feared to Tread on Glenn Beck
by Greg Mitchell
Was it another Jon Stewart vs. Jim Cramer takedown ?
Another case of a faux newsman going where the mainstream media dared not go ?
It was shocking last night to watch the usually pro-right - wing Colbert persona lay into Beck without an ounce of sympathy .
It came just one day after the New York Times ' front page profile of Beck that failed to fully air his dirty laundry and mainly treated him as just another popular entertainer .
Colbert , as you will read and see following this link , expressed ( albeit with his usual twinkle and silly Halloween coda ) all of the passion , and skill , shown by Stewart when he went after Cramer .
He was not just foolin ' around .
Something obviously got to him .
Perhaps it was a part left out of the Times ' piece , which covered Beck 's new " 9/12 " movement without mentioning that Beck had attacked 9/11 families and said he was sick of hearing about it and them .
The punch line : " The 9 - 12 project is not for families directly affected by 9/11 -- just people building their careers on it . " ...

Acupuncture can help people with chronic low back pain feel less bothered by their symptoms and function better in their daily activities , according to the largest randomized trial of its kind , published in the May 11 , 2009 Archives of Internal Medicine .
But the SPINE ( Stimulating Points to Investigate Needling Efficacy ) trial raises questions about how the ancient practice actually works .
Compared to the group that got usual care , results were similar for all three of the SPINE trial 's acupuncture groups : individualized , standardized , and simulated ( without going through skin ) .
Of the people who got any kind of acupuncture , an extra one in five were functioning significantly better at the end of the seven - week treatment — and an extra one in eight were still functioning better at one year .
" This study suggests that acupuncture is about as effective as other treatments for chronic back pain that have been found helpful , " said SPINE trial leader Daniel C. Cherkin , PhD , a senior investigator at Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle .
" But we found that simulated acupuncture , without penetrating the skin , produced as much benefit as needle acupuncture — and that raises questions about how acupuncture works . "
The SPINE trial included 638 adult patients at two nonprofit health plans : Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and Northern California Kaiser Permanente in Oakland .
They all rated the " bothersomeness " of their chronic low back pain as at least a 3 on a 0 - to - 10 scale .
None of them had received acupuncture before .
They were randomly assigned to one of four groups :
Individualized needle acupuncture , involving a customized prescription for acupuncture points from a diagnostician
Standardized needle acupuncture , using a single prescription for acupuncture points on the back and backs of the legs , which experts consider generally effective for chronic low back pain
Simulated acupuncture on those same standardized points , mimicking needle acupuncture but instead of a needle using a toothpick in a needle guide tube without penetrating the skin
Usual care , which is the standard medical care they would have gotten anyway — and that all patients in all groups received
Everyone in the three acupuncture groups ( individualized , standardized , or simulated ) was treated twice a week for three weeks , and then weekly for four weeks .
At eight weeks , half a year , and one year , researchers measured back - related dysfunction and how much symptoms bothered patients .
The SPINE team found that at eight weeks all three acupuncture groups were functioning substantially better , while the group getting only usual care was functioning only slightly better .
Dysfunction scores improved significantly more for all three acupuncture groups than for the usual care group .
These benefits lasted for a year , although they waned over time .
Notably , the outcomes for groups that received the needle and simulated forms of acupuncture did not differ significantly .
So , although acupuncture effectively treated low back pain , that therapeutic benefit seemed to require neither tailoring acupuncture needle sites to an individual patient nor inserting needles into the skin .
" We do n't know precisely why people got back pain relief from the simulated acupuncture , " said Cherkin 's co-author Karen J. Sherman , PhD , MPH , a senior investigator at Group Health Center for Health Studies .
" Historically , some types of acupuncture have used non-penetrating needles .
Such treatments may involve physiological effects that make a clinical difference . "
Or it might be all about the mind - body connection , she said : " Maybe the context in which people get treatment has effects that are more important than the mechanically induced effects . "
Western medicine does not have highly effective medical treatments for chronic back pain , Cherkin said .
Back pain is the number - one reason that Americans use complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) , including acupuncture .
The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) , part of the National Institutes of Health , funded the SPINE trial .
" The findings of this research show that acupuncture - like treatments , including simulated acupuncture , can elicit positive responses , " said Josephine P. Briggs , MD , director of NCCAM .
" This adds to the growing body of evidence that something meaningful is taking place during acupuncture treatments outside of actual needling .
Future research is needed to delve deeper into what is evoking these responses . "
Cherkin and Sherman's SPINE trial co-authors were Richard A. Deyo , MD , MPH , of Oregon Health &Science University in Portland ; Partap S. Khalsa , DC , PhD , of NCCAM 's Division of Extramural Research ; Andrew L. Avins , MD , MPH , Luisa Hamilton , MD , and Alice Pressman , MS , of Northern California Kaiser Permanente in Oakland ; William E. Barlow , PhD of Cancer Research and Biostatistics and Group Health Center for Health Studies ; and Laura Ichikawa , MS , Janet H. Erro , RN , MN , Kristin Delaney , MPH , and Rene Hawkes of Group Health Center for Health Studies .

The number of fake pound coins in circulation may be twice Royal Mint estimates , the BBC has learned .
Official figures suggest around 2.5 % - or one in 40 - are copies , but coin testing companies say it is one in 20 .
Andy Brown of Willings , a firm which makes machines to check coins for other businesses and organisations , says there could be 73 million fake coins .
The Royal Mint says it takes fraud extremely seriously and that it surveys the counterfeit rate every six months .
Wide of mark Mr Brown said car parking firms , vending machine operators , local councils and even banks have sent their coins to Willings to be checked .
He said : " We would estimate that as many as 5 % of coins we test are fakes .
" We 've been collating them for the past four months or so , and already have a collection of several hundred . "
The figures quoted by the Royal Mint were wide of the mark , he added .
Former Queen 's Assay Master Robert Matthews - a leading authority on fake coins - is also worried .
Provided the coins are just being accepted and passed through the system nobody cares ... it 's only when people start rejecting the coins that people come to us
Andy Brown
Coin testing firm Willings
He said : " The Mint is really trying to play down the problem and keep it as low - key as possible .
" They 've not produced any publicity material for banks etc to tell us how to differentiate between real and fake coins .
" They do n't want to undermine public confidence in the coins , you might get people refusing to take them . "
Although it says little in public , the Royal Mint is taking action - testing far more coins than before .
It redoubled its efforts last September after the BBC revealed around one in 50 pound coins was fake .
In the last quarter of 2008 the Mint removed 270,000 fake pound coins from circulation compared to 97,000 for the whole of the previous year .
' No regulation '
The problem is that finding the fakes is not in anyone 's interests .
As soon as a coin accepted in good faith is found to be counterfeit , it is immediately rendered worthless - and in addition attempting to pass it on is an offence .
Mr Brown said : " Provided the coins are just being accepted and passed through the system nobody cares .
It 's only when people start rejecting the coins that people come to us . "
A fake pound coin ( right ) alongside the real thing
Not surprisingly , it is local authorities and the post office , rather than private individuals or small businesses , who are working hardest to identify the fakes - even if that means taking a financial hit .
The aim for those dealing with coin- operated machines is to find mechanisms that will reject even the best forgeries .
Mr Brown said : " We 've been working for the last six months to create a new data file for our machines to detect fake coins .
" We can manage a 50 - 60 % detection rate while the machines being used by the Royal Mint can only pick up around 30 - 40 % . "
That means even when fake coins do pass through security checks at accredited cash centres , two thirds will come right back into circulation .
' Better detection ' Mr Brown believes the Royal Mint 's official figures on the number of fake coins will continue to rise .
" Their percentage will go up as they get better at detecting fakes , " he said .
The Royal Mint inspects a random sample of coins from across the country to establish the twice - yearly official rate .
A spokesman said the Mint was working with organisations such as the Post Office , banks , the vending industry and law enforcement agencies to try to limit the supply of fake £ 1 coins in circulation .
" We are concerned at the apparent upward trend , " added the spokesman .
Mr Matthews , meanwhile , says there is no regulation and thinks it is time the government took ownership of the problem .
He said : " There 's a whole raft of organisations who should have been tackling this who have n't been tackling it .
" It 's like a game of pass the parcel .
In the final analysis it 's the Treasury who should be dealing with this - and checking the work of the cash centres . "
And for the rest of us ?
Finding a fake coin can be done by hand - just check the rim inscription for authenticity , or check the Queen 's head on one side and the pattern on the reverse line up .
But given that fake coins are worthless , you will almost certainly be better off not even looking .

LABOR and the Coalition have defended a $ 4700 increase in the electorate allowance for federal politicians , despite calls by crossbench senators to defer or scrap the rise due to the recession .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's spokesman said the Government accepted the independent Remuneration Tribunal 's decision to lift the allowance to $ 32,000 a year .
But the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association , which is lobbying for a pay rise for pensioners in the May budget , said the electorate allowance rise of about $ 90 a week adds " insult to injury " .
" That 's the sort of increase pensioners need , " policy co-ordinator Charmaine Crowe said .
Greens leader Bob Brown said he would move to disallow the rise when Parliament returned next month .
" It 's hard to justify $ 90 a week for us when pensioners still do n't know if they 'll get $ 30 a week in the budget , " Senator Brown said .
What a start to the summer for Daniel Negreanu .

The 2006 World Series of Poker was memorable for a lot of reasons .
For one , it was the biggest Main Event ever held with over 8,000 players getting in on the action before the Unlawful Internet Enforcement Act , passed later that year , put the brakes on the poker party .
It was also the last year where online poker sites were allowed to satellite players directly into the Main Event so the Rio was a zoo as everyone tried to cash in on the poker craze .
In other words , it was a high point for poker that some maintain we ’ll never see again .
Despite all the exposure at the 2006 WSOP there are a number of stories from that year that people tend to forget .
Fortunately it was one of the first years that PokerListings covered the WSOP in full force so we still have a few tidbits to share .
The following is a look at 17 underreported stories from the 2006 WSOP :

Hang around Vegas a while and you 'll hear many tales of luxurious excess , though few can rival this Phil Ivey anecdote we heard moments ago .
Allegedly a group of businessmen were enjoying dinner at the Wynn when they looked over at one of the nearby tables to see none other than Phil Ivey .
Big fans of the poker superstar , they summoned the waiter and asked him to send Ivey a bottle of Cristal champagne , compliments of their table .

Building Better Web Services With Django ( Part 1 )
Building a RESTful webservice is pretty straight - forward with Django , but in many cases you want to have both a human readable website and a machine readable api .
A lot of websites solve this problem by using www.x.com as the human site , an api.x.com as the machine site .
They also will typically have different structures to support the different usecases . n
Unless your documentation is really excellent and the person writing the client to your service actually reads it building a client for the service is an error prone process .
In an ideal world the developer would be able to browse the website and use the same urls in their client program .
Fortunately HTTP has two headers which make it possible to do just that , Content - Type and Accept .
The Content - Type header describes the type of data that is included in the body of the HTTP request .
Typically this will be values such as text / html , application / json or application / x - www - form - urlencoded .
A content type is sent by the client when POSTing or PUTing data , and whenever the webserver includes some data in its response .
The Accept header is sent by a client to specify what content types it can accept in the response .
This header has a more complicated format that Content - Type because it can used to specify a number of different content types and to give a weighting to each .
When combined these two headers can be used to allow a normal user to browse the site and to allow a robot to make api calls on the same site , using the same urls .
This makes it easier both for the creator of the programmer accessing your site and for you because you can easily share code between the site and your api .
I ’m going to outline a decorator that will let write a webservice such as this , that will support HTML and JSON output , and JSON and form encoded data as inputs .n
First we ’ll create a decorator that parses any post data as JSON and passes it the view as the second parameter ( after the request object ) .
It will also JSON encode any return value that ’s not an HTTPResponse object .
import simplejson as json from django.http import HttpResponse def json_view ( func ) : def wrap ( req , * args , ** kwargs ) : try : j = json .
loads ( req .
raw_post_data ) except ValueError : j =
None resp = func ( req , j , * args , ** kwargs ) if isinstance ( resp , HttpResponse ) : return resp return HttpResponse ( json . dumps ( resp ) , mimetype = " application / json " ) return wrap
This decorator should be pretty easy follow , but here is an example to illustrate its use .
n
@ json_view def view ( req , json , arg1 , arg2 ) : obj = get_obj ( arg1 , arg2 ) if req .
method == " POST " and json is not None : # process json here return { " status " : " ok " } else : return { " status " : " failed " }
This really cuts down on the code you need to write , but this view only handles JSON as its input and output .
Next we need to parse the Accept headers and return an ordered list of content types so we can choose the preferred option .
No need to reinvent the wheel , so we just pull some code from djangosnippets.org .
All the parts are in place now , and in my next post we ’ll create a decorator which takes these parts ands puts them together .
It was obviously not meant to be photographed and displayed as happened at Abu Ghraib .
Some of the sexual excesses were clearly not authorized ( but at Gitmo , recall , we know that lesser sexual abuse was authorized ) .
It was meant to be conducted by more professional personnel than at Abu Ghraib .
It was not supposed to murder anyone - as happened at Abu Ghraib and many other torture sites in the Cheney war .
But the methods were exactly the same .
We know where they came from .
Call them what you will .
There they are .
Cheney knew them all , pushed for them all , and yet cannot own them when they are in front of his eyes .
In fact , he has to push them into a corner called " disgraces . "
That 's a strong word for a policy you created and enforced , against much of the military and intelligence and diplomatic agencies in government .
So why does Cheney tell such a big lie ?
Why does he do what he specifically says he would never do - blame a few underlings for policies he devised , pushed through against the law , and still champions as " honorable " ?
The only salient defense of the techniques of the CIA program as kosher and the Abu Ghraib photos as horrific is that these identical techniques are okay when used by some in the CIA but not okay when used by a low - ranking grunt on the night shift following orders .
This is the core contradiction .
You ca n't scapegoat Lynndie England while championing the methods she was told to use .
If Cheney wants to defend his program of torture and abuse then he owes it to us to own it as well .
You either support what we saw at Abu Ghraib as the policy of the United States or you do n't .
So which is it , Mr Cheney ?
A disgrace ?
Or an achievement ?
On that there is no middle ground , as someone might say .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Exxon Mobil , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil company , reported its lowest quarterly profits in nearly six years on Thursday as lower oil prices slashed earnings across the industry .
Despite the recent collapse in prices , Exxon earned $ 4.55 billion in the first quarter , down 58 percent from $ 10.89 billion in the period last year .
Profit fell to 92 cents a share in the quarter , from $ 2.02 in the year - earlier period .
Exxon , whose operations stretch from Nigeria to Siberia , managed to wring out bigger profits than any of its rivals because of its size and its obsessive attention to controlling costs .
These industry costs , which had doubled in the last few years , have been falling lately as companies cancel projects or delay investments .
Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as a global recession drastically slowed economic activity around the world .
Crude oil futures contracts traded in New York have averaged about $ 43 in the first quarter of this year , compared with nearly $ 100 a barrel in the first quarter of 2008 .
On Thursday , oil settled at $ 51.12 a barrel , up 15 cents .
A federal court last week rejected most of the objections raised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to publication of a 500 - page manuscript critical of the FBI counterterrorism program that was written by retired FBI Special Agent Robert G. Wright .
The manuscript had been submitted for pre-publication review in October 2001 .
“ This is a sad and discouraging tale , ” wrote Judge Gladys Kessler in a May 6 order ( pdf ) , referring to the FBI ’s handling of the manuscript .
“ In its efforts to suppress this information , the FBI repeatedly changed its position , presented formalistic objections to release of various portions of the documents in question , admitted finally that much of the material it sought to suppress was in fact in the public domain and had been all along , and now concedes that several of the reasons it originally offered for censorship no longer have any validity , ” Judge Kessler observed .
The 41 - page , partially redacted court ruling reviewed the facts of the pre-publication review dispute as well as the legal standards for official censorship of such materials , and dismissed all but one government objection to the manuscript .
The court also dismissed other government objections to release of written answers to interview questions submitted by then - New York Times reporter Judith Miller .
Italy is determined to stem the flow of illegal immigrants
The Italian navy has transferred more than 200 migrants picked up in waters off the island of Malta to Tripoli under a new agreement with Libya .
The migrants were rescued after they issued a distress call on Wednesday .
Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the Libyan government 's move could mark a " turning point " in the fight against illegal immigration .
He said it could also help resolve an ongoing dispute between Italy and Malta over responsibility for the migrants .
Last month , there was a diplomatic standoff between the two after the authorities in Valletta refused to accept 140 migrants heading for Italy , who were picked up by a Turkish ship inside Malta 's search and rescue area .
Malta had insisted that the vessel take the migrants to the island of Lampedusa , where Italy has a detention centre for asylum seekers and illegal migrants , because it was the nearest port of call .
Rome eventually took in the migrants on humanitarian grounds .
Nearly 37,000 migrants landed on the shores of Italy last year , an increase of around 75 % over the year before .
' Historic day '
The 227 illegal migrants were rescued by an Italian tanker on Wednesday after being spotted on three separate boats .
Italian customs official Francesco Maugeri said they were sent back to Tripoli on Thursday aboard two coast guard boats and a border police boat .

More from BBC World Service " Some of the migrants were suffering symptoms probably caused by exhaustion and cold " but none had serious health problems , he told the Associated Press .
Speaking on Italian television afterwards , Mr Maroni said he had contacted the Libyan government and arranged the immediate return of the migrants .
He said an accord already existed with Libya covering the return of illegal immigrants but that it had never been successfully put into effect .
The interior minster , a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party , praised Libya 's acceptance as a possible " turning point " , calling it " a historic day " .
He said the deal , if implemented in the future , would be a " breakthrough " that could put an end to rows between Italy and Malta over rescue operations .
Mr Maroni said long - promised joint coastal patrols off Libya by Italian and Libyan boats would start on 15 May .
Laurens Jolles , the representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in Rome , said he was concerned by Thursday 's development .
" I very much recognise the problems that countries such as Italy and Malta are facing , " he told the BBC .
" However , I do think it 's a worrying trend , because the fact is that there is a member state of the European Union which is engaging in an official , declared policy of push - backs . "

HIME ISLAND , Japan —
If Marxism had ever produced a functional , prosperous society , it might have looked something like this tiny southern Japanese island .
At first glance , there is little to set Hime ( pronounced HEE - may ) apart from the hundreds of other small inhabited islands that dot the coasts of Japan ’s main isles .
The 2,519 mostly graying islanders subsist on fishing and shrimp farming , and every summer hold a Shinto religious festival featuring dancers dressed as foxes .
But once off the ferry , the island ’s sole public transportation link to the outside , visitors are greeted by an unusual sight : a tall , bronze statue of Hime ’s previous mayor , rare in a country that typically shuns such political aggrandizement .
Rarer still is that the statue was erected by his son , who is the island ’s current mayor .
In fact , the father , who died in 1984 , and the son , who succeeded him , have won every mayoral election in Himeshima , the island ’s village , for 49 years — without once being challenged by a rival candidate .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbdjetlY8A brain - scanning study of people making financial choices suggests that when given expert advice , the decision - making parts of our brains often shut down .
The problem with this , of course , is that the advice may not be good .
" When the expert 's advice made the least sense , that 's where we could see the behavioral effect , " said study co-author Greg Berns , an Emory University neuroscientist .
" It 's as if people were n't using their own internal value mechanisms . "
Berns ' specialty is neuroeconomics , a once - obscure field of research that 's received heightened attention since the global economic slowdown left people at a loss to explain how the market 's invisible hand picked their pockets .
Of course , describing a few behavioral tendencies is no substitute for a detailed analysis of market deregulation , poorly conceived derivative contracts and all the other factors that fueled the slowdown .
But studies like Berns ' , published Tuesday in Public Library of Science ONE , and another on hormones and day trading ( testosterone is good for individual traders , but possibly bad for everyone else ) , have cast scientific doubt on a central tenet of free - market fundamentalism .
Contrary to neoliberal economic theory , markets are not always driven by individuals acting rationally in their own best interests .
" Many economists live in a peculiar world inhabited by other economists .
It 's called the world of rational decisionmaking , " said Berns .
" In this world , you take advice , integrate it with your own information , and come to a decision .
If that were true , we'd have seen activity in regions that track decisions .
But what we found is that when someone receives advice , those relationships went away . "
In the study , Berns ' team hooked 24 college students to brain scanners as they contemplated swapping a guaranteed payment for a chance at a higher lottery payout .
Sometimes the students made the decision on their own .
At other times they received written advice from Charles
Noussair , an Emory University economist who advises the U.S. Federal
Reserve .
Though the recommendations were delivered under his imprimatur , Noussair himself would n't necessarily follow it .
The advice was extremely conservative , often urging students to accept tiny guaranteed payouts rather than playing a lottery with great odds and a high payout .
But students tended to follow his advice regardless of the situation , especially when it was bad .
When thinking for themselves , students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities .
When given advice from Noussair , activity in those regions flat lined .
The findings , based on a small number of college students in a controlled setting , are necessarily preliminary , but their implications are common - sense .
Berns recommended that investors do their own research , be careful , and remember that fancy credentials and financial pedigrees are no guarantee of economic wisdom .
In the future , however , Berns said it might be possible to construct a brain - scanning device that lets people know when their decision - making faculties go to sleep .
The question then , he said , is whether people would still make sensible decisions .
" That 's a great study , " said Berns .
" Maybe I 'll apply for some stimulus money to do it . "

Any single man must judge for himself whether circumstances warrant obedience or resistance to the commands of the civil magistrate ; we are all qualified , entitled , and morally obliged to evaluate the conduct of our rulers .
This political judgment , moreover , is not simply or primarily a right , but like self - preservation , a duty to God .
As such it is a judgment that men cannot part with according to the God of Nature .
It is the first and foremost of our inalienable rights without which we can preserve no other .

Adobe Photoshop has always been one of the greatest ( if not the best ) software when it comes to manipulating and editing image .
It all started off in 1987 with a Mac application call Display , created by Thomas Knoll .
With almost two decades worth of changes and improvements , you almost ca n’t imagine how the first version of Photoshop would look like by looking at the Photoshop you have on your desktop .
In this post , we attempt to bring you back in time to look at how the very first Photoshop look like , then we scan through each evolution of Photoshop to the latest Adobe Photoshop CS4 in market today .

“ When the same mistakes are repeated over and over again , it ’s time to consider the possibility that they are not mistakes at all . ”
-- Naomi Klein , The Shock Doctrine
Little has changed since Barack Obama assumed the presidency .
The imperial agenda of the United States proceeds unabated with record military spending , expanded wars and prolonged occupations .
Enabled by the president ’s choice of lifelong deregulators Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner to mastermind the economic “ recovery ” , the financial sector continues to fleece the taxpayers .
As Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin succinctly put it , “ Frankly , the banks run this place . ”
Then there is the Bush administration ’s legacy of torture , a problem that wo n’t go away quietly despite Obama ’s determination to “ look ahead . ”
Unfortunately for him , the president does n’t have the right to choose which laws he will enforce , which international treaties he will honor .
( Remember how we balked at George W. Bush ’s imperious signing statements ? )
According to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley , Obama is placing himself in legal jeopardy by refusing to meet the solemn obligations of the United States of America with respect to the crime of torture .
This would be on top of the extreme political jeopardy Obama may encounter now that he has reversed virtually every position with regard the war on terror ( other than his pledge to intensify the Afghan war ) he advanced during his campaign .
Most recently , the president has broken his promise of transparency by refusing to honor a court - ordered release of photographs that could put the lie to the assertion that the torturers were “ a few bad apples . ”
Somewhere along the line , Barack Obama became enamored of Wall Street .
He bought the pre-meltdown line that the raft of exotic financial instruments spawned by the Street were evidence of the energy and creativity of the US economy , rather than signs of its corruption .
When the crash came , Obama smartly saluted the Bush / Paulson plan to advance an initial $ 700 billion bailout of the scofflaws .
The president has n’t wavered since in his belief that Humpty Dumpty can and must be put back together again .
Under Bush and Obama , 13 trillion dollars have been spent , lent or guaranteed to save the country ’s largest ( albeit insolvent ) banks .
But when it came to mustering 51 Senate Democrats to help homeowners avoid foreclosure by the very banks that have been devouring his government ’s bailout feast , Obama was mute .
Senator Durbin again captured the moment : “ The banks that are too big to fail are saying that 8 million Americans facing foreclosure are too little to count . ”
At his 100 Days press conference , the president called the ethical meltdown that led Americans to torture a “ mistake ” .
Hauled before Congress to explain the financial meltdown that gathered steam on his watch , Alan Greenspan explained his “ mistake ” of “ presuming that the self - interests of …banks … were such that they were best capable of protecting their shareholders . ”
In a similar vein , we ’ve heard repeatedly that the Iraq war — with no WMD ’s found and no post - shock and awe plan — was another “ mistake . ”

How come these brilliant , highly educated and compensated people keep making supersized “ mistakes ? ”
Perhaps because they are n’t mistakes at all .
What the United States needs more than anything is some full - bore truth - telling before we slip into a fascistic , Orwellian dystopia .
We could start by admitting that we preyed upon Iraq not because that country was perceived as a threat but because , after 10 years of sanctions , Iraq was no threat at all .
In fact , it was ripe for the picking .
Once consumer protection was removed , the banks could freely practice their own brand of predation .
Millions of Americans , hoodwinked into signing up for “ no - doc ” loans with teaser rates , were also ripe for the picking .
Was the financial meltdown a mistake ?
According to University of Texas Professor James K. Galbraith , “ You had fraud in the origination of the mortgages , fraud in the underwriting , fraud in the ratings agencies . ”
Committing fraud is not the same as making a mistake .
Fraud , according to our dictionary ( American Heritage , 2nd ed. ) , is “ deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain . ”
Fraud is not a mistake .
In 2004 , the FBI warned that “ rampant fraud in the mortgage industry … could become an ‘ epidemic . ’ ”
The Bureau was ignored .
( Interestingly , the Bureau was also ignored when it tried to sound the alarm that young Saudis with dubious visas had enrolled in US flight training schools . )
Top economists including Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman were also ignored because in fact , there was no mistake being made .
As in their preemptory attack on oil - rich and strategically - located Iraq , the ruling elites were simply pursuing their private , or corporate , interests , indistinguishable in their minds from the public interest .
The American people are now suffering from all these “ mistakes ” and there are plenty of signs that things will not improve soon .
Last month , we learned that just over half a million people lost their jobs .
That was considered good news .
Experts predict at least eight million foreclosures in 2009 .
That translates into about 30 million people without homes .
Already tent cities have sprung up in cities and towns around the country .
Democrats in Congress are now proposing construction of FEMA “ emergency centers ” on military installations across the country .
Is this going to be the only “ housing ” that millions of foreclosed Americans will be able to afford ?
Make no mistake , we the people are being taken for a very expensive ride , an unpleasant ride that our children and grandchildren will be forced to take as well .
The elites that own the wealth , fund the politicians and control the message are on the verge of stealing our birthright of “ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” in a democratic society .
[ In this feature , originally printed in Gamasutra sister publication Game Developer earlier this year , EIC Brandon Sheffield and the editorial staff compile the most - repeated ' what went wrong ' issues from the development of games -- spanning Rock Band to Final Fantasy XII and beyond . ]
Postmortems -- articles written directly by the development team on the creation of a particular video game -- have been a staple of Game Developer Magazine for well over a decade .
With so many authors revealing what went right , and of course the car - wreck style appeal of what went wrong with the development process , patterns start to emerge .
It becomes clear that a lot of the same mistakes are being made over and over again , and that some companies are even repeating their own mistakes .
With that in mind , we decided to round up every " what went wrong " entry from the last three years , and compiled the most frequently made mistakes ( usually over five times each ) into this cautionary feature .
As the saying goes , those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it .
So here you have the top 10 " wrongs , " in no particular order , over the lifecycle of the current generation so far .
No one is safe !
1. Content added too late .
Getting story and features right is difficult at the best of times , but when that content comes in just under the wire , not only does that content suffer , every element of the game that relies on that content suffers .
Titan Quest ( Iron Lore , Jeff Goodsill )
" We struggled getting 25 detailed design documents to the technical department on time .
We were still working on first cut design documentation more than one year after the start of the project , so the technical team had to fly blind in the beginning and some systems had to be redone .
" There was a fairly constant issue of design documents not being detailed enough for technical implementation . "
After this trouble , the company devised an approval process , which would have the producer , lead designer , technical director , and the publisher 's creative manager sign off on each document before finalizing it .
While this helped , it did slow down the company 's process a bit , and it's worth noting that for all Iron Lore 's good points , the studio is now closed .
It stands to reason that a " what went wrong " from a shuttered studio would warrant extra scrutiny .
And to quote Riley Cooper , who had a similar problem with Tomb Raider : Legend , " This clearly serves to remind us that if you do n't want any features in your game to under - perform , you need to do them 100 percent or not at all . "
BioShock ( 2K Boston , Alyssa Finley )
" We had many drafts of the story over the course of development , but the final draft turned out to be an almost complete rewrite .
" Competing demands for time and resources meant that , unfortunately , some of the important narrative details of the game were n't created until the final rewrite , and therefore required quite a bit of work to retrofit into an existing game . "
In an RPG - like game , story is the guiding star of the project .
While ideally the systems would be fully integrated into the story to the degree that each can affect the other , at the very least the scenario needs to be nailed down before full - on production .
In a game like BioShock , which features loads of spoken dialog , implementation and pipeline problems can crop up at the last moment , if you do n't deal with them early on .
This is exactly what happened to the 2K Boston team .
2. Communication .
When deadlines get fierce , and everyone 's chugging away , communication is most likely the second thing to go .
The first , of course , is quality of life , leading to crunch , but you can bet that we 'll get to that .
Age of Booty ( Certain Affinity , Max Hoberman )
" Over the course of the project there were numerous disconnects between the perceived state of the game and the actual state of the game .
" The hardest hit were the designers , who continued fine - tuning plans for sophisticated features like matchmaking and party support long after the programmers had already made huge simplifications ( and often cuts ) to these systems .
A combination of lack of attention to the project , poor communication , and wishful thinking led to the design team believing that several features were far more advanced than we were actually able to implement , and they did not find out the reality until very late in the project . "
This depressing quote is made moreso by the fact that this was an Xbox Live Arcade title , and thus had a relatively small team .
The company was working on multiple projects at once , which widened the communication gap .
But that 's another element we 'll get to in due time .
Square Enix's Final Fantasy XII
Final Fantasy XII ( Square Enix , Taku Murata )
" During the development of Final Fantasy XII , the pressure to succeed was at such a high point that we were on the brink of losing control during even the slightest misunderstanding .
What happened was our team was given the freedom to make changes at various stages of development , but the adverse affect of this freedom was miscommunication , confusion , and disorder .
How work was to be distributed was also often ambiguous , which contributed to the problem . "
Management overhead is a particularly large problem in Japan , but that 's not to say it can't happen at home , too .
Often there are too many managers , but not enough actual management going on .

The world 's store of digital content is now the equivalent of one full top - of - the - range iPod for every two people on the planet , following the explosion of social networking sites , internet - enabled mobile phones and government surveillance .
At 487bn gigabytes ( GB ) , if the world 's rapidly expanding digital content were printed and bound into books it would form a stack that would stretch from Earth to Pluto 10 times .
As more people join the digital tribe – increasingly through internet - enabled mobile phones – the world 's digital output is increasing at such a rate that those stacks of books are rising quicker than Nasa 's fastest space rocket .
The large files from digital cameras and the world 's burgeoning army of surveillance cameras account for a significant proportion of the digital universe .
The rapid increase in so - called machine to machine communications – such as when an Oyster card is touched on a reader or a satellite navigation system requests information about its location – has seen the number of individual digital creation events balloon , despite the economic recession .
The digital universe is expected to double in size over the next 18 months , according to the latest research from technology consultancy IDC and sponsored by IT firm EMC , fuelled by a rise in the number of mobile phones .
At the time of their first Digital Universe report in 2007 , the pair reckoned the world 's total digital content was 161bn gigabytes .
About 70 % of the information in the digital universe is created by individuals and includes phone calls , emails , photos , online banking transactions or postings on social networking sites , including Twitter .
" Devices such as camera phones , and the web 2.0 services like social networking sites have created a nation of digital hoarders , " according to Mike Altendorf , managing director of EMC Consulting .
But the responsibility for protecting – and hosting – the vast majority of this content lies with corporations and organisations .
More than 30 % of the information created today , from patient care records to personal financial information , already requires high standards of protection and IDC / EMC reckon that will grow to roughly 45 % by 2012 .
Companies are seeing digital storage needs increase as a result of tightening regulation following the financial meltdown last year .
The amount of information that must be retained to comply with rules and regulations is expected to grow from 25 % of the digital universe last year to 35 % in 2012 .
IDC / EMC estimate that the cost of the computers , networks and storage facilities that drive the digital universe is about $ 6tn .
Add in medical equipment , entertainment and content creation and the figure is more than double that .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Carefully selected men with “ low - risk ” prostate cancer can safely delay treatment and opt instead for active surveillance , researchers report in the April issue of The Journal of Urology .
With active surveillance , or “ watchful waiting , ” patients with early prostate tumors are monitored regularly and only treated if their cancer progresses .
“ Active surveillance with delayed treatment , if necessary , for select patients appears to be safe ” and associated with a low risk of the cancer spreading , the researchers conclude .
Despite the potential survival advantages associated with prostate cancer treatment , senior investigator Dr. Bertrand Guillonneau told Reuters Health , “ there is still a large number of patients who are over - treated and who will suffer from prolonged side effects that impair their quality of life . ”
“ Active surveillance , based on strict criteria , ” added Guillonneau , “ might be a way to sort out patients with growing tumor that requires treatment from quiescent tumor that will not progress . ”
To study the safety of active monitoring instead of immediate treatment of men with low - risk prostate cancer , Guillonneau , of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , New York , and colleagues studied 268 men younger than age 75 years .
All of the men had been given multiple treatment options but ultimately chose active surveillance over immediate treatment .
The men had early “ low - risk ” disease , based on their prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level and initial biopsy findings .
The men had a second “ restaging ” biopsy immediately before active surveillance began and no treatment in the following 6 months .
They subsequently underwent physical exams and PSA tests every six months with biopsies recommended every 1 to 2 years .
Of that initial pool of men electing active surveillance of their cancer , 43 eventually chose treatment or had evidence of cancer progression prompting recommendation of treatment by their physician .
Following delayed treatment ( radiation or surgery , ) all but one were cured of their cancer .
The remaining 219 patients remained on active surveillance without evidence that their disease had spread .
At 2 years the probability of staying on active surveillance was 91 percent .
At 5 years , it was 75 percent .
“ Our study indicates that 75 percent of the patients who are real candidates for active surveillance will still fulfill the same criteria 5 years later , demonstrating the absence of noticeable ( disease ) progression , ” Guillonneau said .
“ These patients should still be closely monitored , ” he concluded , “ but it seems likely , for many of them , the prostate cancer will not ultimately develop and will not require any kind of active and therefore morbid treatment . ”

There ’s often a lot of game - playing in getting appointees approved by the senate .
But this requires more attention .
The senate Republicans are refusing to give a vote to two of President Obama ’s key ( hopefully soon to be ) economic advisors — Austan Goolsbee and Cecilia Rouse .
So for the moment they ’re barred from advising the president at all .
The Republicans seem pretty candid about the fact that this is pay back for stuff that happened back in the Bush era .
But are n’t we in the throes of a catastrophic economic crisis ?

April 2 , 2009 --
A new revolution is sweeping the island of Cuba , which is making massive progress on energy efficiency and renewable generation .
Indeed , such is the success of the two - year old program on this small island of 11 million people , that many other countries could learn from its efforts to be energy independent and curb climate change .
Just a few years ago Cuba 's energy situation was bleak .
The country had 11 large , and quite inefficient , thermoelectric plants generating electricity for the entire island .
Most of the plants were 25 years old and only functioning 60 % of the time .
There were frequent blackouts , especially during peak demand periods .
There was also a high percentage of transmission losses along the electrical distribution grid .
To add to the energy crisis , most Cuban households had inefficient appliances , 75 % of the population was cooking with kerosene , and the residential electricity charges did not encourage conservation .
In 2004 the eastern side of Cuba was hit by two hurricanes in a short period of time , affecting transmission lines and leaving 1 million people without electricity for 10 days .
All of this in the face of the overarching drivers of peak oil and climate change , made Cubans realise they had to make energy more of a priority .
Thus , in 2006 , began what Cubans call la revolución energética -– the energy revolution .
Cuba ’s recent energy revolution has helped it become a true model of sustainable development .
The 2006 Living Planet report assesses sustainable development by using the United Nation ’s Development Program ’s ( UNDP ) Human Development Index ( HDI ) and the ecological footprint .
The HDI is calculated from life expectancy , literacy and education , and per capita GDP .
The UNDP considers an HDI value of more than 0.8 to be high human development .
An ecological footprint , which is a measure of demand on the biosphere , lower than 1.8 global hectares per head denotes sustainability .
The only country in the world that meets both of the above criteria is Cuba .
``Cuba has reached a good level of development according to United Nations ’ criteria , thanks to its high literacy level and very high life expectancy '' , explains Jonathan Loh , one of the authors of the report , adding : `` While the ecological footprint is not large since it is a country with low energy consumption . ''
The statistics are impressive , the country is currently consuming 34 % of the kerosene , 40 % of the liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) and 80 % of the petroluem ( gasoline ) it used to consume before the implementation of the energy revolution a mere two years earlier .
Cuba 's per capita energy consumption is now at a level one - eighth of that in the US , while access to health services , education levels , and life expectancy are still some of the top ranking in the world , as Table 1 below shows .
Small budget , big results
How does a country with a per capita GDP one - tenth that of the US , have the resources to carry out such a radical change in energy consumption , without sacrificing their high social indicators in health and education ?
To understand Cuba 's energy revolution one must understand some of the history of energy production and consumption in Cuba .
Prior to the 1959 Cuban Revolution , 56 % of the country was electrified .
With the socialist revolution came a push to electrify even the remotest communities .
By 1989 , 95 % of the country was electrified –- mostly with cheap oil traded for sugar with the Soviet Union .
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused the bottom to fall out of the Cuban economy .
Having to buy oil on the world market meant that cheap electricity was a thing of the past .
Food , petrol and oil all became scarce as the US made matters worse by tightening its economic blockade .
Both the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act and Helms - Burton law passed in 1996 , target foreign investment in Cuba , seeking to undermine Cuba 's international access to capital , and making much needed resources hard to come by .
The years following the Soviet collapse and the intensifying of the blockade were known as the ``Special Period '' because Cubans had to tighten their belts and learn how to produce basic requirements such as food , medicines and energy , both locally and sustainably .
In 1993 , a National Energy Sources Development Program ( Programa de desarrollo de las Fuentes Nacionales de Energia ) was implemented to reduce Cuba 's energy imports and obtain maximum benefits from domestic energy sources .
The document proposed that the first national source of energy should be efficiency .
After the National Energy Sources Development Program was adopted , Cuba embarked on a drive to save energy and use more renewable sources of energy .
All rural schools , health clinics and social centres in the country , not previously connected to the grid , were electrified with solar energy , and today 2364 of the solar electric systems on the island are on rural schools .
Making lights , computers and educational television programs accessible to every schoolchild in the country ; this program won Cuba the Global 500 award from the United Nations in 2001 .
However , despite all their efforts , 10 years after the program was implemented , Cuba still had an energy crisis on its hands .
So in 2006 the energy revolution took some of the most drastic steps any country has taken to date .
A five - point plan
Cuba 's energy revolution has five main aspects : energy efficiency and conservation ; increasing the availability and reliability of the national electric grid ; incorporating more renewable energy technologies into their energy portfolio ; increasing the exploration and production of local oil and gas ; and international co-operation .
Understanding that the first step in an energy revolution is not to look for more ways of generating energy , but to decrease energy demand , Cuba began a program to change over to energy efficient appliances .
As then - President Fidel Castro explained in a May 2006 address to the Cuban Electric Utility company ( UNE ) : ``We are not waiting for fuel to fall from the sky , because we have discovered , fortunately , something much more important –- energy conservation , which is like finding a great oil deposit . ''
The program to allow people to switch their incandescent bulbs to more efficient compact fluorescents , free of charge , was met with complete success .
In six months more than 9 million incandescent light bulbs .
As there were already many compact fluorescents installed , this meant that close to 100 % of the bulbs used in the whole country had been changed to compact fluorescents –- making Cuba the first country in the world to completely eliminate inefficient tungsten filament lighting .
Furthermore , millions of energy efficient appliances were sold to Cuban consumers , including almost 2 million refrigerators , over 1 million fans , 182,000 air conditioners and 260,000 water pumps .
At the same time , efficient electrical cooking appliances were introduced .
Almost 3.5 million rice cookers and more than 3 million pressure cookers were sold to families in the push to have people switch from kerosene to cooking with electricity .
And one of the best ways Cuba managed to encourage conservation was its new residential electrical tariff structure .
Prior to 2006 , Cuba 's highly subsidised electricity was sold very cheaply , which did not encourage conservation .
The new tariff structure allows people consuming less than 100 kWh per month to stay at the current extremely low rate of only 0.09 pesos / kWh ( 0.38 US cents / kWh ) .
But for every increase of 50 kWh per month the rate skyrockets .
And consumers using over 300 kWh per month must pay 1.30 pesos / kWh ( 5.4 US cents / kWh ) .
In terms of US dollars , this is still significantly less than consumers pay in the United States , but it is over four times what large energy users were paying previously .
Cuba also embarked on energy savings measures in the state sector .
All water pumps in tall buildings and aqueducts were changed to efficient pumps .
The 40 W fluorescent tubes used in many government offices will be changed to 32 W bulbs with electronic ballasts , and inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners have been replaced with more efficient models .
Power to the people
A revolution cannot truly be called revolutionary without the support of the masses .
Cuba 's energy revolution is no exception .
In order to involve the general populace in the effort to save energy , an ambitious energy education initiative was put into place .
The Programa de Ahorro de Energia por la Ministro de Educacion ( PAEME ) is a national energy program implemented by the ministry of education in 1997 .
Its objective is to teach students , workers , families and communities about energy - saving measures and renewable sources of energy .
In schools , the energy theme is present in many different disciplines .
Students learn about energy issues not just in physics but in economic classes , environmental courses and health curricula as well .
( See also http://www.solarenergy.org/resources/docs/SolarToday_Education.pdf.)
PAEME has also held energy festivals for the past three years , educating thousands of Cubans about efficiency and conservation .
The festivals are targeted towards students and are filled with young children expressing their thoughts on energy savings through songs , poetry and theatre .
It starts in each Cuban school where the children with the best energy efficiency projects go on to the festival at the municipality level .
Then the best move on to the provincial level , and from there on to the national level .
``UNE decided that the festival is not a typical competition , but something like an energy efficiency carnival , with the most outstanding students of the country '' , explains Teresa Palenzuela , a specialist with UNE .
In the national festival , where the public lines up for blocks to enter , the students exchange experiences and share knowledge without declaring any winners .
In order to get the word out to even more of the population , the mass media was employed .
For instance , you never see advertising for commercial products on Cuban highways , instead scattered across the country are dozens of billboards promoting energy conservation .
There is also a weekly television show dedicated to energy issues , and articles appear weekly in national newspapers espousing renewable energy , efficiency and conservation .
In 2007 alone there were more than 8000 articles and TV spots dedicated to energy efficiency issues .
Fair distribution
Despite these efforts , saving energy was not enough , and in 2005 blackouts were still common .
Furthermore , Cuba had a very old and inefficient electrical distribution grid to deal with .
The Cuban government realised that one of the best ways to provide for energy security was to move towards decentralised energy , and thus it began the move towards distributed generation .
Employing this concept means less vulnerability to natural disasters or foreign invasions which might affect electricity to a whole section of the country .
The strategy also diversifies energy sources , while making it easier to ultimately change to alternative sources of energy in the future , such as those produced more locally and sustainably .
In 2006 , Cuba installed 1854 diesel and fuel oil micro-electrical plants across the country , representing more than 3000 MW of decentralised power in 110 municipalities .
This virtually eliminated the blackouts that plagued Cuba in 2004 .
In fact , in the years 2004 and 2005 there were more than 400 days of blackouts greater than 100 MW that lasted at least an hour .
In 2006 and 2007 , there were three , all of which were in 2006 .
This is a better rate than in most industrialised countries .
In addition to the new plants , they also installed more than 4000 emergency back - up systems in critical areas like hospitals , food production centres , schools and other sites key to Cuba 's economy .
This represents 500 MW of emergency back - up power .
Furthermore , Cuba embarked on an impressive plan to fix its existing electrical transmission network .
It upgraded more than 120,000 electrical posts , over 1 million utility service entrances , almost 3000 kilometres of cable and half a million electrical meters .
The overall effect of this program meant that in 2005 , while the country needed an average of 280 grams of oil to generate one kWh of electricity , in 2007 this figure had fallen to 271 grams of oil per kWh .
While this might seem like a small saving , it translates to thousands of tonnes of imported oil annually .
In 2006 –2007 Cuba saved over 961,000 tonnes of imported oil through its energy saving measures .
Incorporating more renewables
Although incorporating renewable sources of energy into the energy mix has been a priority since the early 1990s , the past two years have seen even more growth .
Currently 100 wind measuring stations are being installed in 11 different provinces of the country and two new wind farms have been built , bringing the total wind energy installed in the country to 7.23 MW .
Also in development is the country ’s first grid - connected 100 kW solar electric plant .
Furthermore , 180 micro - hydro systems , harnessing energy from water in streams and rivers , are installed around Cuba , 31 of which are grid connected .
And the number of independent solar electric systems in rural areas of the country has risen to more than 8000 , with a plan in place to use solar panels and other renewable technologies to electrify the remaining 100,000 houses that do n't yet have access to electricity .
This year will also see the addition of 300 biogas plants , which are using animal waste to create cooking fuel .
Sugar , Cuba 's main export crop , also produces electricity .
In sugarcane factories around the country the bagasse , which is the residue left over after the cane is processed , is burned and turned into useable energy to power the plant and to feed the electrical grid .
Sugarcane biomass facilities currently have an installed capacity of 478.5 MW .
Cuba is also making progress on liquid biofuels such as ethanol .
Usually involving the use of food crops like corn , the official stance on biofuels is that ``Cuba does not support the idea of converting food into fuels , while more than 800 million people suffer hunger ' ' .
Nevertheless , there are some liquid biofuel pilot projects .
The best example is the cultivation of Jatropha Carcus , which produces a non-edible oil , and which thus does not compete with human food production .
In 2007 a national group aimed at supporting and promoting the accelerated development and penetration of renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency was created .
The 14 commissions of this group , covering all types of renewable sources of energy and efficiency , have a government mandate to study better ways to introduce renewable energies into the country .
` Doctors of the Soul ' help the energy revolution
The island has exported its energy revolution to other countries as well , in the framework of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) , an alternative to the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) .
ALBA emphasises the fight against poverty and social exclusion .
For instance , after Cuba worked with Venezuela on an energy - conservation campaign , Venezuela reported savings of 2000 MW of power .
Cuban scientists and technicians have also provided and installed over 1 MW of solar electric panels in Venezuela , Bolivia , Honduras , South Africa , Mali and Lesotho .
To carry out their ambitious energy conservation plan , Cuba relied on its small army of trabajadores sociales or social workers .
Formed in 2000 , Cuba 's social workers are made up of youths who have the task of bringing social justice to the island in many different spheres , including labour , education , culture , sports and the environment .
Along with working with people with disabilities , the elderly and people convicted of crimes , the latest job of the social workers is to help carry out the energy revolution .
Since 2006 , 13,000 social workers have visited homes , businesses and factories around the island replacing light bulbs , teaching people how to use their new electric cooking appliances and spreading information on saving energy .
The social workers also worked with the ministry of agriculture to help save energy in the sugarcane harvest , and work in the transportation sector to achieve more efficiency in the national bus system .
The social workers attend a school where they receive classes in politics , social communication , energy and sustainable development , with the objective of creating values and convictions which should characterise a social worker .
They are also taught to replace light bulbs and to explain the need for saving energy .
Furthermore , under ALBA , the social workers also travel to other countries to help implement energy saving programs –- such as in Haiti where they visited over 93,000 houses and installed more than 2 million energy efficient light bulbs .
Similar to Cuba ’s medical program , which has more than 20,000 doctors working abroad to help with health crises , the social workers are travelling around the world to help in the energy crisis .
Fidel Castro , who founded the program , refers to the social workers as ``Doctors of the Soul' ' .
`` We need a global energy revolution '' , says Mario Alberto Arrastia Avila , an energy expert with Cubaenergia , an energy information centre in Cuba .
``But in order for this to happen we also need a revolution in consciousness .
Cuba has undertaken its own path towards a new energy paradigm , applying concepts like distributed generation , efficiency , education , energy solidarity and the gradual solarisation of the country . ’
The rest of the world should follow Cuba 's lead , for only a true global energy revolution will allow us to seriously confront the dire environmental problems that the world now faces .

More than 1,500 farmers in central India have reportedly committed mass suicide in the wake of crop failure and increasing debt .
The suicides took place in the agricultural state of Chattisgarh , where people mainly depend on seasonal crops , Earth Magazine reported .
Local residents told the magazine that many of the farmers felt that death was the only option in the face of their insurmountable debt .
The state of Chattisgarh was hit by falling water levels and droughts .
" Most of farmers here are indebted and only God can save the ones who do not have a bore well , " residents said .
Bharatendu Prakash , from the Organic Farming Association of India , said the farmers fell victim to money lenders who impose their own conditions for lending .
" Farmers ' suicides are increasing due to a vicious circle created by money lenders .
They lure farmers to take money but when the crops fail , they are left with no option other than death , " Prakash said .
At least 10,000 debt - ridden farmers in different parts of the country have committed suicide over the last decade .
The government recently announced a $ 15 billion waiver of farmer loans ; however , the waiver may not help a large number of farmers who have taken loans from private lenders .
The suicide issue was among those that dominated campaigning for the recent general election .
A Queens judge ruled yesterday that subway employees do not have to do anything but pick up their phones if they see a crime — as he threw out a suit against the MTA and two workers who did nothing more to stop a rape .
A conductor saw the rape from the window on his train , and a station agent in the booth witnessed a screaming woman being dragged down a staircase inside the desolate 21st Street station of the G line .
But neither one left the safety of their assigned posts to help her .
Instead , conductor Harmodio Cruz and agent John Koort called the command center to summon cops .
Justice Kevin Kerrigan ruled the two workers had taken “ prompt and decisive action in obtaining police help , ” according to the decision handed down in Queens Supreme Court .
The help came far too late for the victim , who was raped on the platform .
Her lawyer , Marc Albert , called Kerrigan ’s decision “ offensive , ” saying it gives “ blanket immunity ” for transit workers to ignore straphangers in peril .
“ Simply pressing the button is enough , ” lamented Albert .
“ God forbid citizens are put in a position where municipal workers are not required to act and it leads to harm — they are left out in the cold . ”
The victim , an artist , was inside a Queens - bound G train at 2:15 a.m. on June 7 , 2005 , when the only other person in the car began to touch her feet .
She jumped away from him , but the commotion caused her to miss her stop at Greenpoint Avenue .
She got off at the next stop , 21st Street in Long Island City , but as she waited for a Brooklyn - bound train , the same sicko — who had followed her off the train — began licking her feet .
She ran up a staircase toward the platform , but the psycho grabbed her in a bear hug and hauled her down the steps .
A station agent saw the commotion , hit a panic button in the booth and called the command center for cops .
The conductor of a Brooklyn - bound train saw the scuffle , heard the woman screaming and notified the train operator , who in turn also called the command center .
Albert argued that the workers could have done more without physically confronting the attacker — the conductor could have stopped the train , he said , and the station agent could have called police directly .
But Kerrigan wrote that it was “ pure speculation ” that added efforts would have helped the victim .
Cops arrived in about 10 minutes , but the attacker escaped up a different staircase .
He has never been caught , police said .
New York City Transit officials declined to comment .

Why Git ?
Kenai added git support
We realized that we'd get more Rubyists contributing if we had a mirror on Github
We became more comfortable with Git Ultimately , the move to Git mostly came down to politics : Rubyists like Git better , and we 're a Ruby - related project .
Had we been Jython , we 'd probably have chosen Mercurial .
Enjoy !
The CI server has already been updated to point at the new repository on kenai , and nightly builds have been running for several days .
If you just want to grab a current nightly snapshot , you can do that from github 's capabilities or by visiting the nightly build page :
The old SVN repository on Codehaus is now defunct for JRuby development and will not be updated any more .
We will likely remove the JRuby branches and trunk soon and replace them with a README pointing to the new repository locations .
We 've known for a long time that we wanted to move to a distributed SCM , and had narrowed it down to Mercurial and Git .
For a long time Mercurial was the front - runner , partly because we were more familiar with it and partly because kenai.com , the site where we 're moving JRuby 's project hosting ( and a JRuby on Rails - based site , btw ) , only supported Subversion and Mercurial .
But a few things changed our minds over the past couple months :
While New Zealand has decided to scrap its " graduated response " law and rewrite it from scratch , French legislators are pushing ahead to pass the Cr�ation et Internet law that would boot repeat file - sharers from the Internet for up to a year at a time .
The Assembl�e Nationale has just approved the main bit of the controversial bill , and full passage could come shortly .
The Assembl�e is working through the many articles and amendments to the proposed law at the moment , assembling a complete package that will eventually be voted on in its entirety .
The key part of the bill is article 2 ( Google - translated version ) , which creates the High Authority ( La Haute Autorit� ) that will administer the rules and pronounce suspensions .
Article 2 was today approved for inclusion in the final bill .
The High Authority , generally known by its French acronym HADOPI , will receive and evaluate complaints made by rightsholders about online file - sharing of copyrighted works .
It will then issue warnings to ISPs , which are required to pass them along to the customer account in question .
After multiple warnings in a one - year period , HADOPI can ( though it is not required to ) sanction a repeat offender by cutting off Internet access from one month to one year .
HADOPI will also maintain a blacklist , and sanctioned users will not be able to sign up for service with any Internet provider in the country during their time on the list .
ISPs who refuse to promptly disconnect subscribers face a � 5,000 penalty each time they do n't take action .
HADOPI will also require that users secure their own networks ( claiming that someone used your open WiFi router to download a file wo n't work ) , and plans to certify security software for use on home computers and networks .
Such software , culture minister Christina Albanel confirmed this week , will be in constant contact with a central server in order to verify whether it is on or off at any particular moment .
The bill is hugely controversial in France , where it is sometimes compared to the Maginot Line or to Big Brother , but the political opposition comes mainly from minority parties .
Once passed , the law could face some form of constitutional challenge ; if approved , it would certainly be the toughest such law in the world .
aaa - The Amazing Awk Assembler by Henry Spencer
" aaa " ( the Amazing Awk Assembler ) is a primitive assembler written entirely in awk and sed .
It was done for fun , to establish whether it was possible .
It is ; it works .
It 's quite slow , the input syntax is eccentric and rather restricted , and error - checking is virtually nonexistent , but it does work .
Furthermore it 's very easy to adapt to a new machine , provided the machine falls into the generic " 8 - bit - micro " category .
It is supplied " as is " , with no guarantees of any kind .
I can't be bothered to do any more work on it right now , but even in its imperfect state it may be useful to someone .
aaa is the mainline shell file .
aux is a subdirectory with machine - independent stuff .
Anon , 6801 , and 6809 are subdirectories with machine - dependent stuff , choice specified by a - m option ( default is " anon " ) .
Actually , even the stuff that is supposedly machine - independent does have some machine - dependent assumptions ; notably , it knows that bytes are 8 bits ( not serious ) and that the byte is the basic unit of instructions ( more serious ) .
These would have to change for the 68000 ( going to 16 - bit " bytes " might be sufficient ) and maybe for the 32016 ( harder ) .
aaa thinks that the machine subdirectories and the aux subdirectory are in the current directory , which is almost certainly wrong .
abst is an abstract for a paper .
" card " , in each machine directory , is a summary card for the slightly - eccentric input language .
There is no real manual at present ; sorry .
try.s is a sample piece of 6809 input ; it is semantic trash , purely for test purposes .
The assembler produces try.a , try.defs , and try.x as outputs from " aaa try.s " .
try.a is an internal file that looks somewhat like an assembly listing .
try.defs is another internal file that looks somewhat like a symbol table .
These files are preserved because of possible usefulness ; tmp [ 123 ] are non-preserved temporaries .
try.x is the Intel - hex output .
try.x.good is identical to try.x and is a saved copy for regression testing of new work .
01 pgm.s is a self - programming program for a 68701 , based on the one in the Motorola ap note .
01pgm.x.good is another regression - test file .
If your C library ( used by awk ) has broken " %02 x " so it no longer means " two digits of hex , * zero - filled * " ( as some SysV libraries have ) , you will have to fall back from aux / hex to aux / hex.argh , which does it the hard way .
Oh yes , you 'll note that aaa feeds settings into awk on the command line ; do n't assume your awk wo n't do this until you try it .
Turkmenistan has accused Russia of causing an explosion on a gas pipeline by giving less than a day 's notice before abruptly cutting its imports .
It said the sharp change in pressure caused a pipeline to rupture , and was a gross violation of gas purchase rules .
The Russian state energy company , Gazprom , denied the allegations saying there was no basis for the accusation .
Moscow buys nearly all Turkmenistan 's gas , and re-exports much of it to Ukraine and other European countries .
The Russian foreign ministry said it hoped the company and Turkmenistan would resolve the issue .
Diversification
Gas supplies from the Central Asia country of Turkmenistan to Russia were halted in the early hours of Thursday following the pipeline blast .
No casualties were reported .
The Turkmen side said it was working to rapidly repair the damage along the Davletbat - Daryalik pipeline , close to the Turkmen - Uzbek border .
In a separate statement , Turkmenistan said the explosion had not been caused by outdated infrastructure .
Gazprom said the incident would not affect supplies to its customers , and that alternative supply routes to Russia were being explored .
Turkmenistan 's massive gas reserves are effectively controlled by Moscow , since it relies on Russian energy giant Gazprom 's Soviet - era pipelines for distribution .
But the BBC's Central Asia correspondent , Rayhan Demytrie , says Turkmenistan is looking for ways to diversify its energy sector .
A major pipeline for the delivery of Turkmen gas to China is currently under construction .
Turkmen gas could also become the key to the success of the Nabucco pipeline , an EU - backed project designed to provide an alternative to Russian gas supplies to Europe .

( Wer diese Liste auf seine Webseite " kopiert " , soll doch bitte den Back - Link setzen , so wie sich das gehört )
Es handelt sich um die Einladungsliste , ergänzt um bestätigte Teilnehmer mit ihrer Funktion , die ich aus dem Griechischen umwandeln musste , wo die Namen nicht richtig , sondern nur phonetisch stehen , da sie wahrscheinlich durch einen Insider telefonisch durchgegeben wurde .
Danke an die welche geholfen haben die Namen mühsam zu entziffern .
Nicht alle die eingeladen wurden sind auch in Vouliagmeni erschienen und umgekehrt .
Ich behaupte nicht die Liste stimmt , sondern gebe nur das wieder was die griechische Zeitung To Vima veröffentlicht hat .
Die Skeptiker wollen doch immer Quellen aus der Mainstream - Presse ... hier ist sie , eine griechische landesweite seriöse Tageszeitung .
Wir sehen , niemand aus Russland oder China steht auf der Liste .
Bilderberg ist ein exklusiver Club für Nordamerikaner und Europäer .
Was hier ganz klar hervorgeht , ein totaler Interessenskonflikt .
Da treffen sich Konzernchefs mit Chefs von Ministerien und Behörden welche die Konzerne kontrollieren sollen , und mit Geheimdienstlern und Militärs , und mit Staatsführer und Politiker , aber gleichzeitig mit Medienbossen und Redakteuren , welche alle zusammen kontrollieren sollen .
Das ist doch absurd .
Wo ist da die Gewaltentrennung ?
Ein Gemauschel und eine Farce .
Die stecken doch offensichtlich alle unter einer Decke .
Wir werden ganz klar von allen Seiten verarscht .
Kein Wunder berichten die Medien nichts darüber und das Treffen wird totgeschwiegen .
Die gehören ja dazu .
Warum diese Geheimhaltung und Abschottung vor der Öffentlichkeit ?
Was haben sie zu verbergen ?
Diese 120 obersten Kader der Wirtschaft , Weltorganisationen , Militärs , Geheimdienste und Medien , plus noch der Blaublüter , treffen sich doch nicht zu einer Plauderstunde bei Kaffee und Kuchen .
Da wird doch ganz sicher Weltpolitik abgesprochen , die uns alle früher oder später betrifft , und wir ein Recht haben zu erfahren .
Die Namen die mir besonders auffallen sind : Christoph Blocher ( ehemaliger Bundesrat und ehemaliger Parteichef der SVP ) , Cem Özdemir ( Bundesvorsitzender der Partei Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen ) und Roland Koch ( hessischer Ministerpräsident CDU ) .
Egal ob sie dabei waren oder nicht , alleine die Einladung ist ein verdächtiges Zeichen .

The Arc Nursery has 50 children in its care Parents have formed a charity to save a south London nursery which was threatened with closure .
In November parents were informed that the Arc Nursery , in Crosby Row near London Bridge , would shut as it had failed to find a buyer .
About 100 families collaborated to form The Arc Community Trustees which took over the administration on Wednesday .
The " heartbreaking " prospect of closure prompted the parents to take action , the new management said .
' Special place '
The nursery , which opened in 2002 , was being run by local charity Charterhouse - in - Southwark but when a potential buyer pulled out the charity was forced to contemplate closing the centre .
The current management has eight trustees , who are all parents , advised and supported by Southwark Council .
Currently 50 children attend the nursery and 25 % of the places will be available at a subsidised rate to local families in need of financial support .
It was just heartbreaking , the thought that it would close down
Karen O'Connor , parent Many parents whose children had previously attended the school also supported the bid for management .
Karen O'Connor , a parent and now the project manager , said : " It just was heartbreaking , the thought that it would close down . "
Julie Nelson Rhodes , a parent and a trustee , said : " We 've got 14 permanent staff and they are all staying which is amazing .
" We are certainly not looking after the kids on a day to day basis but in a supporting role in fundraising , marketing , looking after the building and making sure all the facilities are up - to - date . "
Councillor Lisa Rajan , Southwark Council 's executive member for children 's services , said : " I can see there 's something very special about a nursery that 's run by the parents whose children are on the receiving end of the care it 's providing - there 's a level of understanding of the local needs that 's difficult to better . "
Alison Garnham , chief executive of the Daycare Trust , said : " There is a real danger that if parents get made redundant and pull their kids out of nursery some nurseries will become unviable and they may need to consider closing down or they start making a loss .
" So it 's a matter for real concern and we would like the government to take a look at it . "

Download Native Google Chrome For Mac OS X
Google Chrome can now be built and used natively on Mac OS X .
While it is far from stable and ready for daily use , it is stable enough for the Chrome Developers to use it to dogfood basic browser functionality .
Chrome on mac works similar to the one on windows , with one process spawned per tab , which you can monitor using Activity Monitor .
It also adheres to the Mac design principles with the menu bar on top unlike its windows cousin .
Chrome has n't lost any of its speed in its port to OS X .
A cold start is blindingly fast and web sites load quickly .
On SunSpider benchmark the latest chrome build is far ahead of Firefox 3.0 and slightly ahead of Safari 4 Beta .
It also beats the latest Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 scores on windows .
Finally Firefox and Safari has some real competition on OS X . Opera never caught the fancy of web developers , but chrome has generated tremendous interest among mac users and is poised to capture some market share when it is polished and ready .
If you want to take Chrome for Mac for a spin you can download ( old version OR new versions ) the application I have compiled .
You need an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.5 ( “ Leopard ” ) .
I plan to update it once every week or if a new update is published to the mac status page ..
You can follow techsutra on twitter to get updated when new build are available .

This report comes via “ The Center for Public Integrity ” :
The top subprime lenders whose loans are largely blamed for triggering the global economic meltdown were owned or bankrolled by banks now collecting billions of dollars in bailout money — including several that have paid huge fines to settle predatory lending charges .
These big institutions were not only unwitting victims of an unforeseen financial collapse , as they have sometimes portrayed themselves , but enablers that bankrolled the type of lending that has threatened the financial system .
These are among the findings of a Center for Public Integrity analysis of government data on nearly 7.2 million “ high - interest ” or subprime loans made from 2005 through 2007 , a period that marks the peak and collapse of the subprime boom .
The computer - assisted analysis also reveals the top 25 originators of high - interest loans , accounting for nearly $ 1 trillion , or about 72 percent of such loans made during that period .
The Center found that U.S. and European investment banks invested enormous sums in subprime lending due to unceasing demand for high - yield , high - risk bonds backed by home mortgages .
The banks made huge profits while their executives collected handsome bonuses until the bottom fell out of the real estate market .
Investment banks Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , JPMorgan & Co. , and Citigroup Inc. both owned and financed subprime lenders .
Others , like RBS Greenwich Capital Investments Corp. ( part of the Royal Bank of Scotland ) , Swiss bank Credit Suisse First Boston , and Goldman Sachs & Co. , were major financial backers of subprime lenders .
According to the Center ’s analysis :
At least 21 of the top 25 subprime lenders were financed by banks that received bailout money — through direct ownership , credit agreements , or huge purchases of loans for securitization .
Twenty of the top 25 subprime lenders have closed , stopped lending , or been sold to avoid bankruptcy .
Most were not banks and were not permitted to collect deposits .
Eleven of the lenders on the list have made payments to settle claims of widespread lending abuses .
Four of those have received bank bailout funds , including American International Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc .
The Center also conducted a computer analysis of more than 350 million mortgage applications reported to the federal government between 1994 and 2007 , and found that the amount of money spent by homeowners on their mortgages as a percentage of their income spiked sharply during the peak of the subprime boom .

GAZA CITY � " Dad , I 'm dying . "
The words keep echoing in Kamal Awaga 's ears , sending jolts of pain into his feeble , wounded body .
These were the last words uttered by his 9 - year - old son , Ibrahim , before he ended up as a practicing target for Israeli soldiers .
" They killed my son in cold blood , " says the grief - stricken father , still in a state of shock .
Ibrahim joined more than 350 children killed by Israel in its three - week onslaught on the coastal enclave .
But while others fell victim to killer bullets or deadly bombs , Ibrahim 's fate was even more tragic .
He became a shooting practice for a squad of Israeli soldiers .
" The Israelis did not show mercy for his innocence , " said his tearful father from his bed at the Al - Shefa hospital in Gaza City .
" They had no pity for his tiny body , " added the heart - broken father .
A Sunny Day
Nothing in the day prepared the Awaga family for the tragic twist of events that unfolded .
They woke up to a sunny morning after days of being locked in one small room to escape the massive Israeli bombardment .
" Mom , let 's have our breakfast out in the garden .
I 'm tired of staying in this room , " the grieved mother recalls Ibrahim 's plea .
An hour later , the table was set in the garden and the family was hoping to enjoy rare moments of peace , unaware of the eyes watching them from a distance .
A first missile stole the family 's job before another destroyed their house .
" Dad , I am dying , " cried Ibrahim to his father who rushed frantically to his side .
" Hurry , let 's go , " Awaga told his wife and two other children while carrying bleeding Ibrahim .
But even before they could reach the gate , a flood of bullets showered them .
One bullet hit the mother 's leg and another hit the father 's waist .
Ibrahim's two frightened brothers ran for cover behind the rubbles of their bombed - out house .
Shooting Practice
As the firing died down , the family thought their misery was over .
But the Israeli soldiers were not finished yet .
" When the soldiers came closer , I thought they will kill me , " said Awaga who faked being dead .
" But they were aiming at my young child , " he said choking at the bitter memory .
One soldier came close to Ibrahim 's body , turning him by his leg and laughing while another fired his gun to the dead boy 's head .
Laughs got louder as they carried the body to a higher place to start their party .
For a whole hour , the father hushed his cries of pain as he watched the Israeli soldiers compete in sniping on his dead son's body .
" They were using his bullet - ridden , bleeding body as a shooting practice .
" With each bullet , they were humming with words I could not figure out , but it sounded full of rapture .
It was as if they were celebrating . "
When they finally had enough " practicing , " the Israelis took their guns and left the house .
Four complete days passed before emergency doctors were able to find their way to the family and rush them to hospital .
" What did my son do to deserve that ? "
Awaga asks , shaking his head in disbelief .
" The Israelis killed my kid , not once or twice but a thousand times . "
Google Update , a small program that the search giant uses to deploy new versions of its software to end -users on Windows , is now open for public scrutiny .
Google has released the source code of the program , which is codenamed Omaha , under the open source Apache Software License .
Pushing patches to a large user population is a non-trivial technical problem .
It 's especially hard to make an updater that is n't disruptive or irritating .
Google 's updater operates silently in the background and seamlessly updates programs — including Chrome and Google Earth — as needed .
Although it does n't have the annoyance factor of some other update utilities , its stealthy behavior has raised some concerns among privacy advocates .
It 's hard to trust an opaque process that runs all the time and can't easily be removed — especially when it comes from a company that is perpetually embroiled in controversy over privacy issues .
To quell these concerns and provide greater insight into the behavior of its hidden updater , Google decided to make the source code available for public scrutiny .
Beyond revealing what Google Update actually does , the code could potentially be repurposed by other software developers who are seeking to build their own update systems .
I became intrigued with this idea when open source consultant Jeff Waugh posited that Omaha could hypothetically provide a foundation for building a unified update infrastructure for open source applications on Windows .
On the Linux platform , distributors typically use sophisticated package management systems to deploy new software and updates .
On Windows , however , there is no standardized framework for enabling third - party applications to push updates over the air .
Open source application developers have to each roll their own update tool or depend on users to manually download and install new versions .
Linux enthusiasts who use Windows know how frustrating it is to have to manually download and install fresh versions of Gimp , Inkscape , Pidgin , GVim , and many other tools on those occasions when they boot to Windows .
It 's possible that a better solution be achieved by forking Omaha and using its source code as the basis for a new , shared update system .
It 's still a bit too early to tell whether the newly released code will be useful to third - party developers .
I started poking through the source code myself , and ran into some minor roadblocks .
Most of the dependencies are n't problematic , and I already had most of them installed on my Windows XP virtual machine .
The list includes Python 2.4 , SCons , the Windows Template Library , and .NET 2.0 .
The first roadblock that I encountered is that Omaha wo n't build with Visual Studio 2008 — it requires an older version .
This problem is documented in the project 's wiki and issue tracker .
Google says that third - party developers are welcome to " contribute change to make it build with newer versions . "
The project 's documentation also leaves a lot to be desired .
There is n't much of it yet and the project 's architecture is n't immediately intuitive .
The code is , however , relatively well commented .
Many of the source files have useful explanatory blurbs that describe their purpose .
The deficiencies that I have noted here are n't really bad or surprising — they are somewhat typical of internal projects that are opened to public scrutiny .
In time , some third - party involvement and a bit of tidying up could enable developers to repurpose it and integrate it with other software , but it 's not entirely ready to be plugged into other programs right out of the box .
Google 's decision to open the source code is already fulfilling its primary function , which is to give users a clearer understanding of what the updater does .
For example , you can see which metrics the updater transmits to Google when users opt in to sending usage statistics .
It primarily includes Windows version information and details about the number of crashes the user has experienced .
You can also see how the crash handler automatically generates and submits reports .
This level of transparency is a good step forward for Google and it's a move that one can hope other companies will follow .
It will provide privacy watchdogs with a means of understanding how the updater works so that they can verify that it is behaving as advertised .
Microsoft has waved the white flag of surrender and will not compete with Apple by building a smartphone of their own .
Many people felt that the time was right to release a new smartphone , especially since Microsoft could have capitalized on the iPhone 's numerous shortcomings .
However , Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer feels that the iPhone is too popular right now .
The combination of a struggling economy and the mentality that " everyone who wanted a smartphone now owns a smartphone " led to Microsoft 's final decision .
Ballmer says that the decision is the result of careful financial consideration .
By forgetting about building the hardware for the smartphone and focusing more attention on designing software that is able to stretch across many devices , Microsoft is expected to fare better in the long run .
( Source : techweb.com )
Microsoft a Cheaper Alternative to Apple ?
It was interesting to see that Ballmer did acknowledge Apple as the definite forerunner in the smartphone market , claiming that the device is exceptional at what it does .
Still , Ballmer did point out one weakness of the iPhone that Microsoft hopes to capitalize on : price .
Instead of committing their software to only one type of smartphone , Microsoft is hoping to feature their Windows Mobile operating system on a wide assortment of lower - end devices to attract more people .
It makes perfect sense .
In tough times , people are more inclined to purchase cheaper substitutes as opposed to brand - name models .
If a Microsoft OS is featured on the less expensive device , the company will reap the financial rewards .
The Microsoft / Apple War Rages On
Apple 's victory in the smartphone market does not signal an end to the Microsoft / Apple war .
This year alone , Microsoft plans to redesign its user interface , introduce an application store , and offer a content backup service in order to better compete with Apple ( and other rival companies ) .
( Source : informationweek.com )
It 's all part of Microsoft 's plan to make careful tactical decisions and minimize cost during what 's expected to be a miserable 2009 .
VW : Porsche , mein Bruder , you probably wonder why we brought you here today .
You see , we all know about your gambling problem , even though you 've been hiding it well .
As you can see , the whole family is here .
Audi :
Let me say something , Porsche .
You 've lost your focus .
You need to look inside yourself , because trust me : Everyone cares most about the interior , even if you 're otherwise pretty unreliable .
Bentley ( in German - tinged fake British accent ) : Hear , hear , mein gut chap .
You 've got to stop throwing money at your problems and start getting people to throw money at you instead .
SEAT : I 've got nothing to add , but I 'll echo the same message as Audi 3 - 5 years from now .

TEHRAN , April 22 ( UPI ) --
A conference of Islamic prosecutors in Iran worked Wednesday to develop an indictment against Israeli leaders , accusing them of war crimes in Gaza .
The charges stem from Israel 's military offensive into Gaza in December and January against Hamas militants who control the strip .
Among other things , the Israeli military has been accused of using excessive and indiscriminate force in civilian areas .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Israel is " a regime that only understands the language of violence and force , " CNN reported .
" I am confident that there will come a day when all Zionist criminals will be brought to justice , " Ahmadinejad said on the second day of the conference in Tehran .
Israel said the offensive was an effort to end repeated rocket attacks originating from Gaza .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the conference 's claims against Israel will be heard " when this conference ( starts ) dealing with human rights in the countries that are members of this organization . "
The two days of meetings in the Iranian capital included more than 200 senior judicial officials from the Organization of the Islamic Conference , an association of 56 states .

The chair I ’m sitting in has a springy seat .
I ’m gently bouncing up and down , up and down , bouncing to my personal interpretation of Xtal ’s rhythm .
It ’s one of six , the chair that is , it ’s the color of coffee ice cream , it belongs around the circumference of the dinner table .
One of six , matching dining room chairs , up and down , up and down I bounce on one .
As if dropped straight from a beehive that has voided itself of bees , in other words , as if dropped straight from a beehive full of honey , is idea number two , idea ( 2 ) .
The past , like the future , is always in a state of flux .
The past is variable , never constant , never fixed , the past , like Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle , has a position and a momentum that can never be determined .
An event in the past , like a specific dot on a spinning ball of yarn , can not be pinpointed .
I ’m no physicist , I ’m not even a scientist , but what that means to me is that the past is an everchanging dot , and we live inside the past , we live inside the dot .
I stop bouncing , the up and down , up and down in the coffee ice cream chair comes to a stop once I realize that I speak trash , garbage spews directly forth from my mouth .
I ’m no physicist , no scientist , I am a dot in the past .
I am a dot .

( This is what happened precisely after I wrote “ I am a dot ” :
My nostrils pressed in , sucked against my septum , and I breathed the start of a cry , yes , I was about to cry , and I could feel my tear ducts swell , I was about to cry after I wrote “ I am a dot . ”
Then I stopped everything I was doing .
I stopped typing after the paragraph break , and I shifted my gaze to Honeyed Cat .
I knew she was sitting on the balcony , outside the sliding glass door , so my gaze knew exactly where to go .
The last time I saw her she was inside a warm beam of sunlight , staring at the thin forest on the other side of my screen , which was also her screen , she was staring at an adult iguana , skin still fluorescent orange after the winter season .
But this time , what was nothing less than the second time I looked at Honeyed Cat on the balcony , she was staring directly at me , still inside the beam of sunlight , her eyes glowing a marble green .
Honeyed Cat had seen me typing “ I am a dot ” , and she had seen me breathe as if about to cry .
For whatever reason she had averted her gaze from the iguana and focused on me .
Perhaps it was a sudden intensification of sunlight that made her do it , or maybe she shifted her gaze from nature to man because the iguana in the tree told her to .
Whatever her motivation / incentive , Honeyed Cat saved me from crying . )

The missing link is missing no longer , apparently .
And her name is Ida .
Scientists announced Tuesday that a diminutive , 47 - million - year - old female skeleton is the true bridge between mankind and mammals .
The discovery would “ rewrite history , ” they said - an idea that was contested by creationists and pounced upon by the press .
Ida is already the star of her own book and full - length movie , and her pedigree is on parade .
“ This fossil is so complete .
Everything is there .
It ’s unheard of in the primate record at all .
You have to get to human burial to see something that ’s this complete , ” said Jorn Hurum , a paleontologist with the University of Oslo who led the research .
“ This fossil will probably be pictured in all the textbooks for the next 100 years .
This is the first link to all humans - truly a fossil that links world heritage , ” he said .
His peers were equally enthusiastic over the bones , discovered in a German quarry and so detailed that the creature ’s last meal was still evident , along with impressions of skin and hair .
“ It ’s really a kind of Rosetta Stone , ” said Philip Gingerich , a paleontologist with the University of Michigan .
Ida , whose formal name is Darwinius Masillae , is also a major media event .
There ’s a new book , “ The Link , ” being published Wednesday .
A two - hour , high - definition movie of the same name will premiere on the BBC , the History Channel and other networks Monday .
“ Revealing the Link , ” a new interactive Web site , explains all things Ida ; a replica skeleton is destined for New York ’s Museum of Natural History as well .
But not everyone shares in the Ida adulation .
“ This is an incredible piece of hype to popularize a movie and a book .
It ’s hard to believe that this story took off , but the media picked up on very emotional claims about the ‘ missing link . ’
It ’s created good publicity , ” said Ken Ham , president of Answers in Genesis and founder of the Creation Museum .
“ What was wrong with all the other fossils over the years ?
Why get so excited with this one ? ” he asked .
“ This is a noteworthy fossil find because it ’s so complete .
But comparing it to the Rosetta Stone is quite an exaggeration , ” said David DeWitt , director of Creation Studies at Liberty University .
“ They say ‘ we have proof ’ of the missing link .
A few years later , they ’ll claim they have proof all over again .
The important question is this :
Where did the genetic information come from that produced that skeleton in the first place ?
It ’s not random chance , ” Mr. DeWitt said .
A 2006 Gallup poll found that eight out of 10 Americans believe God guided creation in “ some capacity ” - with 46 percent thinking God created man in his present form sometime in the past 10,000 years , while 36 percent say man developed over millions of years from lesser life forms , but God guided the process .
Thirteen percent of Americans think mankind evolved with no divine intervention .
Ida has seniority as a specimen - she is 20 times older than other fossils linked to human evolution .
But the skeleton , 3 feet long including a tail , has also been part of a research tug - of - war for over two decades .
The specimen was discovered in the quarry in 1983 by amateur fossil hunters who split the bones apart , to be sold in two pieces .
The smaller piece was purchased by a museum in Wyoming .
The Natural History Museum of the University of Oslo eventually acquired the larger specimen , and it has been the centerpiece of Mr. Hurum ’s research for two years .
He compared Ida to “ an unknown Rembrandt , ” explaining that forward - facing eyes , opposing big toes ; short face and other features make her part of the anthropoid branch of mammals that include monkeys , apes and humans .
“ She has a small , compact body , like us , ” Mr. Hurum said .
Earth at the time was a “ vast jungle ” that already hosted early horses , bats and primates .
Ida was not long - lived .
She was 9 months old when she died , her belly full of fruits , seeds and leaves .
An X - ray revealed she had a broken wrist that could have contributed to an early death , Mr. Hurum said .
He also speculated that Ida drowned in the volcanic Messel Lake , which is now the quarry , after having been overcome by carbon monoxide on the water ’s surface .

Like everyone else , I was amused when Texas Governor Rick Perry , a Republican , requested help from the CDC with swine flu medication just a week or so after he said that the “ federal government has become oppressive ” and that if Texans started considering seceding from the union , “ who knows what might come out of that . ”
Perry did n’t seem to realize that throwing off the yoke of the federal government would mean no more help when the going got tough .
Today comes news that Perry has issued a disaster declaration for the state of Texas , the first step in getting assistance from federal agencies like FEMA , DHS , and HHS .
I decided to take a look at how many times the federal government has bailed Texas out during Perry ’s tenure .
The results are pretty incredible .
According to FEMA ’s website , Texas has been the site of 13 “ major disaster declarations ” since Perry took office following George W. Bush ’s departure in 2001 .
That includes five instances of severe storms and flooding , two tropical storms , one “ extreme wildfire threat , ” and Hurricanes Claudette , Rita , Dolly , and Ike .
( Texas received significant federal assistance following Hurricane Katrina , but it did not appear on FEMA ’s website in the “ major disaster declaration ” category . )
David Riedman , a public information specialist at FEMA , explained to me that a major disaster declaration is issued when a governor “ determines the state ’s resources are overrun . ”
From that point forward , the federal government , under federal law , is required to reimburse the state for at least 75 percent of the cost of recovery .
Help is primarily targeted at rebuilding roads and bridges , debris removal , and reparing damage to public buildings .
In the relief efforts that are still under way from the damage done by Hurricane Ike , the federal government is reimbursing Texas for 100 percent of all expenses , according to Riedman .
In fact , since FEMA ’s record - keeping began , Texas has received federal disaster assistance more times than any other state .
From FEMA ’s website :
I ’ve asked FEMA for the total amount of money Texas has received in the form of federal disaster assistance during Perry ’s tenure as governor .
As soon as I get that figure I ’ll update this post .
Update :
Got the numbers .

Cambridge University researchers have discovered that whether someone is a ' people - person ' may depend on the structure of their brain : the greater the concentration of brain tissue in certain parts of the brain , the more likely they are to be a warm , sentimental person .
Why is it that some of us really enjoy the company of others while some people are detached and independent ?
In an effort to explore these questions , Maël Lebreton and colleagues from the Cambridge Department of Psychiatry , in collaboration with Oulu University , Finland , examined the relationship between personality and brain structure in 41 male volunteers .
The volunteers underwent a brain scan using Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) .
They also completed a questionnaire that asked them to rate themselves on items such as ' I make a warm personal connection with most people ' , or ' I like to please other people as much as I can ' .
The answers to the questionnaire provide an overall measure of emotional warmth and sociability called social reward dependence .
The researchers then analysed the relationship between social reward dependence and the concentration of grey matter ( brain - cell containing tissue ) in different brain regions .
They found that the greater the concentration of tissue in the orbitofrontal cortex ( the outer strip of the brain just above the eyes ) , and in the ventral striatum ( a deep structure in the centre of the brain ) , the higher they tended to score on the social reward dependence measure .
The research is published in the European Journal of Neuroscience .
Dr Graham Murray , who is funded by the Medical Research Council and who led the research , said : " Sociability and emotional warmth are very complex features of our personality .
This research helps us understand at a biological level why people differ in the degrees to which we express those traits . "
But he cautioned , " As this research is only correlational and cross-sectional , it cannot prove that brain structure determines personality .
It could even be that your personality , through experience , helps in part to determine your brain structure . "
Interestingly , the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum have previously been shown to be important for the brain 's processing of much simpler rewards like sweet tastes or sexual stimuli .
Dr Murray explained : " It 's interesting that the degree to which we find social interaction rewarding relates to the structure of our brains in regions that are important for very simple biological drives such as food , sweet liquids and sex .
Perhaps this gives us a clue to how complex features like sentimentality and affection evolved from structures that in lower animals originally were only important for basic biological survival processes . "
The research could also lead to new insights into psychiatric disorders where difficulties in social interaction are prominent , such as autism or schizophrenia .
" Patients with certain psychiatric conditions often experience difficulties in feeling emotional closeness , and this can have a big impact on their life .
It could be that the cause of these difficulties is at least partly due to brain structural features of those disorders , " said Dr Murray .

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
It has been a year since retired FBI agent Robert Levinson disappeared in Iran , and his family still has no idea where he is .
Bob Levinson 's daughter Susan and his wife Christine Levinson speak at a rally for the ex-FBI agent Sunday .
Christine Levinson , his wife of 33 years , and their family and friends staged a " rally of hope " in their South Florida hometown of Coral Springs on Sunday -- a day before his 60th birthday .
Outside a restaurant whose owners know and miss Bob Levinson , a crowd gathered wearing yellow ribbons .
They signed a petition that will be sent to Iran 's Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appealing for the Iranian leader to help find their missing relative .
" The rally of hope is to let everyone know that we have not forgotten Bob , that we will continue to search for him and that we hope that anyone that might have information about him will get in touch with us ... and help us bring him home , " Christine Levinson said .
Watch an interview with Christine Levinson »
She urged anyone with information to contact the family at www.helpboblevinson.com.
Levinson worked 30 years for the FBI and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and was employed as a private investigator at the time of his March 8 , 2007 , disappearance , the site says .
Levinson 's family has said they think he might have been working on a cigarette - smuggling case when he flew to Kish in Iran from Dubai .
But Sunday , his wife said she 's not totally sure what he was doing in Iran .
" He may have met with someone there and the two may have been abducted and questioned , " the Web site states .
" Some reports suggest the other man was released but Levinson was not . "
Levinson was last seen on Kish Island , off the coast of southern Iran .
Dawud Salahuddin , an American fugitive who lives in Iran , said last year that he met Levinson in a hotel on Kish Island on March 8 , 2007 .
Salahuddin says the meeting was an effort to put Levinson in touch with Iranian authorities to help the American investigate cigarette smuggling as part of his contract work for a tobacco company .
Known in Iran as Hassan Abdulrahman , Salahuddin is not believed to be a credible source of information about Levinson , senior U.S. administration officials have said .
Salahuddin was given refuge in Iran after admitting to killing a former pro-Western Iranian diplomat in Maryland in July 1980 .
He was on assignment from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's new regime when he killed Ali Akbar Tabatabai at his residence in Bethesda , according to Time magazine .
Shortly after admitting the killing in a 1995 interview with a reporter for the National Security News Agency , Salahuddin began working as a journalist for the Iranian government 's news agency in Tehran in 1980 .
According to Time , Salahuddin was in Afghanistan during much of the mid- to late - '80s , fighting Soviet forces with mujahedeen fighters .
Salahuddin has repeatedly expressed a desire to return to the United States .
Salahuddin's account of his meeting with Levinson is that he was seized by plainclothes Iranian officials , who took him away from the room he shared with Levinson to question him about his Iranian passport .
When he was freed the following day , Salahuddin said , he was told by officials that Levinson had returned to Dubai .
Christine Levinson said a man purporting to be Salahuddin called her " right when he disappeared " and told her that he would be home in a few days .
Senior administration officials have said they suspect Iranian authorities seized Levinson , although they have no proof .
State Department concerned
The State Department has sent several letters to the Iranian government seeking information about Levinson .
The Iranian government continues to maintain it has no information about him .
Speaking last week at a daily briefing , State Department spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is " baffled by the lack of support " from Iran on trying to locate Levinson .
" This is n't a political issue ; this is an issue about an individual ... who went missing from Iran , a place where there are very close tabs kept on foreigners , and in a situation in which we certainly have concerns that a year has gone by and we have not heard from him , " he said .
The United States has no diplomatic ties with Iran but sends messages through the Swiss Embassy .
The United States will " continue to push them , but unfortunately , they hold the key here , " Casey said .
In December , Christine Levinson traveled to Iran to seek information about her husband 's disappearance and pressure the government on his case .
While the Iranian government was polite and guaranteed the security of her family during their trip , she said , they provided no details on his whereabouts .
A hotel registration indicates Levinson checked in and out of a hotel on Kish Island on March 8 - 9 last year .
Christine Levinson says she saw his signature .
She was told he left in a cab .
She is especially worried about her husband 's fate .
He has high blood pressure and diabetes for which he takes medication , she said , adding that his medication was found in a hotel room in Dubai where he was staying before making what was to be a day trip to Kish Island .
In February , she hired an Iranian lawyer to " make sure the Iranian government does not forget about Bob . "
" I know that [ the attorney ] can file the papers necessary to report that he 's missing , " she said , referring to her attorney .
" And he can ask them to do things and go with them to look in prisons and jails .
" Whatever might be necessary . "
" Happy Birthday " sung
Among those at Sunday 's event : the head of the local FBI office , the county sheriff , and former federal agents and prosecutors who worked with Levinson at the DEA and FBI .
Daniel Levinson , who accompanied his mother to Iran last year , spoke with pride about his Dad , reading letters from Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Robert Wexler .
In Farsi , the younger Levinson said , " The next time I go to Iran , I hope it will be to bring my father home . "
Daniel 's aunt Susan said he learned Farsi after his father disappeared .
Monday is Robert Levinson 's 60th birthday .
The family sang " Happy Birthday " in the parking lot .
Christine Levinson said that when she needs a lift , she phones her husband 's voice mail and hears , " Hello , this is Bob Levinson .
...
Please leave your name and the time of your call , and I 'll get back to you .
Take care , and have a nice day . "
" In the moment when I listen , it makes me sad , " she said .
" But then it makes me keep going because I know I will hear him again in person . "
" Each day , I get up and hope today will be the day that I 'll bring him home , " she said .
" And if that does n't happen and if I have n't gotten a phone call , I focus on what I 'm going to do next to find him . "

From CNN :
“ It ’s time for this waste and inefficiency to end .
It ’s time for a government that only invests in what works , ” Obama said .
The president said the country must “ turn the tide on an era of fiscal irresponsibility so that we can sustain our recovery , enhance accountability and avoid leaving our children a mountain of debt . ”
Question Number One : If “ it ’s time for a government that only invests in what works , ” why does it look like AIG may be receiving yet another “ investment ” of taxpayer dollars because their latest bailouts have n’t worked ?
Question Number
Two :
If we are truly going to “ turn the tide on an era of fiscal irresponsibility , ” on what did we just spend $ 11.6 trillion of our children ’s and grandchildren ’s inheritance ?
Question Number
Three :
If “ it ’s time for this waste and inefficiency to end , ” why was n’t it time for waste to end as late as yesterday ?
Question Number Four :
If we are to “ avoid leaving our children a mountain of debt , ” why are n’t we seeing the “ change ” we were promised ?
The only change I see is an accelerated rate of fiscal irresponsibility which may ultimately lead to financial collapse .
The Crain 's New York Business news source reports that the anime and manga distributor Central Park Media ( CPM ) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has closed its doors as of Monday .
According to Crain's , the company owes US $ 1.2 million to creditors .
The company has not been active in releasing new titles in the past 12 months .
CPM and its Software Sculptors , U.S. Manga Corps , and Anime 18 labels were once the North American homes of such prominent works as Grave of the Fireflies , Utena , Mobile Police Patlabor , Record of Lodoss War , Slayers , Night on the Galactic Railroad , Project A - Ko , Dominion Tank Police , Descendants of Darkness , Demon City Shinjuku , Urotsukidoji , and La Blue Girl .
It later branched out into the book publishing field by releasing Comic Party , Record of Lodoss War , Slayers , Embracing Love , Kizuna , and other titles under the CPM Manga and Be Beautiful Manga imprints .
It sponsored the Big Apple Anime Fest earlier this decade .
Companies that file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States will face liquidation — unlike Chapter 11 and 13 bankruptcies which still allow companies to restructure and continue to operate .
CPM 's former management did not respond to ANN 's request for comment .
Thank you to Jess Pavlovich for the news tip .
Update : Added the Be Beautiful imprint .
Thanks , gynocrat_rex .
Update 2 : CPM laid off staffers in its comic book and sales departments in 2005 due to slowing book sales and a change in its distribution system .
It laid off additional staffers in 2006 after being " significantly impacted " by the retail chain owner Musicland 's bankruptcy filing earlier that year .
It seems that we have yet another addition to the growing list of rejected iPhone apps , with the latest rejection being a BitTorrent control App called Drivetrain .
In its rejection letter to the developer , Apple wrote :
… this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights .
We have chosen to not publish this type of application to the App Store . ”
It should be pointed out , however , that the app itself does not download or upload any data .
Rather , the app allows users to remotely control and manage the BitTorrent client “ Transmission ” .
On one hand , I can see where Apple is coming from .
While there ’s nothing inherently illegal about BitTorrent , what percentage of BitTorrent actually use the service for legal purposes ?
Still , is it really up to Apple to make that judgment call ?
I mean , there are a large number of perfectly legal torrents floating around as well .
And seeing as the app itself is used merely as a means to access the desktop app , why does Apple really care ?
In all honestly , it seems a bit ridiculous that Mac users can download 20 GB worth of movie files a day via Transmission , but an iPhone app which allows those same users to manage the app from afar is frowned upon .
It seems that almost every week now there ’s a new controversy regarding Apple ’s submission policies regarding the iTunes App Store , and it appears that Apple just ca n’t win .
One week it ’s criticized for being too lenient , and the next its criticized for being too draconian .
What do you guys think about Apple rejecting Drivetrain ?
Please chime - in in the comments below .

RICHMOND , Va. , April 9 , 2009  --
The two - year anniversary of Virginia Tech , the largest massacre by a sole gunman in the country 's history , is only one week away .
In the two years since , what has changed , what has been fixed , and what has stayed exactly the same ?
Immediately following the tragedy , Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and other authorities called on lawmakers to close the so called " gun show loophole " -- by which anyone can buy a gun from a private dealer with no background check and no questions asked .
Two years later , that loophole is still very much open , in Virginia and 32 other states around the country .
So just how easy is it to buy a gun at a gun show ?
The Challenge : To Buy a Gun in One Hour
For over a year , ABC News has followed Omar Samaha on a very personal quest to hold those lawmakers to their word .
Omar 's sister Reema was one of 32 shot and killed at Virginia Tech .
We went with Omar to a gun show in Richmond , Va. -- one of hundreds held every weekend across the state of Virginia and the country .
We gave Samaha $ 5,000 and one hour to see how many guns he could buy , and how many questions he would be asked .
CLICK HERE TO HELP OMAR SAMAHA FIGHT GUN VIOLENCE .
By 9:30 in the morning , the parking lot was already packed full of cars .
Groups of men , couples and even families with children in tow streamed toward the quickly growing line out front .
Samaha , 25 , joined the crowds and while waiting on line , he was approached by a seller and given the opportunity to make a quick purchase .
He bought a Glock handgun , with no background check , and no questions asked .
" He was just sitting right outside the door , I went up to him .
' How much do you want for it ?'
" '$ 450 bucks . '
' Here 's the cash . '
' Thanks .
See you later . '
" That was it . "
For Samaha , the Glock handgun was a particularly painful purchase .
It was the same kind of gun used to kill his sister Reema when she was a freshman at Virginia Tech .
Just holding the gun in his hand was difficult .
" I do n't want to think about how gruesome it was and how somebody used this type of weapon on my sister and so many other innocent people .
It 's devastating , " he said .
Buying Guns : No Background Check Required
Samaha walked back into the gun show , and within minutes he was out again , this time carrying a Colt AR 15 , a semi-automatic assault weapon very similar to an M16 .
We asked if there were any questions asked .
" Nothing , " he said .
" I just went up , gave him cash .
He 's like , ' Cash is all you need . ' "
Over the course of the hour , Samaha purchased 10 guns : three rifles , four shotguns , one handgun .
He could have purchased many more handguns , but he wanted to abide by Virginia State law , which allows the purchase of one handgun per month , and two assault weapons .
Samaha was never asked to fill out any type of background check .
At one point he was asked to show identification .
When Samaha said he did n't have any , the seller quickly relented , not wanting to lose a sale .
" He 's like , ' Give me $ 100 more and I 'll let you go and take the risk . '
I got two guns for $ 600 without any identification check , " Samaha said .
Lobbying Lawmakers
Not only did Samaha buy 10 guns in one hour with incredible ease and no questions , he could have turned around and sold those same guns right in the parking lot .
In fact , while standing next to his trunk full of guns , Omar was approached by a man who thought he was a seller .
Omar knew the gun show loophole existed , but he was still shocked by how easy it was for him to buy guns with no questions asked .
" Anybody can do it , " Samaha said .
" And it 's for real .
It 's that easy .
Anyone .
Someone who 's adjudicated mentally ill , someone who 's a known felon .
Someone who has a history of crime .
I think people do n't realize how easy it really is . "
In fact , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) reports in their investigations that private sellers at gun shows are a major source of gun crime in the country .
In the two years since Reema 's death , Samaha has fought hard to get the loophole closed in his home state of Virginia .
He has lobbied lawmakers , spoken publicly about his sister and even launched an online campaign about the dangers of guns on campus .
A law to close the gun show loophole has come up twice in the Virginia State legislature , and twice the body has voted against the bill , even though it was one of the key recommendations to come out of Kaine 's Virginia Tech Review Panel .
Gun Show Loophole
When Virginia lawmakers voted against closing the loophole , Samaha was shocked .
" It really made me wonder what kind of people we have making our laws , " he said .
Among those who voted twice against closing the gun show loophole is state John S. Edwards , a Virginia Democrat who represents the district that includes Virginia Tech .
After repeated attempts to reach Edwards , the state senator did not respond to calls from ABC News .
Gun rights groups do n't want to see the loophole closed because they fear that background checks will hurt business at gun shows , and also threaten privacy rights .
They also argue that the Virginia Tech shooter did n't buy his gun at a gun show .
Seung Hui
Cho bought his gun legally at a gun store even though he had a documented history of mental illness .
That breakdown in the system was addressed immediately following Virginia Tech , but families of the victims argue that with the gun show loophole still open , it is just too easy to buy a gun with no questions asked .
For Samaha , it 's not about the right to own a gun , it 's about how easy it is for guns to end up in the wrong hands .
" We 're not trying to keep guns out of the hands of good citizens .
If you can pass a background check , which anyone can do in a matter of minutes , then you can buy guns , " he said .
' None of Them Could Have Stopped Him '
Former ATF agent Gerald Nunziato was with Samaha at the gun show in Richmond , Va .
With years of experience fighting gangs and drug organizations , Nunziato was all too familiar with the guns that Samaha bought .
" My experience as an agent in Detroit and Miami is that these guns [ shotguns ] would be sawed off at the barrel , " he said .
" They 're a very high - powered scatter gun that 's used a lot by drug gang members ' cause they 're easy to get in and out of your car . "
Even though Samaha immediately turned in all the weapons he bought at the gun show to the Richmond Police Department , Nunziato pointed out that if Samaha had wanted to , he could have caused a lot of damage with the guns he purchased .
" There were three or four police cars in the parking lot [ at the gun show ] .
None of them could have stopped him [ Samaha ] with the firepower he bought , " said Nunziato .
For Samaha , it 's all about honoring his sister Reema 's memory and working to prevent another tragedy from happening again .
" I think I 'm doing something she would do , " he said .
" I think she would be proud of me and tell me to keep going . "

Funny Sign Vancouver Island
Photo & Vacation Spot
An amusing and funny sign in the wilderness of Northern Vancouver Island .
Near the northern end of the sedate Island Highway 19 on Vancouver Island is the turn off to the town of Holberg and Cape Scott Provincial Park .
In complete contrast to the paved and maintained highway , the road to Holberg is a rough gravel logging road which winds through the wilderness of Northern Vancouver Island .
Prior to reaching Holberg , those game enough to tackle the rough road will see this funny sign - " Be prepared for the unexpected " .
Read the story behind the funny sign , told by someone who knew the owner of the doomed car !
Not all the Somali " pirates " are gangsters : some are locals who 've watched their loved ones sicken and die after European toxic waste was dropped on their shores and decided to do something about it .
Yes : nuclear waste .
As soon as the government was gone , mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia , dumping vast barrels into the ocean .
The coastal population began to sicken .
At first they suffered strange rashes , nausea and malformed babies .
Then , after the 2005 tsunami , hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels washed up on shore .
People began to suffer from radiation sickness , and more than 300 died .
Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah , the UN envoy to Somalia , tells me : " Somebody is dumping nuclear material here .
There is also lead , and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury – you name it . "
Much of it can be traced back to European hospitals and factories , who seem to be passing it on to the Italian mafia to " dispose " of cheaply .
When I asked Mr Ould - Abdallah what European governments were doing about it , he said with a sigh : " Nothing .
There has been no clean - up , no compensation , and no prevention . "
At the same time , other European ships have been looting Somalia 's seas of their greatest resource : seafood .
We have destroyed our own fish stocks by overexploitation – and now we have moved on to theirs .
More than $ 300 m - worth of tuna , shrimp , and lobster are being stolen every year by illegal trawlers .
The local fishermen are now starving .
Mohammed Hussein , a fisherman in the town of Marka 100 km south of Mogadishu , told Reuters : " If nothing is done , there soon wo n't be much fish left in our coastal waters . "
This is the context in which the " pirates " have emerged .
Somalian fishermen took speedboats to try to dissuade the dumpers and trawlers , or at least levy a " tax " on them .
They call themselves the Volunteer Coastguard of Somalia – and ordinary Somalis agree .
The independent Somalian news site WardheerNews found 70 per cent " strongly supported the piracy as a form of national defence " .
No , this does n't make hostage - taking justifiable , and yes , some are clearly just gangsters – especially those who have held up World Food Programme supplies .
But in a telephone interview , one of the pirate leaders , Sugule Ali : " We do n't consider ourselves sea bandits .
We consider sea bandits [ to be ] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas . "
A study suggests Turks have low tolerance for diverse lifestyles as three in four respondents said they would not want to live next to an atheist or anyone drinking alcohol .
The study by Istanbul 's Bahcesehir University is meant to gauge radicalism and extremism in Turkey .
Results published in Sunday 's Milliyet newspaper indicate 64 % of Turks would not want Jewish neighbors , 52 % would not Christian neighbors , 67 % would not want to live next to an unmarried couple and 43 % would not want American neighbors .
The survey is based on interviews with 1,715 people selected randomly from 34 cities between April 12 and May 3 .
No margin of error was given .
On Wednesday a Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced a man to five months in prison for " insulting a section of society " after he put up a banner saying Jews and Armenians were not allowed to enter his business .
Niyazi Capa , who heads a cultural association in the city of Eskisehir , west of Ankara , put up the banner to protest against Israel 's offensive in Gaza earlier this year , which drew widespread condemnation in predominantly Muslim Turkey .
A cooking oil that is driving the destruction of the rainforests , displacing native people and threatening the survival of the orangutan is present in dozens of Britain 's leading grocery brands , an investigation by The Independent has found .
Palm oil – blamed for a tree - felling rampage in south - east Asia – is present or suspected in 43 of 100 best - selling brands in UK , far more than the one in 10 products estimated by Friends of the Earth four years ago .
Palm oil is present in Hovis and Kingsmill bread , the country 's best - selling margarine Flora , KitKat and Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bars , as well as Dove soap , Comfort fabric conditioner and Persil washing powder .

The research – the first time palm oil , which is usually labelled as " vegetable oil " , has been definitively quantified in British products – comes amid a surge in demand for the world 's cheapest cooking oil .
The United Nations Environment Programme believes palm oil is the major driver of deforestation in the vast islands of Borneo and Sumatra .
Hundreds of thousands of acres of forest are cleared to make way for plantations from which 90 per cent of wildlife disappear , including the orangutan , which is fighting a losing battle against extinction .
Orangutan numbers have dwindled by 90 per cent since 1900 , with the rate of loss accelerating in recent decades .
Emissions from the chainsawed peat - rich forests of Indonesia ( which owns Sumatra and half of Borneo ) are also thought to generate 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
At present only 4 per cent of palm oil production is certified sustainable by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( Rspo ) , meaning that the vast majority of global supply is linked to the forest gold rush .
All companies contacted by The Independent said they were talking to suppliers about moving to a sustainable supply .
However most of them – including Cadbury , Kellogg 's Nestlé , Mars and Heinz – have set no date for the process .
Nestlé said : " Nestlé shares concerns about the serious environmental threat to rainforests in south - east Asia and supports an end to deforestation .
Palm oil is not a major raw material and ... the company 's use of palm oil has been declining somewhat . "
Mars said : " We do use palm oil in our chocolate , but only work with suppliers who respect the environment and are committed to working with all stakeholders to make progress towards sustainable production . "
WWF , formerly the World Wildlife Fund , called on manufacturers to start matching rhetoric with reality by buying sustainable oil , which costs between 10 and 35 per cent more than ordinary supplies which are mixed at refineries .
Jan Kees Vis , Rspo chairman , said that manufacturers did not want to pay more for a hidden ingredient .
" The volume of certified palm oil traded is disappointingly low so far , the reason for this being that many companies are not prepared to pay a premium for certified oil , " he told The Independent .
Originating in West Africa , palm oil has become a £ 14 bn - a - year industry .
Some 38 million tonnes are produced annually .
Manufacturers use the oil to bind and bulk out chocolate , biscuits , bread and margarine and to give a creamy consistency to soaps .
About 85 per cent of the global supply comes from Borneo and Sumatra , where corruption is rife and where incursions into the forests are enforced by gun-toting security guards .
Satellite pictures have shown the rapid loss of the islands ' rainforests , which , in addition to the orangutan , contain endangered species such as the clouded leopard , Sumatran tiger , and sun bear .
Survival International , the London - based human rights group , says that palm oil producers supplying world markets are evicting indigenous people such as the Penan in Borneo from their land .
In an interview taped earlier this year in Borneo , a Penan villager recalled : " There were no official discussions .
The company just moved in and put up signs saying the government had given them permission to plant oil palm on our land .
The manager promised he would pay us whatever we wanted .
But we already know that the companies lie ...
If oil palm is planted , we will lose our land ... there will be no more forest . "
Global demand for palm oil is rising at between 6 and 10 per cent a year .
Although yields could be raised to meet the demand , suppliers have a financial incentive to chop down forest for hardwoods for furniture , which subsidises the plantations before the first oil is produced .
If current rates of logging continue , the UN Environment Programme estimates that 98 per cent of forests in Indonesia may be destroyed by 2020 .
Around 16 per cent of global palm oil arrives in the EU .
Companies often refuse to disclose whether their products contain palm oil .
However , after piecing together information from the companies , The Independent has established that palm oil is contained or suspected in 43 of the Top 100 grocery brands .
Of the nation 's £ 16bn spending on the top 100 brands , £ 5.5 bn goes on brands which contain , or are suspected to contain , the oil .
Thirty - three out of 62 food brands contain palm oil .
Only a few British firms , including Unilever and Sainsbury 's , have bought large amounts of Rspo- certified oil .
Green Palm , a Hull - based company which trades Rspo certificates , says it has struggled to find corporate buyers .
The Food and Drink Federation said the UK was " a small player in the complex global market for palm oil " , importing only 1.2 per cent of the annual crop for manufacture here .
Andy Tait , Greenpeace 's forests campaigner , said : " If you buy products from Unilever or Nestlé , ask what measures they are taking to remove unsustainable palm oil from their supply chain .
Public pressure makes companies change . "
Ancient oil : Modern uses
* Palm oil is made from the fruit and seeds of the oil palm ( elaeis guineensis ) , an edible plant long used as a cooking oil by villagers in West Africa , which now has a wide range of industrial applications .
* Palm oil is so prized because in addition to being the world 's cheapest , it is " uniquely fractionable " .
Chemical processes can separate solid ( stearin ) and liquid ( olein ) .
Manufacturers use the versatile oil in a wide range of foods and household products and , increasingly and controversially , it is used as a biofuel .

2010 Ford F - 150 SVT Raptor – Click above for high - res image gallery
Mike Levine of PickupTrucks.com is currently embedded in an F - 150 SVT Raptor R with the Ford Racing Team at the " Terrible 250 " in Primm , Nevada .
Being that close to the action , Levine has managed to wrest some hard info about the upcoming production SVT Raptor from Ford .
The off road - ready half - ton will start at just $ 38,995 , which may sound like a lot until you consider this desert flier will be only about $ 3,000 more than a well - equipped F - 150 FX4 .
The SVT Raptor will launch with Ford 's 5.4 - liter V8 , but soon after will be joined by the company 's new 6.2 - liter V8 , as well .
The truck certainly is n't for everyone with its huge tires , high suspension and compensating - for - something " FORD " grille , but those who do go for that kind of thing will at least not get gouged at the checkout counter .
Security forces in Bangladesh have arrested the head of a British charity two weeks after weapons were found at a school that his charity allegedly funded .
The family of Dr Faisal Mostafa , who runs the Stockport - based Green Crescent charity , had said he was held in the capital , Dhaka , last Wednesday .
But yesterday Bangladeshi authorities presented Dr Mostafa , 45 , at a press conference , saying his whereabouts had been unclear since 24 March , two days after the weapons cache was found .
Officials said Dr Mostafa had been arrested in Gazipur , 40 km ( 25 miles ) north of Dhaka on Monday , with the unnamed local co-ordinator of the Green Crescent charity .
Last Wednesday , Dr Mostafa 's father , Golam , told the Bangladeshi Daily Star he had been phoned by relatives in Dhaka and told his son was being held there .

Security officials said 10 guns , 3,000 rounds of ammunition , and 2,500 parts for grenades were found in the Islamic school , or madrassa .
WARNING : nearly every word of this post is intentionally false .
This is an April Fool ’s Joke .
There is so much misinformation out there about how MySQL works .
If you ’ve talked to someone from PostgreSQL , you ’ve surely heard some of it : “ MySQL does n’t even have transactions , ” for example .
And this from a PostgreSQL user , who uses a database that does n’t even run on Windows .
But even within the ranks of people who supposedly know MySQL ’s workings , lots of people just get things dead wrong .
I wanted to set the record straight here , so I thought I would give a little walk - through of how MySQL executes a query .
Let ’s see it in action from start to finish .
SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE COUNT ( col1 ) FROM users WHERE userid IN ( SELECT userid FROM othertbl ) ORDER BY userid DESC ;
The steps to execute this query are as follows :
The MySQL API sends the query to the server as a series of tokens .
The query is parsed .
MySQL checks privileges .
This step can be really complex , because it might involve a call to an LDAP or Active Directory service .
So I ’ll gloss over this for right now .
The query cache would normally be checked at this stage , but I ’ve given the SQL_NO_CACHE instruction .
So the query cache is n’t checked .
( If it were , it might find a saved result from a query without SQL_NO_CACHE and return it , which would be against the instruction . )
The optimizer executes the subquery and returns a list of userid values that can be substituted into the IN ( ) expression .
The optimizer looks at the COUNT ( ) expression .
As you know , all COUNT ( ) queries can be executed instantly on MyISAM tables — an optimization that does not exist for InnoDB , which is really slow at COUNT ( ) .
Actually , InnoDB is just slower across the board than MyISAM , which is why you should always use MyISAM .
The parsed and optimized query is compiled into a query plan : native byte code that can be run directly on the CPU .
The optimized query plan is stored for later executions .
If a similar query is issued later , the parsing and compilation can be skipped .
This is stored in the query cache , oddly enough .
( It ’s just one of those funny things about the query cache , which as I say , does n’t work as you expect . )
The query is executed , possibly on many CPUs simultaneously .
If this happens , the results from each CPU have to be combined into the final results , which is what the Sort_merge_passes status variable counts .
( This is also why you want to configure the sort_buffer_size as large as you can make it ; generally I suggest making it 75 % of available memory , or even larger in some cases . )
If there is no index on userid , then the ORDER BY can be skipped .
But if there ’s an index , MySQL ’s row - level locking and MVCC ( implemented at the server level , not in the storage engines ) will force reading of results from the index .
In that case , the result has to be put into a file , which is then sorted .
This is called a filesort .
You can see “ Using filesort ” in the EXPLAIN output if this happens .
If the result is bigger than the server ’s memory , the server also has to use a temporary table on disk .
If it ’ll have to do this , you ’ll see “ Using temporary ; Using disk table ” in EXPLAIN output .
The results are returned to the client via a separate network connection ( so that queries can be asynchronous ) .
After the query finishes , it is logged into the binary logs , which are MyISAM ’s transaction logs .
If you have these logs , you can undo statements , so you do n’t need backups .
You can just use the binary logs to roll back the changes .
That ’s another advantage of MyISAM — it has binary logs .
That ’s pretty much the whole thing .
I almost posted the lines and file names of the code for each step .
But I decided not to .
You can research it yourself if you want .
It ’s actually pretty simple ; the MySQL planner is really straightforward and modular , so you should be able to see exactly how all of the above steps work .
Just read the code .
If you ’re really curious , you can use the following query to test your knowledge of MySQL ’s execution plan .
Trace this one in your Visual Studio debugger and see how it works :
SELECT 0x417072696C20466F6F6C21 ;
That query does n’t access any tables , so it has a special execution plan that should show you whether you understand what ’s been explained above .
Have fun !

If you visited Reddit yesterday ( and at some points today ) , the first post that greeted you was :
That links to a post by me entitled “ What Exactly Has “ Changed ” Under Obama ?
The Rich Get Bailouts , Torture Goes Unprosecuted , AIPAC Decides The Fate Of Iran , and Democrats Are Still Silent Accomplices In Bush - Era War Crimes “ .
Followed by the posters comments on the story , it essentially implicates me and ProseBeforeHos as being mere operatives in a grander ploy by Republicans to turn social media sites against Barack Obama and the Democratic Party .
First , I would like to address the accusation in itself :
Under no circumstances would I ever take money from the Republican party .
I spent my seventeenth year on this planet working on Ralph Naders 2000 Presidential campaign .
I spent 2004 and 2006 working for state Green Party ’s ( Virginia and Georgia , respectively ) .
I ’m not going to go into greater detail about my personal history or beliefs , but I am the farthest thing from a conservative .
I do not have any sympathy , desire to work with , or would ever take cash to either manipulate a social media site , to promote a Republican or conservative agenda , or do anything that undermines the integrity of this website .
I do n’t hold many things sacred , but the purity and honesty in which I pursue things is one of them .
Secondly , yes , the title was hyperbolic .
But , I stand by the assertions I made .
I do n’t think it is a big deal Nancy Pelosi was possibly consulted about torture techniques .
What I do think is a big deal is Nancy Pelosi and Co. spending 6 years cheering on the worst offenses of George Bush ’s administration .
And at the center of the torture debate , the Democrats are scared to death , because they are implicit accomplices in Bush ’s war crimes by not doing a damn thing to stop them while they occurred .
Thirdly , the incident revealed one sad aspect of the social networking frenzy : it breeds the worst kind of self - obsession and bloated sense of collective ego I have witnessed online .
At most , Digg and Reddit garner a couple hundred thousand unique visitors a day .
Do you really think that , in the grand scheme of things , the social networking sites are such a great democratic movement ?
Do you really think that you are so important as to warrant a grand conspiracy to influence your opinions ?
The answer is no to both questions , and we ’d all be a lot better off if you got over yourselves .
Love always ,
Alec
You know your day 's gone badly when it ends with you being shouted at in a Greek police station .
It was n't meant to end this way .
I 'd gone for a gentle sunset walk , up by the Bilderberg hotel , to relax before the big opening day of the elite globalist shindig , watch Phoebus plunge headlong into the western sea , and ( yes ) maybe sneak a couple of short - lens pictures of the mounting security .
Opposite the hotel gates I took a casual photo out over the bay , limbering up to swivel round and snap off some naturalistic " armed guard having fag and chatting up policewoman " sort of shots .
A plainclothes officer jogged across the road and got in my face .
" No photos . "
" Of the sea ? "
" Give me your camera . "
" I do n't understand . "
" Passport . "
" I 've got my Oyster card " .
" Passport . "
" Driving licence ? "
He takes my licence .
A group of policemen have sauntered over , and mutter Greekly about the enormous threat to the smooth running of Bilderberg I seem to represent .
" What is this ? " asks one of the local militia .
He takes my notebook .
Opens it at random .
" What are you writing ?
What here ? "
He points to an old 8 Out of 10 Cats joke ( well , barely ) about what would happen if we had a female Doctor Who .
He jabs at it , proof , in black and white , of my status as an agitator .
I read it out : " I 'm not saying we 've already had a female Doctor Who , but Sylvester McCoy put cracks in the glass ceiling . "
" Who is this ?
Syl ... Syl ... "
" Sylvester McCoy . "
" A friend of yours ?
He is staying here ? "
I bite back telling them that Sylvester McCoy is a noted anti-globalist freedom fighter who is here to lead the people 's revolt against Bilderberg 's liberty - stripping agenda .
" It 's nothing .
Can I have my book back ? "
They confer .
An imp in my brain tells my hand to reach for my camera and take a photo .
Click .
Whir .
At which point , on a gorgeous May evening on the Athens Riviera , began one of the more stressful hours of my life .
Hands went to holsters .
" NO PHOTOS ! "
" HE TAKE FOTOGRAFIA ! "
" NO FOTOGRAFIA ! "
Over came the man with the machine gun .
Over came the man with the special mirror - on - a - stick for car bombs .
It was the first time in my life , and hopefully the last , that I 've been intimidated by a mirror on a stick .
They circled round me .
One of them , the one in the photo with one hand up and the other on his pistol , kept prodding me in the shoulder , and shouting : " Give the camera !
Just give the camera ! "
All around me : " Delete ! Delete photos ! " followed by a lame tug of war for the camera with no great self - belief on either side , which I won .
Camera back in pocket .
Then it became : " Get in the car ! "
Get in the car ! "
I was n't about to get in the car .
I remember saying : " One of you has a machine gun , you 're shouting at me , I do n't understand why , I took one photograph , this all seems a bit strange .
What 's going on here ? "
One of the nicer policemen , who looked a bit like the short guy from LA Law , the one married to Jill Eikenberry ( note to self , update this reference ) , took me aside .
" Very important people coming .
Very important .
No photograph .
Please get in car , we take details , put in computer , you can go . "
I complained , reasonably I think , that they could simply phone my details through to the station , and check that I was n't wanted on three continents for acts of terror , but they were having none of it .
Prod , prod , prod .
Eventually I got in the car .
I had to .
They drove me to the police station .
Other cars followed .
At the station , officers gathered from all quarters .
They 'd sniffed an incident .
A dozen of them stood round me .
The Greek chorus reached full voice : " Give the camera !
Delete photos !
You understand ? ! "
I hated my hands for trembling when I wrote down my father 's name so they could look me up on " computer " .
But at least I got a chuckle hearing them try and pronounce Melvyn .
One of the policewomen smiled .
" Delete photos and you can go , no trouble . "
She looked like Christina Aguilera 's slightly butch cousin and I fell on her smile with a thirst .
Nearly gave her the camera .
Understood in a flash the whole good cop , bad cop thing .
Kept my camera in my pocket .
Smiled back .
" I just want you to tell me if I 've broken the law , and if so , are you arresting me ? "
God , I sound like a cliché of a protester .
Oh god , I 'm a protester .
What are my rights here ?
" Charge me or release me ! " is what I did n't shout .
I sat quietly and tried to still my hands in my lap .
I smiled at Christina .
I was winning .
Suddenly , a " you can go " from the sergeant at the computer .
I went .
I had my camera .
I had my photo .
I was free .
It was the end of Midnight Express .
The Breakfast Club fist in the air .
Except that I felt sick and wanted to go to sleep .
I slept .
This morning , feeling stronger after a slice of breakfast cake , I think I understand : I was the trouble kicking off .
I was the agitation they 'd been warned about .
Very important people .
No mistakes .
They were wired , pumped up for confrontation , and my photo had been the spark .
It 's why they 'd blown up in my face .
Important people arriving .
No fotografia .
And then it struck me : there really ISN'T any fotografia .
There 's none .
Not a single member of the mainstream press .
Not a single newshound camera on a tripod .
Nothing .
Nothing is happening here .
Nothing to report .
The limousines have started to arrive .
Nothing to report .
They 've closed off an entire peninsula .
There are roadblocks .
Machine guns .
Nothing to report .
This is Bilderberg 's 57th annual meeting .
Nothing to report .
Susan Boyle plucks eyebrows !
Finally , something to report .
Charlie Skelton will be filing regular updates from Athens – even though he has been warned and may not be so lucky next time .
Mr Goldstone headed the UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda The UN has appointed South African judge and former war crimes prosecutor Richard Goldstone to lead a fact - finding mission to the Gaza Strip .
Mr Goldstone will investigate alleged violations of international law during the recent conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants .
Martin Uhomoibhi , president of the UN Human Rights Council , said the mission would be independent and impartial .
Israel calls the council biased and has previously refused to co-operate .
Mr Goldstone will lead a four - member team , which also includes experts from Pakistan , Britain , and Ireland , in investigating " all violations of international humanitarian law " before , during and after the Israeli campaign in Gaza that ended on 18 January .
" It 's in the interest of the victims .
It brings acknowledgment of what happened to them .
It can assist the healing process , " Mr Goldstone said .
" I would hope it's in the interests of all the political actors , too . "
The fact - finding mission , which will aim to provide clarity on the legality of the deaths and destruction , is due to start work in the region within weeks , the UN said .
Israel ' singled out '
The council voted to set up the investigation into at a special meeting in January , after widespread allegations of war crimes committed by Israeli forces in Gaza .
I believe I can approach the daunting task that I have accepted in an even - handed and impartial manner
Richard Goldstone
Gaza conflict :
Who is a civilian ?
Who can probe ' war crimes ' ?
Israel disputes Gaza death rates
However , the Israeli army says its operations in the Gaza Strip " were carried out in compliance with the rules of warfare under international law " .
It says it took " numerous measures to avoid causing harm to the civilian population " .
The Palestinian militant group Hamas is widely accused of basing its forces within heavily populated areas , allegations it denies .
The Israeli government has in the past refused to co-operate with UN human rights council investigations , including one led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
It is not clear whether Israel will co-operate with the new investigation .
" This committee is instructed not to seek out the truth but to single out Israel for alleged crimes , " said Yigal Palmor , spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry .
He said the council was a discredited body .
' Shock ' appointment Mr Goldstone is a former UN chief prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda .
He is also a former judge at the South African constitutional court .
He is also on the board of governors at Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
Mr Goldstone said he was " shocked , as a Jew " , to be invited to head the mission .
" I 've taken a deep interest in what happens in Israel .
I 'm associated with organisations that have worked in Israel .
" And I believe I can approach the daunting task that I have accepted in an even - handed and impartial manner . "

Support is added for accessing the Router Console over IPv6 , a new message type enables I2CP applications to query the router 's bandwidth limits , an experimental desktop interface for managing the router is included for the first time ( but not enabled automatically yet ) and participation of a single peer in too many tunnels is prevented to improve reliability and safety .
Besides other maintenance work , several old statistics calculators are dropped to make router profiles smaller and quicker , while new build scripts are supplied for I2 P 's big integer math library .
Updating is highly recommended .

Humans have ventured into space over the last 50 years , and all manner of junk has been left behind .
From tiny bolts to whole space stations , people have discarded lots of stuff up there .
Much of it eventually dies a fiery death as it falls through Earth 's atmosphere , but some larger debris poses risks for astronauts and spacecraft that could collide with it .
Here are some of the quirkier items left in space :
1. Spatula
While spreading some goo as a test of heat - shield repair materials , spacewalking astronaut Piers Sellers accidentally lost a spatula he had been using .
The mishap took place during the space shuttle Discovery 's 2006 STS - 121 flight to the International Space Station , on a mission to test new safety techniques after the 2003 Columbia disaster .
" That was my favorite spatch , " Sellers reportedly said .
" Do n’t tell the other spatulas . "
2. Tool bag
Astronaut Heide Stefanyshyn - Piper lost her grip on a tool bag while doing a spacewalk in November 2008 to try to repair a jammed gear on a space - station solar panel .
The 30 - pound bag , filled with grease guns , a scraper tool and a couple of bags for debris , cost about $ 100,000 .
Amateur astronomers spotted subsequently spotted the bag in orbit , and North Americans can check to see if the tool bag is in their slice of the sky with Spaceweather .
com 's satellite tracker .
Watch the bag float away below .

3. Glove
Starting out the long trend of astronauts losing stuff in space , the very first American spacewalker , Ed White , let go of a glove during his first extra-vehicular activity on the 1965 Gemini 4 flight .
The glove stayed in orbit for about a month before burning up in Earth 's atmosphere .
4 . Tank of ammonia
This one was lost on purpose .
In July 2007 , NASA instructed astronauts to throw an unneeded 1,400 - pound tank full of ammonia overboard .
The device used to be part of the space station 's cooling system , but when the A/C was upgraded , it became obsolete .
Deeming that it would take up too much cargo room to carry it back to Earth , mission managers decided to have it trashed .
More than a year later , the tank burned up over the South Pacific Ocean as it hit the atmosphere .
5. Gene Roddenberry 's ashes
A portion of the ashes of Gene Roddenberry , creator of the Star Trek series , were delivered to space in 1992 by the space shuttle Columbia on its STS - 52 mission .
The lipstick - sized capsule containing his ashes orbited the Earth before eventually disintegrating in the atmosphere .
The rest of Roddenberry 's ashes , along with those of his wife Majel who died in December 2008 , will be shipped into space along with digitized fan letters in 2010 .
6. Pee
Over the years , most of the urine produced by astronauts has been simply dumped overboard .
Once pee hits the cold vacuum of space , it quickly freezes into tiny crystals which then float around as debris .
( Astronauts have described watching urine being released into space as one of the most beautiful sights in orbit ) .
Recently , however , a new pee-recycling system was brought up to the International Space Station to turn urine into drinking water , cutting down on the pee debris .
7. Pliers
While repairing a damaged solar array during a November 2007 spacewalk , astronaut Scott Parazynski accidentally lost a set of needle - nose pliers , which were spotted floating away below the station .
8. Camera
Astronaut Suni Williams was tussling with a stuck solar array on the space station in June 2007 when her camera came untethered and drifted away .
Rather than astronaut error , this incident may have been caused when the button holding down the camera broke .
Watch video of the mishap below .

Last week we got treated to a real study in irony , something that was not lost on columnist Joan Vennochi of the Here 's what she had to say : [ Emphasis added ] Stirring words indeed .
That has been the ideal and the as - yet unattained goal of this nation from its inception .
You would think that the first African American president introducing the first Hispanic American nominee to the US Supreme Court would have something to say about the devastating news from the California Supreme Court , but you would be wrong .
His press secretary ducked the question when asked about the president 's response to the news , and it 's been crickets from the White House ever since .
President Obama was n't always so reticent on the issue , however .
But that was then .
Now he has settled into the politically expedient and oh - so - comfortable " middle " on the issue , as he has on various issues :
In fact , he could n't even be bothered to travel to California to speak to the issue of extending " equal justice under the law " to gays and lesbians .
Apparently this state is important only for fund - raising , not consciousness raising .
That 's not the kind of leadership we were promised .
Instead of emulating a Lyndon Johnson , who helped the country through the tragedy of John Kennedy 's assassination by implementing Kennedy 's dream of a more equitable nation via the civil rights legislation he pushed through ( after being pushed by those who saw that need ) , President Obama appears to be satisfied with a Gerald Ford approach : the nightmare of the Bush Administration is over .
Let 's move forward by papering over the pain of the past .
Here , have a bandaid .
That 's not leadership , that 's capitulation to the monolithic status quo .
I am gravely disappointed and disgusted , and I am becoming increasingly angry .

Sony has contended there is no PSP2 and they are telling the cold hard truth .
There wo n’t be a PSP2 coming for at least a couple more years .
That does n’t mean that some new PSP hardware is n’t headed our way soon enough .
Think more aesthetic changes , more along the lines of DS > DSLite but more substantial of a change .
We here at PlayStation LifeStyle are ready to “ debunk ” or “ confirm ” some of the rumors that are floating around the net .
We are not at liberty to divulge our sources .
Rest assured all will be revealed during E3 .
Some of the details I cannot divulge , but we will try our best to let you know what it is , and what it is n’t .
We recently noticed PSPWorld ’s attempt at “ Separating Fact and Fiction ” regarding the PSP2 , we call it an attempt because it ’s pretty much all wrong .
Let ’s take a look at what PSPWorld calls “ Fact ”
UMD is dead .
Sorry folks , UMD IS dead , they got this one right …
Touch Screen .
PSPWorld states that this is a given as this seems to be the trend the industry is heading towards .
Well Sony boasts it ’s “ Like No Other ” and that is the truth , Sony does n’t follow trends , it sets them .
There will be NO touchscreen in the next PSP .
“ Monstrous Hardware Specs ”
If that were the case , it WOULD be the PSP2 , and the next PSP is NOT the PSP2 , it ’s not the PSP - 4000 either .
In fact it ’s something entirely unique .
Now let ’s move onto their “ Fiction ” :
Release before Christmas 2009 .
We do n’t know an exact release date , but it ’s much sooner than anyone is expecting .
One thing we are sure of is that it ’s definitely going to be before Holiday 2009 .
Internal HDD .
If UMD is dead , how exactly does PSPWorld think we are going to get our games on the new PSP ?
Sure Sony could pack in some form of memory stick with the new PSP , but that is n’t practical .
As Dave Perry has mentioned in the past , look for some type of solid state memory on board .
It will also take some form of removable flash memory .
Phone included .
They got this one right also , but it was n’t a hard guess .
There will be no built in phone in the next PSP , however you can always use Skype .
Here is a few more things we would like to touch on .
Sliding Screen .
They call this fiction , and unfortunately we cannot comment on this .
We have to leave it at that .
Dual Analog Sticks .
Nope , not happening , at least not until the PSP2 which this is n’t .
Adding a second analog stick would alienate the current PSP lineup , which is going to get much more robust later this year .
A lineup , that will play just fine on this new PSP , which is based on current PSP tech .
Last thing we would like to leave you off with is …
We all know E3 is GOing to be filled with HEAVY announcements , potentially COLOSSAL even if we ’re lucky .
Do n’t let all the MASSIVE amounts of rumors RAIN on your parade .
It ’s a great TIME to be living the PlayStation LifeStyle , so TUNE in as we bring all the news , LITTLE and BIG to you as things are set in MOTION every step of the way .
[ Update ]
As reported by other flattering media outlets and we ELUDED to here , the new PSP is called PSP Go .

Peter Schiff Interviews Marc Faber
Dr. Marc Faber runs his own business , Marc Faber Limited , which acts as an investment advisor and fund manager .
He publishes a widely read monthly investment newsletters The Gloom Boom & Doom report which highlights unusual investment opportunities , and is the author of several books including Tomorrow ’s Gold — Asia ’s Age of Discovery which was first published in 2002 and highlights future investment opportunities around the world .
Dr. Faber is also a regular contributor to several leading financial publications around the world .
A book on Dr. Faber , Riding The Millennial Storm , by Nick Vittachi , was published in 1998 .
In late February , Euro Pacific President Peter Schiff interviewed the eminent economist Marc Faber by telephone from his office in Hong Kong .
Q : Marc , many thanks for taking the time for this interview from your busy schedule .
I ’d like to start with some macroeconomic questions , and then talk about some of the investment implications of the larger macro questions .
Let ’s start with the stimulus and bailout , which is very much on everyone ’s mind .
What do you think are the long - term effects of the stimulus and bailout proposals on all the Western countries , including the U.S. ?
MF : Well , first of all , there are lots of academic studies on bailouts and stimuli ; and also on money - printing .
And , in terms of fiscal spending , bailouts usually do n’t work .
When the government sits in and tries to offset sagging private demand with government demand , it usually does not work .
This is the pattern we have seen in the past .
The long - term effect on the US economy from all the bailouts and deficits is basically that government ’s debt will rise very substantially and the balance sheet of the Fed will expand .
Many people think that the global recovery will begin in late 2009 .
I seriously doubt that .
I think it will be at least two years from now , worst case maybe 10 .
And when we do start recovery , interest rates will rise and inflationary pressures will be enormous .
An economy always fluctuates around the trend line .
If you try to postpone recession the way the US government has tried to do , then one day you will have a much bigger problem .
If you postpone recessions through deficit financing , or through easy monetary policies , then obviously you have very strong debt growth as we have had in the US .
Debt as a percentage of GDP has expanded from 130 % in 1980 to 360 % today .
This does not include the unfunded liabilities arising from pensions and from Medicare and Social Security .
The best that the government could have done would have been to take a more severe recession in 2001 , and then all the excess that followed would not have occurred .
Now , we have an environment where the patient has died ; no matter how much stimulus there is , it ’s not going to revive the economy .
Q : Does this mean that in the longer term we ’re going to see an inflationary environment ?
MF : There is no other way for the US but to inflate .
It ’s not a desirable policy , and it has in the end disastrous social consequences .
But given that we have a money - printer at the Fed and an Administration that wants to expand the role of government as a percentage , the result will be , unfortunately , inflation .
Q : Are we looking at the same kinds of inflation we saw in the late ’ 70s , or not quite as bad ?
MF : My view is that , eventually , we will see a much higher inflation rate than in the ’70s .
In the short term , because of the collapsing asset market and increased savings rate in the US , we will see deflationary pressures .
But in the long run , we ’ll have a much higher inflation rate .
That will be negative for US bonds and equities .
Q : Not a pleasant picture .
Are there any other bubbles on the horizon ?
MF : Basically , we always have bubbles and investment mania in the world .
Even in the 19th century , under the gold standard , from time - to - time investment manias and bubbles developed in railroads and in canals and in real estate , just to name a few .
Under a fixed monetary , or gold , standard , where the quantity of money cannot be increased indefinitely ; there is a natural limit to the scale of the crisis .
Usually when there ’s a boom in one sector of the economy , you have some kind of deflation somewhere else ; that was also the case in the 1970’s .
We had a boom in commodities , but bond prices collapsed .
What Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke have achieved is historically quite unique .
They have managed to create a bubble in everything , everywhere in the world : in real estate , equities , commodities , art , worthless collectibles ; even bond prices continued to rise as interest rates fell due to the loose monetary policy .
Since 2007 and 2008 , everything has collapsed .
But government bond prices continue to rise , and went ballistic between November 2008 and December 2008 , when 10 - and 30 - year Treasury yields collapsed .
So my view would be that this was the last bubble they managed to inflate .
From here on , the government bond market will fall .
In other words , the trend will be for interest rates to actually go up .
Q : If you were the Chairman of the Fed or the Secretary of the Treasury , what would you recommend now to the Congress ?
MF : I think the best move would be to resign , but that aside …
Q : Unlikely .
MF :
The problem is that no officials in the US are telling the truth .
Let me give you an example :
The elderly statesman in Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew , immediately said in last September , “ we ’re going to face very tough times ; we have to tighten our belts to stay competitive . ”
This is something no president in the US will say : that you have to want for a few years , tighten your belts , and endure some pain in order to safeguard the country ’s economic health — for the sake of your children and for the sake of the nation as a whole .
Neither party in the US nor any elected government official dares to tell the electorate how disastrous conditions in the country have become .
Ill - conceived policies by the last few administrations , Republicans as well as Democrats , were designed to stimulate consumptions .
As a result of these policies , we will now have a period of subpar growth for quite some time .
The government ’s policy should have been to stimulate capital formation , education , and R&D , and to encourage people to save .
If I had been Fed Chairman , I would have kept interest rates at a much higher level after 2001 .
I also would n’t have cut interest rates as aggressively as Mr. Bernanke did after September 18 , 2007 .
Do n’t forget , low interest rates actually hurt savers .
There are a lot of people in America , like retirees , that have money on deposit , and now do n’t get much interest on their deposits .
So it basically forces them to speculate .
If I were at the Treasury , I would let the financial institutions that overly leveraged themselves and gambled with other people ’s money , like AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , go bankrupt .
You can still protect depositors and the policyholders of these companies .
But let the system , through the market mechanism , deal with the problem .
Q : It looks like Iceland ’s on its way to bankruptcy .
Do you think there are any other countries that are going to be in a similar shape to Iceland ?
Which countries are vulnerable ?
MF : I ’m sorry to say I think the whole world is an Iceland .
I think we have countries like Britain and Ireland and Switzerland that have problems similar to Iceland , though they ’re not as bad as Iceland .
Basically , Iceland became a huge hedge fund .
They raised money in the international capital market ; they then leveraged that money to buy assets all over the world .
So , when asset prices stopped rising , banks and institutions in Iceland had a major problem .
Banks were some of the worst offenders .
They raised money from depositors , and by issuing bonds and certificates of deposit .
Then , they gambled on poor investments , believing that markets could n’t fail .
They are children of the bull market .
But when asset markets started to turn down , they were screwed .
The value of their assets had declined , whereas their liabilities remained at the same level .
That ’s why so many banks are insolvent .
Q : Can America learn anything from Japanese stagflation , the “ lost decade ” as many people call it ?
MF : I think the Japanese had a peculiar situation .
First of all , the stock market in Japan was probably more overvalued than the US market in the year 2000 or in the year 2007 .
Also , the real estate market was in “ cuckoo - land ” in Japan .
The good thing about Japan after 1990 , when the recession hit and a period of no - growth began , is that the typical household never suffered very badly , for the simple reason that prices for assets , things like golf course memberships , nightclubs , housing prices , etc. , all went down .
So , their salaries did n’t rise any more but stayed at the same level , and everything fell in price — we had deflation .
So the typical household actually increased its standard of living .
In the US , the problem is that the household sector is terribly indebted .
That was n’t the case in Japan .
In Japan , the corporate sector was indebted and the banks and real estate companies were overleveraged , but not the household sector .
And the household sector in Japan still had a savings rate of around 12 percent when the recession started .
In the US , the household sector had stopped saving out of current income throughout the 1990s .
In 1990 , the saving rate was nine percent ; then it went to zero .
Now , the savings rate will have to go up .
The household sector will realize that savings out of illusory asset price gains , like stocks and real estate , are not permanent ; and therefore , if we want to have money for retirement , we have to save money from current income .
And that has , of course , a negative short - term impact on the economy .
Q : Marc , I ’d like to ask you now a few investment questions .
I assume that your investment philosophy flows directly from your economic point of view .
If you were a US - based investor with a five - year investment horizon , how would you allocate your assets now , and might you make a change with them in a year or two ?
MF :
It would depend obviously on the cash flow of that particular investor , his risk profile , if he has real estate or a pension account , or is he well - insured and this and that ; so there are many different factors to consider .
Q : Let ’s assume he owns his own home , he ’s not overly leveraged , and he has a job .
MF : In general , I do n’t like stocks .
The Japanese market , as an example , is at the same level it was in 1981 .
So it ’s 30 years behind .
If the US just went down to the level of 1990 , the S&P would be at 300 .
It indicates that the Asian markets are at either 20 year lows or 30 year lows .
The dividend yields on Asian stock markets is about three times the bond yields in those countries .
Relative to the US , Asia is quite inexpensive .
So I think that , yes , emerging economies will be a place to look , and I would allocate probably now , ten to 20 percent into emerging economies .
Also , the commodities have totally imploded .
The shares of mining companies and exploration companies and resource producers have also totally collapsed .
Since November 21st , however , some stocks like Freeport - McMoran and Newmont have roughly doubled in price .
They ’re not quite as attractive as they were two months ago .
And I would still own some gold , say ten percent in gold .
Q : Now , would that be in physical gold , or would that be in an ETF , or individual mining companies ?
MF :
The mining companies are cheaper than physical gold , but the mining industry has its own set of problems .
I would own physical just as insurance , because we cannot trust central bankers anymore — every person has to be his own central bank .
I have a negative view of the US dollar in the long run , as I expect a revival of inflation .
To some extent , I think real estate will protect you ; in particular , I would prefer to have real estate in the countryside , rather than in the city .
Q : Would you consider , as a US investor , real estate overseas ?
I know there are some REITs in Singapore and in Australia that have a terrific yield .
MF : Yes , these yields will come down because they will have to cut the dividends .
But say in Singapore you have REITs that yield 15 percent .
So even if they cut the dividend , I think they will still be good , because the bond yield in Singapore is less than two percent .
Even at five percent yield , in what I would consider a very solid currency in a very solid country , REITs would still be attractive .
Singapore is probably the richest country in the world , everything considered .
Q : Global equities ten to 20 .
So that adds up , if you figure about 20 percent for resource stocks , to about half of the portfolio .
Would you have the rest of your money in cash ?
MF : Yes , in cash .
Q : Which currencies ?
MF : Well , in the short term , I think the US dollar is okay .
But obviously at some point it wo n’t be okay .
But right now , I do n’t see how the US dollar will totally implode .
Q : Do you prefer the Asian markets in general over the US markets .
MF : I ought to have mentioned this before : in Asia the valuations are more compelling , because the markets are back to 20 year lows or 30 year lows , and because the dividend yield is three times the bond yield .
We have in Asia a lot of companies that serve the domestic markets .
They produce cigarettes or beer or food .
They ’re not going to be affected that badly by the global slump .
The valuation of the stocks may be affected , because obviously there is liquidation ; but I think that their fundamentals are sound , and that they ’ll survive under any environment ; and that you will make money , and in the meantime , you ’re receiving the high dividends .
Q : In general , would you say that dividends in Asian companies are more sustainable than yields with US companies ?
MF : As I said about the Asian REITs , they will probably have to cut the dividends .
But if you produce , say , food in Thailand , I do n’t see that the global recession would have a huge impact on food sales in Thailand .
It would have some impact , but not huge ; so these dividends are relatively safe in many cases .
Q : In terms of commodities , do you prefer any sector over another ?
Agriculture or energy or metals or …
MF : Well , I think that oil is now again at a relatively low level and I would probably play the oil market by buying oil exploration companies .
And I think agricultural commodities have come down a lot again , and maybe there are some opportunities there .
But as I said , I ’m not an expert on each commodity .
I think sugar is quite attractive at this level .
The problem is for the individual to play the commodity markets if he does n’t have a commodity - trading account and he ca n’t buy and sell , he gets stuck because he has to stay the course .
And so for individuals the best way to play commodities is to buy a good mining company , a good oil company , or a good exploration company , or just physical gold .
I do n’t believe that individuals are very successful at investing in commodities and commodity - related structure products .
Q : Okay , Marc , I think this would wrap it up , but I ’d like to ask you one question .
If you had to leave one message with our readers to take away from all this , what would that be ?
What would be the big takeaway for them ?
MF : We live now in an environment of very , very high volatility , because on the one hand you have the private sector that has tightened lending conditions , and wealth has been destroyed , and households will save more and be more prudent financially than they ’ve been ; in other words , credit or liquidity is tightening .
Then on the other hand you have these clowns in government that think that they can solve any problem .
As Mr. Geithner said recently , “ we know how to fix the problems . ”
Well if he knew so well how to fix the problems , why did he let the problems happen in the first place ?
He was the New York Fed Chairman when the conditions were created !
And Mr. Bernanke was the Fed Chairman since , I think , 2005 , and he was the architect of this ultra-expansionary monetary policy .
They have no credibility at all , and in my opinion they ’re going to make matters worse .
And the worse the economic conditions will become , the more Mr. Bernanke will throw money at the system ; and that will lead to huge volatility in the market .
You can have rebounds in individual stocks , and in whole markets , of 30 percent in one month , then they can drop 20 percent in a month ; do n’t forget , between November and the end of the December , the 30 - year Treasury ran at 20 percent ; and from its peak at the end of December it dropped 20 percent .
There is huge volatility and the same will happen in equities .
And that ’s why I think it ’s very difficult to make long - term predictions .
When you have a perfect free - market , it ’s difficult to predict the future .
But when you have a market that is disturbed by government manipulations and money - printing , it ’s impossible to make any predictions .
Q : Well said .

The Best of Peter Schiff
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents ' long - forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head .
Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself .
Sheriff 's detectives in Pinellas County , Florida , near St. Petersburg , say the boy found the .25 - caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home .
" They are dealing with this very tragic situation , and at this point , no charges have been filed , " said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff 's office .
His stepfather found Jacob Larson , 12 , with a gunshot wound to the head Friday .
The stepfather called 911 .
Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m. , when his mother , Tracy Newman , leaves for work , and about 11 a.m. , when his stepfather , Joseph Newton , returns home .
The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m .
" A few years ago , they moved , and [ the gun ] was stored in the closet .
The mother never checked it , never fired it , " Barreda said .
" They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet .
Both her and her husband forgot about it , " she said .
Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer .
Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident .
The sheriff 's office says it 's unlikely that they will face charges .
Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it .
Prosecutors do have some discretion , and depending on what happens with the gun , charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe - storage laws .
Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed , an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down .
" Sometimes , the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge , " he said .
The CDC says three children per day , on average , died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005 , the last year data are available .
Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner .
But , he says , there are cases where accidents happen , not crimes .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm , so people have to be aware .
" It 's a horrible thing , and those parents will blame themselves from here out , and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end , " Bartlett said .

I wanted to highlight this press release , instead of just putting it in News Picks , to make sure you see it and understand the significance of it .
It 's a press release from Open Invention Network , the Linux Defenders 911 folks , and they announced today that TomTom is now a licensee .
That means it comes under the protection of OIN , it makes all its patents available royalty - free to anyone else in the OIN network or who agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux System : OIN has accumulated more than 275 strategic , worldwide patents and patent applications .
These patents are available to all licensees as part of the patent portfolio that OIN is creating around , and in support of Linux .
I 'd say the Microsoft / TomTom battle just got bigger , and TomTom is in a stronger position than it was , although TomTom itself has a number of patents of its own , including reportedly a number it purchased in 2007 for just such a moment as this , according to GPS :
Over the years TomTom has built up a strong IP portfolio of navigation patents both through acquisitions and its own research activity .
Because TomTom came rather late to the navigation space , when it started facing lawsuits ( against Garmin ) the Dutch company was in need of early , broad patents for cross licensing situations .
Some of these were bought from Horizon navigation in June 2007 for $ 29 million .
Within the patent set named in this litigation two were bought from Visteon and the two others from Horizon Navigation .
That article opines that this will all end in a settlement , but I doubt it , since the GPL makes it impossible to pay any royalties for patents on GPL 'd code .
That does n't mean no resolution is possible , as Red Hat showed the way to do that without violating the GPL .
I doubt that Microsoft would be willing to do a deal like that , though , since it would make its FAT patents and all the rest it is aiming at TomTom available to one and all ( in the Linux world ) forever more royalty - free .
Remember to report any prior art on the FAT patents to Linux Defenders 911 .

Tensions between the Metropolitan police and London 's mayor , Boris Johnson , flared yesterday after a day of turmoil saw the country 's leading anti-terrorist officer resign following a security blunder .
The departure of Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick was announced by Johnson on Radio 4 , pre-empting a public statement from Scotland Yard and angering both the Met and the home secretary , Jacqui Smith .
Johnson 's decision to go further and release details of Quick 's replacement - John Yates - before Scotland Yard was able to put out its official statement is understood to have infuriated senior Met figures , and could have had serious security implications .
It is the first time since Sir Paul Stephenson took over as commissioner , appointed by Johnson , that the mayor 's behaviour has so obviously clashed with Scotland Yard , and it confirmed the concerns of many within the police force that Johnson believes he is running the organisation .
Johnson 's official spokesman , however , denied any spat between the commissioner and the mayor , saying both had spoken after the radio broadcast .
Sources indicated the home secretary was irritated by Johnson 's behaviour in announcing the appointment of a national lead on counterterrorism .
The dispute puts the spotlight on the uneasy tripartite relationship between a Tory mayor , a Labour home secretary and a police commissioner appointed by them both .
Within Scotland Yard , the departure of another senior officer was met with weary resignation .
Sir Ian Blair ; Andy Hayman , the former head of counter - terrorism ; his deputy , Peter Clarke ; Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur ; and before him Deputy Assistant Commissioner Brian Paddick - all have departed in the last few years .
Stephenson has been left with a depleted top team at a time when the force faces serious challenges , not least over the alleged use of violent tactics at the G20 protests last week , but also the serious failings identified in rape investigations dating back several years .
Yates , whose reputation as a safe pair of hands and a savvy politician is likely to have made him the only candidate for the role of counterterrorism lead , takes over with immediate effect .
His previous role , heading the specialist crime directorate , where experienced detectives investigate homicide , serious and organised crime , child abuse and now rape , will be taken by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Janet Williams , a former head of special branch and one of the Met 's two most senior women officers .
Quick formally tendered his resignation to the Metropolitan Police Authority yesterday morning after carrying clearly visible top - secret security documents about an imminent anti-terror raid in view of photographers outside Downing Street .
Because of his blunder , anti-terror raids in Manchester , Liverpool and Clitheroe , Lancashire , had to be brought forward by several hours , and according to senior sources were " compromised " .
At 7.30 am yesterday , Johnson was told of his decision .
According to his official spokesman he had a conversation with Stephenson , and with his own aides , and went on air 40 minutes later to make the announcement .
His spokesman said Stephenson was concerned that there should be no gap between announcing the departure of Quick and the appointment of a new counterterrorism lead , and therefore Johnson made the announcement about the appointment of Yates .
Quick resigned after the home secretary withdrew her support on Wednesday following his mistake .
Stephenson is understood to have made clear to Johnson that Quick 's position was untenable , leading to his resignation .
Yesterday morning the Yard was about to make the announcement of Quick 's departure , when Johnson appeared on Radio 4 's Today programme to do it for them .
Smith had wanted the police to announce his departure after discussing Quick 's position , and was said to be angry that Johnson had made the announcement while the anti-terror raids were still going on .
Stephenson made no comment on the tensions yesterday .
He released a statement saying Quick had been a " tremendous police officer " , " a friend and colleague " who had accepted he had made " a serious error " .
Quick spoke to friends on Wednesday night before his resignation .
In his statement , he said : " My action could have compromised a major counterterrorism operation .
I deeply regret the disruption caused to colleagues undertaking the operation and remain grateful for the way in which they adapted quickly and professionally to a revised timescale . "
Caught on camera
Bob Quick is not the first to be caught out by the long lens of the press :
• Last year , housing minister Caroline Flint was photographed on her way to brief cabinet colleagues on plunging property prices .
Her briefing document was in a clear folder , showing , as the photographs revealed , that the housing market was expected to drop by at least 5 % to 10 % , but " we ca n't tell how bad it will get "
• George Bush was caught out when a Reuters snapper spied him writing an important note to Condoleezza Rice : " I think I may need a bathroom break ?
Is this possible ? "
• Hazel Blears once unwittingly revealed a printed email disclosing the BBC 's hopes for making Gordon Brown the star of a new reality show , Junior PM
• In 2003 , at the height of the storm over the " sexed - up " Iraq dossier , Tony Blair was pictured with his briefing notes , ready for PMQs .
The green tags revealed which subjects were on his mind .
One stood out - Gilligan
It was quite a dog - and - pony show , Wednesday 's CCIA Washington caucus event , with a boatload of politicians laying out their legislative agendas for a roundtable of computer , cable , and telecom industry executives .
Mostly Democrats they were , including Pete Stark ( D - CA ) and Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) .
The latter knocked off some pretty good one liners :
" Somehow in my first two years in the Senate , [ majority leader ] Harry Reid placed me on the Oceans ' subcommittee , " Klobuchar complained .
" I 'm from Minnesota .
It was n't my first choice .
It was like being from Illinois and placed on Ethics . "
But seriously folks , Congressmember Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) was more specific about his plans , especially proposed legislation that would require commercial websites to disclose what they do with the information they collect from visitors .
Boucher chairs the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Technology and the Internet .
He told CCIA that the law he 's cooking up would require big sites to provide consumers " a complete description " of how information gleaned from them is used .
" Is it used by the website internally for what we call a First Party advertising operation ? "
Boucher asked out loud .
" Are there ever circumstances in which that information is conveyed to other parties ?
And if so , what are those circumstances ?
If the site used its customer data for first - party purposes ( i.e. , the site itself advertising to its own customers ) , it would have to offer consumers an opt - out option .
" The default position would be that the first - party marketing transaction could occur , " Boucher elaborated .
" It would only be prevented if the affirmative step was taken to say , ' no , you can't do that . ' "
But if the customer information is going to be sent to " some completely unrelated party , " Boucher added , " not associated with the first - party transaction , that would fall under opt-in , and that information could then be shared with the other party only if the customer affirmatively took the step of saying ' yes you can share it . ' "
The Representative says he 's working with prominent Energy and Commerce Republicans to get a draft of this concept up for committee consideration .
The collaborators include Cliff Stearns ( R- FL ) and Joe Barton ( R - TX ) .
The law should foster a " greater sense of confidence " in privacy which should , in turn , encourage " greater willingness to engage in electronic commerce , " Boucher predicted .
Following his remarks , we wandered about the conference asking for industry feedback on the plan .
Almost everybody opted - out of talking on the record .
Nice idea in theory , they mostly said , but we 've got to see the proposal in legislative print .
Mr Stevens first entered the US Senate in 1968
Alaska Senator Ted Stevens 's conviction for corruption should be overturned , officials from the US justice department have requested .
Mistakes made by prosecutors during his trial render the conviction invalid , the officials said .
In October 2008 , a jury found Mr Stevens , a Republican , guilty of lying about gifts and free home renovations he received from an oil company .
Mr Stevens went on to lose his Senate re-election battle the following month .
He was the longest - serving Republican senator , having first entered the chamber in 1968 .
' Cloud removed '
Prosecutors made a number of errors during the trial , officials said , the chief among which was the failure to make available notes of a crucial interview in which a witness made a statement that contradicted evidence he gave later under oath .
The prosecutors who made the error have been removed from the case and placed under investigation .
A judge will hear the justice department 's request on Tuesday , and is expected to grant the motion to overturn Mr Stevens 's conviction .
" I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed , " Mr Stevens said in a statement .
" That day has finally come .
It is unfortunate that an election was affected by proceedings now recognised as unfair . "
The BBC's Jon Donnison in Washington says the high profile case clearly led to Mr Stevens losing his seat and gave the Democrats an important addition to its ranks in the US Senate .
But President Obama 's new Attorney General Eric Holder is sending a message that Justice Department prosecutors must operate within the law , our correspondent adds .

Fixing Have Your Say update
Your e-mails broadly supportive of the plans :
As soon as it is possible in this part of the country I will be signing up - nothing to hide and practical for travel in Europe !
After all a great number , if not all , of other EU countries have these .
Steve , Braintree I would get an ID card tomorrow if it was available to me .
I do n't have a passport or driving licence and the only ID I have at the moment is my NHS card .
Being ex-Royal Air Force
I used to have to carry an ID Card every day and it was very handy at times .
My only concern is the cost , being on benefits at present £ 30 is nearly half of my weekly income and out of my reach at present .
Dave Fulton , Barry , Vale of Glamorgan I would reluctantly if I lived in Manchester , but only cos I 'm spending a year in Germany and do n't want to have to carry my passport around with me everywhere .
Alex Wright , Birmingham , England I have travelled extensively throughout Europe and in most countries an ID card is compulsory and no - one minds carrying one .
Those who are against ID cards generally have something to hide , do n't want to carry something that can prove who they really are or simply oppose anything that gives security to the vast majority of law abiding citizens .
Brian , Sandhurst I lived in Brussels between 2000 and 2002 and had to have one when I was there .
I see no problem why we should n't all have to have them in the UK .
Kevin Farren , Callander , Scotland
And why not ?
I think that everyone living and working in the UK should carry the new ID Card , if you have nothing to hide then why would n't you carry one ?
Sue , Cardiff
Yes , I have no problems with the introduction of an ID card , but I am an honest man with little to hide from .
I also believe those that have a problem with it , is because they want to hide from society .
Len Gilbank , Eastbourne I certainly will .
I believe it is a necessity to have one .
Not everyone has a driving license or a passport so how are they to identify themselves .
I believe those who do n't want an ID card or are paranoid about it have something to hide or are planning to have something to hide .
Tony Caban , UK I am all for ID cards so long as they do n't have to be carried all the time .
If they are used for providing proof of identity and proof of age where this is necessary ( claiming benefits , withdrawing money from a bank , buying cigarettes and alcohol etc ) I do n't see what the problem is .
Jim , UK I 've read quite a few comments on here , and i think alot of people are simply just scared .
The fact is our government can already find out everything about you without an ID card .
Imagine replacing Chip and Pin with ID +
Bio verification .
While that would not be around for the near future , and nor would it be unbreakable .
To me this is something we need to do , and need to do right .
Jim , Winchester I will certainly sign up for an ID card .
Like many others in these comments who have lived abroad and had an ID card , I had no problem with it and found it very useful .
In addition , its £ 30 and lets you travel in Europe - that 's a lot cheaper than a replacement passport at £ 72 !
The information held is just the same as what is held for the passport today which is pretty basic .
Donal , Manchester I used to carry one in the Royal Navy , so have no objections to carrying one now .
I do however object to having to pay for it .
Issuing through shops etc is just another one of these privatisation schemes to allow certain groups to make a small fortune .
All of the data should be kept in purely Government hands and made available to the public on request at no cost to them .
Will these cards be secure ?
I doubt it .
Martin W Prior , Poole , Dorset I have no problems with it whatsoever .
I actually think they are long overdue .
If you have nothing to hide , then why not have I.D. cards .
D.Summerfield , Shrewsbury I have no objection to an ID card .
Combating terrorism sounds extremely unlikely .
But I 'd like a proper ID card - one that be " bound " to other data services so I could use it to logon to work computers ; ID myself for signing e-mail ; access my bank ; prove I have a driving licence ; insurance ; act as a CRB reference for working with children ; supply my health records to a hospital etc. etc i.e. one ID card not just another one .
Ian Cunningham , Westbury , UK I think that these ID cards are an very good idea , I would be willing to get one however I think the price is too high for the current economic times
Robert Jones , Beverley Other Europeans have them so why should n't we ?
Yes as someone said , we have and paid for passports , but they 're too big to carry around whereas ID cards are much smaller and easier to carry just like a credit card .
If you have a driving licence then I agree you do n't really need an ID card but I personally still will have one .

If you 're one of the members of public that thinks compulsory ID cards are a bad idea , then you usually have a reason for that , like you 're a criminal and you have something to hide .
I and many other people back this idea as it will also make it a lot easier for the police to do their job , as it would mean it would be harder for people to lie about their personality .
Samuel Baker , Epsom , Surrey I have nothing against the principal but can't see the point of all this when we already have other forms of perfectly good ID .
I think the only people which will benefit from this will be the firms making the cards .
Alex , London Return to top
Your e-mails criticising the planned introduction of ID cards : I 'm only against ID cards on two counts - security , which this government is currently useless at and cost .
At a time when we 're supposed to be ' tightening out collective belts ' why is the government squandering billions on something that will have no effect on fraud or terrorism ?
Duncan , Stirling I have been brought up where it is possible ( not compulsory ) to have an ID card .
To me it represented a useless piece of ID since I own a passport .
Also , the ID cards we had did not carry any biometric information , and it should stay that way .
ID can be lost / stolen hence I prefer to keep my passport at home unless I plan on doing something that requires ID .
Does that make me a criminal ?
I do n't think so .
PG , London
This government , and our current bunch of inept civil servants , have demonstrated time and time again that they cannot be trusted to store our data securely .
ID cards will not reduce terrorism .
The current level of fraud is far more preferable to the damage massive ID theft could do following a security breach in a National ID database .
John Robson , Solihull
While I can see the pros and cons of the ID cards , one thing that occurred to me - what happens to those who simply cannot afford the card ( i.e. those on benefit / pensions ) ??
This could lead to an underclass of " no- bodies " who will not be able to obtain any services ( getting money from the bank , seeing the doctor , getting benefits etc. ) , which will ONLY be available on showing your ID ( it will come .....)
David J , Leeds , UK
It 's the database that lies behind ID cards that I object to .
Why does any government need a centralised database with 49 pieces of my personal information on it ?
Why should I trust them with it ?
Who will they make it available to ?
And how useful will it be while it 's not compulsory ?
Jacqui Smith has yet to persuade me of a single benefit of giving up my privacy to the state .
Michelle Graham , Birmingham , UK I was born in France and ID cards are allegedly voluntary there .
However , if you are not able to produce one on the spot you can be taken and held in custody for 48 hours .
And of course I do n't mind having to feel paranoid walking to the corner shop making sure I have my ID card on me .
At least would be safe in the knowledge criminals would never ever dare to create fake ones .
Anthony , London , UK I can't remember the last time I was asked to prove who I was so why should I pay for something I do n't need .
I have lots of alternative methods to prove who I am .
Brendan , Knebworth I will not be applying for an ID card .
I remain unconvinced with HMG 's case , particularly as they have a proven track record of hopelessly budgeting costs which turn out to be many times original and revised estimates .
Andrew Mcdermott , Lymm , Cheshire
On one hand I have nothing to hide but on the other hand I already have a passport , driving licence and about 100 other forms of ID so why would I need another card ?
I would also be concerned about the security of information as we know this government is prone to exposing confidential information in front of the TV cameras or leaving it lying on trains .
Mandy , Bath I already have 3 forms of government ID - my passport , birth certificate and driving licence .
I do not want to own another one .
The government can already find out pretty much everything about me that it wants to , so why do I need an ID card ?
Most of my travel is outside the EU , so the travel benefits do n't affect me as I 'll need a passport anyway .
Exactly where is the benefit to me ?
K.E. , Leeds
Really do n't see why anyone would willingly pay for these when they do n't have to .
What benefits does it bring ?
Anyone could just get a provisional driving license which does exactly the same thing only it has a use , whether you actually end up driving or not .
Heather , Nottingham I 'm sorry but I just do n't understand the logic behind this ID card scheme , what extra security does it give us that a passport or driving license does n't ?
Unless it is meant to replaced all other ID 's such as Passports / driving licenses ( which would be a benefit I guess ) I just can't see the point .
S Wallace , Essex , UK Firstly , I have nothing to hide and I am not a terrorist so why do I need an ID card ?
Secondly , I give my details and personal information to whom I choose not because I am ordered to do so by an authoritarian Government .
When it becomes compulsory I will break the law because I wo n't be having one .
James , Essex Absolutely not .
Gathering information about every person into a single database ( and it 's the database which is the real issue , not the card itself ) means putting a tool of totalitarianism into the hands of the state ; never a sensible move .
We are told it will never be used in such a way , but , even assuming for a second that I trust the current government as far as I could throw the Statue of Liberty , they 're not going to be in power forever , and should an even more corrupt bunch take office we 'll have no protection from them because we 'll already have handed them all the tools they need .
Adrian Ogden , Reading I will not have a ID card for as long as it is legal to do so .
I think the whole scheme is just a complete waste of money and an inpingement upon my privacy and human rights .
This government has shown itself to be out of touch with the public and this is another example of them trying to impose unworkable top down solutions to things that are not broken .
David Vincent , London Return to top
It is not the ID card that is the risk ; it is the database behind it .
Government databases have been shown to leak like sieves .
It would be as sensible for me to post all my personal details on HYS as to trust the government to keep them safe all in one convenient place .
The idea is a really stupid waste of money invented by a set of dangerous control freaks .
David , Wantage UK
I will never want an ID card which holds data , or where a database can hold such data .
It is not necessary .
If you have an Oyster card for London Transport , they know your name , address and travel patterns .
It is not necessarily the government alone that we have to worry about holding our data , but when they lose it or have it stolen .
We do not need all of this data being held in one place .
We should not permit this .
David , Nottingham I have nothing to fear from an ID card but even so I have no intention of applying for one as I see little benefit .
More to the point , the Government needs to wake up to the fact that irrespective of their case for ID cards ( which is not proven in any case ) the country simply can't afford them at the moment .
Seffrid , Hampshire No. ID cards are part of a much larger picture , RFID chips injected under the skin will be next !
You think I am joking ?
Do your research and learn the truth .
Do not place your trust in the government or the media , they do not work in the peoples ' best interests .
Spencer Dascombe , Milton Keynes
It seems to me like Jacqui Smith read 1984 by George Orwell and thought " Thats a ruddy good idea " .
The idea of the government being able to keep tabs on me , when I have n't done anything wrong is repulsive .
On top of the potential for abuse , comes the very real possibility that they could be exploited by criminals to gather information about me and use that information to rob me or worse .
Alongside this I think it is a huge invasion of Human rights to force people to carry an item that details their lives and is both insensitive and ridiculously controlling .
I do not want to live in a society where I have to fear the government , yet this scheme is the first step along the road to an authoritarian , dictatorship .
No , I will not be using an ID card and never will until it becomes a compulsary item , at which point I may well leave the country .

There is no way that I will be paying for an ID card out of principle when there is no guarantee that the government wo n't just go and lose the data as they manage to do with everything else .
I also entirely object to paying £ 60 to receive absolutely nothing in return .
If Labour want it , the Labour Party will pay .
Oh , I forgot , they can't as all the unions are deserting them under the " leadership " of Brown !
Chris , Exeter
We already have ID cards - they 're called passports .
As far as I can see from the plans , the ID cards will just duplicate our existing passports thus giving more opportunities for fraud whilst providing no additional benefits .
Jo Wiltshire , London , UK With some trepidation I started to read people 's thoughts about the Manchester pilot scheme .
It did n't take me long to realise my fears were totally misplaced .
The vast majority of comments are against this wretched ID card .
Thank goodness for common sense ; a pity the government is deaf and blind to our feelings .
I told my MP , Alan Milburn , about my objections to ID cards ages ago .
I then received a large and very glossy booklet from a Government department that did absolutely nothing at all to make me change my mind .
In this column of responses , only one person has mentioned George Orwell 's book " 1984 " .
Read it , everyone , read it !
If you have n't already done so , that is .
Ken Hill , Darlington , UK Return to top
They are a complete waste of money , will do nothing to fight crime or terrorism .
They will however create a new industry - that of providing fake cards .
They will be popular with some forms of criminal .
Terrorists , however , will carry on with genuine IDs , like the terrorists in 9/11 in the USA or 7/7 in London !
As an IT professional , I will avoid them .
If I am eventually compelled to have one , I hope I will be able to keep it locked up at home to stop it being stolen or damaged ...
Scott , UK
The whole scheme is a gross infrimgement of our civil liberties .
The data provided will not do anything to prevent fraud , terrorism or crime .
A small card will not stop a determined criminal or terrorist .
There is also a clear cost implication , I wonder how many people would be willing to pay £ 200 each for something that is of no real value to anyone .
Ian , Sheffield , UK In a word No. Government agencies have proved time and time again that they are incapable of keeping sensitive data safe .
It will only be a matter of time before you hear of people 's ID cards being cloned and the consequences will be a lot worse than your bank account being cleared out .
Nicole , Chatham I simply cannot believe that the public is expected to entrust its personal data to high street retailers - what next ?
Letting Tescos take our biometric readings at the checkouts ..??
Absolutely ludicrous ..!
Where are we supposed to make use of ID cards if we already have passports ..?
I can not see any benefit or point in the scheme at all .
Graeme Burslem , Ipswich , Suffolk
To say that you have nothing to fear from ID cards if you have done nothing wrong is horrendous .
I was born in the UK .
I am a UK citizen .
I have never committed a crime .
I do not posess a passport because I choose not to travel abroad .
If I did not drive I would not have a driving licence .
Is the government saying I would not therefore have a right to exist peacefully and legally in my own country if I wo n't have an ID card therefore making me a criminal by default ? >

Four buddies set off across the country in an R.V. , video camera in tow , to knock items off their “ 100 things to do before I die ” list : kiss the Stanley Cup , get a tattoo , grow a mustache .
With plenty of high jinks and adolescent humor , “ The Buried Life ” seems like the perfect MTV reality show , except for one unexpected twist .
At each stop the group helps deserving locals with their own wishes .
In Idaho , for example , they took eight children with brain cancer on a shopping spree at Toys “ R ” Us .

After years of celebrating wealth , celebrity and the vapid excesses of youth , MTV is trying to gloss its escapist entertainment with a veneer of positive social messages .
Last fall , after the financial crisis erupted but before the presidential election , MTV executives gathered in New York for meetings to discuss the direction of the network and whether programs like “ The Hills , ” which chronicles the lives of the young and rich in Los Angeles , and “ My Super Sweet 16 , ” a weekly visit to over - the - top coming - out parties , had trapped MTV in a decadent age that was passing .
The Perfect Desktop - Ubuntu Studio 9.04

As you might have noticed , a few applications are redundant , for example there are two CD / DVD burning applications in my list ( Brasero , K3B ) .
If you know which one you like best , you obviously do n't need to install the other applications , however if you like choice , then of course you can install both .
The same goes for music players like Amarok , Banshee , Rhythmbox , XMMS or browsers ( Firefox , Opera ) .

2 Installing The Base System
The installation of the base system is easy as 1 - 2 - 3 because the Ubuntu Studio installer does n't offer a lot of options to choose from , so you can not go wrong .
Download the Ubuntu Studio iso image from http://ubuntustudio.org/downloads, burn it onto a DVD , and boot your computer from it .
Select your language :
Then select Install Ubuntu Studio :
Choose your language again ( ? ) :
Then select your location :
Choose a keyboard layout ( you will be asked to press a few keys , and the installer will try to detect your keyboard layout based on the keys you pressed ) : Advertisement Advertisement
The installer checks the installation CD , your hardware , and configures the network with DHCP if there is a DHCP server in the network :
You can accept the default hostname or specify your own one : Advertisement
Now you have to partition your hard disk .
For simplicity 's sake I will create one big partition ( with the mount point /) and a little swap partition so I select Guided - use entire disk ( of course , the partitioning is totally up to you - if you like , you can create more than just one big partition , and you can also use LVM ) :
Select the disk that you want to partition :
When you 're finished , hit Yes when you 're asked Write the changes to disks ? :
Afterwards , your new partitions are being created and formatted .
Hopsin Continues Hip - Hop Greatness At Ruthless Records !
Following in the footsteps of Eazy - E , Bone Thugs - N - Harmony and NWA emerges Ruthless Records ’ brightest new hip - hop artist HOPSIN – combining the true talent of crafting outspoken and controversial rap verses with a youthful and energetic lyrical flow .
Twenty - three year old , Marcus Hopson , known to the world as Hopsin because his flow is so sinful , grew up in Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley of California .
As a creative and self - proclaimed isolated individual , Hopsin spent his teenage years drawing , skate boarding , and writing rhymes while periodically leaping from clique to clique .
“ I ’ve always been in my own world , living as my own person , finding friends in different circles but not being confined to one group , ” says Hopsin .
At the age of 14 , Hopsin headed to Maryland for a year .
It was in this state that he began to grasp his flair for rapping .
“ I started rhyming to beats I had made on this video game I had , so when I got back to California , I bought a tape recorder and started recording freestyles and downloading instrumentals off the internet . ”
In some ways , Hopsin soon became a local Weird Al Yankovic , remaking popular songs with a sarcastic edge and playing them for his friends and growing fan base .
“ People were saying that my ( parodied ) songs were really good and I should make my own records , ” Hopsin recalls .
Open mic shows , internet showcasing , and perpetual recording and producing soon led to the growth of the Hopsin buzz .
“ It ’s the way hip - hop should be , ” Hopsin says with confidence when talking about his debut album Gazing at the Moonlight .
A combination of hip - hop narratives , irreverent edge and optimally self - produced beats , Gazing at the Moonlight could quite easily be considered hip - hop ’s premier audio book .
His lead single , “ Pans in the Kitchen ” carries a quintessential throwback party beat , with pots and pans embedded in the percussion arrangement .
And as if that were not enough , the title track “ Gazing at the Moonlight ” closes out the album with a dramatic organ introduction followed by intermingled rock and pop riffs that creates the ending to an ultimate masterpiece .
I came to read the latest in journalistic sensationalism the other day when I visited reddit.com .
The hot news of the day is the story run by the AP about the purity of tap water , and the existence of pharmaceuticals in said water .
The study , actually conducted by the AP , reviewed water quality reports put out by the EPA .
The AP managed to find quite a lot of different drugs in the documentation available on the EPA ’s web site , and brought them to light in a way that would make any news agency proud .
In the midst of all the shody journalism that does n’t even quote actual numbers for the quantity of pharmaceuticals found in the water , I found myself wondering “ If they did include numbers , what would they mean , in the context of the volume of tap water I drink in a day . ”
Some of you may recognize this as a hypothesis of sorts .
Well , here are my results …
I drink about three 20 oz glasses of water a day .
So lets immediately convert that to metric , so no one goes insane .
That is 1.774 L/day .
The molarity of pure water is 55.346 mol /L at 25 degrees C. A mole ( mol ) is a number invented to facilitate counting of molecules , and its value is 6.022*1023 .
That means I consume approximately 591.258*1023 molecules of water a day .
This number is obviously approximate , given that there are other compounds added to normal tap water which would affect the quality of this number .
For this study I am not going to worry about the molarity of actual drinking water , because the numbers probably wo n’t be straightforward since drinking water is not 100 % pure water , and because we are just looking for ballpark numbers .
The logical next step is to figure out how much of a drug I am consuming by drinking the quantity of water I do daily .
This number proves to be much harder to find , because in the entire article , the quantity of different drugs found was NOT MENTIONED .
At this point , alarm bells should be going off in your head .
I decided to hunt down the information myself , so I focused this section of the article :
Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed a Passaic Valley Water Commission drinking water treatment plant , which serves 850,000 people in Northern New Jersey , and found a metabolized angina medicine and the mood - stabilizing Carbamazepine in drinking water .
I went to the Passaic Valley Water Commission website to see what I could find in terms of a water quality report , and immediatly discovered the 2006 water quality report in PDF .
I specifically looked for any chemical that a journalist might think is Carbamazepine , and of course there are n’t any in the PDF .
At this point , I am a little stumped , because the news report states the data is recent , but it does not appear available to the public .
It does seem to suggest that the water quality report given to the public and the report given to the EPA are different .
Not quite the level playing field I was hoping for .
At this point , I need to find a number that I can respect as possibly being representative of a good number for the quantity of Carbamazepine in the water .
Looking through the water quality report , I noticed Chromium is in there .
Chromium is a byproduct of steel and pulp mills , and also occurs naturally in the ground , AND is used in a dietary supplement in the form of Chromium ( III ) picolinate .
In reality , there are 3 sources of this contaminate , as opposed to our Carbamazepine ’s 1 method of introduction , that being from human ingestion and excretion .
In theory , it is probably more abundant in our water supply than Carbamazepine , but it will work for this “ study ” .
In the most current document available from the PVWC , the quantity detected in the drinking water is .001 parts per billion in 2006 at the Newark plant only .
So lets do the math :
Above I calculated the number of molecules of water I intake to be 591.258*1023 molecules per day .
I need to figure out how many molecules per day I consume of Chromium , to figure out whether I need to run screaming into the hills with my tinfoil hat firmly equipped .
The calculation should be 591.258 x 1023 * ( .001/1,000,000,000 ) that gives me 59,125,800,000,000 molecules of Chromium per day .
That works out to be 9.81 x 10 - 11 moles of Chromium .
Therefor , the amount of Chromium I consume in a day is 9.81×10 - 11 moles * 51.9961 g·mol which is 5.1 x 10 - 9 grams per day .
Written in a form that is a little easier to understand , my intake would be .0000000051 grams of Chromium .
Now , if we go back to the idea that Carbamazepine in the drinking water supply exists in similar concentrations to Chromium , which is most likely an overstatement to begin with , then it is easy to see why these reports are nothing but stories to scare people and get them all riled up .
Tegretol , one of the drugs based on Carbamazepine , comes in 100mg and 200 mg normal release and 400 mg extended release form .
Now , to write that out in decimal comparison , that would be 0.1 gram , 0.2 grams , and 0.4 grams .
The math shows that the amount ingested daily is 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the clinically approved effective dose .
I think that if you are comfortable with the assumption that the amount of Chromium in drinking water is similar to the amount of Carbamazepine , then you should have nothing to worry about .
As a final note , the bioavailability of Carbamazepine is 80 % , which means that 20 % of the drug is simply excreted without being synthesized .
This means that , theoretically , an additional 20 % of the .0000000051 grams of Carbamazepine is essentially non-effective in the event you actually consume it .
As you can see by the numbers and by a very specific assumption , there really is not anything to worry about .
Our drinking water in the US is very clean , and the concentrations of chemicals that are not water are so low that our bodies will easily filter them out , and are not present in high enough doses to warrant the fear and unrest that the Associated Press tried to stir up with their article .
Additionally , this math is not hard to do .
If someone tracks down a report detailing the level of Carbamazepine in the drinking water as quoted by the AP , I would love to see it , because I would then happily perform calculations on the real numbers , just for my own interest , and for my readers sake .
For now though , I will be enjoying a nice glass of Colorado tap water .

I do n’t know much about porn , people always laugh at me because I am a pervert but whenever they drop porn names , I am always at a loss , because I am more into amateur shit , you know like seeing some college slut sucking off her ex boyfriend before cheating on him and forcing him to share the shit with the world to jerk off to kind of shit , but I know that porn is a big deal , I know that people fall in love with these girls who are generally plastic and disgusting , like raped strippers with a meth addiction , but every once in a while , girls like Bree Olson and Kayden Kross come out of the industry , and who are hot and seem to be havin ’ fun with the whole porn thing , and do n’t seem like battered , victims of abuse , trying to make ends meet .
This is a video of them having a marshmallow eating competition , I ’m sure it ’s not the first time they fill their mouths up together , but probably the first time no vaginainvolved , because these girls always dyke out together , but it ’s a weird video , weird concept , I ’m gonna post the shit because seeing girls spit shit up is hot to me , especially when I have to watch my wife swallow pretty much everything in sight , because she is fat .
Here is a video of her playing something called Fluffy Bunny , I ’ve never heard of …
Bree Olson and Kayden Kross in a Marshmallow Eating Contest of the Day

Yesterday I wondered if athletes see themselves as two separate entities ( the person and the player ) like the actors that Mike Leigh works with .
For actors to be able to differentiate between themselves and the characters they are playing while at the same time remain in character and spontaneous requires a sophisticated combination of skills and spirit .
Nelson , commenting on Wreck & Salvage , is a pro basketball player in the Netherlands :
I do have an on the court persona , without a doubt , that has been cultivated throughout the years , like a character , and it ’s extremely easy to slip into .
There are definitely times when I do n’t feel like playing / performing , but when the ball goes up a switch gets turned on .
We do watch a ton of video and analyze what we could do better , or what we ’ve done wrong .
I guess the point is , one runs on instinct , the other is a learned / cultivated behavior , and a great performance is a mixture of the two , which exists not as a duality , but combined in one person , expressed easily from a lifetime of dedication and practice .
A more extreme case involves Herschel Walker , who has been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder ( aka multiple personality disorder ) :
Walker and Mungadze believe the disorder actually helped Walker — who started for a number of NFL teams , including the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys — succeed on the gridiron .
Mungadze offered a theory about the subconscious logic in Walker ’s head .
“ Since people are laughing at you , we ’re going to make you so strong , so fast , so talented , that you ’re going to be above everyone .
And that is what went into building this super athlete . ”
Getting into character extends into other professions as well .
In Pulp Fiction , before they go into an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss , Jules tells Vincent to “ get into character ” after a conversation about foot massages .
In this Vogue profile of Melinda Gates , she describes her husband Bill ’s transformation when he went to work .
Lately , they have begun to edge into each other ’s territory .
“ I hope that one of the things about a great marriage is that you bring out the best in each other , ” she says .
“ Look , I dated Bill for a long time before we got married , and I knew where his heart was .
But I also knew that not many people saw it .
The wall would go up the minute he stepped into Microsoft .
Sometimes he would come into the foundation with the wall up .
I would even tease him about it .
He would be talking to me in the car , and by the time we got to the elevator I would be like , Whoa , where did he go ? ”
When my dad ran his own business back in the 70s / 80s , he deliberately cultivated a “ business voice ” that he used on the telephone , a voice that was quieter , deeper , calmer , and more serious than his regular voice .
The transformation when he got on the phone was pretty amazing .

Rolo shows no fear as she jumps through the hoop
Rolo - named after her favourite sweets - competes with sheepdogs to jump through hoops , walks on a lead and herds ducks at her Gwynedd home .
Owner Emlyn Roberts says
Rolo likes nothing more than watching football on TV after calling up for her food .
Rolo spent her first year with dogs Mr Roberts trains for agility contests .
Mr Roberts , a regular at Crufts , is convinced that Rolo is more intelligent than the average sheep , and that she picked up tricks from watching him train his sheepdogs .
She comes in dead on time every day and knocks the door with her head if I 've forgotten
Emlyn Roberts
A bond has forged between the owner and sheep after he rescued Rolo from a farm near Caernarfon last year .
" Everyone thought the lamb had died but I looked and was sure she had n't , " he said .
" I knew there was still some breath left in her so I suggested taking her home and looking after her . "
Mr Roberts said he was unsure how his dogs - among them quad bike riding sheepdog Nell - would react to her , but he said they were not at all bothered .
Rolo enjoys watching the television , especially football
" She comes to the house to be fed and to watch the television , " he added .
" She comes in dead on time every day and knocks the door with her head if I 've forgotten , " he added .
" She is growing up exactly like a dog .
You can tell she thinks of herself as a dog . "
Once her dinner is finished , Rolo will then sit with Mr Roberts as he watches the television and seems to especially enjoy ball games with plenty of action .
" She likes football , she sits with her ears pricked .
I think she 'll enjoy the World Cup , " he added .
Rolo will get the chance to show off her skills when she makes her debut at Sioe Ogwen in Bethesda at the weekend .
