Analyst slashes PS3 sales expectations following disappointing 2008 Both Wii and 360 estimates up , but " Sony has failed to establish the PS3 as the console of choice "
Matt Martin Friday 23rd January 2009
Share this article Share
Analyst firm Cowen and Company has reduced its sales expectations for the PlayStation 3 after disappointing sales of the console in 2008 .
The company now expects Sony will sell 4 million units in the US during 2009 , down 2.25 million from previous estimates of 6.25 million units .
Cowen does expect sales will pick up marginally in 2010 , with 4.5 million units sold in the region .
According to data from NPD , the PlayStation 3 sold 3.6 million units in the US during 2008 .
" Following another year in which PS3 unit sales lagged behind the Wii and Xbox 360 , it is now clear that Sony has failed to establish the PS3 as the console of choice among hardcore gamers this cycle , " wrote Doug Creutz in a note to investors .
" Although there appears to be a reasonably robust slate of games for the PlayStation 3 this year , Sony continues to lack a clear ' must - own ' title that will drive sales , while its platform continues to be the most expensive in the market in the midst of a consumer slowdown .
" Meanwhile , highly publicised platform initiatives such as Home have failed to get off the ground , " he added .
In contrast , Cowen has upped its sales expectations for Nintendo 's Wii , expecting the console to sell another two million units in 2009 and 2010 , to 8 million and 6 million units , respectively .
" Nintendo 's software line - up for the platform continues to provide gamers with a more compelling value proposition with new first party hits such as Wii Fit and Wii Music and older titles such as Wii Play continuing to sell extremely well .
" Nintendo also seems to have ironed out supply constraint kinks that held back sales in previous years , " noted Creutz .
Cowan also expects Microsoft's Xbox 360 will widen its lead over the PlayStation 3 this year , with 4.25 million units sold , although expectations for 2010 remain the same at 4 million units .
" Microsoft 's Xbox 360 seems to have entrenched itself as the best value proposition for hardcore gamers , " said Creutz .
" Additionally , with exclusive episodic content for Take - Two 's massive hit game GTA IV coming in 2009 , as well as additional Halo franchise releases this year , we believe that the Xbox 360 is likely to widen its sales lead over the PS3 in 2009 . "
Expectations for DS sales in the US have been adjusted upwards , to 7.5 million this year , and 6.5 million in 2010 , while PSP sales have been dropped slightly to 3.5 million units in 2009 , and 3.25 million in 2010 .
Ugandan men warned of ' booby trap ' Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008
Print This Email This KAMPALA ( AFP )  Uganda 's police warned male bar - goers to keep their noses clean after a probe found a gang of robbers had been using women with chloroform smeared on their chests to knock their victims unconscious .
" They apply this chemical to their chest .
We have found victims in an unconscious state , " Criminal Investigations Directorate ( CID ) spokesman Fred Enanga told AFP .
" You find the person stripped totally naked and everything is taken from him , " he said .
" And the victim does n't remember anything .
He just remembers being in the act of romancing . "
Enanga , who explained that several types of heavy sedatives had been used , said he first came across the practice last year when an apprehended thief named Juliana Mukasa made a clean breast of the matter .
" She is a very dangerous lady , " the official said .
While early investigations suggest that the gang may consist of dozens of members , the source of the sedatives remains unknown .
" We do n't know exactly how they get these materials , " Enanga added .
" That is something that our investigations must crack . "
He called on men , particularly travelling businessmen who tend to carry a lot of cash , to take caution .
" It 's a serious situation and people have to be aware . "

G4 TV Girls
( Fortune Magazine ) --
In today 's dire financial climate , what exactly should a CEO say when it 's time to hold that quarterly earnings call with analysts and the media ?
On the one hand , he could try refreshing candor and say , " Look , let 's be honest .
This sucker could go down . "
The problem with this approach is that it tends to ensure that the company will indeed go down - that afternoon .
The stock price will plummet , lenders will call in their loans , banks and customers will freeze the company out , credit agencies will downgrade it , and soon our commendably honest CEO will notice a half - dozen satellite television trucks - those modern - day vultures - double - parked outside the lobby .
Or there 's Plan B .
The executive could exude confidence and willfully paint a disingenuously rosy picture featuring lots of gilded lilies .
The problem with this tack is that , while it might get the company through a rough patch , the executive is certainly committing civil fraud , and if the company crashes and burns anyway , he may also go to prison .
It 's no defense for an executive who bends the truth to say that he did so only to prevent a run-on - the - bank - type situation , says one criminal - defense lawyer .
( The lawyer requests anonymity because in this climate , he notes , such an on - the - record statement might lose him some business opportunities . )
Even if the executive thinks that short - sellers are spreading lies about his company , he can't respond in kind .
If he does , this lawyer says , " he 's betting the farm .
He 's betting his life . "
Today 's crisis has placed under the forensic microscope scores of reassuring assertions made by CEOs and CFOs during earnings calls or " investor day " gatherings or breezy , on - camera flirtations with Maria Bartiromo that have proved , sometimes within hours , breathtakingly off the mark .
Were the officials honestly relying on flawed business models - or lying through their teeth ?
It 's not just the Securities and Exchange Commission , New York State attorney general Andrew Cuomo , and hordes of civil plaintiffs lawyers who want to find out .
According to understated disclosures in SEC filings or newspaper reports , federal criminal prosecutors in Manhattan , Brooklyn , Newark , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , and Alexandria , Va. , are all poring over e-mails and other records right now trying to answer that question in regard to high - level officers at such formerly blue - chip companies as Lehman Brothers , AIG , Washington Mutual , Countrywide Financial , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac .
To be clear , we 're not talking here about sensational , not conceivably legal , out - and - out Ponzi schemes , like the $ 50 billion one that former Nasdaq chairman Bernard L. Madoff has been arrested for , or brazen forgery and criminal impersonation , like the $ 100 million spree that glitzy New York litigator Marc S .
Dreier has been accused of .
Crimes like those typically have only one of two defenses : ( a) " It was n't me , " or ( b ) " Okay , it was me , but I was sleepwalking on Ambien at the time . "
This article is , rather , about an entirely different category of accusation .
The probes being discussed here concern statements that ultimately proved incorrect , but which reasonable , straight - faced people can , and vigorously do , contend were honest when made .
The level of fury surrounding these inquiries is of a different order from what we saw with , say , the backdating scandals or the Enron and WorldCom failures .
Today 's credit collapse has already vaporized about $ 9 trillion in investment capital , while ripping another trillion in assorted bailout money from the pockets of enraged taxpayers - also sometimes known as " jurors . "
So there 's an angry mob with pitchforks assembling , and they want to see some heads on pikes .
While former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling could at least try to have his case transferred out of Enron - devastated Houston , the credit - crisis targets will have no such card to play .
This time the corporate shenanigans have wrecked the globe .
" This is the ugliest enforcement environment I 've ever seen in my professional career , " says one criminal - defense lawyer , who also asks for anonymity .
" People are hot , " observes John Dowd , who heads the white - collar unit of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld .
" It can get toxic pretty quickly . "
People have a right to be angry , but anger is not the best frame of mind in which to mete out due process .
Here , the process that is due requires distinguishing foolish mistakes from lies and fraud - a line that can get surprisingly fine .
To the chagrin of John Q. Public , there will be serious defenses in most of these cases .
To begin with , bad business models - even business models that in retrospect look like prescriptions for disaster - are not crimes as long as they are fully disclosed to investors .
And the fact that lenders were hawking outlandishly risky mortgages to people who were terrible credit risks was , in fact , no secret in America :
It was bipartisan national policy .
The fact that exotic mortgages ( like " pick a payment option " AR Ms and " Alt - A " loans with no documentation of the buyer 's assets or income ) were then being packaged into complex derivative securities - some rated AAA by Moody's , S &P , and Fitch - was not just well known but also hailed as ingenious by some of the putatively best financial minds in the country .
If CEOs did not foresee the imminent train wreck that , looking back , seems so inevitable , neither did former Federal Reserve chairman and erstwhile " maestro " Alan Greenspan , who has recently , if self - servingly , termed our predicament a " once- in - a - century credit tsunami . "
Accordingly , Carl " Chip " Loewenson Jr. , cohead of Morrison & Foerster 's white - collar defense unit in New York City , sees an impending collision of two powerful opposing forces .
" No one - not Fannie , not Freddie , not Lehman , not AIG , not [ SEC chairman Christopher ]
Cox , not [ Federal Reserve chairman Ben ]
Bernanke - thought it would get as bad as it has gotten , " he says .
" This weighs against proving criminal intent .
" On the other hand , " Loewenson continues , " there is a long populist tradition in our country that insists on finding villains in any economic downturn . "
The job of the prosecutors is not to ferret out the root causes of what went wrong with the economy .
That 's a task for historians .
The prosecutors are to look for unambiguous , intentional wrongdoing - and since a lay jury will be the official scorer here , the simpler the wrongdoing , the better .
While it might be true , for instance , that investors were misled by the way companies handled mark - to - market accounting of derivatives , a prosecutor who makes that the centerpiece of his case will end up with a swearing contest between opposing accounting experts - a morass in front of a jury .
A policeman has died after being mauled by a bear in Romania , an official said today .
Tiberiu Postoaca , head of the ambulance service in Transylvanian Covasna county , said the 30 - year - old officer died after suffering a heart attack while being taken to hospital .
The policeman and a friend were walking through the woods yesterday when the bear attacked .
The friend managed to run and call for help .

Laszlo Bela , the chairman of a hunters ' association , said most bears are currently hibernating and he believes the animal might have attacked to protect its cubs in a nearby den .
Mr Bela said the number of bears in the area has increased to 600 after strict hunting regulations were imposed .
Hunters are allowed to kill 20 bears annually in Covasna .
The tsunami washed over Fire Island and , to the west , waves perhaps as high as 20 feet spilled into Lower Manhattan .
The furious onrush of water left sediment a foot and a half deep on the Jersey Shore , and debris cascaded far up the Hudson River .
No , there ’s no need to rush to higher ground , commandeer a rowboat in Central Park or empty the closet to grab the rubber boots .
This disaster occurred about 2,300 years ago , though how bad it was , or even if it was a tsunami , remains in dispute .
But several geologists have collected evidence indicating that something very big and unusual occurred in waters near the New York area around 300 B.C. , give or take a century .
And Dallas Abbott , a research scientist at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , is asserting that a meteorite , landing somewhere in the Atlantic , generated the tsunami .
Someone at the tip of Lower Manhattan then would probably have seen “ something coming in , ” Dr. Abbott said .
“ Then you would hear a big bang , maybe a series of bangs , something that sounded like gunfire or cannons .
It would be a really , really loud noise .
And then you would be knocked to the ground by the air blast .
And then you would be inundated by the tsunami . ”

Ten years ago today the first module of the International Space Station arrived in orbit nearly 200 miles above Earth .
Since that day it has been an global effort with the cooperation of Russian , European , Japanese and other space agencies in constructing the station .
The station has been home to astronauts from those and other countries , making this truly an international space station .
With the European and Japanese laboratories , crews can conduct experiments both inside and outside the station .
Due to be completed in 2010 , the station is expected to play a key role in research on the effects of long - term trips in space .

Gerry Leone , Middlesex District Attorney , speaks at a news conference , Sept. 17 , 2008 .
Community leaders opposed Question 2 , a proposal to decriminalize marijuana in the Commonwealth .
( AP / Bizuayehu Tesafye ) Back in November , Massachusetts voters passed a ballot measure -- called Question 2 -- that , on Jan. 2 , will turn possession of an ounce or less of marijuana into an offense on par with a traffic violation .
Now police and prosecutors are wondering how the heck they 're going to enforce it .

Both Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android G1 have been out for a while now .
We 've given you our own takes on each of the devices and how they stack up in an increasingly - competitive marketplace .
But we 're not the only ones with some strong opinions .
Our great community members in the Mobile Computing Outpust have been pooling their collective thoughts on the devices , and so we thought now would be a good time to bring back Perspectives .
In Perspectives , we let the forum community do the talking to see how our knowledgeable readers are responding to today 's tech .
Let 's take a look at what our community members had to say about the iPhone and the G1 .
As would be expected , the forums had quite a bit of praise to offer Apple 's iPhone .
Forum goer Akatombo broke down the positives clearly .
" The iPhone is the better consumer product of the two .
Better battery life , better usability design , tighter integrated functionality , and intuitive user interface , " he said .
" The app store is nice and convenient , but does n't allow for core improvements or modifications by the end user .
The iPhone is the clear winner in a consumer sense .
It has all the polish and design that makes a great product great .
It has an ecosystem developed around it , and has plenty of accessories for any purpose . "
Most users did n't even bother to expand on their answers , content to declare overzealously that the iPhone was the be-all , end - all of mobile devices .
" It 's the best cell phone , probably best pda , that I 've ever used , " said ctt1wbw .
" The iPhone / iPod is a much better music / video player ; the apps for the iPhone / iPod Touch are a lot more polished , " another user wrote .
But the iPhone certainly is n't perfect .
Many forum posters had some fair criticisms of Apple 's device .
Some users complained about the speed of the unit while others bemoaned being locked in to AT&T .
" What iPhone are you using where it feels snappier ? " questioned Mordac .
" The iPhone 3g I 'm using is a pile of poo .
It has 2 speeds .
Slow and painfully slow . "
The unit 's keyboard , and its lack of tactility , was another rough patch .
" [ On the iPhone ] it does n't seem possible to type with more than one finger at a time ( index finger / thumb ) , " rued incandenza , an eight year veteran of the forums .
" Plus , you have to constantly watch out that it's not auto - correcting what you type into something you did n't mean ( although I suppose you can turn this off ; I have n't gotten to that yet ) . "
Meanwhile , the Android itself has its various pluses and minuses .
On the plus side of things , the device can run background processes which makes it quite flexible .
" The background issue is a huge deal , " incandenza continued .
" In fact , I was surprised that it worked this way when I first started using the [ iPod Touch ] .
Basically , apps cannot do anything unless they 're running in the foreground .
That 's a pretty big advantage to the G1 . "
" The G1 is the better messaging device , simply because it has actual background processes , " vherrera0079 said , reinforcing the point .
" You can have an IM session and the browser going on at the same time , and you 'll be notified of new messages by the clever notification UI .
You also have a real keyboard and copy / paste functions . "
For those who really like to poke around and customize their device , the G1 is the ideal gadget .
" The G1 is good for anyone who likes to have a netbook experience , " wrote forum newcomer poorboy .
" There will always be new apps coming out to improve and add extra features .
I like to think it 's like playing around with running Linux , it 's all about experimenting with it to enhance your knowledge and enjoyment of the device . "
It 's not all roses and sunshine with Google 's first foray into the mobile world , though ; there are some very serious issues with the phone .
" The G1 is rough at the edges , has lower battery life , and an OS with a UI needing some polish , " wrote Akatombo .
" It just is n't as slick as an Apple product . "
The web browser was one of the many contentious points of the unit .
Though Google 's Chrome is an attractive program , the G1 does n't offer as robust a browsing experience .
" The browser sucks , " wrote spankalee bluntly .
" For being based on the same rendering engine , it sure screws up a whole lot more . "
Even those in favor of the device admitted that the browser was lacking .
" The browser complaints are very valid , though .
The zooming functionality is awkward , and switching between windows is very clunky compared to the iPhone version . "
That missing layer of polish is sadly characteristic of the entire device , the forums say .
" Android simply is n't as slick or easy to use as mobile OS X , probably because they were n't as brutal about cutting features , " spankalee continued .
" There are too many hardware buttons , which sometimes have non-obvious functions , or worse , inconsistent functions that depend on the app .
Many features are n't easily discoverable , requiring you to dig into menus . "
The biggest issue with the G1 that our community identified was the battery life .
Universally , almost every poster had something negative to say about the unit 's electronic fortitude .
" I was thinking of returning my G1 after seeing the abysmal battery life in the first few days , " wrote vherrera0079 .
" I paid money to get a full featured phone so I could do stuff like Locale . "
Many concede , though , that turning off the 3G and GPS features can do wonders for the battery life , as one would expect .
So how do the two stack up against each other when compared ?
Although the crowd stands divided , the iPhone is currently winning with a tidy margin .
Over 60 percent of those who voted on the threads poll preferred the iPhone .
But the G1 had its fair share of fans , too .
The iPhone was praised for its smooth interface , great application support , and accessible features .
Plus , while it may not have the robust computing platform and background - processing capabilities of the G1 , the battery lasts much longer , and what it lacks in flexibility it makes up for in style and usability .
As a development platform and a tinker toy of sorts , the G1 offers a great playpen that is still very much maturing .
" The G1 is great for fiddling and trying to develop code for it .
It 's an engineer 's dream toy , just waiting to be poked around with , " one user wrote .
But in spite of its positive points , most G1 users , whether happy with the device or not , tended to agree that the hardware of the unit simply lacked the polish of Apple 's device .
We periodically update that list and released one such update to the site this morning .
Unfortunately ( and here 's the human error ) , the URL of '/ ' was mistakenly checked in as a value to the file and ' /' expands to all URLs .
Fortunately , our on - call site reliability team found the problem quickly and reverted the file .
Since we push these updates in a staggered and rolling fashion , the errors began appearing between 6:27 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. and began disappearing between 7:10 and 7:25 a.m. , so the duration of the problem for any particular user was approximately 40 minutes .
Thanks to our team for their quick work in finding this .
And again , our apologies to any of you who were inconvenienced this morning , and to site owners whose pages were incorrectly labelled .
We will carefully investigate this incident and put more robust file checks in place to prevent it from happening again .
Thanks for your understanding .

Begich takes an 814 vote ( 0.29 % ) lead with 35,000 votes left to count in Democratic strongholds .
He needs to pass 0.5 % in order to avoid an automatic recount .... and it looks like he will .
Senator - Elect Begich will be the 56th democratic senator .
( VT Independent Senator Sanders is counted towards a filibuster - proof majority but he is not a Democrat . )
Franken in MN looks to quite likely win and be # 57 .
Martin in GA , however , is not so likely to beat Chambliss in arguably the first state to unilaterally use and abuse touch screen voting machines in the US .
GA and AK do not pass the smell test and appear to be the 2000 FL or 2004 OH of 2008 elections .

Never mind any chance at real voting reform .
As I expected , the " e-voting or no voting ! " crowd are seizing the upper hand in the Obama administration .
Listen to the wording of this poll " question " ... no room is left for anything other than e-voting , and in the comments equal amounts of ignorance and " open - source solves all " idiocy by people already inclined to just lap it up and spew it out in turn .

The Minnesota count should be an interesting legal manuever .
Georgia will be a case study in dirty politics .
60 is n't some magic number that will ensure a " filibuster - proof " majority .
Democrats are a herd of cats , and Joe - 4 - Joe is n't a Democrat .
Do n't expect them to stick together , they 'll need Republican support .

How is it possible that a convicted felon ( seven counts of lying ) is even holding a security clearance or accessing government computers , or standing on the Senate floor voting , let alone being on a ballot in the first place ?
Failure of Elections system .
Failure of Justice system .
Failure of Secret Service / FBI .
Failure of DOJ / Pentagon .
Roll this man up with his friggin bedroll , into a jail cell already .
Have him pick up his Senate Office property from the evidence / property window at the police department !

Is n't this the point at which the Supreme Court is supposed to step in , stop the vote count , and declare the Republican candidate the winner no matter what the actual ballots say ?
Bet Stevens wishes his daddy would buy him an election , the way Dubya 's did .

Sorry , if this is n't the correct place ... I was very disheartened when I contacted both senators , 1 responded , by not answering my question at all about election reform in paper ballots and oversight of the counters .
The other senator did n't answer at all , of course he was recently fined $ 90 K for some infraction during his campaign , so he is probably otherwise distracted .
It probably will take a petition to get election reform .

Palin team pushed hard for trooper 's ouster Ex - brother - in - law was focus of dozens of calls to his boss
Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan , a member of the Village Public Safety Officer task force , talks about the state funded program at his office in Anchorage , Alaska Monday Jan. 28 , 2008 .
A seven - member panel released a report to the state Senate on Friday Feb. 1 , calling for significant changes in the Village Public Safety Officer program including hefty pay raises , more than doubling the size of the force and enlisting help from agencies to develop acceptable housing where needed .

A ... more Photo : Al Grillo , AP Photo : Al Grillo , AP Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Palin team pushed hard for trooper 's ouster 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
The 2007 state fair was days away when Alaska 's public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan , took another call about one of his troopers , Michael Wooten .
This time , the director of Gov. Sarah Palin 's Anchorage office was on the line .
As Monegan recalls it , the aide said the governor had heard that Wooten was assigned to work the kickoff to the fair in late August .
If so , Monegan should do something about it , because Palin was also planning to attend and did not want the trooper nearby .
Somewhat bewildered , Monegan soon determined that Wooten had indeed volunteered for duty at the fairgrounds - in full costume as " Safety Bear , " the troopers ' child - friendly mascot .
Two years earlier , the trooper and the governor 's sister had been embroiled in a nasty divorce and child - custody battle that had hardened the Palin family against him .
To Monegan and several top aides , the state fair episode was yet another example of a fixation that the governor and her husband , Todd , had with Wooten and the most granular details of his life .
" I thought to myself , ' Man , do they have a heavy - duty network and focus on this guy , ' " Monegan said .
" You 'd call that an obsession . "
On July 11 , Palin fired Monegan , setting off a politically charged scandal that has become vastly more charged since Palin became the Republican vice presidential nominee .
The outlines of the matter have been widely reported .
Monegan believes he was ousted because he would not bow to pressure to dismiss Wooten .
The Alaska Legislature is investigating the firing and whether the governor abused the powers of her office to pursue a personal vendetta .
Its report is due today .
Palin has denied that anyone told Monegan to dismiss Wooten , or that the commissioner 's ouster had anything to do with the trooper .
But an examination of the case , based on interviews with Monegan and several top aides , indicates that , to a far greater degree than was previously known , the governor , her husband and her administration pressed the commissioner and his staff to get Wooten off the force , though without directly ordering it .
In all , the commissioner and his aides were contacted about Wooten three dozen times over 19 months by the governor , her husband and seven administration officials , interviews and documents show .
Campaign to ' get rid of him '
" To all of us , it was a campaign to get rid of him as a trooper and , at the very least , to smear the guy and give him a desk job somewhere , " said Kim Peterson , Monegan 's special assistant and a 31 - year veteran of state government , who like several other aides spoke publicly about the matter for the first time .
The governor 's office 's interest in the Wooten case did not end with Monegan , the examination shows .
His successor , Chuck Kopp , recalled that in an exploratory phone call and then a job interview , Palin 's aides mentioned the governor 's concerns about Wooten .
None of the 280 other troopers were discussed , Kopp said .
Immediately after Monegan 's firing , Palin said her intent was to change the department 's direction .
( She declined to be interviewed for this article . )
She has since offered a variety of explanations for his ouster , most recently accusing him of insubordination and opposing her fiscal reforms .
As evidence , she has contended , among other things , that Monegan arranged two unauthorized lobbying trips to Washington .
But , according to interviews and records obtained by the New York Times , both trips were authorized by the governor 's office .
As for Wooten , Palin has said she and others were simply lodging legitimate complaints to the appropriate authorities about a trooper with a disciplinary record who was a danger to her family and to the public .
Palin initially said she welcomed an investigation into Monegan 's ouster .
But she has since declined to cooperate with the bipartisan inquiry .
Palin has pledged to cooperate with a separate inquiry , by the state 's Personnel Board .
Began before governorship
The Palin family 's dispute with Wooten surfaced long before Palin became governor .
On April 11 , 2005 , the day Palin 's sister , Molly McCann , filed for divorce , her father , Chuck Heath , informed the state police that a domestic - violence restraining order had been served on his son - in - law .
Heath later told the state police that , although Wooten had not physically harmed McCann , he had intimidated her .
McCann told authorities that Wooten had said to her that he would shoot Heath if he hired her a divorce lawyer and would " take down " Sarah Palin if she got involved .
The family also reported that Wooten , who was assigned to the wildlife investigations unit , shot a moose without a permit , used a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson and drank a beer at a friend 's barbecue before taking a second one for the drive home in his patrol car .
In March 2006 , after an internal inquiry , Wooten received a 10 - day suspension , which was eventually halved .
The suspension letter mentions nothing about threats .
At the time , Wooten and McCann had been divorced for about two months .
On Jan. 4 , 2007 , a month into the Palin administration and his tenure as public safety commissioner , Monegan went to the governor 's Anchorage office to talk with Todd Palin , who had requested the meeting .
Todd Palin was seated at a conference table with three stacks of personnel files .
That , Monegan recalled , was the first time he heard the name Mike Wooten .
" He conveyed to me that he and Sarah did not think the investigation into Wooten had been done well enough and that they were not happy with the punishment , " Monegan said .
" Todd was clearly frustrated . "
Todd Palin pressured
Todd Palin noted Wooten 's divorce case but dwelt on the moose kill , Monegan recalled .
The commissioner said he would have his staff evaluate the evidence .
A few days later , Monegan informed Todd Palin that the issues raised at the meeting had been addressed in Wooten 's suspension .
The case was closed .
Todd Palin sounded vexed and said repeatedly that Wooten was getting away with a crime , Monegan said .
Several evenings later , Monegan 's cell phone rang .
" Walt , it 's Sarah , " the governor said before echoing much of what her husband had said .
Wooten , he recalls being told , was " not the kind of person we should want as a trooper . "
He told the governor , too , that there was no new evidence to pursue .
Soon after that , Todd Palin and several aides began pressing the public safety agency to investigate another matter : whether Wooten was fraudulently collecting workers ' compensation for a back injury he said he had suffered while helping carry a body bag .
Todd Palin declined to be interviewed .
But in a sworn affidavit this week for the legislative investigation , he wrote that he had hundreds of communications about the trooper " with my family , with friends , with colleagues and with just about everyone I could , including government officials . "
As for what he had told his wife , Todd Palin said he often raised his concerns about " the unfairness of his remaining on the state troopers when he was obviously so unfit for the job . "
Monegan fired
Of the dozen calls Monegan 's assistant Peterson received about Wooten , she said , at least half were from Dianne Kiesel , a deputy director at the Department of Administration .
The last discussion with Kiesel came after Peterson informed her that the trooper had been cleared to work full time .
" Since there was now no business reason to separate Wooten , she wanted to know what else we could do with him , " Peterson said , adding , " I could tell she was under pressure to come up with something . "
As for Wooten 's planned appearance as Safety Bear , Monegan said he decided to pull him back .
In July , Palin 's acting chief of staff called Monegan to another meeting in that same room in the governor 's Anchorage office .
The aide , Michael Nizich , said the governor wanted him to head the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board , part of the public safety department .
Put another way , he was no longer commissioner .
Wooten , who declined to be interviewed for this article , remains on the force as a patrol trooper .
Katrina cottage occupants face new displacement WAVELAND , Miss . 
Thousands of cottages housing hurricane victims on the Mississippi Gulf Coast will be vacated next month , even though many of their occupants are n't ready to move and may have no place to go if forced out .
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency distributed the one - , two - and three - bedroom structures to temporarily house displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
There are still 2,300 occupied cottages in Mississippi , said Mike Womack , director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency .
Many of the cottages sit on residents ' lots while they rebuild wrecked homes , he said .
TRAILERS : Judge rejects class - action status in trailer suits According to agreements between the state agency and cities , the cottages will need to be emptied by the end of January and removed by March , Womack said .
Housing advocates , residents and some local officials worry that forcing out residents , many of whom are trying to rebuild their homes , will aggravate an already dire housing situation .
" If these ( cottages ) are gone , there 's just not going to be enough affordable housing , " said Tim Kellar , county administrator of Hancock County , which includes Waveland .
" We do n't have an alternate plan if that happens . "
FEMA distributed the cottages , free of charge , as an alternative to the temporary trailers that first housed hurricane victims .
The program was applauded as Mississippi officials acquired and distributed thousands of the cottages ; neighboring Louisiana lagged behind .
The cottages were always meant to be temporary , not a permanent housing solution , Womack said .
The structures may not withstand another powerful storm and many violate zoning rules , he said .
" We just can't allow these cottages to stay in place where they 're unsafe or degrading the property values of homes around them , " Womack said .
Rebuilding homes or finding alternative housing has been a slow , arduous process in post - Katrina Mississippi , said Andrew Canter of the Mississippi Center for Justice , a housing advocacy group .
For example , none of the public housing units has been rebuilt in Bay St. Louis and Waveland , two of the hardest - hit coastal towns , leaving scores of residents with few options , he said .
Forcing residents from the cottages next month could leave many hurricane victims homeless , he said .
" Thousands of people will not be able to find new housing , " Canter said .
FEMA has offered to sell the cottages to residents , pending approval by the cities in which they reside , Canter said .
Some of the cities , such as Waveland and Bay St. Louis , will only allow the cottages in trailer parks , he said .
Waveland resident Mary Elizabeth Shaerrouse , 84 , has lived in her two - bedroom cottage since October 2007 .
The cottage is parked on her property while her house is being rebuilt .
Problems with a contractor have delayed construction until August 2009 .
She does n't know what she 'll do if she 's forced out by the end of January , she said .
" It 's truly a roadblock , " Shaerrouse said .
" I 'm just trying to make it to August . "

Our grisly tale begins with this newspaper clipping from December 1993 :
FULDA , Germany , Dec 8 ( AFP ) – An American soldier cut off the head of his pregnant wife ’s lover and put it on her bedside table in the hospital here where she was about to give birth , a spokesman at the German public prosecutor ’s office said on Wednesday .
The angry husband struck on Tuesday when his rival , a fellow GI in the American 11th cavalry regiment , was phoning the woman from nearby Sickels military airfield .
The first soldier cut off the second one ’s head with a knife , then drove to the hospital and showed it to his wife and left it there .
The victim just had time to call down the telephone , “ Your husband is coming , ” the German sources said .
An American army spokesman confirmed a decapitated body had been found in a telephone box at the military airfield .
U.S. military police held the first man for questioning .
He was not immediately named .
You might think that so gruesome a tale could n’t get worse , but you ’d be wrong .
In December of 1993 , Gregory Glover paid the ultimate penalty for messing with another fellow ’s wife .
His friend , Stephen Schap , did n’t take the news of Glover ’s wrongdoings all that gracefully , coming as it was from his pregnant wife ’s lips with her about to give birth to this other man ’s child .
Leading up to this gruesome event was the breakdown of the Schaps ’ marriage .
Posted to a U.S. Army airfield in Germany , Sgt. Schap and his wife grew apart over time , a condition Schap was seemingly unaware of , but one with which his wife was all too painfully in touch .
Communication broke down , loneliness set in , and a friendship with one of her husband ’s army buddies progressed from the platonic to the physical .
Diane Schap asked for a divorce at various times , citing marital breakdown as her reason , but her husband always managed to talk her into trying again .
He was unaware ( or perhaps uncaring ) of the depth of her dissatisfaction and completely in the dark about her involvement with another man .
As well , there was the coming child to consider , a child Schap did not know was not his .
And so the stage was set in early December of 1993 .
Schap discovered indications of his wife ’s infidelity from reading her diary while she was away for a weekend visiting a girlfriend .
Though she ’d previously asked for a divorce , she ’d never mentioned her relationship with Glover .
The news in her diary came as a shock to Schap ; upon her return he asked her pointblank if she ’d been sleeping with his friend .
She assured him she had not been , and this assurance appeared to satisfy her husband .
He contacted the base chaplain the next day to make arrangements for Diane to return to the States ; the two of them had finally reached agreement on a divorce .
Diane was hospitalized on December 7 for complications relating to her pregnancy .
It was then that she decided that her husband must be told about the parentage of the child she was carrying .
She shared her news with him from her hospital bed , and he initially appeared to take it well .
( Since Schap had already resigned himself to the marriage ’s being over , perhaps this was n’t all that unexpected a response . )
Within the hour he returned in an agitated state , demanding to know details of who her lover was and where they ’d made love .
After this confrontation , Schap left “ to pack his things . ”
In reality he went to seek out Glover .
Schap found him in a phone booth on the base , in the process of conversing with Diane .
The lovers had been speaking for 5 or 10 minutes , Diane testified , when Glover suddenly swore twice .
The second expletive was “ cut off mid-breath , ” she said .
“ Then all I heard was the dial tone . ”
Glover suffered slight knife wounds in the telephone booth , then tried to escape on foot .
He ran a short distance but slipped and fell , and Schap was quickly on top of him , according to witnesses .
Schap stabbed his victim 10 to 15 times before beheading him .
We quote Diane Schap ’s recollection of the events from her description of them at Schap ’s trial :
After checking into a German hospital in Fulda that day , she had been obliged to confess to her husband that she was pregnant by another man .
A few hours later she was speaking by phone with that other man , Glover , a personable 21 - year - old soldier who was a friend to both the Schaps .
The line suddenly went dead .
Now , around a half - hour later , she heard footsteps coming quickly down the hospital hallway .
She recognized them as her husband’s .
The door burst open , and there stood Stephen Schap , according to her testimony , his chest heaving , clothes speckled with blood .
He was carrying a Head gym bag .
“ He had the sports bag over his shoulder , and it looked like it was full , ” she said .
It was .
Her husband reached into the bag , she said , and pulled out Glover ’s head .
“ He grasped the head in both hands and he tried to push it in my face .
I kept screaming and screaming , ” she said , sobbing as she testified .
“ Look , Diane — Glover ’s here !
He ’ll sleep with you every night now .
Only you wo n’t sleep — because all you ’ll see is this , ” Stephen Schap told her , according to her testimony .
Doctors who had heard the terrified screams ran to the room .
There they found Diane Schap , her face pale with shock , bedclothes spattered with blood .
Stephen Schap sat at the foot of the bed , across his wife ’s legs .
And on the night stand , facing Diane Schap , was Glover ’s head .
Stephan Schap was courtmartialed for the murder of Gregory Glover in April 1994 .
He was found guilty and given a mandatory life sentence .

Youâ€™ve probably seen the commercials â€ “ actually , theyâ€™re sort of impossible to miss .
Â T. Boone Pickens , looking folksy in his chambray shirt , talking about how he has been an Oil Man for over 50 years and how heâ€™s got a real plan to break our dependence on foreign oil .
Â
I love these ads because I want to believe Mr. Pickens with all my heart .
Â
I want to believe that the answer to our oil addiction might be as simple as switching our cars over to clean natural gas to buy us time to develop renewable alternatives that will eventually get us off of oil completely .
Â
But Iâ€™m skeptical .
Â
Weâ€™ve been fooled before .
Â
So I decided to take a deeper look at this man and his planâ€ ¦
Is The Pickens Plan really as good as it seems ?
The Man
T. Boone Pickens is indeed a former oil man â€ “ in fact , he is worth at least 3 billion dollars and made most of that fortune in the oil business .
He started as a geologist for Phillips Petroleum in the early 1950â€™s , and then went on to create Mesa Petroleum and Petroleum Exploration .
Pickensâ€™ belief in acquisition rather than further exploration in the 1980s , lead to his notoriety as a take - over giant and his ranking as Forbes 117th - richest person in America .
Pickens was also known for his hefty financial support of George W. Bush , the Republican Party and the 2004 Swift boat ads that helped derail John Kerryâ€™s bid for the presidency .
But today , T . Boone is all about clean tech energy and he has renounced his Republican affiliations in order to pursue his passion for changing the hearts and minds of Americans to the belief that natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar are our best and most possible hope for a better future .
The Washington Post verbally scratched its head at Pickens new persona : â€ œThe billionaire speculator as energy wise man , an oil - and - gas magnate as champion of wind power , and a lifetime Republican who has become a fellow traveler among environmentally minded Democrats .
â€ 
I say , good for you T. Boone ! Â
Now letâ€™s look at the Plan .
The Plan
Mr. Pickens feels that world oil production has reached its peak and can no longer meet the demands of global consumption .
Â
In fact , he feels that it is on the decline and weâ€™ll be out of oil before we have an alternative if we donâ€™t do something now .
Â
The Plan proposes that we replace the natural gas currently being used for grid power ( electricity ) with wind power ( which he has invested heavily in ) and then take the excess natural gas and use that for transportation fuel , replacing gasoline wherever possible until technology catches up with a renewable fuel source for our cars . Â
Pickens believes that by doing this , we can reduce our yearly foreign oil imports from $ 700 billion down to $ 400 billion in the next ten years .
Â
That sounds pretty good .
Â
Another thing that raises my hopes is that the Plan has been endorsed by Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club , who is usually quite vocal about things that are bad for the environment .
Â
To read the entire plan : Â The Pickens Plan
The Verdict
Pickens has been criticized for creating a plan from which he might stand to gain quite a bit , having already invested nearly 12 billion dollars in wind technology .
Â
His standard rebuttal to this accusation is : â€ œIâ€™m 80 years old , and Iâ€™m worth $ 4 billion .
I have plenty of money .
Â
I think it shows leadership that Iâ€™m putting my money into the wind business , and Iâ€™m willing to put my money where my mouth is.â€ Â
He testified in front of congress in July of this year that his plan would not only reduce our foreign oil consumption by switching cars to natural gas , it would create new jobs in clean technology throughout the wind corridor of the United States , an area in the middle of the country that stretches from the Canadian border , through the Great Plains and into Texas .
Â
The biggest impediment to the Plan , however , seems to be the number of hurdles that need to be gotten over in order for the Plan to succeed .
Â
They include :
+Â The monetary and environmental costs of building enough wind turbines to meet our power needs Â
+Â
The assumption that wind power will adequately replace the natural gas proposed for transportation fuel
+ Â Connecting that power to large cities through approximately 40,000 miles of transmission lines
+ Â Switching millions of drivers over to natural gas vehicles

Mr. Pickens is quick to point out that his plan isnâ€™t a complete solution , it is â€œa bridge to the future â€ ” a blueprint to reduce foreign oil dependence by harnessing domestic energy alternatives , and buy us time to develop even greater new technologies .

With gas prices so high and the economy teetering on the edge , the Plan does seem like a real challenge and yet better than some other ideas floating around out there .

We all know that something has to change and it might mean that we have to make some short - term sacrifices to gain long - term benefits .

If Mr. Pickens has enough energy at 80 to commit to an idea that will take that much money , hard work and tenacity , then I say let him try .

Cheetah Girls Booted from Macy's Parade After Racy Photos Leaked
America will have to do without the Cheetah Girls during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year because they 've been uninvited .
Macy 's officials are citing " scheduling issues " as the reason the girl group wo n't appear in the parade but according to the New York Daily News , the semi-nude photos of Adrienne Bailon were just too much for the wholesome department store chain .
The pictures featured Bailon in a bra and nothing else .
Her publicist , Jonathan Jaxson , first claimed the photos had been stolen at JFK airport a week earlier in a laptop heist .
He has since changed his tune and indicates it was all a publicity stunt to try to alter the singer 's image to be more adult and less Disney .
The fallout has begun .
Says Jaxson : " Adrienne wanted me to plant the story about the laptop .
She wanted to distance herself from the Cheetah Girls .
She decided , ' Let 's spice it up ' and say possible nude photos were stolen from her laptop ... I 've done this before with several stars and we 've had great success , but this is the first time it 's even bitten me in the rear or a client . "
UPDATE : Cheetah Girls Breakup

What Is On - Page SEO ?
When you want to boost your SEO , you need to understand what on - page SEO is and how it is essential to show up at the top of the search results .
On - page SEO is the act of optimizing specific pages for different search terms .
When you ’re looking at on - page factors , it ’s not only the content on the page but it ’s also the HTML on the page .
1. Create Good Content
One of the most important parts of SEO is creating good content that people are going to love consuming .
Subpar content might have been able to make it on the internet years ago , but today there is entirely too much competition .
Good content means content that easily answers the searcher ’s query .
You ca n’t burry the answer in the content and hope people are going to take the time to find it .
Providing clear and concise answers is the name of the game and then you can expand on the content to better explain the simple answer .
Your content also needs to naturally work in keywords that you ’re targeting .
Make sure they do n’t look out of place and distracting .
Your goal is to create content your viewers love and search engines can understand .
2. Title Tag
The title tag of each page is very important and makes a big difference in how the search engines understand your page .
If you do n’t have the keyword in the title tag of the page , that is going to confuse the search engines .
3. Page URL
Another place you need to have your target keyword is in your page URL .
Make the page URL as short as possible while still including the entire keyword in the URL .
While you do want to fit the keyword in , you do n’t want to make the URL any longer than it needs to be since it looks a little spammy when it is long .
4. Image ALT Text
Make sure to include a photo in all of your pages and use the keyword in the ALT text .
The ALT text is the text that is going to show up in case the image is n’t able to load .

At 9 am today , Wednesday , 14 January 2009 , Israeli aircrafts raided an unfinished housing project northwest of Tel al - Sultan neighborhood in Rafah .
This project , which is funded by the United Nations Development Program , is aimed to re-house hundreds of families whose homes had been destroyed by the IOF in Rafah during the past few years .
As IOF ’s attacks have continued , more civilians have been forced to evacuate their homes throughout the Gaza Strip .
More than 30,000 people have found shelter in UNRWA schools ; however , at least 200,000 people have already left their homes .
Bloodshed and displacement continue in the midst of a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Most of the population do not have access to water .
Moreover , the health sector is still suffering from an enormous load of injured and killed persons under severe shortages in medical supplies and personnel , and restrictions on the movement of ambulances and medical consignments .
Al Mezan Center asserts that countless acts by the IOF represent scandalous war crimes , the worst of which being the indiscriminate attacks on house full of inhabitants , killing ambulance teams while attempting to reach them and leaving them to bleed or starve to death only meters from IOF troops .
Additionally , IOF ’s restriction of the passage of foodstuffs and targeting of electric lines has caused civilians to live in dire conditions .
Al Mezan Center therefore renews its strong condemnation of the IOF ’s aggression on the Gaza Strip , and its flagrant disregard of the applicable rules of international law .
This behavior has so far cost the lives of hundreds of civilians and the suffering of hundreds of thousands .
Al Mezan also renews its deploring of the failure of the international community to prevent such violations of international law .
While civilians have been murdered , the UN Security Council took a very long time debating disputed political affairs , while it should have acted to prevent the killing of children and innocent civilians , and to ensure the provision of humanitarian aid in accordance with international law .
Hence , Al Mezan Center calls upon the UN Secretary - General , as a matter of utmost urgency , to focus on the protection of civilians who are the main victims of the violation of international law by Israel .
Political debates can wait ; however , civilian life cannot be compensated .
The United Nations is called on to ensure the compliance with international law and the protection of civilians , including its own staff .
Every hour of aggression on Gaza in the way we have witnessed during the past 16 days means the loss of more civilian life , destruction of property and extending the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people who should be protected , not neglected .
Al Mezan Center also calls on the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War , of 1949 , to live up to their legal and moral responsibilities upholding their own obligations under Common Article 1 , by respecting , and ensuring respect of , the Convection .
The Center , while commending the worldwide action against these violations , calls on civil societies around the world to exert more pressure on their governments so that they act in conformity with the relevant human rights and humanitarian obligations as prescribed in relevant international law .

In what could be a significant victory for its online music store , Apple is believed to have landed agreements not only to remove copy protection from the music of all major labels but to also allow direct music downloads to iPhones over cellular networks .
The deal reported by sources speaking to CNET News.com would see Apple break its longtime insistence on a fixed per-track rate for songs and give in to frequent demands from Sony , Universal and Warner that would change the pricing depending on the popularity and recentness of a given song .
While many songs will supposedly stay at the 99 - cent level , hits will now potentially cost " more " than this amount .
In exchange , back catalog tracks will drop to as low as 79 cents each to help move older or less popular content .
On making the switch to a variable pricing model , any new additions to iTunes ' music roster would immediately be made available without the digital rights management ) DRM that prevents easy copying , while existing titles would gradually see their locks removed .
How existing tracks will be handled is n't known ; in the past , Apple has charged a small fee to upgrade songs to iTunes Plus , which not only removes DRM but doubles the bitrate and potentially improves sound quality as a result .
An announcement could be made as soon as tomorrow 's Macworld Expo , according to the report , as Apple reportedly struck its agreement just this past week .
If authentic , such a deal would be considered a watershed for the acceptance of unrestricted online music .
Stores such as Amazon MP3 , eMusic and Walmart have had completely unprotected music for roughly a year but have failed to dent Apple 's virtual control of the market , which is now so strong that it has outperformed Walmart 's retail division and other previously dominant physical outlets .
Various reports have previously suggested that major labels besides EMI , which until now has been Apple 's only major supporter of DRM - free tracks , have been using the offer of unguarded songs as leverage to boost competitors .
Multiple legal hurdles are also possibly cleared by such a move , including a recent antitrust lawsuit and Norway 's years - long formal complaint .
Both of these accuse Apple of unfairly locking customers to its hardware and software ecosystem by selling music on iTunes with FairPlay protection in place and refusing to license the standard to outsiders .
Separately , other sources claim an apparent breakthrough for over - the - air iTunes downloads .
Where wireless purchases on iPhones are currently limited to Wi -Fi — often believed due to carriers ' concerns over data traffic — this second plan would let users download songs over the EDGE or more likely 3G networks .
There are a wide choice of web design apps available for Linux if you want to move from text editing
Way back at the beginning of the web ( or when it started to become mainstream ) it was popular to spend hours hacking away at a keyboard to type your first web page .
These early efforts were horrific mish - mashes of colour , style ( or lack thereof ) and seemed to consist entirely of people telling you just how they felt about certain topics .
You only have to spend some time with the Internet Archive to see shining examples of the terror that could be wrought with a simple text editor and far too much knowledge .
From there web development got a bit smarter , and it was n't long before GUI - based tools became available to make the whole process more speedy and user friendly .
Sadly , they did n't improve on the whole colour clashing , but they did make a lot more people a lot more productive .
Even Microsoft , having previously dismissed the power of the web , did a complete U - turn and ended up releasing FrontPage to fuel even more abuse of the senses .
Here and now
Nowadays a very large number of sites use a dedicated content management system that serves to totally abstract users from the intricacies of learning HTML , DHTML , XHTML and all the other different languages that can be harnessed to produce rich and dynamic websites in favour of having strict controls on look and feel .
That 's not to say that there is n't a place for good old fashioned web editors ; rather that they now provide a complementary set of tools that can enhance a website , turning it into a thing of relative beauty .
So , what 's the state of editors for Linux and does it get any better than Vi or Emacs ?
Let 's take a look at what options are on offer today .
1. Bluefish
Licence : Free under GPL
Website : bluefish.openoffice.nl
Our first editor of interest is Bluefish , which is marketed as the programmers ' HTML editor .
When you launch it , you can understand why it 's seen this way .
Although you can't edit a graphical preview , you do get a whole host of icons crying out to be clicked on .
The developers have also taken a leaf out of Microsoft 's book , mimicking their Ribbon interface with a range of options to format your HTML .
More interesting is the slew of other components that can be placed into the mix , including PHP , SQL and some limited Apache options .
All of these are designed to take some of the pain out of creating complex pages , something which is to be commended .
Even better , there 's a pretty exhaustive reference not only to the intricacies of HTML , but also PHP , CSS2 and Python .
As you 'd expect from any code editor , there 's syntax colouring and highlighting to help you monitor and correct any mistakes in your code .
Coming back to the Ribbon - like interface , we found it annoying to have to click twice to get to the options we needed – once to bring up the toolbar and again to select the option we wanted .
It 's a feature we find mildly annoying in Office as well , although we can understand that others may prefer it .
However , the interface does seem a little on the cluttered side , even with the ribbon hiding the majority of the icons .
After a while , you 'll find yourself entering code without the icons , just to avoid having to use them .
If you find that you 're using a handful of icons on a regular basis , you can elect to add them to the quick bar – a Ribbon - like option that gives you your own personalised shortcut area .
We are legion
One of the best features in Bluefish is that it enables you to create what it calls projects , which contain a number of pages or elements all founded on a common set of preferences .
Each page is held in its own tab , making it relatively simple to have a number of pages open within the editor to cross check between them as necessary .
In 2007 , the House passed a similar bill , but it failed in the Senate on a procedural vote .
Republican leaders and business lobbyists say the Democrats do not have the 60 votes to overcome a filibuster .
But union leaders voice optimism , noting that Mr. Obama has endorsed the bill and that Democrats have close to 60 seats in the Senate , though two remain in dispute .
Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican who once was a co-sponsor of the bill , has not decided whether he would support it this time , an aide said .
Whether it is Wal - Mart or the National Restaurant Association , many companies and corporate groups financing the opposition fear that their companies and industries will be among labor ’s earliest organizing targets should the bill become law .
Labor leaders say they are setting their sights on several industries , like banks and big - box retailers like Wal - Mart or Target , where unions have had virtually no success .

“ We ’re going to organize in the basic industries of our unions : construction , hospitality , health care , retail , food production and manufacturing , ” said Tom Woodruff , director of strategic organizing for Change to Win , a federation of seven unions that includes the Service Employees International Union , the Teamsters and the United Food and Commercial Workers .
“ Those are jobs that are going to stay in the country .
The question is whether those jobs are going to be decent middle - class jobs . ”
Mark McKinnon , a media adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain and George W. Bush , is a spokesman for the Workforce Fairness Institute .
Mr. McKinnon said the institute was focusing on drumming up grass - roots support from business .
He would not say which companies are financing the institute , founded by several longtime Republican operatives .
“ This issue has really become very high on the radar screen , ” he said .
“ Businesses are hearing about it , and they are ready to riot in the street about it . ”
Many teens are still abusing prescription painkillers , even as the use of stimulant drugs declined , according to an annual study of teen drug and alcohol use released today .
The 2008 Monitoring the Future Survey , conducted by scientists at the University of Michigan and sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which is part of the NIH , surveyed 8th , 10th and 12th graders about their habits regarding drugs and alcohol .
This is the 34th year for the study .

The one - time candidate of " change " and " hope " did n't leave much room for prosecution of the Bush administration in a Sunday interview .
President - elect Barack Obama suggested that prosecuting torture committed by the Bush administration would not be a priority for him once he takes office .
" We have not made final decisions , but my instinct is for us to focus on how to we make sure we 're moving forward , we are doing the right thing .
That does n't mean that if somebody has blatantly broken the law that they are above the law , but my orientation is going to be moving forward , " Obama said .
Interviewed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos , Obama said that he plans to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay but wo n't accomplish that goal during the first 100 days of his administration .
" It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize and we are going to get it done , " he said .
Human rights and civil liberties groups have called for senior Bush administration officials to be prosecuted for a series of alleged abuses , from mishandling the conflict in Iraq to the illegal detention and torture of terrorist suspects and domestic spying .
Obama criticized Vice President Dick Cheney for his public defense of " extraordinary " interrogation methods used against top terrorism suspects , including waterboarding .
" Vice President Cheney , I think , continues to defend what he calls extraordinary measures or procedures when it comes to interrogations and from my view waterboarding is torture , " Obama said .
" I have said that under my administration we will not torture . "

読者の皆さんは 、 「 Cyan」（サイアン）という言語をご存じないかもしれない。Cyanは、Lispのマクロを持ち、Python風のインデントによってブロックを表すプログラミング言語。2008年の春、林拓人という1人の高校生によって設計された。
林拓人氏 写真：岩井玲 文
開成高校2年。撮影は開成高校にて
連載第1回の竹内郁雄氏が「開発」の天才、第2回の五十嵐悠紀氏が「発想」の天才とするならば、今回の林氏は「プログラミング言語」の天才だ。
林氏がプログラミング言語に初めて触れたのは中学3年の夏休み。そこから冬休みまでの5カ月間に、5つのプログラミング言語を習得した。その後もいくつかのプログラミング言語を学ぶ中、林氏の興味はWebサービスなどのものづくりには行かず、ひたすら言語自体へと向かっていった。
高校2年の春、自身でプログラミング言語Cyanを作り上げた。Cyanを設計した林氏は、「U-20プログラミング・コンテスト」（以下、U-20プロコン）で経済産業大臣賞を受賞。初めて本格的に書いたプログラムは、自分の設計した言語の処理系という、何とも特異な、前代未聞のプログラマである。
インタビュアーは 、Lispでおなじみの東京大学 教授 竹内郁雄氏。才能あるプログラマの発掘・育成のためならばと、ボランタリーで引き受けてくださった。
プログラミング能力と日本語力は比例する
1．――文系ですか？ 理系ですか？
竹内氏 林君はいま 高 校2年生か。学校の勉強で得意科目は理数系？
林氏 理数系科目は好きですけど、得意とまではいえないです。国語は比較的得意です。
竹内氏 素晴らしい！ 私の持論ですが、国語ができる（＝日本語できちんとした文章が書ける）人じゃないとプログラムは書けない。これは非常に重要です。情報処理推進機構（IPA）未踏IT人材発掘・育成事業（未踏プロジェクト）で、逸材中の逸材といわれた登大遊（のぼり
だいゆう）君も、国語力がすごい。プログラミング能力と国語力が同じくらいじゃないかな。本当にすごいプログラマは国語ができる人が多いです。いま日本は文章を書くという教育をほとんどしていないですが、林君は自分で文章を書く勉強をしたことはありますか？
林氏 本は好きで小さいころからよく読んでいました。特別にものを書く勉強をしたことはないですが、作文を書くときにはそれなりの注意を払って書きます。あと、日本語の文法にも興味があります。
竹内氏 そのセンスが重要なんです。話を聞いて分かったけど、林君は文系っぽいんだよね。その文系っぽい人が計算機に目覚めたときは怖いんですよ。恐ろしい力を発揮しますから。
「 本当に暇だったんです」（林氏）。1冊の部誌が人生を変える
2．――これまでのプログラミング経験を教えてください
竹内氏 プログラミングを始めたきっかけは ？
林氏 中学3年の夏、帰宅部（註）で暇をもてあましていたとき、ふと本棚から中学2年の文化祭でもらったコンピュータ部の部誌を引っ張り出して読んだことです。部誌に書かれていた日本語プログラミング言語TTSneoを見て、これだったら自分でもできそうだと思い、やってみました。
竹内氏 なかなかマイナーな言語ですね。日本語だったら自分でもできそうと思ったんですね。TTSneoの後はどんな言語を勉強しました？
林氏 TTSneoの後はゲームを作るHSPを勉強しました。その後C言語をやろうとして、C++でオブジェクト指向をかじったりしました。そのときはフレンド関数などの使い道がよく分からず、オブジェクトは構造体に毛が生えたもの程度にしか思っていませんでした。そして、中学3年の冬にプログラミング言語の処理系の作り方を知りました。
竹内氏 中学3年の夏から勉強し始めて中学3年の冬には処理系の作り方を？ 早いね！ 教科書を読んで勉強したんですか？
林氏：処理系の作り方は、『いまどきのプログラミング言語の作り方』という本で勉強しました。この本にプロトタイプベースのオブジェクト指向について書かれていて……。
竹内氏 いきなりそこに行くか？！ この本をきっかけにいろいろなプログラミング言語を習得したんですか？
林氏 はい。当時、オブジェクト指向はクラスベースという固定観念があったのですが、プロトタイプベースを知ったときにオブジェクト指向は広い意味でもっと面白いものだと思いました。プロトタイプベースのオブジェクト指向に興味を持って、いろいろな言語を眺めるようになりました。ちなみにそのときはまだLispを面白いとは思えなかったんです。Lispの第一印象は「変な言語」。後にプログラミング言語を作ろうとしてもう1度学び直したとき初めてLispの面白さが分かりました。
竹内氏 一般に、オブジェクト指向は入門教育が大変なんです。初心者にとって最初に越えなければならない壁が多いから。まずクラスやインスタンスありきで、最初にやたらと抽象的な概念が出てきます。入門言語としてオブジェクト指向がやりにくいというのは教育界でも定評があります。その点林君の場合はプロトタイプベースから入ってとっつきやすかったんですね。そういうところに自然に入っていくのがすごい。ただ、プロトタイプベースは、職業プログラマに対しては必ずしもお薦めしませんが。
それにしても、本当にプログラミング言語遍歴が速いよね。中学3年の夏休み（8月）からTTSneo、HSP、C言語を勉強したんですよね。
林氏 はい、です がCは文法だけ眺めて止めにしました。これでプログラムは作れないかな、と思ったんです。低水準過ぎる気がして……
竹内氏 あー、いいね〜その感覚。それで、中学3年の冬休み（1月）にC++に移って、その後プロトタイプベースのオブジェクト指向とJavaを学ぶと。
林氏 自分でもこんなに早かったっけ、と思います。
竹内氏 TTSneo、HSP、C、C++、Java。つまり8月から1月の5カ月で、5個のプログラミング言語を習得したんだ？！
特別なセンスですね。ほかにどんな言語を勉強したんですか？

On a rainy Friday in November , Feinberg drives me in his beaten - up Toyota to Island Park , about 50 miles outside Manhattan , to see what will become the organisation ’s new headquarters .
Until now the men have worked out of their homes , and they often get together in car - parks and drive - through restaurants .
A friend of Rescue Ink has just donated a small , derelict house that sits on three quarters of an acre overlooking a creek .
There is a disused boat warehouse that Feinberg wants to renovate so that animals can be temporarily housed there if the local laws will allow it ( they are waiting to hear ) .
During the men ’s downtime they have been clearing the house of debris and repairing what they can .
The wooden steps up to the door have rotted away .
Inside , on an old fridge , someone has written the group ’s motto in big black letters : you abuse , you lose .
There will be an office here , one of the bedrooms will , they hope , be used to house kittens and puppies , and there will be a sitting - room where the men can hang out between jobs .
' When we get together , no one is talking about sports or motorbikes any more – all the guys talk about is animals and the cases they have covered , ’ Feinberg says .
China operates a broad - based net filtering system
Australian government plans to filter net use have been rebuffed by local internet service providers ( ISPs ) .
Telstra , Australia 's largest ISP , has said it will not join trials of the filters and others say they will only back a scaled - down system .
The government wants to filter all net traffic and block access to 10,000 sites deemed to hold illegal content .
The initial trials of the filtering technology were due to take place before Christmas .
Protest plan
Australian newspaper
The Age reports that both Telstra and Internode have declared they will not participate in the trials .
iiNet said it wanted to take part to show that the filters do not work and Optus would only work with a scaled back plan .
The plan to set up mandatory filters followed research by the Australian Communications and Media Authority which found that existing filters did a poor job of blocking illegal content .
Responding to the rebuff by ISPs , Australia 's communications minister Stephen Conroy said the initial trials would not be " closed " and involve no actual customers .
Optus said it would take part in the trial in early 2009 but would only impose filters that blocked access to a 1300 - strong list of sites hosting illegal content .
It said it would not block access to the full 10,000 sites demanded by the Australian government nor impose the second tier of filtering that blocks sites unsuitable for children .
Politicians for Australia 's Green party called on the government to abandon the filtering plan which has been widely criticised .
Protests are expected on 13 December in Sydney and Melbourne calling for an end to the scheme .
I ’m happy to inform you that we are entering the beta stage of IDA v5.4 !
In addition to numerous small and not that small improvements , the new version will have three debugger modules : bochs , gdb , and windbg , selectable on the fly ( the active debugger session will be closed , though ; ) )
With the bochs debugger , we offer three different worlds : run-any - code - snippet facility , windows - like - environment for PE files , and any - bochs - image bare - bone machine emulation mode .
You can read more about this module in our blog : http://hexblog.com/2008/11/bochs_plugin_goes_alpha.html

With gdb , x86 and arm targets are supported .
Among other things , it is possible to connect IDA to QEMU or debug a virtual machine inside VMWare .
We tried it iPhone as well .
However , while it works in some curcimstances , there were some problems on the gdbserver side .

We tried it as well .
However , while it works in some curcimstances , there were some problems on the gdbserver side .
With windbg , user and kernel mode debugging is available .
The debugger engine from Microsoft , which is currently the only choice for driver and kernel mode debugging , can be used from IDA .
It can automatically load required PDB files and populate the listing with meaningful names , types , etc .
Speaking of PDB files , IDA imports more information from them : local function variables and types are retrieved too , c++ base classes are handled , etc .
The gdb and windbg debugger modules support local and remote debugging .
We tried to make the debugger modules as open as possible : target - specific commands can be sent to all backend engines in a very easy and user - friendly way .
As usual , better analysis and many minor changes have been made .
If you spend plenty of time analyzing gcc generated binaries , you ’ll certainly appreciate that IDA handles its weird way of preparing outgoing function arguments .
Now it can trace and find arguments copies to the stack with mov statements .
The new IDA will support Python out of box , thanks to Gergely Erdelyi , who kindly agreed the Python plugin to be included in the official distribution .
In fact , the main IDA window will have a command line to enter any python ( or other language ) expressions and immediately get a result in the message window .
We will prepare the detailed list of improvements later this week .
Probe into cosmetic surgeon who ' powered his 4x4 with his patients ' excess flab '
If you 're keen to establish your green credentials you can install solar panels or stick a wind turbine on your roof .
Or you could become a patient of Dr Alan Bittner .
The leading Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon claims to be saving the planet by using fat removed from clients in liposuction operations to power his 4x4 car .
Dr Alan Bittner says he turned fat sucked out of patients in liposuction operations into biodiesel - or ' lipodiesel ' - for his 4x4 vehicle
According to Dr Bittner , his patients are more than happy to be involved in the extraordinary eco-friendly scheme .
' The vast majority of my patients request that I use their fat for fuel - and I have more fat than I can use , ' he declared .
' Not only do they get to lose their love handles or chubby belly , but they get to take part in saving the Earth . '
U.S. authorities are less impressed and have launched an inquiry into his claims that he is converting the waste fat into bio - diesel - or ' lipodiesel ' as he calls it .
Dr Bittner posted his claims on a website lipodiesel.com , which has since been taken down following the sudden closure of his clinic on Rodeo Drive .
He is believed to have moved to South America after several patients filed a lawsuit against his practice for allegedly allowing his unlicensed girlfriend to carry out operations .
U.S. business magazine Forbes reported that Dr Bittner used the ' lipofuel ' to power both his Ford Explorer and his girlfriend 's Lincoln Navigator .
Bio - diesel is commonly made from vegetable oils , although half of the U.S. supply comes from beef or pig products .
Animal and vegetable fat contains triglycerides that can be extracted and turned into diesel .
U.S. authorities have launched an inquiry into Dr Bittner 's claims he used human body fat to power his car
It is not known how Dr Bittner went about turning the fat sucked out of patients into fuel .
But he claims to have carried out more than 7,000 lipo operations - and according to Forbes , a gallon of fat will produce about a gallon of fuel , and drivers can get about the same amount of mileage from fat fuel as they do from regular diesel .
However , it is illegal in the U.S. to use human medical waste to power vehicles .
The doctor is being investigated by California 's public health department .
Dr Bittner 's lawyer did n't return calls seeking comment .
The magazine said his activities came to light after recent lawsuits filed by patients that allege he allowed his assistant and his girlfriend to perform surgery when neither held a medical licence .
Lawyer Andrew Besser , who represents three patients , claims the assistant and girlfriend removed too much fat from clients and left them disfigured .
Dozens of other patients have complained to the state medical board , according to Mr Besser .
On his official clinic website Dr Bittner claims he offers patients a more advanced form of liposuction called liposculpture .
The website says : ' After years of experience with various cosmetic procedures , Dr Bittner founded Beverly Hills Liposculpture and personally trained his team of specialists to focus solely on liposculpture - a far more advanced form of liposuction .
' By focusing on liposculpture , Dr Bittner has developed a unique minimally invasive technique that allows patients to remain awake and comfortable while his team sculpts and contours their body . '
A small notice on the website reveals that Dr Bittner has gone to Bogota , Colombia .
He says : ' After ten years in practice , I have treated over 40,000 patients , including almost 7,000 liposculpture patients .
I am proud to be able to tell you that the record of my liposculpture practice has been impeccable ; not one single serious complication or infection .
' Liposculpture is truly my passion and I have been extremely fortunate , however after ten years of private practice , I am going back to South America to volunteer with a small clinic that is very similar to where my medical career began decades ago , where I can help those most in need . '

2004 How I Did
In each of the past five years I ’ve written a predictions post – usually at year ’s end or by the first of January .
This one is late , and I ’ll admit it ’s because I found it hard to write .
The world is showing itself to be predictable in only one way : bad news begets bad news .
I ’ve spent a lot of the past two weeks , where I was ostensibly “ not working , ” thinking about what this year will bring .
And I ’m not much further from where I started : this is going to be a very difficult year , for a lot of people .
But I do have a fair amount of hope .
I think times like this force all of us to make honest choices about what we do with our energy , our resources , and our lives .
And in the end , that brings long term health to markets .
Last year I wrote my predictions as something of a narrative , and when I looked back to check how I did , I found it somewhat difficult to mark the scorecard .
So this year , I ’m going to try to be focused , brief , and calculable .
Keep me honest , will you ?
1. Macro economy :
We ’ll see an end to the recession , taken literally , by Q4 09 .
In other words , the economy will begin to grow again by the end of the year , but it wo n’t feel like we ’re out of the woods till next year at the earliest .
That ’s because Q4 08 was so damn bad , Q4 09 , rife as it will be with government stimulus , will look much better .
But until we have another year or two to really find our footing , it ’s going to feel like we ’re treading water .
2 . The online media space will be hit hard by the economic downturn in the first half , but by year ’s end , will have chalked up moderate gains over last year in terms of gross spend .
I think it ’s possible that Q1 09 will be lower than Q1 08 , marking the first time that has happened since 01 , if I recall correctly .
This will cause all sorts of consternation and hand wringing , but in the end , it wo n’t matter .
The web is where people are spending their time , the web will be where marketers spend their money .
3 . Google will see search share decline significantly for the first time ever .
It will also struggle to find an answer to the question of how it diversifies its revenue in 2009 .
Search is the ultimate harvester of demand , and Google has become search ’s Archer Daniels Midland – wherever a seed of demand might pop its head through the web ’s soil , Google is there to harvest it .
The media business is more than a demand fulfillment business , and Google must learn to create demand if it ’s going to diversify .
That means playing the brand game – a game that has long been owned by what we call “ traditional media companies . ”
With these companies in a paralyzing economic death spiral ( and their new media brethren , Microsoft , AOL , and Yahoo , in continued strategic sclerosis ) , Google has a unique opportunity to become a new kind of branded media company .
It will fail to do so , mainly for cultural reasons .
4. Despite # 3 above , Google stock will soar in by Q3 - 4 of 2009 , mainly because demand will pick up , and when demand picks up , it ’s like rain on a field of newly sown wheat .
This after the stock tanks when the first half of # 3 , above , becomes apparent .
5 . Tied to # 3 above , Microsoft will gain at least five points of search share in 2009 , perhaps as much as 10 .
This is a rather radical prediction , I know , but hear me out .
I think Redmond is tired of losing in this game , and after trying nearly every trick in the book , Microsoft will start to spend real money to grow share ( IE , buying distribution ) , while at the same time listening to the advice of thoughtful folks who want to help the company improve the product .
However , search share is half the game , as we know .
The second half is monetization , and Microsoft will continue to struggle here , unless it manages to buy Yahoo ’s search business .
Which it wo n’t , because ….
6. Yahoo and AOL will merge .
7 . However , in the second half of the year , Microsoft will buy its search monetization from the combined company .
8 . Apple will see a significant reversal of recent fortunes .
I sense this will happen for a number of reasons ( yeah yeah ) , but I think the main one will be brand related – a brand based on being cooler than the other guy simply does not scale past a certain point .
I sense Apple has hit that point .
9 . Major brands will continue to struggle with the best way to interact with “ social media . ”
They will take budget reserved for media spending ( IE buying banners and building out branding campaigns ) and start to become publishers in their own right .
This is not a new tactic ( many marketers , in particular technology companies , have published magazines , for example , and many consumer brands create or co-create television series ) , but given the plastic and social nature of online media , many marketers will see these efforts fail , in particular when the efforts are executed in partnership with major media companies .
The reason has to do with putting the cart before the horse : in order to truly succeed in conversational media , the company must itself be fluent in that conversation .
A partner with tons of traffic , but who is not fluent , will not be the “ translator ” major brands need .
10 .
Agencies will increasingly see their role as that of publishers .
Publishers will increasingly see their role as that of agencies .
Both can win at this , but only by understanding how to truly add value to real communities – not flash crowds driven by one time events .
I do n’t see a conflict here , long term .
As opposed to simply being creators of media , media companies have realized ( or will soon ) that their job is to create platforms for communities to make media .
Publishers are agents for communities , agencies are agents for brands .
They need each other .
It takes both agents to get good media made .
11 . Twitter will continue its meteoric rise .
This is a very hard prediction to make , because so much depends on the company ’s ability to execute two crucial – and exceedingly difficult – new features :
The integration of search into the service , and the monetization of that integration .
I think Twitter ’s management team ( and its backers ) will want to keep the service independent through 2009 , both because prices are down but also because I think they want to prove something ( this will not keep nearly every major web media company from trying to buy Twitter ) .
The company has a tiger by the tail , and two really defensible assets : a passionate , committed , and growing community , on the one hand , and a valuable , growing , and meaningful database of realtime conversations on the other .
Note I did * not* say they have algorithms .
That will come .
But the key is the community and the conversation that community is having .
By the middle of 2009 , the integration of Twitter ’s community and content will become commonplace in well - executed marketing on third party sites .
12 . Facebook will do something entirely shocking and unpredictable .
I am not certain what , but it wo n’t have a “ status quo ” year .
It might be a merger with a traditional media company , a major alliance with Google , hiring a head scratcher as CEO , or something else at that level of “ WTF ! ? ”
As I think about it , it might be as simple as making Facebook Connect truly open , and changing its policies to make it drop dead easy to get data out of the service .
Also , Facebook will build a Twitter competitor , but it will never leave beta and will ultimately be abandoned as not worth the time .
Instead , Facebook will “ friend ” Twitter and the two companies will become strong partners .
13 . Lucky # 13 is reserved for my eternal mobile prediction : 2009 will see the year mobility becomes presumptive in every aspect of the web .
By that I mean what I wrote back in 2007 : “ Mobile will finally be plugged into the web in a way that makes sense for the average user and a major mobile innovation – the kind that makes us all say – Jeez that was obvious – will occur .
At the core of this innovation will be the concept of search ”
14 . Lastly , I promise , I will have sold my book and will be hard at work on it .
And yes , still running FM too .
I think I have a way to do both , given I wrote 15 K words last year without even knowing it ….
Happy New Year , Searchblog readers , and thanks for caring enough to read my musings .
Here ’s to hard work , smart choices , and learning from our mistakes … .
Andrew Sullivan : " We Need to Take A Machete to Social Security "
By Ben Cohen
Andrew Sullivan 's pig headed adherence to idiotic libertarianism is a habit he just cannot kick .
His solution for the countries economic woes consists in part of cutting off vital support for the poor .
He writes :
We need to take a machete to social security and Medicare and a very
sharp scalpel to all domestic discretionary spending .
To be fair , Sullivan is not completely wrong , as he targets ludicrous military spending and aid to lackey countries :
And we need to
think very hard about big withdrawals of troops in Europe , Asia and the

Middle East , and about the foreign aid we give Egypt and Israel .
Between the boomers at home and the expanding , unending empire abroad ,
the next generation will have no sane fiscal future unless something is
done very very soon .
Sullivan 's problem is his inability to recognize the painful truth about Western economic development - that the free market has never existed , and economic growth is a result of protectionism , state planning and massive corporate welfare .
Cutting welfare as a matter of ideology is just plain stupid - there is a need to be judicious in how tax dollars are spent , and that means supporting key sectors of the economy , and making sure people do not starve to death .
George Bush made decisions based on ideology regardless of the results , a trait Sullivan despised .
Why he continues to follow an ideology that has collapsed on itself is baffling to say the least .
An American education professor , one of the founders of a radical 1960s group known as the Weather Underground , which was responsible for a number of bombings in the United States in the early 1970s , was turned back at the Canadian border last night .
William Ayers , a professor of education at the University of Illinois - Chicago and a leader in educational reform , was scheduled to speak at the Centre for Urban Schooling at University of Toronto 's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education .
But that appearance has now been temporarily cancelled .
" I do n't know why I was turned back , " Ayers said in an interview this morning from Chicago .
" I got off the plane like everyone else and I was asked to come over to the other side .
The border guards reviewed some stuff and said I was n't going to be allowed into Canada .
To me it seems quite bureaucratic and not at all interesting ...
If it were me I would have let me in .
I could n't possibly be a threat to Canada . "
Ayers made headlines this summer after Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin suggested that then - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama hung around with domestic terrorists like Ayers .
The professor had hosted a meet - the - candidate event at his home for Obama in 1995 , during his run for the state Senate .
They also worked together on Chicago school reform and served on a charity board together .
Ayers first rose to notoriety in the early 1970s with the Weather Underground .
The group claimed responsibility for bombings at the U.S. Capitol , a Pentagon restroom and New York City police headquarters .
In 1970 , a townhouse in New York the group was using to build a bomb blew up .
Nowadays , Ayers is known more for his work in educational reform .
He has written or edited more than a dozen books — including his 2001 memoir Fugitive Days — and travels around the world giving lectures on education .
Jeffrey Kugler , executive director of the Centre for Urban Schooling , is deeply disappointed in the turn of events .
For him it's a question of academic freedom .
" It 's kind of ironic the day before Barack Obama is going to become president this is what the Canadian border security has done , " said Kugler .
" It seems ridiculous that one university can't have a professor from another university to come and give a lecture on an important educational topic . "
Kugler waited for five hours at the Toronto Island airport for Ayers .
He was with a lawyer , but the border guard refused to allow Ayers to see the lawyer .
" The entire four or five hours he was not allowed to have representation at all .
To me this is an issue of academic freedom .
He could not be a threat to anyone ever .
Anyone who knows anything about this man – he's a distinguished scholar at the University of Illinois and he has been involved in education reform over the past 15 years .
To imagine in any way he was a threat to Canada is really absurd . "

It ’s a Christmas gift to us fanboys from Fox !
It seems that their copyright case against Warner Brothers has done the trick and this may cause the film not to open come March :
Fox wins ruling in ‘ Watchmen ’ case
“ A Los Angeles federal judge has ruled that 20th Century Fox owns the distribution rights to “ Watchmen , ” representing a setback for Warner Bros . ’ plans to release the pic in March .
“ Fox owns a copyright interest consisting of , at the very least , the right to distribute the ‘ Watchmen ’ motion picture , ” the ruling said .
Judge Gary Allen Feess issued the surprise ruling Wednesday — a week after setting a Jan. 20 trial date for Fox ’s suit — and indicated he would issue a more detailed ruling soon . ”

I wo n't ramble too much .
Most stories are the same .
I just want to tell you what I notice now that I 'm stable .--
Here 's me :
At age 18 I was a drug mule and got busted on my first trip .
My first time , but the amount ( marijuana ) was enormous and I got 4 years .
First two years out , I had some bad luck with roommates ; got robbed so much by my own roomies I had to move out but was then immediately hit by the back - rent no one paid .
No one could be located except for -- guess who -- me .--
I had the apartment 's lawyers and the phone company chasing me for money .
How'd you like to hire somone who has at least two garnishments you have to figure out for each paycheck ?
Also , would you like to lease an apartment to a guy who has an unpaid judgment from his last apartment ?
Do n't forget the convicted felon part .
So , I was homeless for about 4 years until the manager of a car dealership took a chance on me and now I am the manager of our detailing department .
Okay , so what are the things that I really appreciate ?--
Light switches :
In a shelter , lights come on , lights come off and you have no say .
The ability to control your own lighting is a big deal .--
Access to toilets :
Ever hear someone mention how those ' disgusting ' homeless guys pee outside ?
Where else should we ?
The search for a place to relieve yourself is a constant problem when you are on the streets .--
Weather : I do n't pay much attention to weather anymore .
On the streets , weather is your life .
A homeless guy rummaging for newspapers only wants one section , the weather report .
If you can read , and you know the weather , you will have every dude you know asking what is coming .--
Clean water :
Are you impressed with the cleanliness of your average gas station restroom ?
How'd you like to drink from that sink ?--
Not losing things :
Homeless shelters are life - savers in bad weather , but they are also a guarrantee that you will lose all your stuff .
Either it 's stolen while you sleep , or the shelter staff told you you have to leave it outside .
Secret hiding places never are .--
Night fear :
You never stop being afraid of being outside at night .
Think it 's scary to have a breakdown at night ?
Someone gets mad , gets drunk or gets mean , you are going to be the first person they find .--
Internet : I am now an internet addict .
I got arrested in 1997 and I barely heard of the net back then .
When I got my job in 2005 , I got sent to a computer class right away .
When I got my own place six months ago , I went all out and got my own computer plus an internet line .
It is like magic .
I can not get enough of it .-- Health Care Fear : Did you hear about that Bumfights video ?
It 's BS !
No homeless guys are going to fight .
We never fight each other because everyone is afraid of getting hurt .
You hear about guys who sprain their ankle and then die because they could n't move for two weeks .
Or , you hear about a guy who cuts his arm and his arm swells up the size of his leg .
Little injuries kill .
I was always terrified of getting hurt because of that .--
The Looks : I admit , I got used to the looks from people in the real world .
I kept a pretty clean appearance but people can always tell when you are in the 7 - 11 just to warm up or kill time .
I never minded the looks .
Did n't really care , not sure why .--
Girls : I still have not solved the girlfriend riddle , but I love talking to ladies when they come pick up their car and see that we made it look like new .
Seeing a woman 's smile is nice .
When a woman smiles AT you , its like nothing else in the world .
The IDF is looking into two incidents in which friendly fire claimed the lives of four soldiers in Gaza .
Both incidents had similar characteristics .
In both , tanks fired shells at buildings that were suspected of providing cover for terrorists , but in reality , IDF soldiers were located there at the time .
The first incident , in which three soldiers were killed , took place Monday night on the outskirts of the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip .
A tank fired a shell at a building containing Golani soldiers , after they had erroneously been identified as terrorists .
In this incident , another 24 soldiers were wounded , one of them critically .
The casualties from this incident have been identified .
They are : Major Dagan Wartman , 32 , from Ma'aleh Mikhmash , a doctor by profession , who will be laid to rest at 3:30 pm at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl ; St - Sgt Nitai Stern , 21 , from Jerusalem will be laid to rest at 1:30 pm at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl ; and Cpl Yousef Moadi , 19 , from Haifa will be laid to rest at 3:00 pm at the Bircha cemetery .
The second incident took place early Tuesday in Gaza .
One of the walls of the building in which an officer was hiding collapsed , apparently after an IDF shell hit it .
The officer killed was identified as Captain Yonatan Netanel , 27 , from Kedumim .
The time and location of his funeral have yet to be determined .
Netanel was the deputy company commander of the 202nd Paratroopers Brigade .
A central question raised in the investigation is that of authorization to open fire , and whether this was obtained according to the standard protocol as established by IDF regulations .
IDF officers noted that though both incidents are difficult to accept , they occurred in the complex environment of the battle field in which many events take place simultaneously .
The IDF investigation is also examining whether the infantry soldiers took the proper measures to coordinate their entry into the building , as would befit such actions .
In both incidents , the tanks firing the shells were from the same brigade .
However , it is important to note that this does not indicate a malfunction within the brigade , but rather testifies to the complexity of ground operations .
The whole world is in recession .
But the United States is the only wealthy country in which the economic catastrophe will also be a health care catastrophe  in which millions of people will lose their health insurance along with their jobs , and therefore lose access to essential care .
Which raises a question :
Why has the Obama administration been silent , at least so far , about one of President Obama ’s key promises during last year ’s campaign  the promise of guaranteed health care for all Americans ?
Let ’s talk about the magnitude of the looming health care disaster .
Just about all economic forecasts , including those of the Obama administration ’s own economists , say that we ’re in for a prolonged period of very high unemployment .
And high unemployment means a sharp rise in the number of Americans without health insurance .
After the economy slumped at the beginning of this decade , five million people joined the ranks of the uninsured  and that was with the unemployment rate peaking at only 6.3 percent .
This time the Obama administration says that even with its stimulus plan , unemployment will reach 8 percent , and that it will stay above 6 percent until 2012 .
Many independent forecasts are even more pessimistic .

Google Mapsによって、ウェブサイトに簡単に地図を加えることができるが、GoogleのAPIを使用している場合は、他のデータを表示する能力は限定される。自分自身のデータや、Google以外のデータを表示したい場合に、より多くのオプションを提供してくれるのが、オープンソースのJavaScriptライブラリ
OpenLayers である。
OpenLayersは最近、いくつかの著名な活動において利用されている。Djangoの開発者であるAdrian Holovaty氏らが運営する地域的ニュースサイトEveryBlockにも使用され、また、Barack Obama次期大統領の選挙キャンペーンにおいても、その米国大統領選を支援するための地図情報の一環として使用された。
OpenLayersを最初に開発したのは、地理情報を扱う企業MetaCartaだが、現在ではBSDライセンスの下で公開されている。OpenLayersでは、Open Geospatial Consortium のWeb Map Service （WMS ） とWeb Feature Serviceの両プロトコルが実装されている。同ライブラリは積極的に開発が進められており、バージョン2.7が9月にリリースされた。
OpenLayersを使用するには、これへのリンクを張るか、OpenLayersのウェブサイトからダウンロードする。
OpenLayersは、GeoServerやMapServerなどのパッケージを用いて個人が独自に提供するデータにも適用できるし、WMSを介して公開されているデータにも適用できる。表示するデータを持つWMSサーバを検索するための容易な方法は存在しないが、ExploreOurPla.netには検索可能なインデックスが提供されており、3万個以上もの一般アクセス可能なレイヤが含まれているという。
マップとレイ ヤ
NASA OnEarth は 、WMSを介してデータを公開している。中でも有名なのは、衛星画像Blue Marble Next Generation （BMNG）である。このデータにアクセスするには、WMSサーバのURLと使用したいマップレイヤの名称を知っている必要がある。本記事では、NASAのWMSサーバとBlue Marble Next Generationの画像を用いて、OpenLayersの使用方法を説明する。
OpenLayersの最も簡単なマップは、1つのOpenLayers.Mapオブジェクトと、1つ以上のOpenLayers.Layersオブジェクトから構成される。以下に、ウェブページにBlue Marble画像を表示するための簡単なOpenLayersスクリプトと、それに付随するHTMLを示す。
< html > < head > < title > OpenLayers tutorial </ title > < script src= "
http://openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js " ></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > function setHTML ( response ) { document.getElementById('nodeList').innerHTML = response.responseText ; } function init ( ) { var options = { minResolution : " auto " , minExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 1 ) , maxResolution : " auto " , maxExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 180 , - 90 , 180 , 90 ) , } ; var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , options ) ; var NASAwms = new OpenLayers .
Layer .
WMS ( " NASA WMS " , " http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi? " , {layers : ' BMNG ' , format : ' image / png'} , {isBaseLayer : true} ) ; map.addLayer( NASAwms ) ; map.zoomToMaxExtent ( ) ; } </script > < style type =" text /css " > # map { width : 500 px ; height : 250 px ; border : 1 px solid black ; } </style > < / head > < body onload= " init ( ) " > < div id =" map " ></div > < div id=" nodeList " ></div > </body > </html >
OpenLayersで表示したNASAのBlue Marbleの画像
これは 、NASAのWMSサーバから画像を取得し、デフォルトのパンおよびズームコントロールとともに表示するための基本的なスクリプトである。このコードをコピーして、ページをウェブブラウザで開けば、青と緑の地球の衛星画像が表示される。
単一のレイヤしか表示できないわけではない。NASA のBlue Marbleでは美しい衛星画像が提供されているが、境界線など詳細部分が欠けている。米国地質研究所（US
Geological Survey ）もWMSを介してデータを公開している。別のレイヤを作成すれば、
States_Generalized レイヤを用いて米国の州境界線を取得することができる。
USGSによる States_Generalized レイヤを表示するためのコードを追加すると、先ほどのスクリプトは次のようになる。
< script src= " http://openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js " ></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > function setHTML ( response ) { document.getElementById('nodeList').innerHTML = response.responseText ; } function init ( ) { var options = { minResolution : " auto " , minExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 1 ) , maxResolution : " auto " , maxExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 180 , - 90 , 180 , 90 ) , } ; var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , options ) ; var NASAwms = new OpenLayers .
Layer .
WMS ( " NASA WMS " , " http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi? " , {layers : ' BMNG ' , format : ' image / png'} , {isBaseLayer : true} ) ; var USGSwms = new OpenLayers .
Layer .
WMS ( " USGS WMS " , " http://toposervices.cr.usgs.gov/wmsconnector/com.esri.wms.Esrimap/USGS_EDNA_geo? " , {layers : ' States_Generalized ' , format : ' image/png'} , {isBaseLayer : false} ) ; map.addLayer( NASAwms ) ; map.addLayer( USGSwms ) ; map.zoomToMaxExtent ( ) ; } </script >
ここでブラウザの表示を更新してみると、そこに表示される地図は期待していたものとは違っているかもしれない。そこには米国各州の境界線が白い背景上に表示されているだけである。最初のスクリプトでは、「 is BaseLayer : true 」というオプション でNASA 画像をベースレイヤに設定した。他のレイヤはその上に重ねられるため、ベースレイヤを隠してしまう可能性がある。同時に両方のレイヤを表示するには、USGSレイヤのオプションに「 transparent : true 」を追加して、これを透明に表示しなければならない。
OpenLayersによるマルチレイヤのマップ
ここでついでに、地図の初期表示状態を変更しておこう。米国の州境界線のレイヤを加えたので、米国を中心に表示するよう設定するとよいだろう。
これを行うには、緯度と経度、および初期ズームレベルを設定する。ワシントンDCを中心とするには、 lat と lon とい う2つの変数を作成し、それぞれの値を38.890000と-77.020000にする。次に zoom という変数を作成してその値を3とすれば、地図はワシントンDCを中心に拡大され、米国の東部海岸地区のほぼ全域を表示するサイズになる。
map.zoomToMaxExtent ( ) ; という行の代わりに、これらの変数を用いた map.setCenter(new OpenLayers .LonLat( lon , lat ) , zoom ) ; を入れると、上述の初期表示設定が完了する。
上記の変更を加えたスクリプトは、以下のようになる。
< script src= " http://openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js " ></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > function setHTML ( response ) { document.getElementById('nodeList').innerHTML = response.responseText ; } function init ( ) { var lat = 38.890000 ; var lon = - 77.020000 ; var zoom = 3 ; var options = { minResolution : " auto " , minExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 1 ) , maxResolution : " auto " , maxExtent : new OpenLayers .
Bounds ( - 180 , - 90 , 180 , 90 ) , } ; var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , options ) ; var NASAwms = new OpenLayers .
Layer .
WMS ( " NASA WMS " , " http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi? " , {layers : ' BMNG ' , format : ' image / png'} , {isBaseLayer : true} ) ; var USGSwms = new OpenLayers .
Layer .
WMS ( " USGS WMS " , " http://toposervices.cr.usgs.gov/wmsconnector/com.esri.wms.Esrimap/USGS_EDNA_geo? " , {layers : ' States_Generalized ' , format : ' image / png ' , transparent : true} , {isBaseLayer : false} ) ; map.addLayer( NASAwms ) ; map.addLayer( USGSwms ) ; map.setCenter(new OpenLayers .LonLat( lon , lat ) , zoom ) ; } </script >
マーカー
Google Mapsと同様にOpenLayersでは、地図上の興味のある地点にマーカーを配置することができる。これを行うための最も簡単な方法は、テキストレイヤを作成することである。
テキストレイヤは、1つ以上の興味のある地点に関する緯度と経度、名称、説明、使用するアイコンが並んだ、タブ区切りテキストファイルを読んで表示する。地図に表示されたマーカーをクリックすると、その地点の名称と説明を示すテキストバブルが表示される。その表示はHTMLで制御することができる。もう一度マーカーをクリックすると、テキストバブルが閉じる。
ワシントンDC、ニューヨーク、アトランタの各都市に、OpenLayersのデフォルトのアイコンをマーカーとして表示する、簡単なテキストレイヤファイルを以下に示す。
point title description icon 38.905 , -77.016 < h4 > Washington DC </ h4 > Population : 588,292 40.664,-73.938 < h4 > New York </ h4 > Population : 8,274,527 33.763,-84.423 < h4 >

Intelligence cherry - picked for ideological purposes ; the claims of a single , unreliable source treated as fact and stovepiped straight up to the White House ; a National Intelligence Estimate riddled with dubious claims ; efforts made to connect an enemy regime with international terrorism .
Echoing the prelude to the Iraq War , these are , in fact , a sampling of the allegations directed at Robert Gates 15 years ago , when the Senate Intelligence Committee considered Gates ’ nomination to be the director of Central Intelligence .
Back then , the Senate hearings on Gates — who is now President Bush ’s nominee for secretary of defense , and who is expected to be confirmed as early as next week — were lively , controversial , and went on for a full month .
Senators heard from a variety of witnesses , including a handful of Gates ’ former colleagues at the CIA , who painted a damaging portrait of the nominee .
Among them was 24 - year CIA veteran Melvin Goodman , a friend and fellow Soviet buff who came up with Gates at the agency during the height of the Cold War .
Goodman told the senators that Gates had helped manipulate intelligence to fit the hawkish perspective advanced by officials in the Reagan administration — in particular by seeking to link the Soviet Union with acts of terrorism , including the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II .
“ Frankly , I worry about the signal that would be sent by returning Gates to the environment he created , ” Goodman testified on October 1 , 1991 .
“ I worry about the effect this would have on the standards of others back at the Central Intelligence Agency to be led by someone so lacking in vision , integrity , and courage . ”
When Gates appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee this week , he ’s unlikely to face the level of scrutiny he did in 1991 — when 31 Democratic Senators voted against him — or , for that matter , in 1987 , when lingering questions about his role in Iran - Contra forced him to withdraw from the confirmation process altogether .
Nor will senators hear from Goodman , who is now a senior fellow at the Washington - based Center for International Policy and an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University .
When I caught up with Goodman recently , I asked him why he decided to testify against his boss — and friend — back in ’91 .
Melvin Goodman :
The issue was politicization for me — that is , the way that Bob Gates was taking intelligence and spinning it towards a policy purpose .
My direct experience was on matters dealing with the Soviet Union and particularly the papal plot assessment of 1985 , but actually intelligence was being politicized on a variety of issues dealing with Iran , Central America , Afghanistan , and the Middle East .
Mother Jones :
What was the impetus for this , in your view ?
MG : It was in part the Reagan Administration and in part Bill Casey , who was the CIA director — his views on covert action and his views on policy .
For Gates his master was Bill Casey , and Casey was an extremist on various issues and went further than the administration .
I think Iran - Contra was part of that .
MJ : What kinds of incidents specifically were you concerned about ?
MG :
The key , the thing that really drove me away , was the assessment on the papal plot in which Bill Casey , four years after the assassination attempt on the pope , came across a raw operational report from a Bulgarian source that was thirdhand — it referred to Soviet involvement in the papal plot .
On the basis of that one raw report Casey wanted a sensitive assessment prepared that would be given only to about a half - dozen senior leaders , including the president and the vice president , and he turned to Gates , who was the DDI [ deputy director for intelligence ] , and said , “ Get this done . ”
Gates was the one to pick the three people to do it .
He had them work in secret .
It was this memo that I found on the desk of one of the authors , her name was Kay Oliver .
I took the memo , I Xeroxed it , and I went to my boss , Douglas MacEachin .
And then I went to Gates and confronted him .
MJ : What happened ?
MG : It got ugly .
He wanted to know how I found out about it , and I told him .
I admitted that I did n’t have direct access to it , that I found it on someone ’s desk and I Xeroxed it .
I admitted I was skulking around .
There were rumors that things were being prepared that were n’t being processed through the Office of Soviet Affairs , and I knew who the people would have been because Gates engaged in what I call “ judge shopping in the courthouse . ”
If you want something done — and that ’s how politicization is done — you go to someone who you think will agree with you .
It ’s not that you order someone to do something .
That ’s not how politicization works in an organization like the CIA , or probably any other organization for that matter .
They knew who to pick .
He said I had no right to have access to this document , it was a sensitive matter at the direction of the CIA director .
I reminded him that he had testified in 1983 that the Soviets were not involved in the papal plot .
He said things had changed , the evidence had changed , and he said that anyway this memo was going to be hypothetical .
Of course , Gates then put a cover note on all of these memos , and his cover note made it clear that this assessment , was based on the best intelligence we ’d ever collected on this subject .
So much for hypothetical .
MJ : And it was based on one source ?
MG : It was one report from one source .
It was a Bulgarian source .
What is really important and why the director of operations had no plan to put out this report in a piece of finished intelligence collection was because he was a GRU source — that is , [ Russian ] military intelligence .
Of course , if the Soviets had been involved it would have been with the KGB , certainly not military intelligence .
So this was a bad source , it was thirdhand , and GRU was not even the right channel .
So no one took the report seriously , but Casey was in the habit of reading raw traffic .
He liked to do that , and people would just gather up reports , particularly the most provocative reports because this is always what Casey was looking for .
MJ : Why did Casey want this memo drawn up in the first place ?
MG : He wanted something to sort of undercut the détente policy of George Shultz .
Secretary of State Shultz , by this point , 1985 , had sort of won a bureaucratic battle within the Reagan administration .
This was the first year of Reagan ’s second term , and Reagan was convinced that his tactics toward the Soviet Union was going nowhere and needed to be changed .
This is what Shultz and people like Jack Matlock , who eventually became the ambassador to the Soviet Union , were arguing .
Of course , he was coming up against the opponents , the neocons of their day , people like Casper Weinberger , the secretary of defense , and Bill Casey .
With this assessment that only went to the president , the vice president , the secretary of state , the secretary of defense , the head of the National Security Council — I think this was Casey ’s way of undercutting détente policy .
And if you go to the Shultz memoir , Turmoil and Triumph : My Years as Secretary of State , it shows his contempt for the CIA , his contempt for Bill Casey , his contempt for Bob Gates , and his confrontation with Bob Gates over the matter of flawed intelligence , corrupted intelligence , and the fact that they were misinforming the president .
It is some of the strongest language I ’ve ever seen between a policymaker and a senior CIA official .
MJ : He basically said , “ I do n’t trust the intelligence coming out of the agency . ”
MG : “ I do n’t trust what you do . ”
Yeah .
Something like , “ If this were a business and you were part of the business , I ’d go somewhere else . ”
He made it clear that what Gates was doing , what he was responsible for , was totally objectionable .
MJ : James Baker also had problems with Gates , if I ’m not mistaken .
MG : There is a passage in the Baker memoir that deals with the speeches Gates was giving in 1989 undercutting his policies of détente .
Baker was engaged at that time at trying to engage Bush to get him back on the arms control track .
Gates was trying to undercut this , with the support of his boss , General [ Brent ] Scowcroft , who was really far more conservative than people give him credit for .
Gates was Scowcroft ’s deputy at this time in 1989 .
MJ : Was the papal plot memo an isolated case , would you say , or did spinning intelligence become more common at the agency ?
MG : I definitely think it did , There was the plot memo and one other very important document .
This was a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran in which Gates essentially prepared the intelligence case on Iran - Contra .
This was to argue that the Soviet Union was trying to put a great deal of pressure on Iran , to bring Iran into the Soviet orbit , and that there were moderates in Iran who were interested in doing business with the United States and that Iran was getting out of the business of terrorism .
All these issues , all these charges and conclusions , were false .
There was no evidence to support any one of them .
But Gates had sort of conspired with the national intelligence officer for the Middle East , Graham Fuller , to try and prepare a memo that would justify Iran - Contra .
And , of course , this gets into the whole issue of what Gates knew about Iran - Contra and the fact that no one on the intelligence committee believed him in 1987 when he said he knew nothing about it .
MJ : As you mentioned , Gates has denied having knowledge of Iran - Contra .
You were at the agency during that period .
Is that plausible ?
MG : Now , fortunately , we have documented evidence about what he knew and who told him what and what meetings he sat in on .
He was briefed by about three different CIA officers .
Gates denied the meetings he had with [ National Security Advisor John ]
Poindexter , which we know he had .
He met regularly with Poindexter , he met regularly with [ Oliver ] North , he sat in on meetings with North and Casey .
I myself think the reason why Casey made Bob Gates his deputy in 1986 is he needed someone who was involved in all the operational matters of Iran - Contra as some security fence within the bureaucracy , someone who knew all of this stuff and could protect it .
In ’87 that ’s why Gates never got to a vote , because no one believed he was telling the truth when he said that he was n’t part of this operation and he knew nothing about it .
In ’91 , they were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt , but there were still 31 votes against Bob Gates , which is more than all of the negative votes against all of the CIA directors going back over a 59 - year period .
MJ : Back in ’ 91 , did you call the Senate Intelligence Committee , or did they call you ?
MG : I was on the verge of calling them , but before I could call them they called me and asked me to come over , which led to three separate meetings with staff .
There were about 12 to 15 people in the room , including the staff director , George Tenet .
MJ : Some of Gates ’ former colleagues at the agency seemed to regard him as an intimidating presence .
Was that your take as well ?
MG : No , you ’ve got to remember I knew him for 20 years .
I knew him from his first day in the building .
I took him to lunch that day .
Our families knew each other , our children were involved in socializing .
[ But ] there was an arrogance about him , the kind of thing you see in the bureaucracy of people who , you know , kiss up and kick down .
Bob Gates was certainly one of those people .
MJ : After Gates was confirmed in ’ 91 , did his performance at the agency do anything to change your view of him ?
MG : No , no .
The issues for me were the way he exercised control over the intelligence output of the CIA .
He virtually killed the Foreign Broadcasting Intelligence Service , FBIS , which was very independent - minded and sort of off the range on some issues .
And Gates wanted to bring a halt to that , and he did .
He did n’t want controversy with the military , so he started sending areas of tactical military intelligence over to the Pentagon , got the CIA out of the business of order of battle intelligence , which is really an unfortunate setback .
He weakened the research bureaus of political , military , and economic reporting .
He sent a lot of imagery analysis the CIA used to do over to the Pentagon , a process that [ John ]
Deutch completed when he came in as CIA director several years later .
The military , remember , during this period was quite angry about what they considered the inept performance of the CIA around the time of Desert Storm , the intelligence failure with regard to Iraqi strategic capabilities and then the weakness of intelligence support during the war .
They had been blasted by [ General Norman ] Schwarzkopf , and Gates called Colin Powell , the chairman of the joint chiefs , to try to get a two - and three - star general to come over to the CIA as a deputy director to further form links between the military , the Pentagon , and the CIA on intelligence matters .
Of course the reason why the CIA was formed was to be independent of policy organizations .
But Gates wanted to avoid these disputes .
I considered him a rather weak CIA director .
MJ : So essentially you ’re saying that Gates handles bureaucracy well .
MG : I think Bob in many ways is the consummate bureaucrat , but without any ethical or moral compass .
He ’s cautious ; he knows how to protect himself ; he knows which documents not to sign ; he knows when to appear uninformed , whether it ’s with colleagues bringing him information which he sort of pretends not to know anything about , or when he goes before the Senate Intelligence Committee in ’91 and says , “ I do n’t recollect . ”
That was about 33 different questions .
He ’s not an innovator .
He ’s not strategic minded .
He has a very good memory .
He ’s a workaholic .
No one is going to work longer hours than Bob Gates , even at the Pentagon where it ’s legendary what some of these careerist colonels and generals do .
Bob Gates will be in there from morning until night .
He will serve his master .
But his master is George W. Bush , not George Herbert Walker Bush and General Scowcroft .
MJ : What are your specific concerns about Gates taking over as secretary of defense ?
MG : My major concerns are issues of integrity .
For me , basically , the test of character is what you do when no one ’s looking .
I do n’t think Bob Gates can be trusted when no one ’s looking .
When military officers keep the Pentagon informed about how bad the situation is in Iraq , what will Gates do with this information ?
Is he willing to tell the president ?
Is he willing to give this story to the president , keeping in mind that the White House still wants to win this war and still feels in many ways that the U.S. is doing very well in Iraq ?
I do n’t think he can be trusted to encourage the Pentagon to report on all sides of the operation inside of Iraq .
In terms of fitness , he does n’t have the skill sets that you would want for a secretary of defense .
He ’s the kind of micromanager in the same way that Bob McNamara and Donald Rumsfeld were .
And I do n’t think you can be a micromanager in the Pentagon , where you ’re talking about a $ 450 billion budget .
I think he ’ll be swallowed up .
He ’s temperamentally unsuited to delegate responsibility , which of course he ’s going to have to do .
I think it ’s going to be difficult for him to solve disputes between the various services over weapons acquisition .
To give Rumsfeld some credit , he was trying to reform the acquisitions process and make that more methodical .
Gates does n’t have those kinds of skills .
MJ : And then there ’s the issue of politicization .
MG : Well , politicization of course would be the key issue in all of this .
You know , the day he entered the CIA he was what I considered to be a realist and a centrist .
And I think the longer he stayed , the more tours he took down at the White House for various National Security Council advisors to the president , the more hard - line he became .
By the time he came back to be deputy director for intelligence under Casey , he was writing memos encouraging the use of military force and warning about the Soviet threat in ways that went way beyond the intelligence record .
Now , of course , he ’ll be in a policy position .
But I ’d worry about his Cold War instincts .
And of course the classic case of the memo he wrote to Casey encouraging the use of military force , air power against Nicaragua , which was written after the Boland Amendment [ outlawing assistance to the Contras ] was passed [ in 1982 ] .
He wrote this memo in December 1984 encouraging military action .
This was using air power against Nicaragua .
Here Gates was not only encouraging Casey in this direction , but he did n’t even provide him with any warning about the fact that these laws had been passed .
MJ : So do you think that means Gates , if confirmed , is going take a hard line on Iran and North Korea ?
MG : I ’m not anticipating that .
And frankly from a policy standpoint , this country is so deeply embedded in Iraq that it does n’t have options for worsening relations in any other areas .
That ’s one of the problems with Iraq .
MJ : Some are saying that the president ’s selection of Gates indicates that he is moving toward some sort of policy shift on Iraq .
But you ’ve written that the president is simply circling the wagons .
MG : I look at this more as damage limitation than anything else , until I see some evidence .
The president is still talking victory , and the vice president is still talking full - court press .
I do n’t see any sign of a real change in policy .
The incredible thing about this administration is why they did nothing for a full year while the situation worsened , certainly since February when I think you had the beginning of a civil war , which we ’ve been in ever since .
MJ : What do you think of the Iraq Study Group ?
MG : I think it ’s smoke and mirrors .
[ Co- chair Lee ]
Hamilton has never had a reputation for looking very deeply at any of the issues he ’s been involved in .
That would be true for Iran - Contra and the 9/11 commission for that matter , where I think he did a really poor job .
[ Co-chair James ]
Baker is there to protect the reputation of the Bush family , the Bush legacy , and the president .
I do n’t consider this operation any different from going down to Florida when he did in 2000 to secure an election victory for the president .
MJ : Since the politicization of intelligence also became an issue during this war , do you expect Gates to face some tough questions on his role in skewing intelligence back in the ’ 80s ?
MG : I guess I do n’t .
I expect a few people to bring it up again for the record to make it clear .
And there is sort of a delicious irony here that we went to war based on politicized intelligence and now one of the major players in terms of that world of politicization is now going to be running the Pentagon .
I do n’t see how you can not point out his role in the past .
But I do n’t expect many senators to go down that road .
I expect a few Democrats to do it .
I hope Carl Levin is one of them .
I expect Dianne Feinstein to be one of them .
But I do n’t think it will become a major issue .
I expect there will probably be five or six votes against him .
Bob is the morning - after pill .
He ’s the one who ’s going to be responsible for aborting Donald Rumsfeld , and people are anxious to get him over to the Pentagon .
And the people at the Pentagon are anxious to see him arrive , so he ’s got all that on his side .
The next chapter of the World Wide Web will not be written in English alone .
Asia already has twice as many Internet users as North America , and by 2012 it will have three times as many .
Already , more than half of the search queries on Google come from outside the United States .
The globalization of the Web has inspired entrepreneurs like Ram Prakash Hanumanthappa , an engineer from outside Bangalore , India .
Mr. Ram Prakash learned English as a teenager , but he still prefers to express himself to friends and family members in his native Kannada .
But using Kannada on the Web involves computer keyboard maps that even Mr. Ram Prakash finds challenging to learn .
So in 2006 he developed Quillpad , an online service for typing in 10 South Asian languages .
Users spell out words of local languages phonetically in Roman letters , and Quillpad ’s predictive engine converts them into local - language script .
Bloggers and authors rave about the service , which has attracted interest from the cellphone maker Nokia and the attention of Google Inc. , which has since introduced its own transliteration tool .
Mr. Ram Prakash said Western technology companies have misunderstood the linguistic landscape of India , where English is spoken proficiently by only about a tenth of the population and even many college - educated Indians prefer the contours of their native tongues for everyday speech .
“ You ’ve got to give them an opportunity to express themselves correctly , rather than make a fool out of themselves and forcing them to use English , ” he said .
The planned LGBT / HIV human rights protest outside the Senegal Embassy in London on Friday 23 January has been canceled .
This is at the request of LGBT and HIV activists in Senegal .
They say negotiations are going well with the Senegalese government for the release of nine men from jail .
Although the activists appreciate our planned protests and have expressed their gratitude for our support , they now feel that negotiations are at a very delicate stage and they are nervous that protests might alienate the government .

Can the Market Balance the Game ?
Putting the Market Inside the Game
The Benefits of Free Trade
[ In a fascinating opinion piece originally printed in Game Developer magazine , EA Maxis designer and programmer Soren Johnson ( ) visits a wide variety of games both past and present to examine the complex issue of designing player economies . ]
Game design and economics have a spotty history .
Designing a fun and functional economy is no easy task as many design assumptions tend to backfire when they come in contact with the player .
For example , the early days ofwere infamous for the game 's wild and chaotic economy .
Zachary Booth Simpson wrote a classic analysis ofin 1999 , detailing some of the more notable problems experienced at launch :- the crafting system encouraged massive over - production by rewarding players for each item produced - this over - production led to hyper- inflation as NPC shopkeepers printed money on demand to buy the worthless items - players used vendors as unlimited safety deposit boxes by setting the prices for their own goods far above market value - item hoarding by players forced the team to abandon the closed - loop economy as the world began to empty out of goods - player cartels ( including one from a rival game company ! ) cornered the market on magical Reagents , preventing average users from casting spellsMMO economies have come a long way since then ; 's auction house is now a vibrant part of the game 's economy and overall world , with many players spending much of their time " playing the market " to good effect .
CCP , developers of , even hired an academic economist to analyze the flow of resources and the fluctuation of prices within their game world .
Indeed , understanding the potential effect of market forces on gameplay is an important ability for designers to develop .
Many designers have used economic game mechanics as a tool for balancing their games .
For example , in , every time a unit - such as a Knight or Archer - is purchased , the cost of future units of the same type goes up , simulating the pressure of demand upon price .
This design encouraged players to diversify their armed forces , in order to maximize their civilization 's buying power .
By allowing the " values " of different paths and options to float during a game , designers present players with a constantly shifting landscape , extending replayability by guaranteeing no perfect path to victory .
However , if taken too far , efforts to auto - balance by tweaking the economy can destroy a game .
In 2006 , Valve conducted an interesting economic experiment within , implementing a " Dynamic Weapon Pricing " algorithm .
According to the developers , " the prices of weapons and equipment will be updated each week based on the global market demand for each item .
As more people purchase a certain weapon , the price for that weapon will rise and other weapons will become less expensive .
" Unfortunately , the overwhelming popularity of certain weapons trumped the ability of the algorithm to balance the game .
For example , while the very effective Desert Eagle skyrocketed to $ 16,000 , the less useful Glock flatlined at $ 1 , leading to some extreme edge cases ( such as the " Glock bomb " ) .
A game economy is not a real economy ; not everything can be balanced simply by altering its price .
Gamers just want to have fun , and if the cost of the option considered the most fun is constantly tuned higher and higher until the price becomes prohibitive , players may not just alter their strategy - they may simply go play another game .
The current price of gas may be making our real lives " unfun " , but only one real - world economy exists , leaving us no choice .
Gamers are not in the same situation .
Ultimately , designers should remember that achieving perfect balance is a dubious goal .
Players are not looking for another game like rock / paper / scissors , in which every choice is guaranteed to be valid , essentially encouraging random strategies .
Players are motivated by reasons beyond purely economic ones when playing games .
Raising the cost of a player 's favorite weapon is simply going to feel like a penalty and should only be done if the imbalance is actually ruining the core game .
Perhaps a more appropriate use of economic dynamics is as a transparent mechanic within the game itself .
The board game world provides some great examples of such free market mechanics at work .
German - style gamesandboth use increasing subsidies to improve the appeal of unpopular roles and technologies , respectively .
In the case of the former , every turn no player decides to be the Craftsman , one gold piece is added as a " reward " for choosing that role .
As the gold increases slowly , few players will be able to resist such a bounty , which nicely solves the problem of making sure all roles are eventually chosen.
still has some clearly better and clearly worse options - they just change from turn to turn based on the current reward .
In this case , auto - balancing actually keeps the game fun because players are rewarded for choosing less common strategies , instead of being penalized for sticking to their favorites .
Perhaps more importantly , the effects of the market are spelled out clearly for the players ahead of time , so that no one feels the game is biased against them .
Perhaps the most elegant example of a pure free market mechanic based around actual resources and prices can be found in , another German - style board game .
In this case , players supply their power plants with a variety of resources ( oil , coal , uranium , and garbage ) , all of which are purchased from a central market .
Resource pieces are arranged on a linear track of escalating prices .
Every turn , X new pieces of each resource are added to the market , and players take Y pieces away as purchases .
As the supply goes up and down , the price correspondingly goes up and down , depending on where the next available piece is on the market track .
By making the supply - demand mechanic so explicit and transparent to the players , the market becomes its own battlefield , as much as the hex grid of a wargame might be .
By buying up as much coal as possible , one player might drive the price out of the range of the player in the next seat , causing her to be unable to supply all her plants at the end of the turn , a disastrous event in .
Thus , with a true open market , price can be used as a weapon just as much as an arrow or a sword might be in a military game .
Similarly , a number of modern strategy games , includingand theseries , have included free markets in which players could buy and sell resources , influencing global prices with their actions .
These markets serve as interesting " greed tests " in that players are often tempted to sell when they need cash or to buy when they are short on a specific resource , but they know in the back of their minds that each time they use the market , they are potentially giving an advantage to another player .
Buy too much wood in , and your opponents can make all the gold they need selling off their excess supply .
Unfortunately , the market dynamics of these games tend to repeat themselves , with prices usually bottoming out once the players ' total production overwhelms their needs .
This effect stems from the fact that the game maps emphasize economic fairness - in , each player is guaranteed a decent supply of gold , stone , and wood within a short distance of their starting location .
Spreading resources randomly around the map could lead a much more dynamic and interesting market mechanic -- but at the cost of overall play balance for a game with a core military mechanic .
If your opponents attack with horsemen , what if there is no wood with which to build spearmen , the appropriate counter unit ?
However , a game with a core economic mechanic does not suffer from such limitations .
In most business - based games , specializing in a specific resource is a basic part of the gameplay .
Thus , a free market mechanic can become a compelling part of a competitive game .
The ultimate example of such a game is the ' 80s classic , in which four players vie for economic dominance on a newly - settled world .
Although only four resources exist ( food , energy , smithore , and crystite ) , economies - of - scale encourage players to specialize .
More importantly , players can rarely produce all the resources they need on their own , requiring them to buy directly from other players .
The game has a brilliant interface for facilitating this trade between players .
Buyers are arranged along the bottom edge of the screen , with sellers on the top .
As buyers move up , their asking price goes up accordingly .
As sellers descend , their offer price decreases as well .
When the two meet in the middle , a transaction occurs .
Once again , the mechanic is explicit and transparent - player inventories and market prices are all clearly visible to everyone .
Players understand that they either have to adjust their own prices to make a deal happen or hope that their rivals cave .
Knowing how desperate another player might be to acquire the energy needed to power his buildings or the food needed to feed his labor , the temptation to pull ever last penny from him is strong .
In such a case , prices tend to fall only if the player is afraid someone else might sweep in to reap the profits !
The game mechanic mined here byis deep and rich .
Impoverishing one 's enemies can be just as much fun as destroying them .

- Introduction -
The tone and direction for the coming year seem clear enough : ominous , and downward .
Down for living standards ; down for levels of employment ; down for world trade ; down for investment portfolios and retirement funds ; down for the prosperity and even the physical safety of the lower and middle classes in the United States and around the world .
Levels of freedom are headed downward also , as the power elite worldwide use the time - honored method of responding to a crisis – any crisis – as a tool to increase their own power .
From ancient Rome to Hitler 's Germany , from the U.S. Civil War to modern Zimbabwe , from the Great Depression to the terrorist events of 9/11/2001 , crisis has worked so reliably as an excuse for power - grabs that one wonders why tyrants have n't thought of creating crises in order to increase and consolidate their power .
Thank goodness for small favors !
What a nightmare it would be if tyrants ( and their central bankers ) ever did catch on to such an obvious tool .

The Landscape Darkens as the Storm Begins
As predicted in this space last year ( and earlier ; for instance in March of 2007 , well before the meltdown began in August of that year ) , an epic and global financial crash is now underway .
Worldwide , stock market investors have lost about $ 32 trillion in wealth in the last year , per Eric Fry of Agora Financial .
Throw in the losses in real estate , bonds , and commodities , and the total loss might exceed $ 60 trillion , reports Kurt Kasun , who adds : " This is beyond rescue .
It is virtually impossible to overstate the dire consequences resulting from the severity of the declines recently experienced in almost all asset classes -- from both a technical and fundamental viewpoint . "
The consequences have indeed been dire , and they are n't over yet .
Major financial institutions and other businesses are failing in large numbers , retailers were slammed with dramatically lower consumer spending this critical holiday season , unemployment is skyrocketing , the mortgage crisis continues , housing sales and prices continue falling , and many state , county , and city governments are in serious financial trouble and responding with higher taxes and fees at the worst possible time for an increasingly impoverished public .
Concern over the solvency of U.S. debt and thus the dollar itself is being voiced , and with good reason , especially since the falling U.S. dollar is the core of most other nations ' currency reserves .
Even a simple list of major casualties in the field of finance is stunning :
" Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Bros. , AIG , Washington Mutual , Citigroup etc. , in the US and Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley in the UK all collapsed , were merged or fell into government ownership .
In the space of a few weeks the once proud US investment banking industry ceased to exist as standalone operations , being either merged or converted into commercial banks . "

How the Experts Missed the Obvious
The global financial crisis now underway is larger and deeper than any in living memory ; it will be talked about for millennia , assuming mankind survives that long .
Yet most economists and talking heads in the lamestream media , including print as well as television , failed to see it coming , just as they missed the call on the housing and dot - com bubbles .
Paul Krugman confessed last week on the NY Times Opinion page that " . . . the failure [ of economists ] to see the most obvious bubble of my lifetime remains a puzzle . "
It may be a puzzle to Krugman , but the answer is simple : Most economists and paid commentators are Keynesians ( see also this video on the results of Keynesian policy ; 7 min 29 sec ) who believe in government economic intervention ( i.e. , control via taxation , regulation and spending ) combined with central banks and fiat currencies .
In short , Keynesianism consists largely of central planning ( the lynchpin of the old Soviet Union and Red China under Mao , although Keynesianism allows for a semi- market economy ) combined with heavy taxation and epic levels of unrestrained counterfeiting , with the wealth thus extracted from citizens being spent on more central planning and , in the case of the United States in particular , on war and on maintenance of an empire ; for example , on our 750 + foreign military bases ( see also here ) around the planet .
The wealth thus drained from the lower and middle classes flows to favored corporations , government agencies , and other special interests .
Overall , the wealth extracted from citizens is redirected to those who already have wealth and power , for they control the system .
What little does flow to the lower and middle classes ( Social Security , Medicare , " free " education , welfare payments , etc. ) has the added benefit , from the elite 's point of view , of making the great mass of citizens ever - more dependent upon the State ; eventually , the helpless , infantilized citizenry looks to the State for nearly everything .
No wonder Keynesians have been so clueless :
Those mechanisms and their side - effects are the cause of the present crisis .
Why , then , do so many economists and commentators hold Keynesian views ?
Because those same mechanisms are also the core of the elite 's wealth and power , and since the elite control the major broadcast and print media and most universities , any economist or paid commentator who does not champion the Holy Trinity of government intervention , central banking , and fiat currency is shut out of the system .
Gary North describes the process , especially in regards to academia , in a reality - based horror story titled How Academic Guilds Police Higher Education .
I have previously described the effect of misperceiving reality due to inaccurate mental frameworks in Blinding by Paradigm .
Such misperception is especially common , and highly destructive , in regards to politics and the nature of coercive government itself .
As a paradigm , Keynesian economics is on a par with the divine right of kings : an idea ( or set of ideas ) so shockingly dishonest and out of synch with reality that it clearly exists only as rationalization for thuggery , theft , and fraud .
No wonder those who see the world ( or at least describe the world to others ) in terms of this paradigm so often miss the obvious .
Getting things right is not the purpose of this paradigm ; the purpose is keeping things right – that is , keeping the powerful in power and the masses in their place .
One bright spot in the current storm is that intelligent and honest commentators such as Congressman Ron Paul , investor Jim Rogers , and economist Peter Schiff are getting more respect and exposure as a result of having been consistently right on where we were headed ( links are to videos ) .
All three of these men , in particular , have been repeatedly interviewed on national television lately and the point has often been made that they predicted the current crisis years in advance while most other commentators were denying or downplaying the problems and sometimes literally laughing at the men who we now know were right .
There is no mystery to how Paul , Rogers , and Schiff saw the future with such clarity : they simply used a more accurate paradigm for understanding human action and the markets .
Such ( largely ) Austrian - oriented bears as these three are likely to continue their dour " winning " streaks , because 2009 looks to be even harsher and scarier than 2008 .

Yet Again , a Crisis Becomes an Excuse for Tyranny and Corruption
Government response to the financial crisis has mainly consisted of throwing taxpayer money at the problem in Keynesian fashion – no surprise – although not even I imagined we would see trillions of dollars being created and given to the culprits as a means of allegedly " saving " the system .
This is not mere Keynesianism ; it is Keynesianism on steroids and crystal meth .
It would be irresponsible in the extreme for an individual to forestall a personal recession by taking out newer , bigger loans when the old loans can't be repaid .
However , this is precisely what we are planning on a national level .
~ Peter Schiff , There 's No Pain - Free Cure for Recession , 12/27/08
Nearly everything the federal government , the president - elect , and the Federal Reserve have done or have announced plans to do runs counter to what is necessary to recover from today 's unfolding disaster .
Actual and proposed actions consist almost entirely of short - term pseudo - fixes , jaw - dropping thefts from American taxpayers , and shameless , outright power - grabs .
All of this will make the problem worse , prolonging and deepening the pain .
Similar Keynesian policies have failed and caused harm in Japan since the 1990s , and such measures greatly prolonged the pain after the American stock market crash of 1929 .
Both Hoover and FDR threw taxpayer money and centralized control at the problem , turning what could have been a short , sharp downturn into a 17 - year disaster so horrifying it was quickly labeled " the Great Depression . "
Not until after WWII ( during which rationing was imposed for gasoline , sugar , butter , meat , and other things ) did America return to anything one might call " prosperity . "
Of course , not everyone is hurting today ; just as a relatively few people and businesses get rich off the horrors of war and terrorism ( and as government power grows with war and terrorism as an excuse ) , today 's financial destruction has become an incredible windfall for some , as suggested earlier .
One can almost hear the excited gibbering of the power elite : " A Crisis , hooray !
Thank the Dark Powers that Be !
Let us make the most of this precious gift , for the People are never so pliant , so willing to give us their wealth and power , as when a lovely - scary Crisis is at hand ! "
And so , as mentioned , the U.S. government and its monopoly - chartered central bank have created trillions of new dollars , handing most of it to the banksters and other key players who helped create this crisis in the first place .
Give that last sentence a moment 's thought : a small group of people gave trillions of your dollars – not that you have that much money – to , well , mostly to crooks and failed businessmen .
No one asked your permission , and now suddenly you and your children and grandchildren , and probably even their grandchildren , are in debt for an unpayable , galactic - sized pile of money – money you did not borrow or spend , but which others did – in your name !
This dizzying largess has put American taxpayers on the hook for another $ 8.5 trillion ( in addition to our previous national debt ) so far – with much more to come , including President - elect Obama 's " stimulus " plans , recently estimated at $ 850 billion and growing .
In case you were wondering : Yes , this is serious money .
The entire Gross Domestic Product of the United States is roughly $ 13.5 trillion ( before this year 's financial meltdown ) and the insanely bloated federal budget is less than $ 3 trillion .
The bailouts have thus already cost us about three times the annual Federal budget , and more than half of the nation 's entire annual economic output .
Actually , given the precipitous and continuing drop in our GDP , $ 8.5 trillion might soon be our entire annual output .

The Hyperinflation Express
Has such massive creation of money from thin air ever been done before ?
Yes , many times , and you might be curious to know how it typically works out .
The answer is , basically : Not so good .
Here 's a WikiPedia link on the topic of " a massive and rapid increase in the amount of money , which is not supported by growth in the output of goods and services " – their definition ( and mine ) of the cause of hyperinflation .
In every case , hyperinflation has been a disaster to the people it was inflicted upon , with the level of harm roughly correlated to the speed and amount of money creation .
The Wiki article includes a long list of examples , and you would not want to have lived through any of them ; poverty , hunger , violence , and even revolution are common side - effects .
Partial or total destruction of the middle class is another typical result of hyperinflation .
Is n't the destruction of wealth we have seen of late deflationary ?
Well , yes and no ( it 's a complex question ) , but consider Eric deCarbonnel 's description of hyperinflation 's onset in Germany 's Weimar Republic , with interesting detail on the path and timing of the disaster :
" As an example of deflation leading to hyperinflation , consider the case of the Weimar Republic .
In 1920 , Germany experienced a deflationary collapse , with the average citizen finding it harder and harder to get enough money for necessities .
Banks , short of money , could not honor checks , and businesses were strapped for cash to buy materials and meet payroll .
Fearing a collapse that would throw millions of workers out on the street , the German government desperately printed money in an attempt to re-inflate the economy .
During this period , despite the government 's money printing , the mark actually gained in value against foreign currencies , so that prices of imported goods fell by some 50 % .
" Eventually , as a result of the money supply 's rapid expansion , the nation 's massive foreign debt , and the shrinking economy , German citizens lost all confidence in their currency , and the Weimar Republic experienced one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern economic history .
Billions of hoarded marks came out of hiding and entered the marketplace .
The chart below tells the rest of the story . "
[ Bold added ]
How Deflation Creates Hyperinflation by Eric deCarbonnel
Note the highlighted , penultimate sentence in that last paragraph .
Then consider that unlike the German mark of the 1920s , today 's U.S. dollar is both the primary reserve currency for the entire planet and has been used as a store of wealth around the world for decades by everyone from Columbian drug lords to Siberian peasants .
According to at least one recent estimate , " two thirds of all dollar money balances are held overseas . "
That has already begun to change , but the trickle of dollar repatriation is about to become a tsunami .
Other nations ( China , Russia , Iran , and Venezuela to name only four ) are increasingly strident in their calls for ending the world 's " dollar standard " and are making plans to begin trading among themselves in , well , anything other than dollars .
The concerns being voiced go well beyond the diminishing value of the dollar itself and include anger from an increasingly wide understanding that the United States has long abused its position as issuer of the world 's reserve currency to defraud other nations and to unfairly enrich itself .
Imagine being on the receiving end of U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connolly 's famous 1971 comment to European financial ministers : " The dollar is our currency , but your problem . "
1971 was the fateful year when Nixon took us completely off the gold standard , thus defaulting on promised gold payments to every nation in the world .
Only our military and economic superpower status allowed us to get away with such behavior .
Times have changed , and blowback from that long - standing arrogance and malfeasance is about to hit these shores with staggering force .
In addition to the inflationary effect of today 's reckless dollar creation for " bailouts , " " stimulus , " and other nonsense , we can expect a tidal wave of existing , long - sequestered dollars to arrive from overseas as people throughout both hemispheres trade their dollars for something – anything – that might actually hold its value .
Adding fuel to this dollar repatriation will be a widespread desire to help destroy the hated dollar system itself , including the aggressive , oversized American military that both feeds upon and helps prop up that system .
Some percentage of these foreign dollars will be spent on gold and silver , the only common forms of money that cannot be printed into worthlessness or otherwise defaulted on .
The precious metals market is extremely small relative to other investment categories .
As investors flee to the safety of precious metals , it wo n't take much to send prices of those metals to the moon .
Or , heck , to Alpha Centauri .
It is worth noting that the United States has already endured hyperinflation twice , once during the Revolutionary War when our fiat " continental currency " lost so much value that the phrase " not worth a continental " entered the American lexicon , and then again during the Civil War .
Fortunately for those who benefit from inflationary policy , most U.S. public schools apparently do n't find the topic worthy of discussion -- yet another reason to get government entirely out of the schooling business .
The " massive and rapid increase in the amount of money " that we have witnessed in the last six months is sure to continue , if only because the predicted federal budget deficit is expanding at near lightspeed , with some estimates – for just the deficit , not the budget as a whole – topping $ 1.5 trillion per year .
And what about all those trillions already created recently ?
Do n't ask ; it 's apparently easier to pretend they do n't exist .
For that matter , do n't even ask who got the money – Bloomberg News tried and failed to get the Fed " to disclose the recipients of more than $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral . "
After asking politely , Bloomberg filed suit to force the issue , invoking the Freedom of Information Act , but to no avail .
The result , so far , is that you , the American taxpayer , have the right ( oops ! – the " obligation " ) to pay that $ 2 trillion ( plus billions in interest ) , but not the right to know where your money went .
That would seem to clear up who is actually In Charge in these United States , and it sure is n't " we the people " -- who overwhelming and vocally opposed an early $ 700 billion portion of this bailout orgy .
Congress initially responded to all that citizen opposition by rejecting the proposal but then quickly made an about - face , tacking on an extra $ 150 billion in pork in the bargain .
Apparently , the people who are really In Charge ' splained the situation to the lackeys in Congress ( in which term I am including the Senate ) , who did as they were told – by those who actually matter .
In any case , oversight of any kind has been conspicuously lacking during this massive redirection of wealth from taxpayers to private " bankstas " and other favored groups .
We do know who the $ 700 billion TARP money went to , but this particular $ 700 billion was given with no strings attached , and the banks that received these billions are not interested in providing any sort of accounting of how they are spending the taxpayers ' money .
( For a look at where about $ 200 billion has gone so far -- not how the favored institutions have spent the money , but which institutions got the money -- see the list and link at the end of this column .
I highly recommend spending a moment with this list ; seeing such enormous numbers written out in full for dozens of banks and other financial firms has real impact ) .
Nor are the banks using this ocean of new cash to ramp up loans to individuals or businesses – instead a severe credit crunch is in the news .
Bonuses of breath - taking size – many larger than what most families earn in a lifetime – have continued at many of the firms being bailed out , which is to say that the same people who helped create this mess are being hugely rewarded at taxpayer expense .
In normal times , the people responsible for such a disaster – especially given that outright fraud at several levels seems fundamental to the whole problem – would be hauled into court on criminal charges , not handed millions of dollars in free money from the taxpayers .
When blatant theft , corruption , and contempt for the rule of law become this visible at the highest levels of government and finance , you know that things have gone way beyond " normal " and are deep in the danger zone .
The America we knew is disintegrating , and the public treasury is being looted by those in charge as the walls come down .
Worse behavior , and not only in the financial realm , is on the way .

At the Edge of a Fractal Break
" What seems to spook people now is the possibility that everybody in charge of everything is a fraud or a crook .
Legitimacy has left the system . " ~ James Howard Kunstler , Legitimacy Dwindles
Fractals " appear similar at all levels of magnification " ( quoting the linked WikiPedia article ) – as , for example , does corruption and other psychopathic behavior at various levels of U.S. politics , from your town hall to the upper echelons of the federal government .
Levels of theft and corruption , and of blatant , visible disdain for the rule of law , have largely been within traditional limits – what might be termed a " standard pattern " – for most of this nation 's history .
The rot has been ever - present but sufficiently limited and disguised that Americans could pretend otherwise ; our extremely high living standards certainly helped in that regard .
All of that is now coming to an end .
A fractal break is occurring .
The theft and corruption are n't going away , but instead increasing exponentially .
The pattern is visibly changing , and the common perception of the United States as a prosperous , safe , and free society where the rule of law ( and , far more importantly , actual justice ) is the expected and mostly - real norm is rapidly dying .
America is dying with it , for America is more an idea than a set of land boundaries or government institutions ; America was explicitly created as a haven for human liberty .
We never got it right , of course : our early slavery and genocide hardly fit with the ideals of liberty , and especially since 1913 , our federal government has grown like a cancer to a size previously unthinkable .
So perhaps it is no surprise that the whole enterprise is now collapsing , with government power increasingly drowning individual freedom in a tidal wave of police - state and coercive - socialist tyranny .
The America of Henry David Thoreau , of Mark Twain , of Walt Whitman , of Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine and the millions more who brought this nation into being and kept it alive in their hearts and , to a large extent , on the ground , for so long – that America , the real America , the " asylum for mankind " that Paine wrote about so eloquently – that America is gone , fading already into myth and legend , gone soon even from living memory as the last citizens who remember America 's dying embers wink out from this world , one by one .
In their place : a new citizenry , molded by government schooling and control and constant statist propaganda , clamoring now for a strongman to take control – preferably ( according to a recent popularity contest ) a strongman with winning smiles and a vague message of " change " and " hope . "
This new strongman wants the Bush war - and - torture team to stay on and has already done much else to suggest that " change " was indeed mostly a slogan , but , thankfully for the power elite , hope springs eternal .
Meanwhile , the U.S. Army has already begun " homeland tours " and plans to have " 20,000 uniformed troops inside the United States by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe , according to Pentagon officials , " reports the Washington Post .
Along the same lines , Marines have joined the California Highway Patrol on at least one DUI checkpoint ( on a positive note , a few citizens actually complained ) .
Between all that and the Halliburton - built gulag of detention camps on American soil ( here 's the KBR press release on the topic , from 1/24/2006 ) and the various police - state laws , executive orders , and repressive new federal agencies ( TSA and Homeland Security , especially ) imposed on us in the last seven or eight years , the United States is looking more like a continent - wide prison camp than a free nation .
These are disturbing times , even frightening times , for anyone who favors love and freedom .
America is dead .
Nothing to see here , citizen .
Move along .
- - - - -
By now , you will not be surprised to learn that the mildest predictions I find even slightly credible for the coming year are those labeled by the mainstream as extreme or frightening : for example , here is Fortune Magazine on 8 Really , Really Scary Predictions .
The subtitle is " Dow 4,000 .
Food shortages .
A bubble in Treasury notes .
Fortune spoke to eight of the market 's sharpest thinkers and what they had to say about the future is frightening . "
" Really , really scary ? " Nah .
I 'll see your " Dow 4,000 " and raise you . . . .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
Part II of this column , including predictions , will follow sometime next week .

Indian Girl Marries Dog In Bizarre Ritual
A flaming indication that India remains a land of enduring superstition , especially in rural areas where literacy is practically non-existent , here is a most unusual news item about a young girl who was forced to marry a dog in order to ward off “ evil spirits . ”
In India ’s eastern Jharkhand , locals in the Munda Dhanda village have â€˜married off ’ one of its children to a stray dog because they believed her family was endangered by a malevolent spirit that could be assuaged in no other way .
The ceremony was performed to the beating of many drums in the belief that it would help to overcome any curse that might fall upon the unfortunate family .
In an odd twist of fate , the girl will be free to marry a man later in life without even seeking a divorce from her four - legged husband !

LONDON — An island nation that bulked up on debt and lived beyond its means .
A plunging currency .
And a financial system edging toward nationalization .
With the pound at a multidecade low and British banks requiring ever - larger injections of taxpayer cash , it is no wonder that observers have started to refer to London as “ Reykjavik - on - Thames . ”
While that judgment seems exaggerated , there are uncomfortable parallels between Iceland ’s recent financial downfall and Britain ’s trajectory .
Equally important , news that widening bank losses in Britain have necessitated another round of government life support provides a stark example to the United States .
Washington ’s attempts to stabilize financial institutions have failed so far , as well .
And now the Obama administration , along with the rest of the world , could watch Britain to see what a bank nationalization might look like , and what it might suggest for American banks .
The Israeli government has admitted in a secret memorandum that Ariel Sharon has failed to honour commitments to President George Bush to dismantle Jewish settler outposts in the West Bank .
The memorandum , which originated in the Israeli foreign ministry and was leaked to Reuters , is an admission of duplicity by Mr Sharon , who gave face - to - face commitments to Mr Bush to dismantle the outposts to show good faith toward the US - led " road map " peace process .
The memo says : " International criticism is growing because of our lack of creative ideas for getting out of the conflict .
" Our claim that Israel has fulfilled its side of the ' road map ' is seen as lacking credibility because not only have we not evacuated the illegal outposts , we are working in every way to whitewash their existence and build more . "
At the Aqaba summit in June , Mr Sharon told Mr Bush he would remove Jewish settler outposts which even Israeli law recognises as illegal .
The prime minister justified the move to his supporters by saying he was not giving ground to the Palestinians , merely enforcing Israeli law .
But after symbolically shutting about a dozen of the 100 or more outposts , the government quietly abandoned the closures .
In any case , some outposts were declared erased when they had been permitted to move a few hundred metres away .
Others were re-established after a few weeks .
In
my last column of 2008 ,
I built on Linda
Hirshman ’s idea
that an economic stimulus package offered under the Obama administration
should focus on making sure that job creation equally benefits
men and women .
We should applaud the Presidential transition team
for embracing the idea of green
jobs , but , as Hirshman
points out , the jobs that have been proposed are mostly blue collar jobs in industries dominated
by men .
Hirshman suggests that the Obama administration additionally prioritize building our educational system , which would employ
more women .
I suggest that the country should view health care
reform as an economic investment that can create jobs women are likely to take .
Forty - six million Americans currently go without health insurance , and most of them have patchy access
to health care , avoiding preventive services and only seeing a doctor
when lack of prevention lands them in an emergency room — perversely , this
creates the very long lines we ’re told to fear if said people instead receive
basic health care .
Under most universal health care proposals , these 46 million would be able to purchase health insurance , dramatically elevating the labor demand for doctors , nurses ,
pharmacists , and other health care providers .
With doctors alone ,
this improves women ’s employment prospects , since female medical school
applicants outnumber male applicants .
But with the increasing emphasis on prevention , the demand for nurses
and other medical staff will rise even faster .
These are professions in which women are predominant .
Obviously , the incoming administration
has an opportunity to kill two birds with one health care reform stone .
Applying the green job reform model to health care — creating a demand
for labor and creating a means to fill it — will work nicely for health
care .
We have a nursing shortage in America , but it ’s not for
a real lack of actual human beings who need the jobs .
Most of
the women who might find nursing a good job ca n’t quite seem to get
into it , because cobbling together the time and money for the training
falls just outside of their means .
Making the leap from a minimum
wage service industry job into a higher income nursing job means , for
many women who would like to make that transition , finding money
to pay for it , and dealing with increased child care costs to cover their hours working
their normal job and the hours at school .
For many women , these
are costs they simply cannot afford .
But our federal government can
easily provide both the tuition money and the child care .
It ’s
been demonstrated in this country ’s past , that if need be , the federal government
can create child care programs to free up women ’s time
so they can take jobs that must be done .
During
World War II , the federal government set up 24 hour day care centers
for female shipyard workers taking jobs that men could n’t fill .
This would have the added benefit
of employing more women , since child care workers are largely female .

Abortion .
Parenthood .

Should the demand rise high
enough , the government might even invest in on - the - job training programs
for female health care workers , so they can start drawing a salary immediately ,
reducing their need to hold down an outside job while receiving the
training to be a nurse .
Right now , one of the biggest barriers
between the many women ( and men , too ) who would like nursing jobs is
the long
waiting lists at nursing school .
Again , the federal government can attack this problem ,
funding an expansion of the educational apparatus to increase the number
of graduates coming out of school and meeting the growing demand for
this kind of health care .
Just a couple of years ago ,
the idea of widespread federal investment in infrastructure for the
purpose of investment and job creation seemed a
marginal idea that had been abandoned once we recovered from the
Great Depression .
That changed in pretty short order , and if things
go as planned , historians will mark this as a time of a great paradigm
shift .
And thank goodness .
If this is a country that really is
committed to the equality of all , the federal government should consider
the needs of the working class to obtain and maintain decent work to be
at least as important as the desires of the wealthy to keep their stock
holdings from plummeting precariously when the latest economic scheme
collapses .
Federal job creation is a good unto itself , so long as the work is real and dignified , but we
have a unique opportunity to create jobs that really do pay us back
tenfold .
Green jobs that set the standard for a modern environmentalist
society are one way to get our investment back beyond just the standard
good of full employment , and health care job creation does the same
thing .
Everything in our society will improve when our citizens are as healthy as possible .
And we can do all this without
compromising feminist principles that advocate for an economy where
women do n’t depend on men , and are n’t forced , as I argue in this
week ’s podcast , to make compromises like staying in abusive marriages
because they ca n’t afford to escape .
In opposition to the New
Deal of the 1930s , which glorified the nuclear family and female dependence ,
we really can create a new New -er Deal that supports female independence
and truly healthy families formed out of full consent , economic and
otherwise .
“ Because of the pendency of the federal complaint , the executive decisions that Mr. Blagojevich makes are tainted , ” Ms. Madigan said in her filing with the Illinois Supreme Court .
“ Indeed , every day this state is faced with an allegedly corrupt governor making critical decisions that have no legitimacy . ”
Standard &
Poor ’s put the state ’s general obligation bonds on credit watch with negative implications this week , citing “ our concern that the legal charges now facing the governor and his chief of staff may challenge the state to respond to this fiscal situation on a timely basis . ”
On Thursday , Mr. Franks filed a measure that would prohibit the governor from temporarily appointing someone to fill a vacant Senate seat “ if the governor has been arrested , charged , or indicted for a felony offense ” and the case remains unresolved .
The bill also provides that in such an instance the vacancy would be filled in the next election .
“ It ’s nothing anyone really anticipated , ” Mr. Franks said .
“ I never thought we would need a law like this .
But we have to protect the sanctity of our democracy . ”
Federal officials acknowledged that a grand jury was weighing evidence in the case against Mr. Blagojevich , though the timing of any indictment was unclear .
In a rare firsthand account of how Mr. Blagojevich , a two - term Democrat , went about the selection process , an Illinois state senator said in an interview that he had felt pressured to respond to the governor ’s interest in him with a quid pro quo agreement and has withdrawn his name because of increasing wariness about the process .
The state senator , Kwame Raoul , who represents the South Side of Chicago , offered few details of his interaction with the governor ’s office but said he received a call about a month ago confirming that he was under consideration .
Soon afterward , however , Mr. Raoul said he ran head - on into another message : that the governor was looking for a candidate who offered something of tangible value to him .
Indian newspapers said on Friday the government had proof that Pakistan 's military spy agency was involved in the Mumbai attacks , including evidence supplied by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation .

The ISI is Pakistan 's main spy agency .

Pakistan says will ' frame a response ' to demand , offers joint probe India to Pakistan : Hand over suspects
The Hindu newspaper said investigations into the Mumbai attack had led to the names of handlers and trainers of the Islamist gunmen and the locations where the training was held .
These were believed to be military or ISI men .
At least 171 people were killed in the attacks last week in Mumbai .
Nine of the attackers were killed while one is being interrogated .
The detained man told investigators he had attended four training camps in Pakistan over the past 18 months , Mail Today newspaper said .
He has said he is a member of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based group blamed for previous attacks in India .
The attacks have increased tensions between India and Pakistan .
New Delhi says militants based in Pakistan were involved in the attacks , and has demanded that Islamabad hand over 20 of its most wanted fugitives .
The prime suspect for the Mumbai attacks is Lashkar - e - Taiba , an Islamist group fighting Indian rule in disputed Kashmir , and which analysts say has had ties with Pakistani intelligence in the past .

It seems someone " fell " off the tall building the car was parked next to and landed on the car .
And to top things off , the faller apparently had AIDS !
The note ends up creating more questions than answers .
Did the person live ?
Does the owner know about the car yet ?
How did this happen ?
Did they jump or fall ?
How do you " fall " off a building ?
One thing is clear though , this is incredibly bizarre .
Oh , and one more thing , this happened on Fell Street .

COME JANUARY , a new president will take charge of a nation diminished , an America that is far shakier economically , less secure militarily , and less respected internationally than it was eight years before .
The nation needs a chief executive who has the temperament and the nerves to shepherd Americans through what promises to be a grueling period  and who has the vision to restore this country to its place of leadership in the world .
Such a leader is at hand .
With great enthusiasm , the Globe endorses Senator Barack Obama for president .
The charismatic Democrat from Illinois has the ability to channel Americans hopes and rally the public together , at a time when the winds are picking up and the clouds keep on darkening .
Unlike many of his rivals this year of either party , Obama is nt refighting the political or cultural battles of the 1960s .
Instead , he is asking Americans to take responsibility for the nations problems now ; no one else will take care of them , and the consequences of years of disunity and profligacy should not be visited upon future generations .
Obama shows great faith in the possibility of persuasion overseas and in the ingenuity of the American economy .
While intransigent rogue states cant be finger - wagged into giving up on nuclear weapons , perhaps they can be talked back from the brink .
As fossil fuels become scarcer , and the ecological damage more evident , Americans can put up windmills and solar panels and drive more efficient cars .
Encouragingly , Obama has assembled an impressive economic team that understands both the power of the market and the need to discourage recklessness and promote social equity .
He would broaden access to health insurance , using a mechanism akin to this states Commonwealth Connector .
And he offers a tax plan that , in offering modest cuts to most taxpayers and taking back some past cuts for the highest earners , acknowledges the widening gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else .
The question , of course , is whether Obama can make good on his promises under the circumstances .
For George W. Bush will leave a woeful legacy .
The Iraq war , which was sold to Congress and the public on false pretenses , continues to consume billions upon billions of dollars , even as many of the plotters of Sept. 11 are still at large .
In his efforts to cultivate democracy abroad , Bush has hacked away at its roots here : due process , the separation of powers , the conviction that there are some things that government must not do .
Waterboarding and secret prisons abroad , warrantless wiretapping at home  these acts belie Americas image of forthrightness , the nations greatest asset in world affairs .
Meanwhile , as the planet gets warmer , its top energy consumer has no plan to wean itself from fossil fuels .
Healthcare costs are strangling businesses .
Real wages have declined for the average worker , even as the cost of food and fuel has skyrocketed .
Vague unease about the economy has turned into outright fear as the financial system sank into quicksand and 500 - point - plus plunges on the stock market have become a near - daily occurrence .
Obamas opponent , Senator John McCain , would try to solve all these problems by going back to the same Republican set of tools : tough talk abroad , tax cuts for the richest at home .
In contrast , Obamas presidency would benefit from the Illinois senators formidable political gifts .
A graduate of Harvard Law School and a former community organizer on Chicagos South Side , Obama debuted on the national political scene with a dazzling speech at the Democratic National Convention four years ago .
Since then , every word of his books and his speeches has been closely parsed .
Evident from all that scrutiny is a nimble mind , an ever more impressive grasp of policy detail , and an ability to listen to contradictory viewpoints .
Obama is clearly a liberal .
But when he led the Harvard Law Review , he won praise from conservative thinkers because he genuinely wanted to hear what they had to say .
Obama is hardly immune to political calculation .
Though he has positioned himself as a supporter of campaign finance reform , he backed out of the public financing system after his ability to raise jaw - dropping sums over the Internet became apparent .
In the general election campaign , he has been slow to admit how much the financial crisis would limit his policy options come January .
Even so , the way Obama has run his campaign has been a marvel of sound management :
He laid down principles , put the right people in positions of authority , and spent money strategically .
And he has shown a remarkable steadiness .
Whether he was far behind Hillary Clinton before the Iowa caucuses or on the verge of locking up the Democratic nomination , whether he was leading or trailing McCain in the general election contest , Obama made the same forward - looking appeal to voters best instincts .
As the first black major - party presidential nominee , Obama has strived to make voters comfortable with a skinny kid with a funny name .
And yet the historical significance of his bid is impossible to ignore .
Voters can make no more powerful statement about Americas commitment to inclusion and opportunity than to put forward this man  Barack Hussein Obama , son of a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas  as the nations representative to the world .
An early Obama campaign slogan declared , We are the ones weve been waiting for .
His critics deemed such rhetoric too ethereal .
Now it seems prescient , as the nation confronts a financial crisis of historic proportions , as well as all the other policy failures and debt - fueled excesses of the last eight years .
The United States has to dig itself out .
Barack Obama is the one to lead the way .

OVERLAND PARK , Kansas ( Reuters ) -
It has been nearly a year since Todd Wilson last collected a paycheck .
The Kansas computer salesman was n’t too worried at first , for he had a solid work history , decent savings , and a wife with a job .

But now , with unemployment on the rise all around him , such as the 8,000 new cuts announced this week by Overland Park , Kansas , based Sprint Nextel , competition for ever fewer jobs is growing -- and desperation is setting in .
“ Anybody who is looking for a job now is feeling an economic tsunami , ” said 48 - year - old Wilson , who says he has exhausted his family ’s savings and now spends most days searching for jobs at an area employment - assistance center .
“ It feels like all of a sudden , it has just fallen apart . ”
Far from Washington D.C. , in communities across the United States , the talk of federal economic stimulus plans and bank bailouts offers only faint hope for help .
Many workers say the ever - rising unemployment spells a long road of hardship ahead .
This week alone , U.S. companies including Sprint , Home Depot , Caterpillar , Texas Instruments and others announced they would cut more than 60,000 jobs .
On Tuesday , another 10,000 job cuts were announced .
So far this month , more than 210,000 jobs are known to have been axed .
And in a report due Thursday , claims for U.S. unemployment benefits by the newly jobless are expected soar above 500,000 .
All that comes on top of 524,000 jobs lost in December and a spike in unemployment in all U.S. states that left the national unemployment rate at 7.2 percent , up from 6.8 percent in November , according to the Labor Department .
In all , more than 11 million U.S. workers are unemployed , a 48 percent jump from a year ago .
The numbers translate to roughly four job seekers for every one job opening in the United States , according to Heidi Shierholz , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington - based think tank .
The grim job picture cuts across nearly every sector , she said .
“ There are literally millions of workers unemployed with no hope of finding a new job , ” she said .
“ The queue is just too long . ”
Job losses contributed to a record low in U.S. consumer confidence this month , the Conference Board , a non-profit business research group in New York , said on Tuesday .
A new survey by the Society for Human Resource Management also found that nearly 75 percent of human resource professionals from U.S. companies were expecting deeper job cuts in the U.S. labor force in the next few months .
NO QUICK FIX ?
Economists and workers alike say they see President Barack Obama ’s efforts to jolt the economy taking at least a year or more to jumpstart renewed hiring .
“ With the right package , the economy will start growing in 2010 and the labor market will start picking up after that at some point , ” said Shierholz .
That is slight comfort to U.S. workers and small business owners who see their livelihoods eroding at a rapid pace .
“ It ’s been less than four months since I got this job and I ’m already worried about holding onto it , ” said Anna Chung , 30 , who works at a small auto parts supplier in suburban Detroit , Michigan , where the state unemployment rate was 10.6 percent in December , reflecting the automobile industry ’s dismal fortunes .
“ I ’m afraid I might be the next to go . ”
In Overland Park , where Sprint ’s world headquarters dominates the landscape of the upscale bedroom community near Kansas City , the layoffs have many reeling .
“ Behind each number is a person and a family , ” said Tracey Osborne , president of the local chamber of commerce .
The mounting corporate job losses mean slowing sales for a range of service and support businesses .
Tax revenues are falling and money for schools and social services is squeezed .
Kyle Witherspoon owns the sports bar directly across the street from Sprint ’s sprawling corporate headquarters , and for years has served a steady flow of Sprint employees .
But he said sales have slowed due to the job cuts .
This week , he was busy booking going away parties for Sprint workers , he said , and bracing for more lost customers .
“ When these people go now , it will have a huge impact , ” he said .
At the Mid-America Regional Council in Kansas City , chief economist Frank Lenk said for every corporate job lost , two more will be shed on average .
“ This is a gloomy time , ” Lenk said .
“ People are feeling pretty uncertain about their financial security . ”
Computer programer Larry Martel understands uncertainty .
He had been laid off for six months last year before landing work as a consultant at a Kansas City - area firm .
Now Martel , 50 , is just thankful to have a steady paycheck .
“ There are people really hurting .
It ’s everywhere you turn , ” said Martel .
“ It is probably going to get worse before it gets better . ”
Functional Programming Unit Testing – Part 7 Thursday , January 29 , 2009
In the previous installment in this series , I covered how you can use type classes to implement operators to allow you to do such things as approximate equals for floating point calculations , so that you could run QuickCheck property tests with relative ease .
This post will get us back on track to our refactoring tales and what tools we can use to better understand the language .
Let ’s get caught up to where we are today :
Improving Your Codebase
One of the big questions that invariably comes up when introducing yourself to a new language is “ How can I tell if I ’m using it correctly ? ”
When we explore new languages , we always look to have some sort of hand holding to determine if there is a better way of accomplishing the task at hand .
There are the more traditional avenues such as the #haskell IRC channel , the Haskell - Cafe mailing list and Hoogle , but one tool that stands out is HLint .
HLint , created by Neil Mitchell , is a tool that can provide suggestions for common mistakes made in the language .
This , deriving its name from the lint tool , can help refine your codebase and better utilize the features of the language .
Tools such as this really allow you to become a bit more fluent in the language .
As we approach each language that we learn , it ’s important that we understand not only the basics , but the many nuances , just as you would with a spoken language .
What are exactly its capabilities ?
Let ’s cover some of the basic suggestions it can give , then walk through several examples .
List recursion hints
Map / Fold ( Left & Right ) hints
Unnecessary parentheses and brackets
Eta reductions
Monadic sugar hints
And more
Let ’s first look through some trivial hints such as functional composition :
mapFilterReduce xs =
sum ( filter ( \x -> x `mod` 3 == 0 ) ( map ( flip ( ^ ) 3 ) xs ) )
We can then run this through the HLint package to see if the tool has any relevant suggestions :
> hlint " hlintexample.hs "
hlintexample.hs : 1:1 : Eta reduce
Found :
mapFilterReduce xs
= sum ( filter ( \ x -> x `mod` 3 == 0 ) ( map ( flip ( ^ ) 3 ) xs ) )
Why not :
mapFilterReduce
= sum .
filter ( \ x -> x `mod` 3 == 0 ) . map ( flip ( ^ ) 3 )
Found 1 suggestions
This gives us a pretty nice suggestion which is to use the dot - operator in order to compose the functions together .
This also then lets us omit the xs as a function argument as it now will be inferred usage .
Another example is to do another simple calculation .
Let ’s take the following code example which calculates mean values on odd numbered lists :
import Data .
List ( sort )
meanOdd xs =
head $ drop ( length xs `div` 2 ) ( sort xs )
Running this through HLint will give us the following results :
> hlint " hlintexample.hs "
hlintexample.hs :3:1 : Use index
Found :
head $ drop ( length xs `div` 2 ) ( sort xs )
Why not :
sort xs !!
( length xs `div` 2 )
Found 1 suggestions
What this tells us is that instead of the head and drop functions , we could use the !!
list index operator to retrieve the value from the list .
This is looking pretty good so far .
What Neil has done that is interesting is running this tool against the base libraries in the GHC compiler to find some opportunities as well .
What I ’ve shown here barely scratches the surface with some of the possibilities here .
The opportunity for something like this in the F# world is huge .
Not only refactoring tools that allow for such things as removal of parameters , reorder parameters , promote lambda to named function , etc , but to actually tell you which functions you might be better off calling instead .
I hope the open source community , the refactoring tools vendors and others are looking at this opportunity .
What Have We Learned ?
I hope this series was helpful to those who are looking at design and testing in the functional programming world .
After 8 posts , I ’ve covered quite a bit in the functional programming world from traditional xUnit testing , to QuickCheck property - based tests , to refactoring and other interesting areas .
It ’s great to see others such as Joe Armstrong talking about “ Micro Lightweight Unit Testing ” in Erlang as well .
There are some additional resources in the form of videos that might interest you on QuickCheck .
These videos are great to explain a little further some of the techniques of how you testing using QuickCheck in a little deeper discussion than I have provided here .
This has been a fun series to put together and I hope it draws a picture of the design and test options we have in the functional programming world .
Elder Gandy : Mormon Missionary
I 'm an LDS missionary .
This is my blog .
A lawsuit that was filed in Texas a few days before Norm Coleman 's filing involved one of Norm Coleman 's close friends and major political contributor and contained some very serious allegations .
If proven true these allegations would likely lead to further investigations and a trial much like what now indicted Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens has recently gone through .
In the lawsuit Paul McKim , the former CEO of an oil - rig servicing company in Houston , alleges he was coerced by 50 % shareholder Iranian - born Nasser Kaseminy , a Norm Coleman friend and major political contributor , to funnel payments to Norm Coleman 's wife through her employer Hays Companies in Saint Paul Minnesota .
The lawsuit was entered into Harris county court in Texas on Monday , then pulled on Tuesday because of ongoing negotiations , and then re-submitted to the courts on Thursday .
The plaintiff , McKim , signed an affidavit under oath on Friday and updated the lawsuit to include additional exhibits .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune obtained a copy of the lawsuit and exhibits .
These documents show " service fees " paid to the Hays Companies where Laurie Coleman works .
Below is a copy of one of the payments included as an exhibit in the lawsuit and is apparently from a ledger , a payment of $ 25,000 to Hays is circled in ink with a note : " Please pull this detail and delete ...
8/19/08 . "
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Mr. McKim alleges in the lawsuit that :
In March 2007 , Kazeminy began ordering the payments of corporate funds to companies and individuals who tendered no goods or services to DMT for the stated purpose of trying to financially assist United States Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota .
In March 2007 , Kazeminy telephoned B.J. Thomas , then DMT's Chief Financial Officer .
In that conversation , Kazeminy told Mr. Thomas that " U.S. Senators do n't make [ expletive deleted ] " and that he was going to find a way to get money to United States Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota and wanted to utilize DMT in the process .
At a last minute news conference in Moorhead Minnesota yesterday , Coleman called McKim 's suit " sleazy politics " .
" If my opponents have any shred of decency left in this campaign -- stop attacking my family , " Coleman also said .
Norm later said in a prepared statement released to the Star Tribune in reference to his wife , " She has not received one dime from the company that was involved in this lawsuit – she was not the producer on the account – she was not responsible for this transaction in anyway " .
That of course is true because neither Norm or Laurie Coleman or the Hays Companies were listed as a party in the suit .
The only company involved in the lawsuit is Deep Marine Technology .
But Norm 's statement of denial does n't address the question of whether the money was funneled from Deep Marine Technology to the Hays Companies and then to Laurie Coleman .
The Al Franken campaign , which seemed just as surprised as everyone else , has flatly denied any involvement and said no one associated with the Franken campaign had anything to do with bringing the lawsuit to light .
Norm Coleman 's accusation that this was an 11th hour political attack by Al Franken does n't seem to be holding much water .
Casey Wallace , one of McKim 's lawyers , told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that his client 's lawsuit had nothing to do with the impending election between Franken and Coleman .
It has also been found out that Paul McKim is a Republican and stated in a conversation with Saint Paul Pioneer Press on Friday that he does not know either Norm Coleman or Al Franken and has not had any contact with them .
Some are also rightly questioning why Norm Coleman filed a defamation suit against Al Franken also on Thursday and even suggest that Norm Coleman might have done this as a diversionary tactic .
It would probably be naïve to think Norm Coleman did n't already know about the lawsuit filed against his friend Nasser Kaseminy two days prior .
The lawsuit filed by Norm Coleman on Al Franken on Thursday would not be heard by the courts until Tuesday and experts say it is doubtful that it would go very far .
That lawsuit stems from radio and TV ad's that Al Franken has been running against Norm Coleman stating that a bipartisan watchdog group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , reported that Norm Coleman was the 4th most corrupt Senator in congress .
Melanie Sloan , the organization 's director , told the City Pages on Thursday , " I can see how they came to that conclusion , but that 's certainly not what we said . "
Because CREW only listed 4 senators in their report and the other 96 did not make the report she said it would be correct to say Coleman is one of four most corrupt senators in their report .
What seems to be in question is that the Al Franken campaign said Norm Coleman was the 4th most corrupt Senator and CREW is saying their report said Norm was one of the four most corrupt Senators and did not necessarily assign the rank of 4th .
The CREW report that came out earlier this fall pointed to four U.S. Senators that made their list of the most corrupt members of Congress .
Republican Norm Coleman was one of the four that also included now indicted Republican Ted Stevens , Republican Mitch McConnell , and Democrat Mary Landrieu .

Persistent Depressive Disorder ( PDD )
Dysthymia , now known as persistent depressive disorder , refers to a type of chronic depression present for more days than not for at least two years .
It can be mild , moderate , or severe .﻿﻿
People might experience brief periods of not feeling depressed , but this relief of symptoms lasts for two months or less .
While the symptoms are not as severe as major depressive disorder , they are pervasive and long - lasting .
PDD symptoms include :
Feelings of sadness
Loss of interest and pleasure
Anger and irritability
Feelings of guilt
Low self - esteem
Difficulty falling or staying asleep
Sleeping too much
Feelings of hopelessness
Fatigue and lack of energy
Changes in appetite
Trouble concentrating
Treatment for persistent depressive disorder often involves the use of medications and psychotherapy .
According to the National Institute of Mental Health , 1.5 % of adults in the United States had persistent depressive disorder in the past year .
The disorder affects women ( 1.9 % ) more than men ( 1 % ) , and researchers estimate that around 1.3 % of all U.S. adults will have the disorder at some point during their lives .
The Federal Government is facing pressure from within its own ranks to begin moves for a referendum on becoming a republic .
A referendum on having an Australian head of state appointed by the Parliament was defeated in 1999 .
But the issue has been revived after the Government 's 2020 Summit last year called for the constitutional monarchy to be abandoned .
The chair of the Parliament 's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee , Labor MP Mark Dreyfus , says the Government should hold a plebiscite on the issue soon .
" I think it 's possibly already too late to hold a referendum in the first term of the Rudd Labor Government , but it 's not too late to move on to a plebiscite to get some kind of preliminary indication of the national will , " he said .
" Holding a plebiscite does n't commit the Government to holding a referendum at any particular time .
It is an important preparatory step .
" The other thing we 've learnt about the history of constitutional change , or the lack of change to the Australian constitution , is that these things take a very long time .
That 's a good reason to start now . "
Taslim Solangi , an 8 months pregnant Pakistani teen from Khairpur , was forced to give birth prematurely and then was thrown in front of a pack of dogs , all of this because her father - in - law claimed that the child she was expecting was out of wedlock .
Purported allegations of infidelity and adultery against her were enough for the in - laws , in cohorts with the local populace , to mete out this depraved form of tribal justice .
Perpetrators of this barbaric act are yet to be captured by the local police even though the accused , while labeled as absconded , has openly made threats about killing the lynched teen ’s mother .
The baby , meanwhile , was disposed off in a canal .
News reports indicate that her father - in - law , Zamir Solangi , who is responsible for this gruesome act , took the pregnant girl from her mother ’s and subsequently swore of the Holy Quran that he would n’t harm her .
Religion and patriarchy make a fairly toxic cocktail in the Indian sub - continent and the ignorant masses are only too pleased to gulp it down by the gallon .
My earliest images of Pakistan ’s women were shaped by the slightly asymmetrical and exaggerated ( as duly pointed out by a lit- crit professor ) accounts of gender based bias and discrimination in Tehemina Durrani ’s Blasphemy .
Today though , I do n’t quite think the book as exaggerated as Dr D’Souza thought .
To be honest , I was quite scared of ever stepping foot anywhere beyond the LOC ( “ Line of Control ” between India and Pakisran ) and it had nothing to do with the perennial under-currents of violence and hatred , assumed or otherwise , between the two neighbors .
India and Pakistan share a murky history and a superior culinary culture plus a million other things .
Yet despite celebrity proclamations of how it ’s the “ same ” country both sides of the border , I know for a fact that ’s not entirely true .
We are different entities and the umbilical cord was severed quite a few decades ago .
Even so , you can relate to the urban Pakistani ecosystem a lot better if you come from the Northern part of India and I have been repeatedly informed by friends and mutants alike that much of Karachi will remind me of some of Delhi .
I have n’t travelled the length and breadth of our Northern neighbor to validate that statement so I ’ll make room for reasonable doubts than take it at face value .
My interest lies in a comparison of parities in the lives of an average Indian woman vis -à - vis one in Pakistan .
There are differences galore , but quite a few similarities too .
I do confess to very little information about rural Pakistani women in particular .
I am grown up enough now to believe that not every Pakistani household has its own feudal lord – though a significant amount of them are at the mercy of some lameass patriarchal messiah of sorts - and I am also firmly aware of the bitter truth that a very stringent sort of sexism prevalent in a large part of that country ( as in mine ) means a daily , almost ritualistic , persecution and defilement of women – emotionally , mentally , physically – as well as a thorough disregard for women ’s rights .
Despite my usual preparedness for the abnormally grim , stories like Solangi ’s still manage to scare me insane and fuel unbridled rage within me .
Wrath is what I can feel right now , rising from the absolute pit of my stomach .
Unadulterated and unmitigated anger .
And I want to use this anger in a way that pulverizes the very core of our enforced patriarchal inheritance .
I want my anger to be as brutal and as devoid of mercy as these murdering charlatans are .
I need revenge .
We need revenge .
I could have chosen to satirize in my usual blasé manner because I find in humor – especially dark humor – a rock - hard and unshakable crutch .
But this is not the time to seek crutches , it ’s the time to demolish .
I beseech those academically fortified women amongst us , who love to deliberate about ethnocentric feminism ’s strides in the warm comfort of their Ikea - decorated living rooms , to stand up and address this .
Now .
Without politeness and political correctness corrupting their ire .
Because when young girls are left for dogs to feed on , very little room is left for civility .
What kind of monsters would force a teen to prematurely birth her child ( who was subsequently thrown into a canal since he / she was deemed illegitimate by a killer father - in - law ) and then based on some asinine rodent ’s “ wisdom ” would throw her to a pack of rabid canines ?
While this epic torture drama ensued , hitmen were sent after Taslim ’s absconding mother to snuff out her life too .
However , if all of this does n’t inspire serious fear and fury in you , then take heart in the knowledge that a government official – a top level assistant commissioner , no less – was at the helm of these vile proceedings .
Yes , officially signed , sealed and delivered , et al .
How many more women in the sub - continent have to bleed and scream before their voices can reach the world outside ?
For every Mukhtaran Mai , a million Taslims are silently buried and disappear without a trace .
But not this time .
Definitely ,
This time the water has reached our necks and it is lashing at its nape .
It ’s gurgling in our ears .
It ’s dirty and infected and it threatens to wash us away .
It ’s a hurricane of pain and disillusionment .
It all boils down to one thing : Women are a long way from being ranked or even considered as human beings amidst some of the largest populations on the planet .
Who will speak about it ?
Who needs to speak about it ?
We .
We need to speak .
No , actually , we need to do more than just speak about it , we need to scream , yell , shout , screech , holler , and tear apart the foundations of the universe if the need arises .
This is not injustice to one , it ’s injustice to all .
We all get torn apart when militant fangs dig into a pleading Taslim ’s skin and heart .
We ca n’t reduce ourselves to willing and mute witnesses to this century ’s crimes against ourselves .
We ca n’t afford to watch it till it simply “ dies down ” or “ dissipates ” .
We ca n’t afford to be so static and unaffected .
We must do something .
We must seek justice .
We should , ideally , seek an eye for an eye because it just does n’t work any other way – all due to respect to the Gandhian dogma and Bollywood movies inspired by it .
For all that chest beating / bra burning in the name of the Sisterhood , it eventually boils down to this .
This is the reality for brown women in our world .
It ’s a large and fairly violent world but someone has to change it .
Evolution needs catalysts .
Theorizing and rationalizing will only take us so far .
The rest of the journey is on foot .
Without crutches .
My crutches included .

Barack Obama yesterday promised to end George Bush 's " twisting " of science to suit " politics or ideology " in an extraordinarily outspoken address to the nation , and announced that he was putting top climate scientists in key positions in his administration .
The move , which signals perhaps his sharpest break with the outgoing administration , makes it clear that he was going to put climate change and the environment among the most urgent priorities of his presidency .
And as if to emphasise the difference , President Bush is using his last weeks of power to push through a record number of last - minute rule changes to increase mining and oil drilling on public lands , and even to allow people to carry concealed , loaded guns into national parks .

During its years in office the Bush administration attempted to muzzle senior government scientists who disagreed with it , and even altered scientific reports – causing more than 60 top academics to sign a petition accusing the White House of manipulating findings for political reasons .
But in his weekly radio address , Mr Obama pointedly promised to end this .
" Promoting science is about free and open inquiry , " he said .
" It 's about ensuring that facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology .
It 's about listening to what our scientists have to say , even when it 's inconvenient – especially when it 's inconvenient .
That will be my goal as president of the United States . "
The president - elect used the address to announce his top scientific appointments , which included two of the world 's most respected climate scientists , John Holdren and Jane Lubchenco , in a move warmly welcomed even by the country 's top Republican environmentalist .
They will have enormous influence over his government 's green policies .
The appointments follow the naming earlier this month of Steven Chu – a Nobel prize - winning physicist , and another prominent advocate of urgent measures to tackle climate change – to the key position of energy secretary , and a decision to create a special office on energy and climate within the White House headed by Carole Browner , Bill Clinton 's former environment chief .
Both Professors Holdren and Lubchenco are past presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Professor Holdren , a professor at Harvard University and director of the blue - chip Woods Hole Research Center , will be science adviser to Mr Obama , who has elevated the position to an official assistant to the president .
He recently called for immediate action on climate change , saying that it was already causing " widespread harm " .
But he is also sceptical about nuclear power , reflecting a feeling in the Obama team that it can not be made economical .
Professor Lubchenco , of Oregon State University , a similarly outspoken expert on oceans and global warming , is to be the first female administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which measures the pace of global warming , tracks hurricanes and monitors the health of the world 's seas .

The chief scientist at Defra , Professor Bob Watson , who worked in the Clinton White House , said yesterday that Obama was putting together " a phenomenal team of world - class scientists " , as a sign that he was " totally committed to the environment " .
William K Reilly – President George Bush 's environment chief and the country 's leading Republican environmentalist – told The Independent on Sunday that he was " very pleased " by the appointments of " long - standing advocates of addressing climate change " .
In another clear indication that the incoming team has taken on board the arguments of those advocating a " green new deal " that expanding environmental industries and jobs is the best way out of the recession , Mr Obama on Friday signed up a vocal advocate of green jobs , Hilda Solis , to be his labour secretary .
The Californian congresswoman will be a key figure in implementing a plan to create millions of green jobs .
US environmentalists , however , are split over yet another appointment – of Colorado senator Ken Salazar – as secretary of the interior .
It was welcomed by the top environmental pressure groups , but smaller and more radical ones said he had had a mixed record in congressional votes .
" He 's far from the most anti-environmental guy out there , " says Kieran Suckling of the Center for Biological Diversity , " but he 's no environmental hero . "
Meanwhile , Mr Bush has been pushing through a record number of so - called " midnight regulations " .
He has enabled coal - mining firms to dump waste in valleys , relaxed pollution rules from factory farms , and allowed companies that produce toxic wastes to burn them as fuel .

Consumers are often told that if they break an item , they buy it .
But a new study suggests that if they just touch an item for more than a few seconds , they may also end up buying it .
Researchers from Ohio State University and Illinois State University tested how touching an item before buying affects how much they are willing to pay for an item .
A simple experiment with an inexpensive coffee mug revealed that in many cases , simply touching the coffee mug for a few seconds created an attachment that led people to pay more for the item .
The results , which were published recently in the journal Judgment and Decision Making , found that people become personally attached to the mug within the first 30 seconds of contact .
People who held the coffee mug longer than a few seconds seemed not only more compelled to outbid others in an auction setting , but they were also more willing to bid more than the retail price for that item .
“ The amazing part of this study is that people can become almost immediately attached to something as insignificant as a mug , ” said lead author of the study James Wolf , who started the work while he was a doctoral student at Ohio State .
“ By simply touching the mug and feeling it in their hands , many people begin to feel like the mug is , in fact , their mug .
Once they begin to feel it is theirs , they are willing to go to greater lengths to keep it . ”
Previous research had documented that many people begin to feel ownership of an item long before they actually acquire it .
But this is the first study to demonstrate that strong feelings of ownership can begin in as little as 30 seconds after initial contact , said Wolf , who is now an assistant professor of information systems at Illinois State University .

To explain how touch can affect a person ’s valuation of an object , the researchers tested 144 people at a large university .
People were asked to bid on mugs in either an open or closed auction after inspecting a coffee mug firsthand for various lengths of time .
Participants were given the mug at the beginning of both experiments .
People in the short - duration treatments were asked to inspect a coffee mug for 10 seconds , while those in the longer treatments were asked to inspect it for 30 seconds .
After inspection , they were asked to bid on the mug .
Those in closed auctions were asked to write down their maximum bid on a piece of paper for a mug worth $ 3.95 at the nearby university bookstore .
They then flipped the paper over so no one could see their bid during the auction .
Those in the open auctions , on the other hand , were allowed to see other bids .
Participants in open auctions placed their bids for a mug worth $ 4.95 through a computer - based auction similar to eBay , where they could see the current high bid and time remaining in the auction .
The open auctions had “ soft ” ending times , meaning the length of the auction was extended every time a bid was placed in the last 15 seconds of the auction .
Soft ending times were used to reduce the effects of last - second bidding .
All participants were told the retail value of the coffee mug before the auction began .
They were also informed that several identical mugs were available for purchase at the campus bookstore adjacent to the testing location .

All participants received $ 10 for participating in the experiment ; they were told that the winning bidders would have their bid amount taken out of their payment if they agreed .
The results showed that people who held the item for 30 seconds bid significantly higher than people who touched the mug for 10 seconds .
The average bid in the open auctions was $ 2.44 for people who touched the mug for 10 seconds and $ 3.91 for those in the 30 second experiments .
This finding was also consistent for those in silent auctions , with people in the 10 and 30 second experiments bidding $ 2.24 and $ 3.07 , respectively .
The higher bids were particularly significant given the fact that the researchers used seemingly insignificant , inexpensive mugs , said co-author Hal Arkes .
“ We took the most minimal type of attachment ; not a new car or a suit , but a mug .
And we found significant differences in consumer valuations that begin in a matter of seconds , ” said Arkes , who is a professor emeritus of psychology at Ohio State .
Those differences continued when the researchers looked at how often the winning bid exceeded the retail price of the mug .
All participants were told the price of the mug before bidding started .
But people who held their mug for 30 seconds bid more than the retail price four out of seven times .
Although the mugs were valued at $ 4.49 , bids went as high as $ 10 on two different occasions for those in longer duration experiments .
In contrast , the winning bid for people in the 10 second group exceeded the retail price only once .
Co-author Waleed Muhanna , who is an associate professor of management information systems at Ohio State , said the tendency for participants who held the mugs longer to bid over the retail price may come down to the strength of their attachment .
“ The strength of this attachment seems to increase with greater physical contact .
And one explanation is loss aversion ; that is , the longer people have an object , the stronger their attachment and their eagerness to keep it .
People become attached and they are willing to pay much more to avoid losing that object , ” Muhanna said .
While this research may help researchers understand the buying behaviors of consumers , many retailers have been using the try - then - buy tactic for years , Wolf said .
Car dealers often tell people to drive cars home and pet stores encourage shoppers to play with puppies because they know the attachment makes consumers more willing to buy their products .
But Wolf said understanding this attachment may help buyers make smarter decisions .
“ When you sit behind the wheel of a new car , you know you ’re going to value it more and possibly be ready to pay more .
But by going in there knowing that you are going to feel like raising your price , maybe you can be better prepared not to make a hasty purchase that you ’ll regret later on , ” he said .
The study was partially funded by Ohio State ’s Jensen - Wallin - Young Fund and by Illinois State ’s Caterpillar Scholars Fund .
George W. Bush Will Not Be President in 100 Hours
Created : January 16 , 2009 09:05 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
I did n’t watch President George W. Bush ’s valedictory speech .
As it happens , I was at my gym , using one of the elliptical machines with the personal TV screens .
I flipped to MSNBC , not mindful of the time , and then all of a sudden Bush was on the screen , mashed up , thanks to my iPod , with a Screeching Weasel song .
The women using the machines next to mine shot me brief but clearly disdainful expressions .
I changed the channel .
So I did n’t see the speech .
Read it if you feel so inclined .
It ’s hard to remember , but in 2000 , Bush ’s campaign plane was called Accountability One .
Nearly nine years later , his speech is about why he should n’t be judged by his disastrous results , but instead by what was in his heart .
If there ’s any real parting gift that George W. Bush has given conservatives , it ’s that they can no longer use Jimmy Carter ’s presidency as a laugh line .
Carter never seriously argued that his presidency succeeded because only 3000 people died from terrorism on American soil while he was president .
Indeed , the speech ’s most inspiring stories are about people who persevered despite his policies :
We see America ’s character in Dr. Tony Recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina …
We ’ve seen it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade , who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow Marines .
Maybe
Dave will have more to say about the speech .
Even without seeing it , I kind of like the verdict delivered by this TPM reader :
Yes , Palin did it herself .
The Washington Post has a photo of the budget with her handwriting on it .
She ’s such a compassionate , right wing theocrat :
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice - presidential nominee who revealed Monday that her 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant , earlier this year used her line - item veto to slash funding for a state program benefiting teen mothers in need of a place to live .
After the legislature passed a spending bill in April , Palin went through the measure reducing and eliminating funds for programs she opposed .
Inking her initials on the legislation — “ SP ” — Palin reduced funding for Covenant House Alaska by more than 20 percent , cutting funds from $ 5 million to $ 3.9 million .
Covenant House is a mix of programs and shelters for troubled youths , including Passage House , which is a transitional home for teenage mothers .
According to Passage House ’s web site , its purpose is to provide “ young mothers a place to live with their babies for up to eighteen months while they gain the necessary skills and resources to change their lives ” and help teen moms “ become productive , successful , independent adults who create and provide a stable environment for themselves and their families . ”
" The United States participated actively and effectively in the negotiations of the Convention [ Against Torture ] .
It marks a significant step in the development during this century of international measures against torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment .
Ratification of the Convention by the United States will clearly express United States opposition to torture , an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today , " - president Ronald Reagan , 1988 .
Notice his clear stand not just against torture but also against " other inhuman treatment or punishment " as well .
And now think what Bush and Cheney have done to the honor or reputation of the United States and the integrity of the conservative soul .

Abstract
The purpose of this lab is to determine the fractal dimension of broccoli .
Introduction
A fractal is an object that has a fractional spatial dimension .
The dimension of a point is 0 , a line is 1 , a plane is 2 and a cube is 3 .
The dimension of a fractal that can be drawn from a line is between 1 and 2 and has infinite points and finite length .
The dimension of a fractal created from a shape on a plane has a fractal dimension between 2 and 3 and has infinite length and finite area .
Broccoli is a fractal because it branches off into smaller and smaller pieces , which are similar in shape to the original .
The fractional dimension can be calculated by :
where N is the number of closed balls of diameter S needed to cover the object .
In this study , the fractal dimension of a broccoli is determined by calculating the slope of the graph of ln( N ) / ln ( S ) .
Broccoli is especially interesting for its fractal properties .
You can explore the concept of self - similarity by chopping broccoli .
Procedure
Buy three bunches of broccoli .
Eat two .
Measure and record the size of the remaining bunch , using either a micrometer ( for smaller pieces ) or a ruler ( for larger pieces )
Break up the broccoli into smaller pieces and repeat step 3 , three times in order to measure 3 levels of the fractal .
Eat the remainder of broccoli
Analysis
Size Range ( cm ) Number of pieces 0.25–1 117 1–2 80 2–4 9 4–8 2 8–16 3
The Fractal dimension of broccoli is the magnitude of the slope of the graph of ln( number ) vs. ln( size ) .
According to the line of best fir , the slope is 1.5 .
But wait , that does n't make sense since broccoli exists in three dimensions , so the fractal dimension must be somewhere near 3 .
Something must be wrong .
What should we do ?
Let 's get rid of the first and last data points .
They are outliers that do n't fit with the remaining points .
Aha !
Now the slope is 2.66 , which is closer to 3 and thus makes more sense .
Size Range ( cm ) Number of pieces 1 –2 80 2–4 9 4–8 2
Conclusion
The fractal dimension of a broccoli is 2.66 .
Sources of Error
It was difficult to measure the diameter of irregular pieces .
We were forced to average the major and minor axes .
It was very difficult to determine where to split the broccoli as the size became smaller .
It was ever more difficult to accurately split it , some of the buds shed off when it was being handled .

Pictured : Kiteboarder 's close encounter with a huge whale
Now Australian school teacher David Sheridan knows how Jonah felt - or near enough .
As this amazing picture shows , a huge whale suddenly rose up close to the surface as the 42 - year - old New South Wales man was riding his kiteboard - a small surfboard suspended beneath a large kite .
Seconds after this photo was snapped remotely by David 's camera , mounted on the kite apparatus , the whale flicked up its tail and gave him an almighty blow on the back of his head .
Because the camera was programmed to take pictures every 10 seconds it missed the moment when the whale struck David - but this incredible shot of the massive creature swimming beneath him is reminder enough of his close encounter .
Seconds after this photo was snapped remotely by David Sheridan 's camera , the whale flicked up its tail and gave him an almighty blow on the back of his head
' It all happened so fast that all I could do was crouch down as the whale swam under me , ' David said .
' I saw the huge shape and my reaction was to duck while remaining attached to the flying lines from the sail above me .
' The next thing I felt was its tail come up and hit me on the back of the head .
' I honestly thought I was gone - it was such a forceful blow - but then the whale eased off and I was able to sail away .
' But my legs were really shaking .
I 've never been through anything like that before and probably never will again . '
David told Sydney 's Daily Telegraph he had gone to Valla Beach , on the north coast of New South Wales , for an afternoon of kiteboarding with two friends .
Because he wanted some unique photos of himself , he set up a camera on the sail that would haul him skywards so that he could then skim across the surface of the water - a dramatic sport that leaves beach - side spectators fascinated .
' The camera was set to start firing off shots every 10 seconds as soon as I hit the water .
When the sail was at full height the camera was about 25 m above the surface .
' It was a lucky shot to snap the whale as it came up underneath me .
' It would have been great to have got a picture a second later when the tail came up and hit me in the back of the head , but you take what you get . '
He said he believed the whale was content to scare him away , rather than lash out aggressively .
' It was more of a push than a punch .
I expected more .'
Wildlife experts have identified the creature as a southern right whale , which gets its name from old - time hunters who believed the species were the ' right ' whales to hunt because they were large , slow moving and floated when they were killed .
They also provided large amounts of oil and bone .
' Southern right whales are more unpredictable than humpbacks , ' said Mr Jeff Ross of the National parks and Wildlife Service .
' It 's possible this one had a calf it was protecting , or was simply just reacting to the movement on the surface . '
El Tinklenberg , a moderate Democrat who is running against Michelle Bachmann in Minnesota ’s 6th district , raised $ 125,000 in the last 24 hours after Bachmann spoke on Hardball yesterday questioning Barack Obama ’s “ anti-American views ” and calling or the media to investigate which members of Congress share those anti-American views .
If you missed her disgusting tirade , follow the above link and watch as much as you can stomach .
There is a website up where you can sign a petition to censure her anti-American , fascist rhetoric .
If you believe that there should be no place for comments like this in our political discourse , sign the petition .
Bachmann , an attorney , attended the Coburn School of Law , an affiliate of the now defunct Oral Roberts University .
Some of Bachmann ’s previously espoused views :
“ hyper- regulation ” by the federal government created a chain of events that caused bank failures and credit freezes .
( source )
Congress has been pushing banks to make risky , subprime loans .
Using the authority of the Community Reinvestment Act , the big push for subprime mortgages ( source )
“ Loans started being made on the basis of race , and often little else . ”
Blaming minority lending for economic crisis ‘ does not mean I ’m a racist ’ ( source )
challenging the nation ’s embrace of energy - efficient compact fluorescent lights , saying the government has no business telling consumers what kind of light bulbs they can buy . ” ( source )
told her local St. Cloud
Times that she knows of a secret plan by Iran to partition Iraq and turn half of the country into a “ terrorist safe haven zone ” called the “ Iraq State of Islam . ” ( source )
She later recanted this accusation .
“ [ Pelosi ] is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that she ’s just trying to save the planet , ” Bachmann told the right - wing news site OneNewsNow .
“ We all know that someone did that over 2,000 years ago , they saved the planet — we did n’t need Nancy Pelosi to do that . ” ( source )
“ We ’re losing our country .
People are not assimilating themselves to America .
They ’re not speaking English , and you must speak it if you want to succeed here in this country , ” she said .
Bachmann also compared the situation on the border to the Israel / Palestine conflict , saying “ the argument that fences do n’t work does n’t hold water .
Look at Israel and Palestine .
Fences work . ” ( source )
“ Some suggestions are that perhaps we would see an enhancement of wildlife expansion because of the warmth of the pipeline , ” she said . [ … ]
The pipeline has now become a meeting ground and “ coffee klatch ” for the caribou , she said .
( source )
I could list many more lunatic rantings of Ms. Bachmann , but I think I have provided enough that you can come to a reasoned conclusion about this woman .
If you feel that America has had enough of Michelle Bachmann , please feel free to donate what you can to her opponent , El Tichlenberg .
The people of this country deserve better than having someone as morally and ethically bankrupt as Bachmann representing them , and the type of rhetoric and hatred that she warmly embraces and espouses .
As we all know , money is needed to win these races .
Do what you can .
UPDATE :
Update : $ 438,346.57 .
That ’s how much El Tinklenberg says has flooded in so far .
He ’s aiming for half a million .

People are so often great .
This time they have voted down the Congestion charge in Manchester .
They dared to vote down a £ 1.6 billion “ bribe ” – more public spending which of course would all be borrowed and which the people of Manchester and elsewhere would have to pay back with interest sometime .
Great news .
All this will come as a huge surprise to many of my MP colleagues who still bellieve people want all this public spending on the never never , more than they want more money in their own pocket to pay the gas bill , the mortgage and for the family car .
Labour especially is always complaining if Conservatives do not approve every extra penny of borrowed money , even when it is being wasted in a most obvious way as with the VAT cut , unelected regional government , ID computers and the like .
They need to think again .
Or will the people of Manchester have to vote again , as they got it wrong .?
Will Labour adopt EU style democracy , where you have ballot by exhaustion till they get the result they want ?
Or will we have Lab style democracy , where you vote down regional government one day , and are told they will keep it on an unelected basis the next !
The conceptual landscape of productivity and personal development is in dire need of some revisioning .
This has been apparent to many of the bloggers , writers , and coaches in the field , and many of us , individually , started questioning the state of the art .
But more is needed – rather than discussing these ideas in our own separate space , we need to start discussing them in the same space .
During the latter part of last November , I asked some of the bloggers that were pushing me to rethink productivity and personal development to be on a panel of sorts to talk to each other about the issues .
To be honest , I did n’t know where it would go and how it would turn out , but I just knew it needed to happen .
The conversations that followed exceeded all of our expectations .
They have really crystallized and changed the way I think about productivity and personal development , and you can see the same ideas played out on Lifehack in Dustin ’s “ Toward a New Vision of Productivity ” series .
The goal has always been to share these conversations and ideas , and for next few weeks , parts of the conversations will be hosted here .
Where it goes after that , we ’re not sure – but we hope that you enjoy them as much as we have .
The Panel
For something like this to work , it ’s key to have a group of smart , reflective people interested in the topic .
Additionally , there has to be enough diversity so that it ’s an actual conversation rather than people expressing the same ideas in the same way .
What has made the conversations so illuminating , interesting , and fun is the quality of the people on the call – I ’m just glad they put up with me !

I ’m really interested in helping creatives become consistently creative and productive in ways that suit who they want to be .
What ’s Wrong With “ Productivity ” ?
The topic of the first ( unrecorded ) call was , loosely , “ What ’s wrong with productivity , and what ’s the fix ? ”
The topic became salient as most of us commented on how we were tired of “ productivity ” and the way it ’s normally presented or understood .
While the call was not recorded , I was able to recreate most of the ideas and the flow of the conversation .
What follows is a sample of what you ’ll hear in the upcoming weeks :
The office paradigm that Getting Things Done is written from does n’t fit a lot of people because a lot of the people that are really interested in productivity do n’t work in offices .
The principles of GTD , though , can be applied to any type of work – even that for creatives .
When people are doing things that they genuinely love to do , they really do n’t need a productivity system to help them do it .
It ’s all the other stuff that people need the most help with .
Meaning does n’t come from repeatedly doing as many presentations of GTD make it seem .
We can become more and more efficient and can crank more and more widgets without addressing how that relates to our own goals and meaning .
Many people focus on the efficiency brought about by following GTD , but efficiency is not effectiveness .
The problem with finding and following meaningful goals is n’t a problem with any given productivity system .
It ’s a problem with us – many people are just not ready or equipped to deal with questions of meaning and purpose .
The weekly review is supposed to help here , but so few people are equipped to deal with the questions that need to be asked and answered that it does n’t help .
It ’s fascinating that many of the people who are so interested in personal development ( i.e. meaning and purpose ) are so disinterested in productivity , and many people who are interested in productivity are n’t interested so much in personal development .
Productivity systems have a way of trying to algorithm - ize goals and life choices that just do n’t fit into that type of pattern .
The idea of a weekly review is a perfect example of this – you ca n’t program a time to effectively review your life .
The idea of a weekly review is a perfect example of this – you ca n’t program a time to effectively review your life .
There comes a point with lifehacks of diminishing returns .
The first ones adopted may help increase productivity , but later adoptions do n’t yield similar increases .
We should shift into thinking about how to improve our core competencies rather than new things to add to the list of skills we already have .
Many people confuse the placebo effect from trying a new productivity tool or tip from the tip itself .
It ’s often the reviewing your work processes that increase your productivity more than the actual tip itself .
What ’s missing from discussion of productivity is the inclusion of how people ’s personality affects how they ’ll approach productivity .
There is no productivity system that works for everyone .
There are bits and pieces of productivity systems that work for certain people based on what type of work they do and what type of personalities they have .
And that was just the first call !
Our next call was ( loosely ) about the relationship between personal development and productivity .
On Thursday , we ’ll share Part 1 of that call – it ’ll be about 20 minutes .
I ’ll post the other two parts next week .
If you ’re interested in productivity , personal development , lifestyle redesign , and creativity , then you ’ll be interested in these calls .
We look forward to seeing your comments and contributions !

Anyone looking southwest in evening twilight as November turns to December will witness a close pairing of the two brightest planets , Venus and Jupiter .
On November 30th and December 1st they ’ll be separated by only 2° — about the width of your finger held at arm ’s length .
And on the evening of December 1st , skywatchers in the Americas will see the crescent Moon joining the two planets to make a remarkably compact celestial triangle .
It ’s sure to turn heads .
The illustration at right shows the scene .
( Reload or click here if no illustration is visible . )
It 's plotted for observers in the middle of North America ( and the alignment of the Venus - Jupiter pairing is exact for December 1st ) , but it ’s close enough to give a good idea of how the scene will look from anywhere in North America on the evenings in question .
Although the three objects appear close together , appearances in astronomy are deceiving .
The Moon is only 252,000 miles away , less far than you may have driven in your lifetime .
Right now Venus is 370 times farther away , at 94 million miles .
And Jupiter , at 540 million miles , is nearly six times farther than Venus .
If the sky is cloudy for this event , do n't despair .
Venus and the crescent Moon will have another spectacular twilight pairing ( though without Jupiter ) on December 31st , New Year 's Eve .
This week 's planet conjunction marks the second time this year that Venus and Jupiter have mimicked a brilliant " double star " in our sky .
Back on February 1st , they appeared together in the eastern sky before dawn .
At that time they nestled even closer together — only ½° apart .
The last time these two planets were paired in the evening sky and easily seen was September 2005 , when they appeared about 1 ½° apart .
They wo n't be this close together and well placed for evening viewing again until May 2013 ( 1° apart ) .
Special Treat for Europeans
Across much of Europe , even people who never normally look up should watch the western twilight on Monday evening , December 1st .
The Moon will be right next to Venus and Jupiter .
But the real show happens when the Moon 's dim , earthlit edge occults ( covers ) dazzling Venus itself .
The second act happens roughly an hour or more later , when Venus reemerges into view from behind the crescent 's bright edge .
At locations where the twilight sky has darkened enough , all you 'll need are your eyes .
But binoculars or a telescope will give a much grander view — and will also allow you to watch the occultation where it happens in a bright sky , even before sunset .
Actually , with Venus a full 43° from the Sun , you may be able to pick it up in daylight with your unaided eye , depending on the clearness of the air .
Venus will appear small and gibbous in a telescope , 69 % sunlit and 17 arcseconds across ( a hundredth the diameter of the Moon ) .
Because of Venus 's significant angular size , its disappearance and reappearance will each be gradual , taking 30 seconds or more .
As a child , Mike Brown had all the trappings of an astronomer in the making , with space books , rocket drawings , and a poster of the planets on his bedroom wall .
The poster depicted Pluto as “ this crazy and very eccentric planet , ” he says .
“ It was everyone ’s favorite crazy planet . ”
Brown , now an astronomer at Caltech , still recalls the mnemonic he learned for the names of the planets : Martha visits every Monday and ( the a was for asteroids ) just stays until noon , period .
“ The ‘ period , ’ for Pluto , was always suspicious , ” Brown says with a laugh .
“ It did n’t seem to fit .
So maybe that was when I first got the idea that Pluto did n’t belong . ”
Brown ’s childhood insight now sounds like a premonition .
In August 2006 the International Astronomical Unionofficially demoted Pluto , putting it into the new category of “ dwarf planet , ” a sun-orbiting object big enough to be forced into a spherical shape by gravity but not big enough to clear its own orbit .
The IAU more recently deemed Pluto and two newfound bodies to be “ plutoids , ” bright dwarf planets that circulate mostly outside Neptune ’s orbit .
The decision was controversial and continues to generate protest , fueled by new findings from this icy realm .
These remote celestial bodies are the largest known members of the Kuiper belt , a band of rocky , icy objects that orbit the sun in a swath stretching from beyond Neptune to a distance of nearly 5 billion miles .
Whatever you call them , one point is beyond debate : Pluto is no longer a lonely outpost in an otherwise empty frontier .
A string of discoveries has revealed that it is merely the entry point to a vast and still mysterious wilderness that teems with an uncount - able number of unusual objects .
They come in a variety of shapes , colors , and sizes , many with their own moons , some in peculiar orbits that have been pushed by Neptune or pulled by passing stars .
Stranger objects are likely to be found , since astronomers are only on the edge of discovering this vast new terrain .
In the 1940s and 1950s , astronomers Kenneth Edgeworth and Gerard Kuiper independently predicted that a reservoir of icy rocks lay beyond the orbit of Neptune .
Many of these objects became short - period comets , with orbits of 200 years or less , that blasted in toward the sun , crossing the paths of most planets .
Excluding Pluto ( discovered in 1930 ) , the first official Kuiper belt object was not found until 1992 , by astronomers Jane Luu and David Jewitt .
Since then , in excess of 1,200 have been detected in the 2 - billion - mile - wide Edgeworth - Kuiper belt ( commonly truncated to Kuiper belt ) , including burly Eris , even larger than Pluto .
Almost all of the biggest have been found by Brown and his colleagues .
More than 100,000 objects at least 30 miles across may occupy the belt .
But our solar system does n’t end there .
Far beyond the Kuiper belt lies the mysterious
Oort cloud , a spherical shell that stretches to the boundaries of interstellar space and blasts its own dark ice balls toward the sun .
Trillions more bodies may lurk there .
A few may be as big as Mercury or Mars .
Imprinted in those far - flung worlds , scientists say , is the history of the solar system before planets came to be .
Every Kuiper belt object and Oort cloud entity is a geologic fossil , preserved at low temperatures , largely unaltered by time , and made up of the material from which the solar system formed .
Understanding their compositions — and why they are where they are today — will help scientists reconstruct the nascent moments of our planetary neighborhood and our sun ’s younger days , when it was just one of a cluster of stars .
Name That Celestial Object Scientific nomenclature can barely keep up with the range of objects that astronomers are discovering in the solar system these days .
Future discoveries will no doubt suggest new categories and further blur the boundaries of old ones .
In the meantime , here ’s a field guide to the known residents .
Planets are defined by the IAU as bodies orbiting the sun that have been made spherical by their own gravity and have cleared their orbit of other objects .
Not every astronomer accepts this designation .
Dwarf Planets
are similar to planets but are too small to clear their own orbits .
Most lie beyond the orbit of Neptune , making them plutoids , a subcategory named for the most famous member of their group .
Asteroids
are rocky , metallic , or carbonaceous bodies whose solar orbit takes them beyond Mars into the so - called asteroid belt .
They typically lack sufficient gravity to retain an atmosphere .
The latest count of asteroids in the inner solar system , inside Jupiter , is between 1.1 million and 1.9 million .
Comets
are icy bodies that follow elliptical orbits .
Those originating in the Kuiper belt have orbital periods shorter than 200 years .
Longer - period comets originate much farther out in the Oort cloud .
Known comets number in the thousands , but trillions might be out there .
Classical Kuiper Belt Objects orbit the sun at 3.9 billion to 4.5 billion miles out .
They are sometimes called cubewanos , after QB1 , the first Kuiper belt object discovered ( 1992 ) .
Resonant Kuiper Belt Objects orbit in synchrony with Neptune .
Pluto is the prototype , orbiting twice around the sun for every three solar circuits made by Neptune .
The majority of known RKBOs are thought to orbit with a similar 2:3 resonance and thus are called plutinos .
About 100 other objects with resonant orbits have been detected .
Scattered Kuiper Belt Objects have very eccentric and tilted orbits that carry them from around 3.3 billion miles from the sun to almost 100 billion miles out .
They may have been kicked into their far - flung orbits by Neptune ’s gravity .
Deep red , large , and very far away , Sedna is an enigma .
Since its discovery , the menagerie of big oddities in the outer solar system has expanded to include Eris and Makemake , a plutoid discovered in 2005 .

Looking Deeper and Farther
As astronomers trip over one another hunting for planets outside our solar system , some of the most exciting finds may be closer to home .
Palomar Observatory Survey Since 1998 , Mike Brown , Chad Trujillo of Gemini North Observatory , and astronomer David Rabinowitz of Yale University have used the 48 - inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Mountain in Southern California to scan the Kuiper belt and beyond for objects two - hundredths the brightness of Pluto .
Every night a mosaic of 112 charge - coupled devices ( CCDs ) snaps digital images of a hand - size patch of sky .
So far the search has turned up almost 100 new objects .
Deep Ecliptic Survey
In this study , a mosaic of eight CCD detectors coupled to the 3.8 - meter Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson , Arizona , scanned for faint Kuiper belt objects as small as 30 miles in diameter .
A second , identical camera was connected to the Blanco Telescope in La Serena , Chile .
In all , the survey spotted 499 objects .
The goal , says former survey leader Robert Millis , was to discover enough distant bodies to begin to understand the scale of the belt , the three - dimensional distribution of these objects in space , and their orbits .
Currently the group is engaged in follow - up study and working to improve observational techniques .
Spacewatch
For a portion of each month , the 0.9 - meter and 1.8 - meter telescopes at Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak scan the skies for comets , asteroids headed for Earth , and other small bodies in the solar system .
Although Kuiper belt objects are not the main quarry of Spacewatch , the project ’s astronomers did find 560 - mile - wide Varuna , a dwarf planet candidate .
Taiwan - American Occultation Survey Astronomers are using four small robotic telescopes to simultaneously scan the same patch of sky .
The telescopes look for the slight dimming of distant stars that occurs as Kuiper belt objects momentarily pass in front of them .
The hope is that objects as small as a third of a mile wide will be detectable .
The survey monitors 2,000 stars each night .
New Horizons NASA is gearing up for a historic first visit to the frigid world of Pluto and its moon , Charon .
The designated explorer , a 1,000 - pound , $ 550 million spacecraft called New Horizons , swung around Jupiter in February 2007 for a gravity boost and is scheduled to arrive in July 2015 .
It will snap the first close - up images of Pluto and Charon , map their surface features with visible - wavelength cameras , study their compositions in the near - infrared spectrum , and monitor Pluto ’s thin atmosphere with ultraviolet spectrometers and radio waves .
The closest approach will bring the probe within 6,000 miles of Pluto ’s surface .
Among their many aspirations , NASA scientists hope New Horizons will clarify Pluto ’s relationship to Triton , a moon of Neptune with a similar size , mass , and composition .
Are they sister worlds or historically distinct entities ?
After 2015 , the spacecraft will venture farther out into the Kuiper belt , where it will spend five years or more studying at least one of the smaller ( 30 - to 60 - mile - wide ) objects there .
“ This is our first foray into the deep , frozen , ancient outer solar system , ” says planetary scientist Alan Stern .
“ This is what humans do , what great civilizations do :
They explore and they make history . ”
Understanding Your Solar System 2.0
It ’s not about planets anymore .
In the past decade , astronomers have spotted hundreds of objects in the Kuiper belt , one of them ( Eris ) even bigger than Pluto .
Countless more await discovery .
Even the distant
Oort cloud is coming into scientific focus .
Preserved in these nether realms are trillions of rocky , icebound insights into the early days of the sun and the formation of the solar system .
In spatial scale and information potential , they are the true solar system — past , present , and future .
Inner Solar System : 0 –5.2 astronomical units , or AU
The inner solar system spans everything from the sun out to ( but not including ) Jupiter , 483 million miles away .
The solar system as a whole formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing disk of dust and gas .
Swarms of boulder - size objects called planetesimals slowly accreted to form the rocky planets — Mercury , Venus , Earth , and Mars — and their various and sundry satellites .
The leftovers linger today in the asteroid belt .
Farther out , well away from the sun ’s warmth , gases like hydrogen and helium remained in place and accumulated to form the gaseous outer planets : Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune .
Asteroid Belt 2.3–3.3 AU
( main belt )
The majority of asteroids orbit about 210 million miles from the sun , between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter .
A smaller group orbits at about 370 million miles ; a third group occupies the same orbit ( though not the same spot ) as Jupiter .
At least 100 asteroids are a mile or more in diameter , and a dozen or so are 200 miles wide .
The largest , Ceres , is 600 miles wide and is now considered a dwarf planet .
One astronomical unit ( AU ) equals the distance from the sun to Earth , about 93 million miles .
Kuiper Belt : 30 –50 AU
The Kuiper belt is a vast reservoir of icy rocks that extends from about 3 billion miles from the sun , beyond Neptune ’s orbit , to 5 billion miles out .
Beyond that , the number of detected objects drops precipitously until one reaches the Oort cloud .
There may be billions of Kuiper belt objects in all , including at least 35,000 that are more than 60 miles wide .
Eris is the largest and farthest of the known objects ; there is also some truly quirky stuff out there .
2003 EL61 looks like a deflated football hurtling end over end through space , dragging along two moons and a tail of icy debris .
Pluto was once thought to be unique in having a moon ( Charon ) , but dozens of Kuiper belt objects are now known to have such partners .
Most of the bodies in the Kuiper belt are believed to have formed roughly where they now reside , and many have stayed largely undisturbed in temperatures averaging –375 degrees Fahrenheit .
They come in a variety of colors , from gray to dark red , but all are thought to be half ice and half rock .
On occasion a gravitational bump from Neptune tosses a Kuiper belt object toward the sun .
Then the heated ices sublime , producing a bright halo of glowing gas that trails behind the rock : the coma and the tail of a comet .
Oort Cloud 10,000 – 100,000 AU
The entire solar system is enveloped by the Oort cloud , an enormous sphere of dormant comets extending more than 9 trillion miles into space .
The cloud is thought to contain trillions of loose lumps of dust and volatile gases , near - perfect samples of the stuff from which the planets were made .
Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik
Oort first proposed the existence of the cloud in 1950 to explain the peculiar paths of comets that take more than 200 years to orbit the sun .
This model suggests that the cloud ’s contents started out closer by , near Jupiter and the other gas giants , until gravitational encounters with those planets knocked the primordial bits into the hinterlands .
Barely 5 percent of that original material remains in the Oort cloud ; the rest has been ejected entirely from the solar system .
Over time , the gravitational yanks of passing stars jostled the orbits of the outer
Oort cloud objects , leaving no hint of their formerly neat , flat paths around the sun .
( The orbits of objects in the loosely defined inner Oort cloud , located a few thousand astronomical units from the sun , do retain some memory of their origins , so this part of the cloud is thought to be flatter . )
The outer , round cloud would have taken about a billion years to form , making it the youngest structure in the solar system .
Compiz Fusion and X.org MPX and Input Redirection Patches are now out !
So , I figured that I should publish these before murphy ’s law ensures that I either have a 1 % chance of living the next day , or that the Australian Government censors me .
So , as previously said , the patches are now out today .
Here is a list of what they contend of :
All plugins that used mouse input can use input from all devices , not just the master device
Fixes for the Input Redirection patches in the X Server
Input Redirection support in shift , scale , freewins , shelf and ring ( Expo and Ezoom are not included because they were difficult for me to do mathmatically , volunteers welcome )
So , wihout further ado , the patches are retrievable from my git repository , located at
git://git.compiz-fusion.org/users/smspillaz/compiz-mpx-ir
Inside you will find three directories , xorg , compiz and fusion .
You shoud apply the patches in that order .
In the xserver directory , there is a second patch for you to use if you use proprietary video drivers which do n’t like the new function signatures .
Of couse , credit where credit is due :
Peter Hutterer for : Adapting the base of Compiz for X Input 2 Support ( the core patches are mostly based on his original work ) Getting MPX Support into the X Server
David Reveman for : Creating Compiz , which I ’m sure we all ca n’t live without Creating the Triangular Co-ordinate mesh input redirection system in XComposite
Joel Bosveld ( b0le ) for : Updating the X Server Input Redirection patches to be more relevant with the current X Server Showing me how the X Triangle Mesh works Helping me in implementing the meshing interface in Compiz - Core
Dennis Kaspryzyk ( onestone ) for : Helping me to understand some of the mathematics behind expo and others ( although , I was unable to use the methods that he suggested , perhaps one day I will find a way )
And thanks to all of you who were patient in waiting for me to release these patches .
Hopefully , with this work done , more people will be able to have input redirection in their servers , and the X.org team will consider input redirection to be an important item on their agenda in future X server releases .
I have also stickied a thread on the C- F forums , ‘ Input Redirection Reliant Ideas ‘ .
Please , feel free to post away .
There is no tutorial on how to apply the patches at the moment , I will make one soon .

BBC News
Prime Minister James Callaghan described the situation as a " scandal " Documents marked " Top Secret , UK eyes only " which have just been de-classified by the National Archives , show the Labour government of 30 years ago was engulfed in a furious row over the inadequacy of the nation 's defences .
The papers paint a picture of a 1970s Britain that would have been virtually helpless in the face of a Soviet attack .
As the public were being advised on how to prepare for a three - minute warning , government briefings made it clear their efforts would have been a waste of time .
Just released by the National Archives , conversations in 1978 between the then Prime Minister James Callaghan and his defence secretary , Fred Mulley , describe the country 's defences as " outweighed " , " outnumbered " and " insufficient " .
The damning assessment came after Mr Callaghan ordered a defence analysis in response to a Joint Intelligence Committee ( JIC ) report on the scale of the Soviet threat to the UK .
In reply , Mr Mulley wrote : " The picture the Chiefs of Staff set out is a sobering one . "
I take it someone has worked out whether we can defend ourselves !
Prime Minister James Callaghan
" Air defences would be outweighed because aircraft would be outnumbered and stocks of air defence munitions would sustain operations for only two or three days .
" The Army would be able to counter the currently assessed Soviet land threat during the initial stages of war but , lacking supporting arms and logistic support , it would be inadequate to deal with any significant threat .
" In the case of nuclear attack by ballistic missiles there would be no defensive capability , save the indirect defence of our nuclear forces . "
In the air , the UK would be forced to confront an estimated 200 Soviet bombers with 98 fighters , resulting in destruction to the UK many times worse than that delivered by the German Luftwaffe .
At sea , the country 's force of minesweepers and mine hunters numbered " only 32 " and were considered " obsolete " .
Public information told people how to make fall - out shelters and save water Mr Callaghan was furious .
He described the lack of air munitions in particular as a " scandal " and said " one or two people should be sacked " , although he did not include Mr Mulley .
The documents are scrawled with his exasperated comments .
At one point he writes : " Heaven help us if there is a war ! "
At another : " I take it someone has worked out whether we can defend ourselves ! "
The assessment also had implications that reached beyond the fate of Britain .
Mr Mulley wrote : " It is unlikely that the UK defences could prevent the loss of a substantial proportion of Nato 's forces based in the UK , including important US assets .
This would , he said , " significantly reduce Nato 's ability to sustain conventional operations successfully in Europe , in the eastern Atlantic and in the Channel areas " .
British fighter planes patrolled British air space for Soviet aircraft
Their conclusion was also sobering .
It showed a realisation that Britain could not hope to stand alone against the Soviet war machine .
One letter to the prime minister reads : " The problem is made worse by the rate at which the offensive capability which the Russians might use against the United Kingdom is growing .
We shall have to run hard to stand still .
" Though the secretary of state for defence 's report on the United Kingdom 's direct defences is a worrying one , we should continue to rely on the collective deterrence offered by the Alliance as the main source of our security . "
In the end the attack never came and just four years later the country was at war on the other side of the Atlantic , over the Falkland Islands .
According to William Spencer , a military specialist at the National Archives , since the row in 1978 , both the military threat to the UK and how the nation 's forces prepare for it , have changed dramatically .
The documents are scrawled with comments from the prime minister As the Cold War ended , the emphasis on fighting a nuclear war with a major European opponent declined .
The UK 's nuclear capacity is now limited to submarine - launched intercontinental ballistic missiles - Trident - and the military 's focus has moved towards a much more global commitment .
The British military is spread more thinly across a variety of different conflicts and operations - a force that has to be both more mobile and multi-tasking .
The need for powerful alliances , however , remains a cornerstone of British defence strategy .

Vincent Dooly ( Andrew Bowser ) is an aspiring inventor who dreams of winning an annual inventing award .
There ’s only one problem … he ’s never made anything that ’s worked .
Now , it ’s the last year he can enter and he has some stiff competition from Martin Wooderson , the smug wunderkind who has a long history of winning .
But this time , Vincent has a plan… and it just might change everything .
Written By Joseph M. Petrick and directed by Petrick & Bowser , the film is a comedy about an indomitable oddball who refuses to give up on his dreams and is a reflection of the filmmakers ’ own dreams .
The film was made with money raised mostly from friends and family , it is a testament to the hilarity of perpetual failure and the triumph of spirit to get back up and try again .

The EPA has launched a new website hoping to enlist the public and law enforcement in capturing fugitives accused of environmental violations .
The site , EPA Fugitives , includes photos of the accused along with summaries of their violations .
Some of the alleged violations are the smuggling of ozone - depleting substances , illegally disposing of hazardous waste , and discharging pollutants into the air and water .
One fugitive , Mauro Valenzuela , illegally transported waste oxygen generators on board a jet without proper markings or safety measures .
The jet crashed and killed all 110 passengers and crew .
“ Putting this information on the EPA ’s Web site will increase the number of ‘ eyes ’ looking for environmental fugitives , ” said Granta Y. Nakayama , assistant administrator for EPA ’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance .
“ Two EPA fugitives were captured this year , and this Web site could help us find more fugitives in the future . ”
If you encounter any of these fugitives , please resist from enacting some hippy version of COPS , as they maybe armed and dangerous .
Please notify the EPA via the website .
You can also report the information to your local police or the nearest U.S. Embassy ( in case you defected because you thought McCain might win ) .

No certificate
Governor ’s power disputed
No clear answers
Kevin Diaz • 202-408-2753
By Kevin Diazkdiaz@startribune.com WASHINGTON
—
The lights were on and the coffee was brewing Monday inside Norm Coleman ’s Capitol Hill office .
But the doors were locked .
Amid legal questions about the Senate recount standoff with Democrat Al Franken , some of Coleman ’s Capitol Hill staff did n’t even know if they would get paid when they showed up for work .
Given the current balance of power in the Senate , all that seems certain now is that neither Coleman nor Franken will be around for today ’s swearing - in of the 111th Congress .
“ As a practical matter , one side or the other can prevent someone from being administered the oath , ” said Minnesota congressional analyst Steven Smith , a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis .
Texas Sen. John Cornyn , new chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) , called any immediate move to install Franken “ a recipe for chaos .
” The legal tangle — which officially started when the Minnesota Republican ’s term ended Saturday — remains mired in procedural and constitutional questions that some say could be headed for the nation ’s highest court .
With the state Canvassing Board declaring Franken the top vote - getter by 225 votes on Monday , Senate Republicans and Democrats are girded for gridlock over any immediate attempt to seat him , or to let Gov. Tim Pawlenty appoint Coleman temporarily while the legal challenges play out .
“ The race in Minnesota is not over , ” said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , moments after Senate Democrats pronounced Franken the winner .
Some Democrats , notably Amy Klobuchar — currently Minnesota ’s only U.S. Senator — earlier proposed seating the top vote getter in the Canvassing Board ’s recount , “ pending litigation . ”
With Franken on top , Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said that an attempt to seat Franken this week is “ likely , ” but that it wo n’t happen Tuesday .
Republicans have signaled their intent to block such a move , and they currently have enough votes to mount a successful filibuster .
Franken ’s biggest legal and political obstacle is that despite the certification of results , he still has no formal election certificate , and is n’t likely to have one while Coleman contests the Canvassing Board ’s decision .
Smith and a number of other academic experts say there is no modern precedent for seating a U.S. senator without an election certificate , despite hard - fought post-election battles in New Hampshire and Louisiana .
Under Minnesota law , a certificate must be signed by the governor and the secretary of state , and there ’s a seven - day waiting period before that can happen .
So the earliest Franken could have a signed certificate would be next Monday .
But Coleman ’s camp has all but guaranteed a lawsuit , and Minnesota law says a certificate ca n’t be signed until the lawsuit is over .
Some Democrats have argued that common sense and fairness would dictate no delay in seating Franken .
But their argument has been weakened by their objection to seating Roland Burris scandal - plagued Gov. Rod Blagojevich ’s appointee in Illinois — until he gets an election certificate .
Facing the prospect of protracted litigation , some observers are n’t holding their breath for any quick resolution of the Minnesota impasse .
“ I think this seat will not get filled pending the litigation , and that could be six months , ” said Hamline University law and politics professor David Schultz .
Republicans , for their part , have discussed the possibility of having Pawlenty make a temporary appointment — presumably Coleman or some other Republican .
The 17th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution appears to give him that power .
But Democrats , who control the Senate , say they would block such a move .
Manley has suggested that the Senate would have to declare a vacancy before the governor can fill it .
That is based on an election dispute in New Hampshire in 1975 , when the Senate , stymied by filibusters , declared a vacancy and called for a special election .
Schultz and other academics say there ’s no Senate rule that bars a gubernatorial appointment without a declaration of vacancy .
But while some argue Pawlenty would have the right , few believe it is something he would do .
“ It ’s something he wants to avoid , politically , at this point , ” Schultz said .
Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said the governor ’s office could make an appointment only in the case of a permanent vacancy .
“ Our office has done the legal research and it appears the governor does not have the ability to appoint an interim U.S. Senator in this case , ” he said .
Some experts believe that the most immediate prospect for an early resolution would be if the Minnesota courts can move quickly through Coleman ’s challenges .
Then , even if there were pending federal appeals , Democrats could argue that Minnesota has been heard and that the governor should sign a certificate and end the vacancy .
“ In the end , most of these things are settled politically , not legally , ” said Thomas Mann , a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Klobuchar appears to have a political deal in mind with the suggestion of seating someone before all of Coleman ’s appeals are exhausted .
Her spokesman , Linden Zakula , said her idea “ allows two senators to serve the people of Minnesota , but still allows legal challenges to proceed .
If procedural or legal obstacles prevent this , then we ’ll simply have to resolve those issues .
” Ultimately , one of those issues could turn on the courts ’ power to intervene at all , based on Congress ’ constitutional power to “ be the judge of the elections … of its own members . ”
Some theorists say it ’s a clear - cut right .
But others note that in 1969 , the U.S. Supreme Court forced the U.S. House to take back controversial Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell .
“ If you ’re looking for clear answers , ” Smith said , “ you wo n’t find them . ”

Windows 7's new Taskbar has drawn many comparisons to Mac OS X's Dock , and many of them negative , with the overwhelming concern that Windows is becoming too Mac - like .
Even among Mac users , the new Taskbar is unlikely to be universally appreciated , as many feel that the Dock is deeply flawed .
On a superficial level , the similarity is obvious ; both Dock and Taskbar are rows of large icons used for application launching and switching .
Closer examination , however , reveals that there 's a long way to go before anyone should worry that Microsoft is slavishly following Apple .
The Windows UI is n't turning into the Mac OS X UI — not yet , at least .
UI Paradigms
In order to fully appreciate the differences between the Taskbar and Dock , we first have to understand the basic premises on which Windows and OS X are built .
Much of the material in this section will be remedial for the majority of readers , but it pays to cover it anyway , since it lays an important foundation for the rest of the article .
The fundamental distinction between OS X and Windows is that , in general , windows on Mac OS X represent documents ; on Windows , they represent applications .
This conceptual difference motivates many of the UI features of both OSes , and understanding it is key to understanding the two operating systems .
In practice , the most obvious repercussion of this difference is that on Mac OS X , closing the last window of an application does not exit the application itself .
After all , each window is merely a document , and just because there are no documents open does not mean that the application should close ; perhaps the next action will be to create a new document or open an existing one .
In Windows , on the other hand , closing the last window generally closes the application completely .
Because the application is the window , closing the window naturally closes the application with it .
So , for example , in this screenshot we see TextEdit is running with a single document window open .
Closing that document does n't close TextEdit ; it 's still running , just without any windows ( that is , documents ) open .
TextEdit
TextEdit has no windows , but is running all the same
In Windows , by contrast , closing the last document window closes the application :
Notepad
With no windows , Notepad has nowhere to run , so it quits — hence the Taskbar no longer has a Notepad icon .
The Mac 's window - per - document model naturally leads all Mac software to be able to load and display multiple documents simultaneously ; to have multiple documents , just create multiple windows .
Multiple documents just mean multiple windows ; no problem
The situation is n't so clear - cut on Windows .
Because each window represents an entire application , what should an application do if the user wants to load two documents simultaneously ?
The lack of a single good answer means that Windows applications exhibit a variety of behaviors .
The simplest policy is that used by Notepad ; Notepad simply can't open multiple documents , and so to get multiple documents you just run multiple copies of the application .
Multiple Notepad documents means multiple Notepad applications
While this works reasonably well for small , lightweight applications like Notepad , it 's not so satisfactory for larger applications , and as a result we see a variety of other behaviors in other Windows programs .
After weeks of speculation surrounding Dell 's rumored MacBook Air competitor , the PC maker finally gave a sneak peek to journalists of its new Adamo portable at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
But much to Â the dismay of those attending , it was hard to get a clear look at the machine .
A model carried the notebook around in front of the room in only one hand but in low light , then she was whisked away from the stage .
According toÂ Engadget , all they could get out of Dell execs was that " Alienware is [ Dell 's ] top performance brand , Adamo is our top design brand . "
Dell consumer sales and marketing vice president Michael Tatelman said the Adamo will represent Dell 's " luxury franchise " , and to expect a release in the first half of this year .
Â Tatelman declined to reveal any information about price , saying development is on schedule and this was only a " sneak peek " .

This just in : Congressman John Shadegg 's campaign appears to be using some pretty shady surrogates .
And no , I 'm not talking about Shadegg 's fellow Republican congressman , Rick Renzi , who 's awaiting trial on a host of felony counts .
Or former Arizona Attorney General ( and fellow Republican ) Jack LaSota , who 's apparently making big bucks making robo-calls on behalf of payday lenders .
Nope , when it comes to connecting you with shady people , Congressman Shadegg 's campaign takes the cake :
They 're apparently using felons and at least one sex offender to work the phone banks .
Ewww .
As first reported on the Politico Web site , the Shadegg campaign has paid at least three men with dubious pasts to work its phone banks .
One guy , records suggest , did two years in the Arizona Department of Corrections for vehicle theft and burglary .
Another did nearly four years for burglary .
And the third phone bank worker may well be the creepiest :
This 24 - year - old male is a registered sex offender who had " sexal contact with a minor , " according to the state 's registry .
The state labels him an " intermediate " risk .
Normally , we do n't get too worked up about the whole a - sex - offender - just - moved - into - my - neighborhood thing .
But this is a little different .
Phone bank workers presumably have access to both the names and addresses of the registered voters that they 're dialing .
And , naturally , if a kid picks up the phone , their first question ought to be , " Are your parents home ? "
Really , do n't you think anybody with access to this information -- much less the reelection campaign of a sitting congressman -- ought to be a little careful with it ?
I called the Shadegg campaign for comment , but had n't heard back by press time .
This is n't exactly unusual .
I 've been trying , on and off , to reach them for the last two weeks for this or that and have yet to get a call back for anything .
Kind of frustrating -- especially since Shadegg is , by all accounts , facing the toughest challenge of his political career from Democratic attorney Bob Lord .
The Dems are throwing a ton of money into this race -- unseating the reliably conservative Shadegg has become a major lefty cause .
In times like these , you 'd think we could get a call back -- or at least minimal screening over at campaign headquarters .
Think maybe they 've been a little distracted ?
They 've Got Nuthin '
The key to Keynes ’s contribution was his realization that liquidity preference — the desire of individuals to hold liquid monetary assets — can lead to situations in which effective demand is n’t enough to employ all the economy ’s resources .
When you do n’t understand that principle , you end up writing stuff like this :
Obama ’s “ rescue plan for the middle class ” includes a tax credit for businesses “ for each new employee they hire ” in America over the next two years .
The assumption is that businesses will create jobs that would not have been created without the subsidy .
If so , the subsidy will suffuse the economy with inefficiencies — labor costs not justified by value added .
That is , if the private sector would n’t have created a job on its own , that job should n’t have been created — whereas the real choice is between having workers doing something and being uselessly , destructively unemployed .
From the same article , we have this :
In a forthcoming paper , Ohanian argues that “ much of the depth of the Depression ” is explained by Hoover ’s policy — a precursor of the New Deal mentality — of pressuring businesses to keep nominal wages fixed .
I ’ve already pointed out how Keynes disposed of the money - wage argument , way back in 1936 .
Why do people still fail to get Keynes , after all these years ?
Keynes might have said that it ’s the inherent difficulty of the concepts :
For — though no one will believe it — economics is a technical and difficult subject .
But there ’s also the Upton Sinclair theorem :
Australia 's underage drinkers consume more than 175 million drinks a year and feed $ 107 million directly into government coffers , according to a new report highlighting " alarming " rates of illegal alcohol consumption .
Specialists from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre say their findings show " getting pissed " is still a firm priority for young Australians - but the money they spend on drinks is doing nothing to help curb the problem .
" We 've shown teenage drinking is a big money spinner for the government , " said Dr Christopher Doran , lead author of the study in the journal Addictive Behaviours .
JERUSALEM - Israel is believed to be using controversial white phosphorus shells to screen its assault on the heavily populated Gaza Strip yesterday .
The weapon , used by British and US forces in Iraq , can cause horrific burns but is not illegal if used as a smokescreen .
As the Israeli army stormed to the edges of Gaza City and the Palestinian death toll topped 500 , the tell - tale shells could be seen spreading tentacles of thick white smoke to cover the troops ' advance .
" These explosions are fantastic looking , and produce a great deal of smoke that blinds the enemy so that our forces can move in , " said one Israeli security expert .
Burning blobs of phosphorus would cause severe injuries to anyone caught beneath them and force would - be snipers or operators of remote - controlled booby traps to take cover .
Israel admitted using white phosphorus during its 2006 war with Lebanon .
The use of the weapon in the Gaza Strip , one of the world 's mostly densely population areas , is likely to ignite yet more controversy over Israel 's offensive , in which more than 2,300 Palestinians have been wounded .
The Geneva Treaty of 1980 stipulates that white phosphorus should not be used as a weapon of war in civilian areas , but there is no blanket ban under international law on its use as a smokescreen or for illumination .
However , Charles Heyman , a military expert and former major in the British Army , said : " If white phosphorus was deliberately fired at a crowd of people someone would end up in The Hague .
White phosphorus is also a terror weapon .
The descending blobs of phosphorus will burn when in contact with skin . "
The Israeli military last night denied using phosphorus , but refused to say what had been deployed .
" Israel uses munitions that are allowed for under international law , " said Captain Ishai David , spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces .
" We are pressing ahead with the second stage of operations , entering troops in the Gaza Strip to seize areas from which rockets are being launched into Israel . "
The civilian toll in the first 24 hours of the ground offensive - launched after a week of bombardment from air , land and sea- was at least 64 dead .
Among those killed were five members of a family who died when an Israeli tank shell hit their car and a paramedic who died when a tank blasted his ambulance .
Doctors at Gaza City 's main hospital said many women and children were among the dead and wounded .
The Israeli army also suffered its first fatality of the offensive when one of its soldiers was killed by mortar fire .
More than 30 soldiers were wounded by mortars , mines and sniper fire .
Israel has brushed aside calls for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged territory , where medical supplies are running short .
With increasingly angry anti-Israeli protests spreading around the world , Gordon Brown described the violence in Gaza as " a dangerous moment " .
White phosphorus : the smoke - screen chemical that can burn to the bone

- White phosphorus bursts into a deep - yellow flame when it is exposed to oxygen , producing a thick white smoke
- It is used as a smokescreen or for incendiary devices , but can also be deployed as an anti-personnel flame compound capable of causing potentially fatal burns
- Phosphorus burns are almost always second or third - degree because the particles do not stop burning on contact with skin until they have entirely disappeared - it is not unknown for them to reach the bone
- Geneva conventions ban the use of phosphorus as an offensive weapon against civilians , but its use as a smokescreen is not prohibited by international law
- Israel previously used white phosphorus during its war with Lebanon in 2006
- It has been used frequently by British and US forces in recent wars , notably during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Its use was criticised widely
- White phosphorus has the slang name " Willy Pete " , which dates from the First World War .
It was commonly used in the Vietnam era

The United States Constitution 's Article 2 , Sec. 2 , cl. 2 , provides that the president of the United States " shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , Judges of the Supreme Court , and all other Officers of the United States . "
President Donald Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett as U.S. Supreme Court justice who will replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg .
Barrett currently serves as United States Circuit judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
The 7th Circuit serves the Midwestern states of Illinois , Indiana and Wisconsin .
It is now the Senate 's job to decide whether to confirm Barrett 's appointment as an associate justice on the Supreme Court .
In thinking about the Senate 's criteria for making their decision , we might ask what is the role of a U.S. Supreme Court justice ?
A reasonable answer is to recognize that our Constitution represents our rules of the game .
It dictates what is and is not permissible behavior by government and its citizens .
Therefore , a Supreme Court justice has one job and one job only ; namely , that of a referee .
A referee 's job , whether he is a football referee , baseball umpire or a Supreme Court justice , is to know the rules of the game and to ensure that those rules are evenly applied without bias .
Do we want a referee or justice to allow empathy to influence their decisions ?
Let us answer this question using this year 's Super Bowl as an example .
The San Francisco 49ers have played in seven Super Bowls in their franchise history , winning five times .
On the other hand , coming into the 2020 game , the Kansas City Chiefs had not won a Super Bowl title in 50 years .
In anyone 's book , this is a gross disparity .
Should the referees have the empathy to understand what it is like to be a perennial loser , not winning a Super Bowl in five decades ?
What would you think of a referee whose play calls were guided by empathy or pity ?
Suppose a referee , in the name of compensatory justice , stringently applied pass interference or roughing the passer violations against the San Francisco 49ers and less stringently against the Chiefs .
Would you support a referee who refused to make offensive pass interference calls because he thought it was a silly rule ?
You would probably remind him that it is the league that makes the rules ( football law ) , not referees .
Supreme Court justices should be umpires or referees , enforcing neutral rules .
Here is a somewhat trivial example of a neutral rule from my youth ; let us call it Mom 's Rule .
On occasion , my sister and I would have lunch in my mother 's absence .
Either my younger sister or I would have the job of dividing the last piece of cake or pie .
Almost always an argument would ensue about the fairness of the cut .
Those arguments ended when Mom came up with a rule :
Whoever cuts the cake gives the other person the first choice of the piece to take .
As if by magic or divine intervention , fairness emerged and arguments ended .
No matter who did the cutting , there was an even division .
This is what our society needs — the kind of rules whereby you would be OK even if your worst enemy were in charge .
Despite the high stakes of bitterly fought football contests , most games end peaceably , and the winners and losers are civil .
It is indeed a miracle of sorts that players with conflicting interests can play a game , agree with the outcome and walk away as good sports .
That " miracle " is that it is far easier to reach an understanding about the game 's rules than the game 's outcome .
The same conflict - reducing principles should be a part of a civilized society .

A few weeks ago , I published an e-mail message sent to me from an executive who works in the banking industry — and had become disgusted by what he sees all around him .
This weekend , that same banker sent me another e-mail message , which he has also agree to let me publish .
It ’s another wake - up call .
Too bad nobody is listening .
Today , we are bailing out the banks because of their greedy and deceptive lending practices in the mortgage industry .
But this is just the tip of the iceberg .
More is coming , I ’m sorry to say .
Layoffs are being announced nationwide in the tens of thousands .
As people begin to lose their jobs , they will not be able to pay their credit card bills either .
And the banks will be back for more handouts .
I received a catalog today from Casual Living and in big bold print on the front page , it said “ BUY NOW , PAY NOTHING ” .
Then in significantly smaller print underneath , it said , ( until April ) .
That mantra has been sung throughout the credit markets over the last 10 years .
The banks waive a carrot in front of the consumer and reel them in and encourage them to go deeper and deeper into debt .
They do this by prescreening customers through credit reporting agencies , mailing offers to apply , and to transfer balances at teaser rates or zero percent financing .
They base it on credit score and not on capacity to repay .
A good credit score does not equate to the ability to repay debt .
Over my career , I have seen thousands of consumers that have credit card lines in excess of their annual salaries .
Some are sinking under their burden .
Some have been fiscally responsible and have minimal amounts outstanding .
My 21 - year - old daughter , who ’s in college , gets pre-approved offers all the time .
She has no ability to repay debt , yet the offers flow in just the same .
We all know how these lines are accumulated .
The banks , in their infinite stupidity , keep upping credit lines because the customer pays the minimum payments on time .
My daughter ’s credit line started at $ 1,000 and has been increased over the last two years to $ 4,400 .
She has no increased earnings to support this .
But the banks do it without asking .
And without being asked .
The banks reel in the consumer , charge interest rates higher than those charged by the mob , increase lines without the consumer asking and without their consent , and lure them into overextending .
And we can count on the banks to act surprised when they are n’t paid back .
Shame on them .
As a banker , let me describe what we do wrong when we accept and review an application for a credit card .
First , we do n’t verify income .
The first ‘ C ’ of credit : Capacity to repay , is completely ignored by the banks , just as it was in when they approved subprime mortgages .
Then we ask for “ household income ” — as if other parties in the household could be held responsible for that debt .
They cannot .
And since we do n’t ask for any proof of income , the customer can throw out any number they think will work for them .
Then we ask if they rent or own and how much they pay .
If their name is not on the mortgage , they can state zero .
If they pay $ 1,000 in rent , they can say $ 500 .
( Years ago we asked for a copy of the lease to verify this number . )
And finally , we do n’t ask how much of a credit line the consumer is looking for .
The banker ca n’t even put that amount into the system .
There is n’t any place on the application for that information .
We simply put unverified information into a mindless computer and the computer gets the person ’s credit score and grants them the biggest line that score and income ( ha ! ) qualifies for .
I recently had a client apply for a credit card .
She is a homemaker , with no personal income .
The house she lives in is in her husband ’s name .
She would have asked for a $ 3,000 credit line , just to pay miscellaneous expenses and to establish some credit on her own .
So the computer is told that her household income is $ 150,000 ; her mortgage / rent payment is zero .
The fact is that her husband ’s mortgage payment is $ 7,000 a month ( which he got with a no income verification loan ) .
She had a good credit score , but limited credit since she has only lived in this country for the last three years .
The system gave her an approval for a $ 26,000 line of credit !
This has got to stop .
People are going to be learning hard lessons over the next years .
It would help , though , if the banks could change their behavior now , before things get any worse .
Tomorrow is already too late .
In 2003 , Congress passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 .
This law was implemented through regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission in consultation with the federal banking and credit union agencies .
It requires all credit card and insurance solicitations to include a disclosure for “ prescreened offers . ”
We are all familiar with them .
They are the dozens of credit card offers that are sent , unsolicited , to consumers , usually by mail .
The law allows the consumer to opt out of receiving prescreened offers by calling an 800 - number .
I think Congress did this backwards .
Perhaps it could amend the law .
The regulation should have required the consumer to opt in , if they so desire , instead of opting out .
That would mean that no one would get an unsolicited credit card offer .
If a consumer needs a credit card he or she could be given an option to call an 800 - number to opt in .
Or the consumer could go to their local bank and apply for a credit card in person .
Or the consumer could go online and apply for a credit card .
The consumer can also view all the best credit cards , nationally , at bankrate.com .
Bankrate.com is an invaluable tool for consumers .
Some other benefits : ( 1 ) It would halt the message being sent that credit is free and perhaps limit irresponsible accumulation of credit lines .
( 2 ) It would force the banks to become more competitive in their rates .
The consumer is going to need a break and they will need it soon .
And credit card rates , which are quite often above 22 percent , is piracy .
( 3 ) Eliminating mass mailings would save a lot of trees .
I ’ve been reviewing many of the banks annual reports over the last month and there is no question that the default rates are on the rise .
If Congress does n’t act today , the bankers will have their hats in their hand before we know it , and doing another a tap dance before the Senate Banking Committee , and asking to be bailed out once again with our tax dollars .
Sad , but true .
After pouring three years of her life into making the film , and having great success with audiences at festival screenings , she now ca n’t distribute it , because of music licensing issues : the film uses songs recorded in the late 1920 ’s by singer Annette Hanshaw , and although the recordings are out of copyright , the compositions themselves are still restricted .
That means if you want to make a film using these songs from the 1920s , you have to pay money — a lot of money ( around $ 50,000.00 ) .
It ’s a classic example of how today ’s copyright system suppresses art , effectively forcing artists to make creative choices based on licensing concerns rather than on their artistic vision .
The music in Sita Sings The Blues is integral to the film : entire animation sequences were done around particular songs .
As Nina says in the interview , incorporating those particular recordings was part of her inspiration .
To tell her — as many people did — to simply use different music would have been like telling her not to do the film at all .
And that ’s part of her point : artists “ internalize the permission culture ” , which in turn affects the kinds of art they make .

Famed film critic Roger Ebert has raved about it .
But the film remains undistributable as of this writing ;
Nina is trying to work out an arrangement with the holders of the monopolies on the music that inspired her .

Does this map show an ancient ocean floor on Mars ?
A map of Mars showing the location of possible ancient ocean .
Credit : U. Arizona
New evidence says " maybe " .
But it ’s a pretty good maybe !
It ’s been argued for years that Mars may have once had oceans of water , billions of years ago .
Some catastrophe dried them up , making the evidence for them difficult to detect .
Topographic ( relief ) maps look like there may have been two oceans in one spot , for example , separated by some time .
There appear to be two separate shorelines , with one smaller , later ocean existing where there once had been a much larger ocean .
But that ’s circumstantial .
More direct evidence is needed .
So some scientists speculated a bit .
Rocks containing elements like potassium , thorium and iron would get made in the highlands ( near volcanoes ) , then get transported down into the lowlands .
If there were an ocean there , those elements would get leeched out of the rocks by the water .
Then , when the water evaporated , those elements would be deposited in a thin layer on the surface .
On board the orbiting probe Mars Odyssey is the Mars Gamma - Ray Spectrometer , a device which can measure the abundance of elements on the Martian surface .
When it was trained on the lowlands of Mars , it found evidence to support the existence of those oceans !
The elements in question were most abundant below the shorelines , as expected , when compared to regions outside ( above ) the shorelines .
The regions with higher concentrations of potassium are marked in red and yellow in the map above , right where the lowlands are .
While this does n’t prove an ocean as big as the United States once occupied a large chunk of Martian real estate , it ’s further evidence of it .
Scientists are still arguing over whether Mars had long - lasting , ponded water , or if it was released in short , transient events , only to evaporate quickly away .
But either way , we ’re not arguing over whether Mars had water , just how long it lasted .
Either way , Mars is an incredible planet .
It may have once been much more Earth - like , but then something went wrong .
Maybe it was the formation of the giant volcanoes ( indicated by the red arrows in the above image ) , or the loss of its magnetic field that exposed its atmosphere to erosion by the solar wind .
As we study Mars more , we get closer to figuring this out .
And make no mistake : knowing where Mars went wrong gives us great insight into our own planet .
If you think we ’re wasting money on researching Mars , then I suggest you take a cold , hard look at that cold , hard planet , then look out your window at our own home world .
There but for the grace of science may go us .
More of the USCF legal saga : I am not endorsing this lawsuit and I am not commenting on the merit of it .
USCF members can make their own conclusion .
However , members need to know what is going on before they can make informed decisions .

( “ USCF ” ) and alleges asfollows : 1 . This is a proceeding for Declaratory Relief seeking to restore SamSloan to the ballot as a candidate for Election to the Executive Boardof the United States Chess Federation .
It also seeks the removal ofWilliam Goichberg from the Executive Board and a permanent bar againstGoichberg from holding any position as an officer of the United StatesChess Federation or from running slates of candidates for election .
The Plaintiff Sam Sloan is a long standing member of the United StatesChess Federation , having been a member since 1956 .
Plaintiff submittedhimself for candidacy for the current 2011 election but has beenremoved from the ballot this year due to Plaintiffs assertion ofvoting regulation manipulation by the Defendants .
2 .
This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants as Defendantshave performed duties as directors or officers of a corporationorganized under the laws of Illinois .
735 ILCS 5/2-209 (a ) ( 12 ) .
None ofthe Defendants reside in Illinois , and therefore venue is proper inthis county pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-101 .
Defendants have previouslyfiled suit in this county and Court , and therefore providesindisputable assertion that venue in this Court is proper .
The Defendants previously filed the case United States of America ChessFederation vs. Susan Polgar and Paul Truong in this same court .
Thiscase should be marked as related to that other case .
3 . Defendant USCF is an Illinois not - for - profit corporation in goodstanding , with its principal place of business in Crossville , Tennessee .
The USCF is the official , not - for - profit United Statesmembership organization for chess players and chess supporters of allages and strengths , from beginners to Grandmasters .
The average ormedian age of USCF members is ten years old .
The USCF is governed by aBoard of Delegates , composed of a seven - member Executive Board , Delegates at Large , and over 125 Delegates apportioned among U.S.States .
4 .
The seven - member Executive Board ( " EB " ) are tasked with managing the affairs of the USCF between the annual meetings of the Board ofDelegates who are the true Board of Directors for the USCF .
5 . Defendant James ' Jim ' Berry is the President of the USCF .
DefendantRuth Haring is the Vice President of the USCF .6 . Defendant Randy Bauer is the Vice President of Finance of the USCFwhose term expires at the beginning of the next Board of Delegatesmeeting in July 2011 to be held in Orlando , FL.7 .
Gary Walters and Michael Nietman are seeking re-election to the EBthrough the 2011 elections .
8. Michael Atkins is a long term employee of William Goichberg and the Continental Chess Association , Inc .
He has performed significantcompensated duties to William Goichberg prior to Atkins ' tenure as amember of the EB.9 .
Allen Priest is a member or chairman of many USCF committeesincluding the “ Forum Oversight Committee ” which has acted as a Boardof Censors so as to bar any negative comments about Goichberg or anypositive comments about Sam Sloan from being posted to the USCF IssuesForum .
Allen Priest is currently seeking a position on the EB throughthe 2011 elections .
10 .
Bill Hall is the Executive Director of the USCF who is oncontractual terms of employment with the USCF .11 .
Bill Hall 's contract is set to expire this year and is a topic ofrenegotiation for the EB that will be comprised as a result of the2011 election .
12 . Defendant William Goichberg has been an officer of the USCF aseither President , Vice - President , Executive Director orMember - at - Large since 1996 with minor gaps caused by being ' termedout ' from time - to - time in accordance to the Bylaws of the USCF .
UnderRule by Goichberg , the USCF has lost more than two million dollars andis now on the brink of bankruptcy .
13 .
Defendant William Goichberg is also the sole owner of the Continental Chess Association ( ' CCA ' ) , a for - profit corporation , whichis the dominate force in organized , large money stake chesstournaments ( $ 100,000 - $ 250,000 in prizes ) across the United States , held under the auspices of the USCF .
As such he is also the largestcustomer of the USCF through advertisement fees , fees for rating histournaments , and new membership / renewal membership acquisition .
14 .
In years past there were spirited election campaigns for USCFExecutive Board with many candidates running .
For example , in 1999 there were 17 candidates running .
In 2009 there were ten candidatesrunning .
However , in the last few years William Goichberg has becomeextremely aggressive about attacking or blocking anybody opposed tohis policies which benefit his for - profit organization at the expenseof all other organizers and the federation , so as to prevent them fromeven running .
As a result , those not in accordance with WilliamGoichberg policies have almost all given up , considering runningagainst the Goichberg machine to be a waste of time and money .
15 . Defendant Goichberg , in an attempt to provide a false front forhis motives , commissioned the Governance Task Force ( ' GTF ' ) , which wascomprised of individuals that he exerts influence over .
16 .
The GTF was headed by a personal friend of Defendant Goichbergnamed Joseph Lux .
The deputy of the GTF was Defendant Allen Priest , aGoichberg sycophant .
17 .
The USCF and the Executive Board ignored the suggestion ofdelegates to have the GTF members be comprised of a group of crosspolitical parties to ensure fairness .
Instead Goichberg sycophantswere the only active members .
18 .
The GTF proposed by - law changes that were presented to a meetingof the delegates held in Irvine California on August 8 , 2010 after theelection period had already stated and candidates were circulatingpetitions .
The delegates were not informed of the nature and extent ofthe changes and were led to believe that this was a routine measure .
The proposal was not announced in advance and was not in the advanceagenda .
No count was made so it could not be determined if the 2 /3rdsvote as required in the bylaws was met.19 .
The charter of the GTF was to make recommendations for improvementof the governance structure of the USCF .20 .
A crucial change that was the outcome of the GTF and voted upon atthe annual meeting of delegates was changes in election processes .
First it required a new structure of signatures , where 15 signaturesof delegates were required from 5 different states .
Second it requiredUSCF members to register in order to vote .
21 .
This crucial change was hastily implemented during an electionyear , instead of providing time for the new guidelines to becomedistributed appropriately to the USCF membership community and thedelegates that were not able to attend the meeting .
The next electionis in 2013 , only two years away .
22 .
Meeting minutes from the annual board of delegates meeting werenot made available until December 4 , 2010 , four months after meeting .
No voice or video recordings have been made available , though theywere made during the meeting .
23 .
These by - law changes still as of the date of this complaint havenot been posted .
No copy is available anywhere .
The posted by - laws arestill not reflective of the important changes that have taken place .
They are nearly one year old and are dated May 2010 .
24 .
Election petition due dates were changed from previous years .
Inpast years , the last day to circulate petitions was January 10 .
Thisyear it was moved up to December 31 , 2010 without adequateannouncement to the membership and the candidates .
Delegates not inattendance at the annual meeting in Irvine California on August 8,2010 were not informed of this .
Since no communications directed atthe delegates are performed by the federation , those not in attendancein Irvine are not aware of these changes .
25 .
In the closing days of the petitioning period , when two candidateswho were members of the Goichberg Slate did not have enoughsignatures , Defendant Bill Hall changed the ' received by ' requirementset forth in the by - laws to ' post - marked ' by .
This was to benefitmembers of the “ Goichberg Slate ” , Allen Priest and Gary Walters , whowere having difficulty collecting signatures due to being unknown inthe chess community .
Defendant
Hall also should have known the officewas to be closed on December 31 and did not communicate that theoffice was closed unless someone proactively asked about it .
Thischange in Bylaws is not within the power granted to Defendant Hall asthe Executive Director .
26 .
The Bylaws state that the petitions were to be sent to the Election Committee , not the USCF office .
No information on how to sendthe petitions to the Election Committee was provided to any potentialcandidates .
Instead all petitions were forced to be sent to the USCFoffice , the same office whose Executive Director has a vested interestin the outcome of the election .
27 .
An appropriate and complete list of delegates were not availableonline and to this date the full list is not known .
The lack ofknowing who are the delegates ( thus the true directors of thecorporation ) means that the federation is filing false documents withthe State of Illinois and are only listing the EB members as the boardof directors ( which is incorrect as a bylaw amendment exists statingthat the delegates are the Board of Directors , not the EB ) .
28 .
Due to the inaccurate and incomplete information on who exactlyare the members of the board of delegates , previous delegates signedelection petitions for Plaintiff Sloan , only to be rejected by theUSCF office .
29 .
The election committee did not receive physical copies ( scanned / faxed / photocopied ) of election petitions or the proof ofreceipt of petitions by the due date .
They received a MS Word documentwith purported names and ID's of people that signed the petitions .
This determination was used to qualify or disqualify signatures .
TheUSCF staff under the auspices of the Executive Director Bill Hallvalidated each signature themselves .
This is a conflict of interest asthere is no independence in the verification process .
30 .
Plaintiff was elected to the USCF Executive Board in 2006 but wasdefeated when he ran for re-election in 2007 in part due to the “ FakeSam Sloan ” controversy in which another candidate for election who wasat the time allied with William Goichberg impersonated him more than2500 times making obscene and scatological newsgroup postings .
Plaintiff is an announced candidate for the current 2011 election buthas been kicked off the ballot this year due primarily to themanipulations of William Goichberg , the long time control person ofthe USCF .31 .
This action seeks to restore Sam Sloan to the ballot for thecurrent USCF election .
Secondly , because Bill Goichberg persistentlyviolates the most fundamental rule involving not - for - profitcorporations in that he runs the USCF for his own personal profit andbenefit by running big money cash prize chess tournaments , Plaintiffseeks the permanent removal of Bill Goichberg from holding any officeor position in the USCF and further seeks a court order enjoining Goichberg from running slates of candidates for office in the USCF , from posting articles on his websites attacking opponents of hisslates , from circulating petitions to get his candidates on the ballotelected and from in any way interfering in the USCF Election process .
32 .
Defendants Gary Walters , Michael Neitman and Allen Priestconstitute the " Goichberg Slate " in the current USCF Election .
MichaelAtkins and Michael Neitman are current members of the USCF ExecutiveBoard .
Gary Walters and Michael Neitman are running for re-election .
Michael Atkins is a long time employee of Bill Goichberg and hasworked as assistant director at many Goichberg tournaments .
33 .
Defendant William Goichberg is the control person of the USCF .
Goichberg dominates and controls the USCF Executive Board .
For almostevery year since 1996 , with just a few gaps , Goichberg has been acontrol person , holding the positions of President , Vice - President , Executive Director or Member - at - Large for all but a few of thoseyears .
Goichberg was USCF President from 2005 to 2010 when he was termlimited out and became member - at - large , but he still controls theboard because , for the last three elections since 2007 , no candidatehas been elected to the Executive Board without receiving theendorsement of Goichberg .
The “ Goichberg Slate ” swept the 2008 , 2009 and 2010 elections .
Under Rule by Goichberg the USCF has lost morethan two million dollars and is now on the brink of bankruptcy .
34 .
Defendant William Goichberg is also the sole owner of the Continental Chess Association , a for - profit corporation .
TheContinental Chess Association dominates the market for prize moneychess tournaments .
During most of the weekends of every calendar year , the Continental Chess Association holds cash prize money tournamentsaround the United States in almost every state except for New Jersey , where Goichberg is unofficially persona non grata .
Goichberg holdsmajor big money tournaments in the major holiday weekends , such as his “ World Open ” held in Philadelphia on July 4th weekend with GuaranteedCash Prizes of $ 225,000 , the Chicago Open with $ 100,000 GuaranteedCash Prizes , the North American Open in Las Vegas and PhiladelphiaOpen with similar prizes , and until 2009 the Foxwoods Open followingwhich the Foxwoods Casino kicked him out .
In addition to these majortournaments , Goichberg holds minor tournaments on most weekends withcash prizes ranging from about $ 4,000 to about $ 10,000 each .35 .
All of these cash prize money tournaments are held under theauspices of the USCF .
They are all USCF Rated .
They are all advertisedin Chess Life magazine .
Goichberg so dominates the market for prizemoney tournaments that it has proven nearly impossible for othertournament organizers to compete with him .
Several organizers who havetried to compete against Goichberg have suffered severe financiallosses and some have even gone bankrupt .
36 .
In years past there were spirited election campaigns for USCFExecutive Board with many candidates running .
For example , in 1999 there were 17 candidates running .
In 2009 there were ten candidatesrunning .
For many years Goichberg was a pariah in the USCF due to hisrunning exclusively big money tournaments , often in gambling casinos , especially since the median age for USCF members is 10 years old .
Goichberg , knowing he could not get elected , did not run .
However , inthe last few years Goichberg has become extremely aggressive aboutattacking or blocking anybody opposed to his policies so as to preventthem from even running .
As a result , those not in accordance withGoichberg policies have almost all given up , considering runningagainst the Goichberg machine to be a waste of time and money .
37 .
Among the things that Goichberg does to stop anybody not blessedby him from running or being elected is he sends out huge massmailings primarily advertising his prize money tournaments but alsotelling the voters whom to vote for .
Goichberg typically mails 17,000 ( seventeen thousand ) postcards in a batch .
Goichberg also posts on histournament websites including http://www.chesstour.com/
articlesattacking and ridiculing any candidate not favored or endorsed byGoichberg , for example at http://www.checkmate.us/ .
Goichberg alsohires assistant directors for his tournaments who also campaign forhis candidates while running his tournaments and while making pairingsand ruling on disputes .
38 .
Not satisfied with the fact that he already has a virtual monopolyon big time cash prize money chess tournaments and he has such a lockon the elections that almost all would - be candidates have given uptrying to run against him , Goichberg now is trying to avoid evenhaving to go to the trouble to run candidates for election by changing the election rules so as to make it virtually impossible for anybodynot nominated by Goichberg even to get on the ballot .39 .
In order to do this a “ Governance Task Force ” was createddominated by Goichberg himself plus Goichberg sycophants Joe Lux and Allen Priest .
Joe Lux was made the Chairman .
This “ Governance TaskForce ” was originally set up to try to address the problems created bythe fact that Goichberg had the USCF in his iron grip .
A fatal errorwas made by allowing Goichberg to serve on a committee which wassupposed to deal with the problems caused by Goichberg .
Goichbergproceeded to take control of the committee .40 .
The result was a proposal by Goichberg to disenfranchise the 30,000 voting members of the USCF and to give control of the electionprocess to the 125 delegates .
Since a high percentage of the delegatesare employees of Goichberg working as assistant directors in the prizemoney tournaments held by Goichberg around the USA and all thedelegates from New York State are personally appointed by Goichberg , this meant that Goichberg would virtually control who got on theballot .
The original Goichberg proposal was that in order to get onthe ballot a prospective candidate would need to obtain the signaturesof 40 of the 125 delegates from 15 different states .
Since Goichbergholds tournaments in more than 15 different states and more than 40delegates either work for Goichberg or are beholding to Goichberg andsince nobody else does this , this meant that Goichberg would decidewho got on the ballot .
41 .
At the USCF Delegates meeting in Irvine , California in August2010 , in response to objections to the Draconian Rules proposed byGoichberg , Goichberg agreed to reduce the number to 25 delegates from15 different states .
Goichberg stated at a by - laws committee meetingchaired by Goichberg sycophant Allen Priest that 25 delegates shouldbe required to sign because in the past some of the candidates hadbeen “ rather poor ” .
42 .
There were still grumblings about this so as the USCF Delegatesmeeting held on August 7 , 2010 in Irvine , California a motion was madeto require that candidates for election obtain the signatures of atleast 50 voting members of whom at least 15 must be delegatesrepresenting at least 5 different states .
The maker of this motion was Allen Priest who himself was a candidate for election .
This motionpassed with virtually no debate or discussion .
Several delegates whowere present and who voted in favor of the motion have since statedthat they did not know what the motion was as it was not explained norwas in announced in advance and they would never have voted for thismotion had they known what it was .
43 .
The by - laws require that there be a 2 / 3rds vote for any by - lawchange , especially those not included on the advance agenda .
Thisby - law change was not in the advance agenda .
No count was taken orshow of hands to see if the 2/3rds requirement had been met .44 .
Since the election campaign was already underway and severalprospective candidates including Gary Walters were circulating themeeting room asking delegates to sign their petitions , this by - lawchange should not have taken effect until the next election cycle , which will be in 2012 .
However , the Goichberg controlled USCF officehas allowed this by - law change to become effective retroactively sothat it controls the current election campaign which had already beenstarted before this by law change had been voted upon .
45 .
Prior to this change , in order to get on the ballot , a candidateneeded the signatures of 30 adult voting members of which there areabout 30,000 .
After this change , one needed 50 signatures of adultvoting members of which at least 15 must be delegates representing atleast 5 different states .
With only 125 delegates assuming all thepositions are filled ( which is not the case ) this made it vastly moredifficult .
46 .
In spite of the extreme difficulty of meeting these vastly moredifficult requirements , Candidate Sam Sloan circulated petitions andobtained the signatures of 90 members of which 70 ruled valid .
These70 signatures including 16 delegates representing 11 different states .
Thus Sloan easily met the requirements .
47 .
Nevertheless , Goichberg Stooge Bill Hall ruled that 4 of thosesignatures were invalid and thereupon has kicked Sloan off the ballot .
Most of those allegedly invalid signatures are from the State of NewJersey where Goichberg is persona non grata .
The three New Jerseydelegates whose signatures were ruled invalid were former USCFPresident Leroy Dubeck , Steve Ferrero and Aaron Kiedes .
They alsoinvalidated the signature of Gary Alan Fine of Illinois and EricJohnson of Pennsylvania .48 .
At the same time a member of the Goichberg Slate , Allen Priest , did not have enough signatures even though Goichberg was going aroundthe North American Open where he was the director on December 30 , 2010 ( the day before the deadline ) twisting the arms of delegates to getthem to sign for Priest .
Bill Hall extended the deadline for thebenefit of Allen Priest and Gary Walters ( neither of whom aretournament chess players and are only candidates as a result of beingGoichberg stooges ) by extending the deadline so that the petitions didnot have to be received but only mailed by December 31.49 .
Candidate Sam Sloan has never to this day been notified that hehas been kicked off the ballot .
Page 10 of the February Chess Lifestates that nominating petitions have been received from fivecandidates , Sevan Muradian , Mike Nietman , Allen Priest , Sam Sloan and Gary Walters .
However , the April Chess Life , page 11 only lists thenames and candidates of four candidates , omitting Sam Sloan.50 .
Having eliminated one candidate by having his signatures ruledinvalid , Goichberg is now attacking the remaining non-Goichbergcandidate by stating that he is not “ loyal ” to the USCF because hescheduled a chess tournament to be held on the same weekend as aGoichberg tournament , the Midwest Class tournament .
Seehttp://www.checkmate.us/muradian.htmWHEREFORE, for these any other reasons more fully set forth in theaccompanying affidavits and exhibits , Plaintiff demands the followingrelief : 1 . An Order Restoring Sam Sloan to the ballot for the coming USCF election .
2 .
An order removing William Goichberg from the board and permanentlybarring William Goichberg from holding any office in the USCF or fromrunning slates of candidates or influencing the results of electionsthrough post card mailings , websites and other means as long as hecontinues to hold large cash prize big money chess tournaments forprofit associated with the USCF .
Respectfully Submitted , Sam Sloan

For his third Christmas , Tina bought Brandon a first - rate Army set — complete with a Kevlar hat , walkie - talkies , and a hand grenade .
Both Tina and Brandon ’s father had served in the Army , and she thought their son might identify with the toys .
A photo from that day shows him wearing a towel around his head , a bandanna around his waist , and a glum expression .
The Army set sits unopened at his feet .
Tina recalls his joy , by contrast , on a day later that year .
One afternoon , while Tina was on the phone , Brandon climbed out of the bathtub .
When she found him , he was dancing in front of the mirror with his penis tucked between his legs .
“ Look , Mom , I ’m a girl , ” he told her .
“ Happy as can be , ” she recalls .
“ Brandon , God made you a boy for a special reason , ” she told him before they said prayers one night when he was 5 , the first part of a speech she ’d prepared .
But he cut her off : “ God made a mistake , ” he said .
Tina had no easy explanation for where Brandon ’s behavior came from .
Gender roles are not very fluid in their no -stoplight town , where Confederate flags line the main street .
Boys ride dirt bikes through the woods starting at age 5 ; local county fairs feature muscle cars for boys and beauty pageants for girls of all ages .
In the Army , Tina operated heavy machinery , but she is no tomboy .
When she was younger , she wore long flowing dresses to match her long , wavy blond hair ; now she wears it in a cute , Renée Zellweger–style bob .
Her husband , Bill ( Brandon ’s stepfather ) , lays wood floors and builds houses for a living .
At a recent meeting with Brandon ’s school principal about how to handle the boy , Bill aptly summed up the town philosophy : “ The way I was brought up , a boy ’s a boy and a girl ’s a girl . ”
School had always complicated Brandon ’s life .
When teachers divided the class into boys ’ and girls ’ teams , Brandon would stand with the girls .
In all of his kindergarten and first - grade self - portraits — “ I have a pet , ” “ I love my cat , ” “ I love to play outside ” — the “ I ” was a girl , often with big red lips , high heels , and a princess dress .
Just as often , he drew himself as a mermaid with a sparkly purple tail , or a tail cut out from black velvet .
Late in second grade , his older stepbrother , Travis , told his fourth - grade friends about Brandon ’s “ secret ” — that he dressed up at home and wanted to be a girl .
After school , the boys cornered and bullied him .
Brandon went home crying and begged Tina to let him skip the last week .
Since he was 4 , Tina had been taking Brandon to a succession of therapists .
The first told her he was just going through a phase ; but the phase never passed .
Another suggested that Brandon ’s chaotic early childhood might have contributed to his behavior .
Tina had never married Brandon ’s father , whom she ’d met when they were both stationed in Germany .
Twice , she had briefly stayed with him , when Brandon was 5 months old and then when he was 3 .
Both times , she ’d suspected his father of being too rough with the boy and had broken off the relationship .
The therapist suggested that perhaps Brandon overidentified with his mother as the protector in the family , and for a while , this theory seemed plausible to Tina .
In play therapy , the therapist tried to get Brandon to discuss his feelings about his father .
She advised Tina to try a reward system at home .
Brandon could earn up to $ 21 a week for doing three things : looking in the mirror and saying “ I ’m a boy ” ; not dressing up ; and not wearing anything on his head .
It worked for a couple of weeks , but then Brandon lost interest .
Until governor Sarah Palin gives a full press conference , it seems to me that the cable news outlets should stop running her stump speeches in full on television .
The deal is : candidates get to broadcast their message if the press get to question them thoroughly .
That 's how real democracy works - give and take .
What the Palin - McCain campaign wants is all give and no take : an indirect propaganda filter and the outrageous precedent of no press conferences in presidential campaigns .
This is an assault on democracy .
It is closer to Russian or Georgian democracy than American .
If cable news continues to enable this chilling process , they will become complicit .
Enough .

( CNN ) -- The Twitter accounts of President - elect Barack Obama , CNN anchor Rick Sanchez , Britney Spears , Fox News and 29 others were hacked Monday according to the microblog site , leading to false and inappropriate messages being posted on their accounts .
The microblog site Twitter was hit with phishing scams and hacker attacks during the last three days .
First Fox News
Twitter followers read a false message about Bill O'Reilly 's sexuality Monday morning after hackers launched several attacks .
Then came the attack on pop princess Britney Spears ' private parts .
CNN anchor Rick Sanchez , who uses Twitter on his TV show to interact with the audience , also fell victim to the scam , when a hacker posted about drugs on his account .
Twitter is a social - networking blog site that allows users to send status updates , or " tweets , " from cell phones , instant messaging services and Facebook in less than 140 characters .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote on the site 's blog that the accounts were compromised after a hacker accessed tools the support team uses when a Twitter user can't remember or wants to reset their login info .
" We considered this a very serious breach of security and immediately took the support tools offline , " Stone said in the blog post .
" We 'll put them back only when they 're safe and secure . "
Jennifer Dargan , director of public relations for CNN , confirmed Sanchez 's account was compromised .
" As a result , some Twitter users may have received offensive messages attributed to Rick when the breach occurred , " she said .
" This is annoying , though such breaches are not uncommon when using social networking sites . "
" Rick has notified Twitter of his account 's breach and taken some basic steps to secure his account 's access .
Rick enjoys communicating with viewers via Twitter and he and many others at CNN find social networking a valuable tool in their shows .
Rick will continue to use Twitter -- along with MySpace and Facebook -- to engage CNN 's audience . "
The attacks came after Twitter suffered a vicious phishing scam over the weekend , during which everyday Twitter users may have been tricked into logging on to a page masquerading as the Twitter front page , according to the site .
Instead , users were actually giving out their login information .
The fake link was then passed along to anyone following that user .
Twitter posted a small notice on the page of each user warning them about the attacks .
But some users , concerned about the attacks , began messaging Twitter employees .
" So you 're OK with a status quo where any Twitter [ application ] is potentially a phishing scam ? "
Twitter user " Aral " posted on the account of Alex Payne , a developer at Twitter .
According to his Web site Payne is in charge of working with programmers who develop their own applications that work with Twitter .
" I 'm certainly not happy with the security status quo .
I just want people to understand the different threats .
We 'll get there , " Payne responded .
The attacks are the first known security issues with Twitter , which has grown as a popular social networking site during the last year .
The attack on Twitter indicates hackers may see social networking sites as a good place to try and steal passwords and account information from the most people .
While many of the accounts were fixed quickly by resetting passwords , the attacks are a reminder for Twitter that with increasing popularity comes more security risks .

And those risks have kept employees at Twitter working quickly to try and fend off attacks and fix compromised tools .
The company 's CEO Evan Williams echoed that sentiment with a post on his Twitter account this morning .

An eminent French cardiologist has triggered an impassioned debate in the medical world over his claim to have discovered a cure for alcoholism .
Dr Olivier Ameisen discovered baclofen had cut addiction in rats Dr Olivier Ameisen , 55 , one of France 's top heart specialists , says he overcame his own addiction to alcohol by self - administering doses of a muscle - relaxant called baclofen .
He has now written a book about his experience - Le Dernier Verre ( The Last Glass ) - in which he calls for clinical trials to test his theory that baclofen suppresses the craving for drink .
Widespread media coverage of his book in France has led to a rush of demands from alcoholics for similar treatment , and some doctors have reported unexpected successes after prescribing it .
But many other specialists are sceptical , warning of the dangers of so - called miracle cures .
' Needed alcohol '
Dr Ameisen was associate professor of cardiology at New York 's Cornell University , and in 1994 he opened a profitable private practice in Manhattan .
But , stricken by an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy - he says he felt like " an impostor waiting to be unmasked " - he found relief in large quantities of whisky and gin .
Encouraging people to think that there is a miracle molecule is to completely misunderstand the nature of alcoholism
Dr Michel Reynaud " I detested the taste of alcohol .
But I needed its effects to exist in society , " he says in Le Dernier Verre , which comes out in English next month .
Dr Ameisen says he tried every known remedy to end his dependence .
Between 1997 and 1999 he spent a total of nine months confined in clinics - but nothing worked .
Fearing for his own patients , he gave up his practice and returned to Paris .
Then , in 2000 , he read an article about an American man who was treated with baclofen for muscle spasms and found that it eased his addiction to cocaine .
Further investigation uncovered research showing that the drug worked on rats to cut addiction to alcohol or cocaine .
Some experts say curing alcoholism takes more than just a drug But , strangely , Dr Ameisen found that baclofen was unknown to specialists on dependence .
In March 2002 he began treating himself with daily doses of five milligrams .
" The first effects were a magical muscular relaxation and baby - like sleep , " he says .
Almost immediately he also detected a lessening in his desire for drink .
Gradually , he increased the daily dosage to a maximum of 270mg , and found that he was " cured " .
Today he continues to take 30 to 50mg a day .
" Mine is the first case in which a course of medicine has completely suppressed alcohol addiction , " he says .
" Now I can have a glass and it has no effect .
Above all , I no longer have that irrepressible need to drink . "
Not licensed
With its eye - catching message , Le Dernier Verre has been an autumn best - seller - prompting thousands of recovering alcoholics to ask to be prescribed with baclofen .
I have never had reactions like this before .
We cannot ignore findings such as this
Dr Pascal Garche
Some doctors have decided to ignore the fact that the drug is not authorised for treating alcoholism , and report exciting results .
" I prescribed it to two alcoholics who were really at the end of the road .
To be honest , it was pretty miraculous , " says Dr Renaud de Beaurepaire of the Paul - Guiraud hospital at Villejuif near Paris .
In Geneva , Dr Pascal Garche put 12 patients on baclofen , of whom seven came through reporting marked improvements .
" I have never had reactions like this before .
We cannot ignore findings such as this - the book is going to set the cat among the pigeons , " he said .
However , many specialists fear that media excitement over Dr Ameisen 's theory is obscuring the complex nature of alcoholism .
" Encouraging people to think that there is a miracle molecule is to completely misunderstand the nature of alcoholism , and is extremely irresponsible , " says Dr Michel Reynaud of Paul - Brousse hospital in Paris .
" We need comprehensive tests to determine how this drug acts , if it is effective and at what dosage , and if it is genuinely harmless in the longer term , " says Alain Rigaud , president of the National Association for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Addiction .
" But even if it turns out to work , that does not mean a drug alone is the solution . "

Antarctica Turning to Solar , Wind Power
January 22nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Antarctica seems more like a dead zone than a haven for renewable energy , but solar and wind power are slowly taking hold on Antarctic research bases .
The Rothera base already has a $ 58,000 set of solar thermal panels that generate 15 kW of energy , and soon it will receive $ 11,000 German Ritter Solar GmbH panels .
According to Rothera scientist William Ray , more solar energy can be collected on the Antarctic Peninsula than in London .
Wind energy is also becoming popular on Antarctic research bases — probably because Antarctica is the windiest place on earth .
A New Zealand company called Meridian is set to ship wind turbines to New Zealand ’s Scott Base and the American Antarctic station for what will be be the most southerly wind farm in the world .
The turbines , which will replace fuel - powered generators , could save up to 500,000 liters of fuel each year .
Australia ’s Mawson base has been using two 300 MW wind turbines since 2003 .
Anyone installing solar panels and wind turbines in Antarctica has to be ready for the most extreme weather conditions imaginable .
But if we can cut fuel costs to Antarctic bases , more money can go towards important climate research .

‘ Flying While Muslim , ’ the New ‘ Driving While Black ’
Created : January 02 , 2009 09:59 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Washington Post reports that a large group of Muslim travelers were removed from a flight Thursday at a Washington - area airport after one of them made a comment about airline safety .
Officials ordered nine Muslim passengers , including three young children , off an AirTran flight headed to Orlando from Reagan National Airport yesterday afternoon after two other passengers overheard what they thought was a suspicious remark .
Members of the party , all but one of them U.S. - born citizens who were headed to a religious retreat in Florida , were subsequently cleared for travel by FBI agents who characterized the incident as a misunderstanding , an airport official said .
But the passengers said AirTran refused to rebook them , and they had to pay for seats on another carrier secured with help from the FBI .
Kashif Irfan , one of the removed passengers , said the incident began about 1 p.m. after his brother , Atif , and his brother ’s wife wondered aloud about the safest place to sit on an airplane .
“ My brother and his wife were discussing some aspect of airport security , ” Irfan said .
“ The only thing my brother said was , ‘ Wow , the jets are right next to my window . ’
I think they were remarking about safety . ”
According to the article , five of the six adults in the party were of South Asian descent , and the men all wore beards while the women wore traditional headscarves .
Kashif Irfan is an anesthesiologist and his brother , Atif , is a lawyer .
Both were born in Detroit and currently live in Alexandria , Va .
They said they suspected they were profiled because of their appearance , which AirTran disputed .
“ At the end of the day , people got on and made comments they should n’t have made on the airplane , and other people heard them , ” [ AirTran spokesman Tad ] Hutcheson said .
“ Other people heard them , misconstrued them .
It just so happened these people were of Muslim faith and appearance .
It escalated , it got out of hand and everyone took precautions . ”
I realize that many people in this country want airlines to target Muslims for additional security screening , which , even if you agree with that idea , this seems a bit excessive .
I ’m not sure this approaches the level of impropriety of , say , someone joking that he had a bomb in their bag at the ticket counter .
More importantly , if you do n’t agree with targeting travelers based on race , think about why .
If a white person made a similar comment , it is very unlikely that anyone would even take notice .
And that ’s the point :
If it was inappropriate for a Muslim , then it would also be inappropriate if someone like , say , myself said the same thing .
At the very least , the airline could have rebooked them on another flight after they were cleared .
Researchers at the University of California have developed a computer model of the triple star system at Alpha Centauri that shows that Alpha Centauri B ( the largest of the three stars ) could have rocky Earth - like planets orbiting within its habitable zone , where liquid water could exist .
At four light years away , these are the closest stars to our solar system .
Of the 276 extrasolar planets we have found so far none of them have been that local .
Now two of the co-authors are about to start a campaign at Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile to observe Alpha Centauri to test methods to look for these planets .
Alpha Centauri is a good target because , like the Big Dipper in the Northern Hemisphere , Alpha Centauri is almost always up in the Southern Hemisphere night sky for observing .
Being so bright and nearby would also help researchers detect the tiny wobble a small terrestrial planet would impart .
Scientific modeling of solar system formation had previously found that while gas giants are unlikely to form in the Alpha Centauri system , rocky planets would .
This new data that the possible planets could be in a habitable zone makes it all the more tantalizing .
University of California researcher Javiera Guedes developed the simulations of the system 's first 200 million years .
In each instance , despite different parameters , multiple terrestrial planets formed around the star .
In every case , at least one planet turned up similar in size to the Earth , and in many cases this planet fell within the star 's habitable zone .
Co-author and Professor Gregory Laughlin said , " We 're advocating that there 's a strong possibility a planet could be there . "
Study co-author Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University is leading the NSF funded program on the 1.5 - meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory to monitor Alpha Centauri A and B , Tau Ceti , GJ780 and Beta Hydri through November 2009 .
The team says that a dedicated five year campaign should be able to discern the presence of even an Earth sized rocky planet .

I wrote this comic based primarily on the developments of last week ’s installment of Heroes , but I ’m sure it will apply to tonight ’s as well ( is it new tonight ? ) .
There ’s no reason to beat a dead show ( or steal it ’s powers , as it were ) , so here ’s some links about how Heroes sucks and Tim Kring is a douche mellon :
As civilian casualties mount in the Gaza Strip , President - elect Barack Obama is coming under intensifying pressure to end his disengagement and begin working for a halt to the fighting .
Obama has argued that President Bush remains in charge of U.S. foreign policy until the inauguration on Jan. 20 .
But critics say hundreds may die in the next two weeks while the president - elect stands by .
The displeasure is threatening the incoming administration ’s chances for a honeymoon in the Middle East , where millions have held high hopes after the bitter conflicts that occurred during the Bush years , analysts say .
Obama has announced plans for a major speech in a Muslim capital early this year to begin forging a new and positive relationship with Muslims who have been alienated by Bush .
But Riad Malki , the Palestinian Authority foreign minister , expressed disappointment with Obama this week during an appearance at the United Nations .
“ We expected him to be open and responsive , ” he said .

While Obama has avoided interfering with Bush on Gaza , he has condemned with “ the harshest of words ” the November terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , said Al Quds al Arabi , an Arabic language newspaper published in London .
“ It seems the rules change when the attacker is Israeli and the victim is Arab or Muslim , ” the newspaper said .
In an apparent acknowledgment of the growing pressure , Obama broke his silence Tuesday after Israeli shells struck Palestinians in a U.N. school in Gaza , killing at least 30 people .
“ The loss of civilian life in Gaza and in Israel is a source of deep concern for me , ” Obama said at his transition office in Washington , while continuing to insist that the United States has only one president at a time .
“ After Jan. 20 , I ’m going to have plenty to say about the issue . ”

But he gave no indication of what approach he would take .
Secretary of State - designate Hillary Rodham Clinton , who will be confronted with the crisis as soon as she is confirmed by the Senate , also has been reserved .
Clinton has discussed the conflict with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , but has declined to speak publicly .
Clinton was regarded as a staunch defender of Israel while serving as a Democratic senator from New York .
Her appointment offered reassurances to Israelis wondering about Obama ’s intentions , while cooling Arab hopes for a marked U.S. policy shift .
Arab governments , which hope for good relations with the new president , have generally avoided exerting pressure over the issue .
But many ordinary Arabs are puzzled , and Arabic news outlets raise the issue regularly .
Hussein Ibish , of the Washington - based American Task Force on Palestine , said he took part in an interview with the Al Jazeera satellite TV news channel in which an anchor “ basically berated me ” about Obama ’s muted response .

Khaled Meshaal , Hamas ’ leader , pointed to the president - elect ’s silence Monday in declaring that the early stage of Obama ’s presidency “ is not good . ”
And in a recording purportedly made by Al Qaeda ’s No. 2 , Ayman Zawahiri faults Obama ’s inaction , saying the president - elect was falsely portrayed as “ a rescuer who will change the policy of America . ”
In the United States , some of the liberals who strongly backed Obama ’s candidacy expressed unhappiness with his reticence .
Blogs such as Huffington Post and Kabobfest carry regular calls for action .
“ Where is Obama , in the war for hearts and minds ? ” Philip Weiss of the Mondoweiss blog wrote Tuesday .
Even the Obama campaign ’s website , Change.gov , receives entreaties .
“ Are you going to remain silent on the inhumane war Israel is launching on the Palestinians ? ” one person , identifying himself as Omakan , wrote from New York .
Advertisement
Nevertheless , some leading Arab American activists expressed understanding for Obama ’s position .
Ziad Asali , president of the American Task Force on Palestine , said many in the Middle East have unrealistic expectations about what Obama can do .
The current U.S. policy , with its emphasis on protecting Israeli security , “ is more or less the policy of the American establishment ” and is likely to continue , Asali said .
“ People ’s expectations in the Middle East have been inflated , and ca n’t possibly be met , ” he said .

When the Division of Elections closes for business today , Ted Stevens and Mark Begich will be a lot closer to knowing just who won the Alaska Senate race .
Elections officials plan to count more than half the 90,000 ballots that remain outstanding , the Anchorage Daily News writes today .
That includes 61,000 absentee ballots , 9,500 early votes and 20,000 ballots that are disputed .
Officials will count the early votes and more than half the absentee votes , likely meaning Stevens ' 3,257 - vote lead will shrink .
Early votes have gone to Democrat Begich by a 59 % - 37 % margin , a spokesperson for the Alaska Democratic Party reports .
The number of outstanding ballots could still grow , as more than a quarter of Alaska 's 40 precincts have not reported how many disputed ballots they have .
Already , the 52,000 votes elections officials hope to count today amount to a little over 20 % of the total number of votes cast .

Pel 's fishing owl is one of the hardest birds to see in the whole of Africa .
Huge and almost entirely nocturnal , this near - mythical creature prowls the swamps and waterways of the continent in search of its fishy prey .
So as I set off to explore the Okavango Delta on a bright , sunny morning , Pel 's fishing owl was not very high on the list of birds I expected to see .
I was in a low - slung , traditional canoe known as a mokoro - easily the best way to explore this watery wonderland .
Though this is a mode of transport that leaves the passenger feeling pretty vulnerable , especially when I heard the rumbling laughter of a hippo coming from the nearby reeds .
But as we were poled expertly through the shallow water , my fears gave way to delight .
A tiny painted reed frog clung to a stem , allowing me to appreciate its stunning variety of colours as we glided past .
Water - lilies thronged the surface , giving the misleading impression that we were passing across a giant ornamental pond .
And along the edges of the water red lechwe – a medium - sized antelope with a preference for swampy habitats , were warily feeding .
And , of course , there are the birds .
Squacco herons exploded from the reeds in front of us in a flurry of ochre and white .
African jacanas walked across the aquatic vegetation on long , splayed toes .
And overhead , a magnificent African fish eagle was soaring , chestnut and white against the clear blue sky .
I was relaxing into my mokoro ride when the poler in front called out – he had seen an owl flying off into the distance .
As it disappeared into the trees on a nearby island I realised that the huge size and gingery plumage all pointed to one species :
Pel 's fishing owl .
I experienced a mixture of delight and frustration at such brief and inconclusive views .
We moored the boats and scanned the thick vegetation .
After a minute or two , someone spotted the owl perched on a branch .
Unlike most other large owls this species lacks the usual tufted " ears " , and has a round - headed appearance , with what can only be described as a kindly expression on its face .
Not so kind if you are a fish , presumably .
We edged closer , and I enjoyed some of the best views I have had of any owl , let alone such a rare and elusive species .
A minute or so later this magnificent bird decided to seek a quieter spot to rest for the day , and flew off .
A truly memorable encounter with one of Africa 's most mysterious birds .
Most commentary on the terrible employment report has focused on the establishment numbers , because the number from the household survey that usually makes headlines , the unemployment rate , did n’t rise all that much .
But the jobs picture from the establishment survey looks terrible , too ; what held the unemployment rate down was a reduction in the number of people who said they were looking for work .
The chart above shows the employment - population ratio , the ratio of employed Americans to the adult population .
By this measure it ’s been a weak economy all along — and now it ’s falling off a cliff .
Office work is already taxing for most people .
But the prospect of moving to a new one is even more terrifying for many reasons .
Not only do you need to adapt to a new setting , but you also need to rearrange your desk anew .
But the more important concern is do you have all the office desk essentials to become more productive , efficient , and healthy in your new office ?
Having the right items on your desk brings numerous benefits .
Though some items may vary from person to person , some are non-negotiable in today ’s working environment .
Continue reading below as we take a look at these valuable items you must have on your office desk .
Essentials You Must Have on Your Desk
Here ’s a fact : there are lots of items that you can put on your office desk .
Each of these items has its own merits .
Each one is deserving of a spot on your table .
But the problem is , you only have enough space to accommodate a few .
If we are to trim down the list , here are seven office desk essentials , in no particular order , you must have :
1. Cellphone Charger
Though you may think the phone charger ’s place is inside your bag , having a spare one in your desk drawer will go a long way .
Keeping a spare charger on your desk will save you during times of great need .
If your work entails using your mobile phone to check on emails or make phone calls , you can expect your device to run out of juice even before the workday ends .
When this happens and you left your charger at home , you will have to ask around to borrow one .
In a fast - paced workplace , you do not want the inconvenience of borrowing chargers to keep your phone alive .
2. Headphones
If you love music , then you need to have a set of headphones on your office desk .
Research explains that music can help spur people ’s productivity .
This is even more evident if your work involves repetitive tasks .
Though your office may play some great tunes , there is no guarantee that everyone will like them .
Listening to music you do not like becomes a distraction instead of an inspiration .
Thus , putting on your earphones and playing songs from your playlist is the way to go .
3. The Right Chair
Though this is technically not a part of your physical desk , a chair is an integral element of your personal workspace .
Thus , we need to include the chair on the list .
What you want is something ergonomic .
This means the chair must come in a design that will make you more efficient and comfortable at work .
Sitting for several hours in front of a computer daily may lead to different health issues .
This is further escalated if you have a poor office chair .
Additionally , complement your ergonomic chair with a laptop stand .
These stands improve the position of your laptop .
In turn , it improves your body ’s posture by keeping you from slouching .
You check out this guide here to learn about laptop stands .
4. A Notepad
In a world where everything is moving towards the digital direction , having a trusty notepad still proves to be valuable .
A notepad can help you jot down important details quickly if you are talking to a client over the phone .
Moreover , a notepad is easy to carry during quick meetings with your boss .
Instead of carrying your laptop to the conference room , slip your notepad inside your pocket and you ’re good to go .
Additionally , having a notepad by your side helps increase your productivity .
You will also remember things faster , as you can write down quick notes in seconds .
5. Water Bottle
One of the keys to productivity and efficiency at work is hydration .
Without enough water in your body , your ability to think and function goes down .
Moreover , you may experience different kinds of physical discomforts .
Dehydrated people may feel irritable .
Some feel sleepy while others have bouts with headaches .
Thus , you need to have a water bottle close by .
You want to drink enough throughout the day .
But do n’t drink too much , as frequent trips to the bathroom may affect your productivity .
Additionally , throw in some light snacks on the side .
You ’ll never know when hunger pangs come knocking on your tummy .
6. Personal Care Products
You also need to keep a stash of your personal care and hygiene products .
Make sure you have a bar of soap , a mouthwash , and a deodorant ready .
These things come in handy whenever you need to rush to an important event right after work .
For women , make sure to stock up on feminine products .
Also , a small box of mint or gums will go a long way .
7. A Box of Tissue Paper
Last but not least , you need to have a box of tissue paper on your desk .
This is crucial during times when you catch a cold .
Sneezing and blowing your nose without any tissue insight is a disaster .
Organizing Your Office Desk Essentials
You already have the essentials ready .
Your next step is to organize them on your desk .
Let ’s touch on the benefits of organizing your work desk .
1. You Do n’t Forget Tasks
Organizing your work desk will help you remember important tasks for the day .
With everything in their proper places , you will not have a hard time looking for incoming and outgoing paperwork .
2. Promotes Your Creativity
With a clean desk , you can focus more on your tasks .
If you belong in the creative industry , your creativity will further come out if your desk is clean and clutter - free .
3. Reduces Stress
Last but not least , having an organized desk will reduce your stress levels .
Studies show that clutter can increase your stress levels .
It affects your decision - making and drains your cognitive resources .
Aim for Efficiency and Productivity
By having these office desk essentials , your transition into your new office becomes easier .
But with the different challenges of moving offices , you need to focus on increasing your productivity and efficiency .

We give out tips and tricks that will help you finish more tasks faster .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. economy contracted violently in the fourth quarter , with gross domestic product falling at its fastest pace in more than 25 years , economists said ahead of what promises to be a grim week of economic news .
" Real economic activity fell off a cliff during the fourth quarter , producing a sharp drop in employment , output and spending , " wrote economists at Wachovia .
And the worst part is that it 's not over .
Economists expect another huge decline in the first quarter , with a smaller contraction in the second quarter .
GDP is expected to have fallen at a 5.5 % annualized rate in the final three months of last year , according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
That would be the biggest decline since the 6.4 % drop in early 1982 and one of the worst quarters in the post - World War II era .
The government will release its first estimate of fourth - quarter GDP on Friday , the culmination of a very busy week on the economic calendar .
See Economic Calendar .
Other major releases will include durable - goods orders for December , home sales for December , and consumer confidence surveys for January .
In addition , economists will be watching the weekly jobless claims data for more clues about the health of the labor market .
We could see first - time claims breach the 600,000 mark for the first time since the early 1980s .
None of the news in the coming week is expected to be positive .
The bad GDP story
Almost everything that could have gone wrong did after the credit crisis worsened in September .
More than 1.5 million jobs were destroyed in the quarter .
Consumer spending fell again .
Businesses put investment plans on hold .
Home builders threw in the towel .
Export markets dried up .
The only bright spot was the collapse in prices for oil and other commodities , a sudden reversal caused directly by the global slump .
This has boosted consumers ' spending power , but has also slammed corporate profits .
" The weakness was very widespread , with every type of final expenditure falling , " wrote economist Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan , who expects final sales to fall 5.9 % annualized , which would be the third worst quarter since 1949 .
According to Feroli's estimates , consumer spending likely declined at a 3.6 % annual pace , about the same as the 3.8 % drop in the third quarter .
Business investment probably declined at a 20 % pace , while residential investment plunged at a 30 % pace , the worst yet in this episode .
He expects nonresidential construction to fall 2 % , the first decline in about three years , with bigger drops to come .
And net exports are expected to fall , a big turnaround from earlier in the year when exports kept the economy above water .
The only positive contributors to GDP are expected to be government spending and inventories .
Government spending is expected to surge in the coming quarters given the huge fiscal stimulus being promised by the Obama administration and Congress .
On the other hand , inventories are expected to be a drag on growth going forward .
Companies have kept their inventories lean , but not lean enough .
" Given the rate at which sales are falling , that means that the inventory - to - sales ratio is rising sharply , and production will have to fall further in the first quarter to work off the excess supplies , " wrote Brian Bethune and Nigel Gault , economists for IHS Global Insight .
Every other time in the modern era that the U.S. economy has contracted more than 5 % in a quarter , falling inventories have been a major reason , if not the single biggest factor .
Usually , really bad recessions are worsened by the need for companies to get rid of all the stuff they made but nobody bought .
Once the inventories are sold off , the economy can grow quickly again because idled workers are called back .
But so far in this recession , the inventory cycle has n't been a major factor , outside of the housing and auto sectors .
That means that we can't look forward to a quick reacceleration as the inventory cycle turns .
This recession is rooted in a severe credit squeeze and a fundamental readjustment in consumer demand , not in the typical inventory cycle .
Policy to the rescue ?
Most economists are cautiously optimistic about a modest recovery later this year .
The turn in the inventory cycle is one reason , but a bigger cause for hope is the massive amount of work by the Federal Reserve and the government .
" Despite the current and expected near - term weakness , we caution against simply extrapolating .
While momentum is currently downward , policy action has been stepped up dramatically , with more measures likely , " wrote Maury Harris and Jim O'Sullivan , economists for UBS , who were among the few economists who saw this coming .
The Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the impact of what they 've done and what they 'll try next .
Interest - rates are as low as they can go , so the FOMC will put its full attention on the nontraditional measures it 's employed to thaw out the credit markets .
The conventional wisdom is that nothing has worked , but that 's not really accurate .
First off , governments in the developed world have made it clear that they wo n't allow the financial system to fail , which has lessened the fear of a systemic collapse .
If what they 've tried so far does n't work , there are other things that can be done , including nationalization of the banks as a last resort .
There are signs of improvement already , especially in the short - term funding markets , where the Fed has concentrated its efforts lately .
Credit spreads between government debt and the London interbank offered rate , commercial paper and mortgages are falling , although they certainly are n't back to normal levels .
Yes , the days are cold and dark , but spring will come .
It always does .

Most video games can safely be filed under male wish fulfillment .
Some part of us always wants to have the biggest gun , to be the best at the martial arts , and to be able to solve any problem with brute force .
Heck , even sports games fall under this category ; who does n't want to share in the glory of winning the Super Bowl ?
Faith , from Mirror 's Edge , is a different beast all together .
She 's adept at hand - to - hand fighting , but each opponent you encounter in the game is a serious threat .
The best strategy is almost never to stand and fight , but to run .
That 's what Faith is , a runner , and this is how she sees the world .
Every level is a maze of platforms , jumps , and seemingly impossible feats of speed and coordination ; being Faith means never having to worry about traffic or parking or any of the other petty things that infest the lives of the people on the street level .
A rare moment of peace for Faith
You see , in the world of Mirror 's Edge , the city is a perfect , clean expanse of glass and steel .
The government has made sure that we 're all safely watched and controlled in order to stamp out dangerous things like violence , crime , and free thought .
There are a few people who have been pushed to the outskirts of the city who do n't feel like giving into this unholy trade - off of free will for safety , and of course , every now and again , they need to communicate with another set of people across the city .
Phones are tapped , e-mail is read , mail is opened .
So how do you communicate safely ?
You use something better than technology , and Faith is that organic solution .
The runners take those messages and rush them across the tops of the city 's buildings , running on foot across obstacles that would stop any normal pursuer .
Running across an entire city is n't a hard thing when you 're moving as the crow flies , and this is the feeling that DICE 's Mirror 's Edge wants to give you : freedom .
We see Faith in the third - person during the animated cut- scenes , and she always seems slightly unhappy and worried , weighed down by the sheer fact of being in her skin .
Hers is n't the easiest life , and , while stationary , she has time to wonder about these things .

( CNN ) -- A bus carrying Chinese tourists overturned Friday near Hoover Dam , killing at least seven people and injuring at least nine , an Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman said .
Authorities work on the crash scene Friday on U.S. 93 in White Hills , Arizona , near Hoover Dam .
The accident happened at 4 p.m. on U.S. 93 at mile marker 27 , about 27 miles south of Hoover Dam , said Lt. James Warriner .
The dead lay in body bags on the roadway near the bus , which was on its side across both lanes and onto the shoulder of the highway .
Initial reports from the scene indicated rescuers had difficulty communicating with the passengers , all of them Chinese nationals .
Five of the injured were taken to Kingman Regional Medical Center , where one was in critical condition and four were in serious condition , said Ryan Kennedy , executive director of operations .
Rick Plummer , a spokesman for University Medical Center in Las Vegas , said the hospital received five victims by helicopter , one who died , two in critical condition and two in serious condition .
Watch authorities work the crash scene »
The north - south highway at the crash scene in White Hills , Arizona , was shut in both directions .
Officials said the bus was heading from Las Vegas to Arizona .
Hoover Dam is near the border of the two states .

Among the injured was a motorcyclist who was hurt avoiding the bus , said National Park Service spokesman Andrew Munoz .
I received this text message from a friend who fortunately is one of those who has not only read history but also never forget it .
“ Richard the Lionheart fought the crusades against Muslims who were valiantly defended by Salahuddin Ayubi .
In operation LionHeart , who is lion heart in present context ?
Can somebody ask Gen Ather Abbas ? ”
Since , I was running fever and had n’t watched TV or read newspaper for a couple of days ; I ask him that what operation Lionheart is ?
He informed me that joint operation of Pakistani and ISAF forces in FATA is named operation Lionheart .
I then forwarded that text message to my favorite hosts and was lucky to get reply from two of them .
In their reply they told me that they would ask the question as the next day they were meeting Gen Abbas in Seminar in the Capital .
To my knowledge , till these lines are typed , no has asked this questions on - air , may be due to the censor policies of their channels .
However , the messages like these are roaming through cellular network ;
“ Now the crusades against Muslims of Pakistan and Afghanistan have been named operation Lionheart after the title of crusader King Richard who fought against Salahudin Ayubi for four years and massacred each and every Muslim in Al - Quds when he conquered it for a brief period .
The US Army , NATO and ( some of the words are edited here ) our own army are operating together under the operation Lionheart , there is no doubt left for the real Muslims and Pakistanis to recognize who their clear enemies are !
If you love Islam and Pakistan now is the time to stand and fight for our Faith and Country . ”
We can easily call these text messages , the views of radicals , extremists , illiterates , conservatives , enemies of free society and social change and so on .
But we ca n’t deny the truth that speaks very loud between the lines .
Whether it should be a matter of our Faith or not , it ’s debatable as there are the people who still believe this is “ our own War ” .
But what is the reason and intention behind naming an operation against Muslim , no matter extremist or moderate , after the name of a cruel crusader KINGS ?
It ’s a new world , a cyber world , an era of information .
I hope our forces and agencies would not loose their energy on making way out to shut the month speaking truth , but answering these simple question such as ;
Why has a joint operation in FATA named after crusaders ?
Is this a Slip of pin like the slip tong by Mr Bush right after 9/11 when he termed the war on terror as a Crusade ?
Is it a deliberate act of western forces who think that Muslim masses would be stupid like their leadership and would have forgotten their history ?
My friends are suggested to visit the following links for reading about Richard Lionheart .
It will be also healthy for those responsible for dealing with western powers to visit the recommended Links .

“ When I am president , ” President - elect Barack Obama said in a videogram sent to a participants of a climate change summit organized by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last week , “ any governor who is willing to promote clean energy will have an ally in the White House . ”
And it was just one of several pledges he made .
Governors from Western states have now issued a four - page letter to Obama calling for long - term commitment to clean energy in the U.S.
While it is not a direct reply to Obama ’s video ( drafts have been in the works since June , according to Western Governors ’ Association spokesperson Karen Deike ) , the letter amounts to a collective “ Yes We ’re Willing ” from the states ’ leadership .
Sent last week , this message came as global leaders made final preparations for another set of climate change talks , known as COP - 14 , that kicked off today in Poland .
As the first international conference on the issue since the election , COP - 14 represents a re-entry for the U.S. into global climate change talks largely neglected since the country walked away from the Kyoto Protocol .
Signed by leaders of the Western Governors ’ Association , which represents governors from 19 states ( including Alaska , of “ Drill Baby Drill ” fame ) , plus Guam , American Samoa , and the Northern Mariana Islands , the letter includes calls for tens of billions of dollars in annual investment in clean energy and vehicle technologies , assistance for industries transitioning to renewable fuels and more efficient technologies , and rewards for utilities that reduce customers ’ energy usage .
The governors ’ vision extends beyond public funding for cleantech .
The group also suggests making “ maximum use ” of market - based mechanisms for slashing emissions , and encouraging ( though not requiring ) the private sector to invest at least as much as the federal government into energy technologies .
The governors do n’t specify a regulatory scheme for carbon emissions , but they are clear on how revenue from something like a carbon tax should be spent .
“ Revenue raised should support the energy policy principles in this letter , ” the governors write , “ and not be used as a means of sustaining or expanding general governmental operations . ”
The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , a coal industry group , has announced support for the governors ’ stance — or a skewed version of it , at least : Instead of renewable fuels , the coalition suggests the governors have come out swinging for so - called “ clean coal ” technology .

SUGGESTION : DOWNLOAD THE HAND OUT
Gandhi's major statement on the Palestine and the Jewish question came forth in his widely circulated editorial in the Harijan of 11 November 1938 , a time when intense struggle between the Palestinian Arabs and the immigrant Jews had been on the anvil in Palestine .
His views came in the context of severe pressure on him , especially from the Zionist quarters , to issue a statement on the problem .
Therefore , he started his piece by saying that his sympathies are all with the Jews , who as a people were subjected to inhuman treatment and persecution for a long time .
" But " , Gandhi asserted , " My sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice .
The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me .
The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and in the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after their return to Palestine .
Why should they not , like other peoples of the earth , make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood ? "
He thus questioned the very foundational logic of political Zionism .
Gandhi rejected the idea of a Jewish State in the Promised Land by pointing out that the " Palestine of the Biblical conception is not a geographical tract . "
The Zionists , after embarking upon a policy of colonization of Palestine and after getting British recognition through the Balfour Declaration of 1917 for " the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jews , " tried to elicit maximum international support .
The Jewish leaders were keen to get an approval for Zionism from Gandhi as his international fame as the leader of a non-violent national struggle against imperialism would provide great impetus for the Jewish cause .
But his position was one of total disapproval of the Zionist project both for political and religious reasons .
He was against the attempts of the British mandatory Government in Palestine toeing the Zionist line of imposing itself on the Palestinians in the name of establishing a Jewish national home .
Gandhi's Harijan editorial is an emphatic assertion of the rights of the Arabs in Palestine .
The following oft - quoted lines exemplify his position : " Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French .
It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs ...
Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home . "
Gandhi's response to Zionism and the Palestine question contains different layers of meaning , ranging from an ethical position to political realism .
What is interesting is that Gandhi , who firmly believed in the inseparability of religion and politics , had been consistently and vehemently rejecting the cultural and religious nationalism of the Zionists .
What follows then is that he was not for religion functioning as a political ideology ; rather , he wanted religion to provide an ethical dimension to nation - State politics .
Such a difference was vital as far as Gandhi was concerned .
A uni-religious justification for claiming a nation - State , as in the case of Zionism , did not appeal to him in any substantial sense .
The history of Palestine in the first half of this century has been characterized by the contention between two kinds of nationalism : Zionism and Palestinian Arab nationalism - the former striving for creating a Jewish nation in Palestine by colonizing its land through massive Jewish immigration and the latter struggling for freedom of the inhabitants of the land of Palestine from colonial and imperialist control .
Gandhi , in his role as leader of the national struggle and the Indian National Congress ( the organization embodying that struggle ) , had been actively engaged during the 1930s and 1940s in moulding the perception of the people of India to the nationalist and anti-imperialist struggles in the Arab world .
The 1937 Calcutta meeting of the All India Congress Committee ( AICC ) " emphatically protested against the reign of terror as well as the partition proposals relating to Palestine " and expressed the solidarity of the Indian people with the Arab peoples ' struggle for national freedom .
The Delhi AICC of September 1938 said in its resolution that Britain should leave the Jews and the Arabs to amicably settle the issues between the two parties , and it urged the Jews " not to take shelter behind British Imperialism . "
Gandhi wanted the Jews in Palestine to seek the goodwill of the Arabs by discarding " the help of the British bayonet . "
Gandhi and the Congress thus openly supported Palestinian Arab nationalism , and Gandhi was more emphatic in the rejection of Zionist nationalism .
The major political driving force in such a position was the common legacy of anti-imperialist struggle of the Indians and the Palestinians .
Gandhi's views on the Zionist doctrine and his firm commitment to the Palestinian cause starting from the 1930s obviously influenced the design of independent India 's position on the Palestine issue .
Gandhi's prescription for the Jews in Germany and the Arabs in Palestine was non-violent resistance .
With regard to the Jewish problem in Germany , Gandhi noted , " I am convinced that if someone with courage and vision can arise among them to lead them in non-violent action , the winter of their despair can , in the twinkling of an eye , be turned into the summer of hope . "
His views on Zionism and his prescription of non-violent action and self - sacrifice to the Jews in Germany generated reactions ranging from anger to despair .
Famous Jewish pacifists , Martin Buber , Judah Magnes and Hayim Greenberg , who otherwise admired Gandhi , felt " highly offended by Gandhi's anti-Zionism " and criticized him for his lack of understanding of the spirit of Zionism .
Martin Buber , in a long reply to Gandhi's Harijan editorial , remarked , " You are only concerned , Mahatma , with the " right of possession " on the one side ; you do not consider the right to a piece of free land on the other side - for those who are hungering for it . "
As mentioned earlier , Gandhi refused to view the Zionist " hunger " for land in Palestine as a right .
Gandhi wrote on 7 January 1939 the following in response to an editorial in the Statesman , " I hold that non-violence is not merely a personal virtue .
It is also a social virtue to be cultivated like the other virtues .
Surely society is largely regulated by the expression of non-violence in its mutual dealing .
What I ask for is an extension of it on a larger , national and international scale . "
Also , it is significant to note that , as far as Gandhi was concerned , non-violent action was not pacifism or a defensive activity but a way of waging war .
This war without violence also requires discipline , training and the assessment of the strength and weakness of the enemy .
According to Paul Power , four factors influenced Gandhi 's position on Zionism :
" First , he was sensitive about the ideas of Muslim Indians who were anti-Zionists because of their sympathy for Middle Eastern Arabs opposed to the Jewish National Home ; second , he objected to any Zionist methods inconsistent with his way of non-violence ; third , he found Zionism contrary to his pluralistic nationalism , which excludes the establishment of any State based solely or mainly on one religion ; and fourth , he apparently believed it imprudent to complicate his relations with the British , who held the mandate in Palestine . "
Gandhi withstood almost all Zionist attempts at extracting a pro-Zionist stance from him .
G.H. Jansen wrote about the failure of Zionist lobbying with Gandhi :
" His opposition [ to Zionism ] remained consistent over a period of nearly 20 years and remained firm despite skilful and varied applications to him of that combination of pressure and persuasion known as lobbying , of which the Zionists are past masters . "
Apart from responses to Gandhi's anti-Zionism from Jewish pacifists such as Buber , Magnes and Greenberg , Jansen points out at least four separate instances of Zionist attempts to get a favourable statement from Gandhi .
At first , Hermann Kallenbach , Gandhi's Jewish friend in South Africa , came to India in 1937 and stayed for weeks with Gandhi trying to convince him of the merits of the Zionist cause .
Then , in the 1930s , as requested by Rabbi Stephen Wise , the American pacifist John Haynes Holmes , tried " to obtain from Gandhi a declaration favourable to Zionism " .
In March 1946 , a British MP from the Labour Party , Sydney Silverman , an advocate of Indian independence in Britain , attempted to change Gandhi 's mind .
At the end of their heated conversation , Gandhi stated that " after all our talk , I am unable to revise the opinion I gave you in the beginning . "
The fourth Zionist attempt to change Gandhi 's mind was by Louis Fischer , Gandhi 's famous biographer , to whom Gandhi reported to have said that " the Jews have a good case . "
Later , Gandhi clarified in one of his final pieces on Zionism and the Palestine question on 14 July 1946 that " I did say some such thing in the course of a conversation with Mr. Louis Fischer on the subject . "
He added , " I do believe that the Jews have been cruelly wronged by the world . "
Gandhi went back to his initial position by categorically stating that " But in my opinion , they [ the Jews ] have erred grievously in seeking to impose themselves on Palestine with the aid of America and Britain and now with the aid of naked terrorism ...
Why should they depend on American money or British arms for forcing themselves on an unwelcome land ?
Why should they resort to terrorism to make good their forcible landing in Palestine ? "
There were an influential number of Jews who thought that force , only force , could ensure the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine .
They adopted terrorism as the method to achieve their national goal .
This policy of subjugation of the Palestinians by Zionist terror was totally rejected by Gandhi in no uncertain terms .
A few months before his assassination , Gandhi answered the question " What is the solution to the Palestine problem ? " raised by Doon Campbell of Reuters :
" It has become a problem which seems almost insoluble .
If I were a Jew , I would tell them : ' Do not be so silly as to resort to terrorism ...'
The Jews should meet the Arabs , make friends with them and not depend on British aid or American aid , save what descends from Jehovah . "
A couple of months ago I found out about Clint Ecker ’s excellent django app django - chunks , which basically does one thing and that very well :
It takes the idea of a django.
contrib.
flatpages and uses it for small chunks or blocks on a page , like a help section a small “ about ” part you want to have on every page , yet still keep it editable .
All you have to do , is create a model instance , give it a specific name / key / slug and then use a bundled templatetag to include that object into your view .
{ % load chunks %} ... { % chunk ' my_help_section ' %}
Many people started forking it to add some additional fields .
Kevin Fricovsky added an active - flag , Peter Baumgartner added a header field , … which is something I personally needed for one of my projects .
But I also need a couple of other things , like an inclusion - tag instead of a plain - old - django - templatetag , so that I could easily add , for example , an edit button right next to each such block .
That was the time when I knew , I had to make it a real fork .
The first step actually was to also allow the name of the chunk / flatblock being passed via a template variable , so you could all of a sudden do something like this :
{ % load flatblock_tags %} ... { % flatblock blockInAVaribale %}
… which makes things a little bit easier if you ’re , for instance , operating in a multi-lingual environment .
But first I have some other things I want to see in django - flatblocks with a simple view for editing being quite on top of that list … so that I do n’t have to write it again and again in each and every project I ’m working on ;-)
But now enough of that .
Enjoy django - flatblocks 0.1.0 :-)
Update ( 2009 -02 -25 ) : django - flatblocks 0.2.0 is now available :-)

Are consumers dissatisfied with their netbooks ?
Despite the form factor 's explosive growth in popularity and seemingly bright future , a market analysis firm with a novel means of collecting and sorting information alleges exactly this .
Biz360 's recent aggregation and analysis of online netbook reviews and forum conversations around specific models indicates that , on the whole , users are n't too happy with netbooks in the critical areas of performance , display sizes , and features .
According to Biz360's analysis , which dredged more than 20,000 reviews from all corners of the internet , " consumer advocacy for the netbook category lags behind consumer advocacy for all laptops . "
To be specific , " Net Advocacy " ( more on this term in a moment ) was 40 % lower , a mere 27.72 over the six brands searched for , versus 46.1 for notebooks .
But 2008 was the year of the netbook , right ?
So what 's the genesis of this apparent paradox in consumer satisfaction ?
Let 's take a look at Biz360 's report and methods .
The " advocacy " algorithm
Biz360's " Opinion Insights " analysis method works by collecting reviews and commentary on consumer products from review and retailer websites , parsing them for content , ranking them by their sentiment and the prominence of their venue in web rankings , and finally aggregating them into a consensus level of satisfaction with different aspects of the product called " Net Advocacy . "
One might expect that Net Advocacy is found by subtracting LDL Advocacy from HDL Advocacy , and this is essentially what happens .
Negative buzz is subtracted from positive , and the end result divided by the total volume of noise on the subject .
The end result is each product and attribute 's Net Advocacy ranked on a scale from - 100 to 100 , with - 100 signaling unanimous execration of a product 's attributes , and 100 representing universal panegyric enthusiasm .
Picking apart the results
Biz360 says the method delivers " critical information that [ their customers ] can use to uncover the truth about brand preferences , specific product features and attributes that matter most , emerging trends , price elasticity , competitive vulnerabilities and much more . "
Certainly , this kind of analysis can offer up - to - the - moment information on online reputation , although selection bias probably reduces its value .
Not only do consumers select whether to comment based on their impressions , and on their degree of tech - savviness , but retailers sometimes censor user reviews .
Biz360 says this selection bias is n't a problem , because the online reputation itself has value .
Indeed , conventional wisdom and consumer surveys have indicated that purchasers make purchasing decisions based on online reviews .
This has some problems too .
While it 's possible to imagine a computer algorithm that could extract sentiments like " screen is too small " or " trackpad sucks , " it 's difficult to picture any rating extracting all the subtle clues that users sense in ranking reviews .
The same sentiments might be completely dismissed based on subtle grammar errors , a telling technical mistake , or an unprofessional username .
Moreover , some sentiments may appear frequently , yet fail to move purchasers at all .
Even a simple measure , like the influence of the host website , may be easy to perceive ( Newegg is more influential than Dell.com ) but hard to quantify ( 10 % more ? 50 %? 3 times ? ) .
MONTREAL – Montreal police have asked the city to empower local officers to crack down on insult - hurling citizens – likely with a blow to their pocketbooks .
Mayor Gerald Tremblay said today his public security committee is mulling the request to slap offenders with fines , a suggestion first brought forward by Montreal 's police brotherhood .
The union wants Tremblay to make it illegal for members of the public to call cops profanity - laced nicknames , or to call them names like ``pig " and " doughnut - eater . "
" It 's something that will be addressed – we know that other cities have passed some bylaws considering that subject , " said Tremblay , stressing the city has not made any concrete decisions about banning indignities directed at police .
Chief - Insp. Paul Chablo , communications director for Montreal 's police force , said lawyers from the department and the city are examining the feasibility of such a rule .
" The key factor is ensuring that it becomes a useful tool for the officers involved , but at the same time it does n't infringe on anybody 's rights , " he said .
Chablo said several municipalities across Quebec – including Quebec City – have some variation of a law that prohibits citizens from spewing slurs at police officers .
The 28 - year veteran of the force said the law could keep police interventions involving violent citizens from getting out of hand .
" There are cases where people are either intoxicated , or for other reasons extremely aggressive and very injurious , " he said .
" In these cases , this tool might be something that 's practical . "
But while city council digests the demand to prevent civilians from mouthing off at cops , some experts question whether punishing Montrealers for launching jeers infringes on one 's right to expression .
" There are an awful lot of words that are borderline and it's highly subjective – it's too vague , " Ronald Sklar , a McGill University law professor , said of the police union 's proposal .
" I do n't think the police should be any different than anybody else as far as insults go because it does n't affect their ability to do their duty .
" It 's questionable policy . "
Sklar said words can be punishable , but they must threaten bodily harm or incite disorder .
Montreal was also expected to pass a motion Monday night to meet another police request .
The city is considering a bylaw amendment that would prohibit protesters from covering their faces during demonstrations .

Claude Dauphin , Montreal 's executive member in charge of public security , said there would be exceptions to the rule .
For example , demonstrators would have the right to don headgear resembling a particular politician whose position is the target of a rally , or slip on a ski mask when the temperature dips to - 25 C .
" But when you 're in the month of July , and you wear a ski mask or a gas mask , there might be a problem , " he said .
" Maybe their intention is not to have a peaceful demonstration . "
Chablo said police would use common sense in applying the law .
" Whenever there 's a protest where people cover their faces with masks or any type of cloth , usually it results in violence or there 's an intention to commit violence , " he said .
" It will be applied where there is a high - risk factor . "
But Sklar said citizens have a right to wear a mask during protests , regardless of what the weather 's like .
" At a political demonstration , I think there 's a right of privacy – I have a right to cover my face if I do n't want to be seen , " he said .
Barack Obama delivers his inaugural address after being sworn in as president of the United States .

By Mike Ely
For literally millions of people , for many of a new generation , the awakening to politics starts in these moments .
This is the world , the arguments , the summations , the claims , the promises that they hear and that they will see unfold in the days ahead .
We need to understand this moment , we need to also inhabit this world that they are seeing — in order to craft from among them a revolutionary force that can actually connect with and represent their highest hopes .
This essay was first presented at a Kasama Project forum held in Chicago before the two political conventions in August 2008 .
Six months later , after Obama 's election and inauguration , the question is even more sharply posed : what is the change that this represents .
What does it mean ( to the United States , to its forms of white supremacy , to its norms and assumptions ) that a Black man inhabits the White House .
What does it mean to the people , to their view of this country and its system ?
( What about the rise of a new Black patriotism and “ pride in America ” ? )
* * *
I want to talk about what the Obama candidacy represents domestically and I ’d like to talk about it in this sense :
Some major critiques that I run across of the Obama presidential campaign come from a certain tired 1960s Black nationalism .
I do n’t know if you all follow Burning Spear ( officially known as African People ’s Socialist Party , APSP ) .
But I think its analysis is a good example of what I ’m talking about .
It argues that Obama should not be supported — but views this moment through a set of decidedly 20th century goggles .
Burning Spear ’s chairperson Omali Yeshitela gave a series of talks called “ Barack Obama — White Power in Black Face ” — which is worth listening to in this light .
And I think we have to include in this category political prisioner Mumia Abu - Jamal ’s analysis ( posted on Kasama ) .
Basically their analysis is : Look , a President Obama would just be a black face on the same old white supremacy .
And I ’ve even run across some communists running a version of this line , saying , for example , that Barack Obama is not “ really ” Black or African American , and that is why he is acceptable and promotable within the “ white power structure ” .
And right from the beginning , we would have to say that there is a profound element of truth in what both Yeshitila , Mumia and other radical Black nationalists are saying : that the oppression of Black people will not be alleviated through some national election .
Yes , a President Obama will preside over the continued oppression of Black people .
That part is profoundly true and that is something we have to explain to people without sounding fatalistic .
Something will uproot this oppression , but it ’s just not Obama .
But it ’s a mistake to say it ’s the same old white supremacy if it is run by a Black president because first of all it is n’t .
Black people widely have some sense of that .
Multiculturalism and its meanings
We should peel back what Obama ’s “ post - racialism ” would mean and what is actually being contested in this country , because I think it will explain some of the facts that we have to think through .
This is somewhat simplistic , we can always get deeper , but it ’s very clear in a generation the majority of the people in the United States will be minorities .
This is a huge demographic shift .
It ’s happening much more rapidly than they thought , and it ’s a historic shift .
All previous waves of immigration came from Europe .
Now the waves of immigration come from oppressed countries , including especially countries oppressed by the US .
So if you bring in large numbers of people that have been oppressed by the US directly or indirectly –- from Mexico , Colombia , Guatamala , Puerto Rico , South Korea , and a dozen other countries –- it has a large effect on the politics and the culture of your country .
So those running the US have to deal with it .
And there is a sharp contention among the people who are responsible for the long - range operations of this empire about how to handle it .
We all are pretty much aware of the sort of right - wing arsehole approach — which is one pole within that contention :
That ’s the wall - at - the - border , run - the - Latinos - out , make - everyone - speak - English clampdown –- this is the call to enforce a traditional white Christian , male - dominated country , that ’s - what - made - us - great - so - shut - the - fuck - up .
I think we ’ll see it in a virulent tone .
Opposed to that is another discussion that revolutionaries have not grappled with profoundly , for reasons we can discuss .
And that pole is the Clintonian - sort of multiculturalism .
Rather than describe that pole perceptually , let me just say something about the history of this country :
Black people have always been black African - descended people — they were forced into castelike conditions of slave , sharecropper and impoverished worker using the confines of a colour line .
But white people have not always been white people .
When I was a kid , people talked about WASPs ( white Anglo - Saxon Protestants ) running this country .
And then suddenly , as the 1950s passed on , the talk is about “ white people . ”
Jews and Italians became honorary members of the dominant natonality , after they had long been excluded under this banner of WASPs .
A WASP , if you look at it , is Anglo - Saxon which means Brits and Germans ( it allowed Germans in ) .
And even that WASP concept had a historic beginning .
I wrote a piece on St. Louis and the German workers of the Civil War .
One thing that stands out is that German immigrants used to be an oppressed nationality in this country .
so were the Irish .
At that time , the dominant nationality was Anglo - Americans .
Then the Irish became white .
( There ’s a valuable book called How the Irish Became White that ’s really worth reading . )
The author of that book , Noel Ignatiev is part of a radical break from traditional communist theory about the national question — creating a school of analysis sometimes called the “ race - traitor ” school that writes about the “ invention of the white race ” .
And there are things worth understanding about what this school of thinking has dug up :
That in the US the system has , over time , flexibly adjusted who was considered part of the dominant nationality — part of the social compact that helped keep African American people , Chicanos , Native Americans , and the latest immigrants pinned at the bottom of the class structure .
One of the things revealed is that the dominant structure of this country has sought to accommodate while continuing to oppress .
Without going into all the depth of this : capitalism needs an oppressed class .
But historically , in the US , the system had trouble maintaining a historically stable , hereditary oppressed class — there was a labour shortage , there was an opening for escape onto the frontier , there were pressures pushing up wages .
The United States has always had a labour shortage because it killed the Indians , because its economic growth was dizzyingly rapid and because European immigrants could seek “ free land ” ( made “ free ” by killing their original inhabitants ) .
So it was hard to keep white people working in fields and domestic service .
( It was tried through a system of indentured servitude . )
The bringing in of Black people and making them do forced unpaid labour was a way to have a labour force at the bottom .
And holding Black people in caste - like conditions at the bottom of the working class was a way of keeping a proletariat in this country .
This was not the experience of other nationalities :
For example in the ’50s when the Jewish population went from being overwhelmingly proletarian to almost no members of the working class in twenty years .
It ’s one of fastest demographic transformation in history and it ’s part of what conservatised Jewish people in this country .
But through such changes affecting European immigrants , Black people have historically been held in caste - like conditions using the colour line .
Change in the structure of nationality and race in the United States
And now , we can see that there is consideration of a modification to that historic approach to Black people .
And I think the possible modification goes along the following lines :
Capitalism in the US still needs an oppressed proletariat — more than ever because of the competition within global manufacturing .
And certainly the capitalists themselves see the health of their domestic industries require the existance of significant sections of workers living and working at Third World levels .
Over the last decades , they have brought in immigrants and they are keeping many millions of them illegal , which is a way of super - exploiting people -- keeping them below prevailing wage levels .
And this system has worked to re-exploit Black people .
That was , for example , a capitalist calculation that animated the Clintonian approach to welfare :
What ’s the use , it was said , of having a proletariat if it ’s not desperate for work , if it ’s not willing to work for nothing ?
If Black youth are not interested in working for the minimum wage , then pressure needs to be brought to bear .
And so the existing structure of social services were changed — to pressure poor people to re-enter the workforce , at the bottom — to increasingly re-exploit , re-proletarianise them .
And at the same time , there has been a consideration of expanding the circle of those who are accepted into assimilation .
Interestingly enough , the model of this kind of assimilation has been the supposedly “ anti-racist ” innovations of the post - Vietnam US military .
There are places in this society where there have been efforts to transform how these things work .
The military is both extremely reactionary , and because of its need for humanpower , has done some accommodation on how Black people are brought into the structure .
There are also places in civil society in which , as a result of the 1960s , certain sections of Black people are allowed assimilation .
And there ’s a link between the conditional assimilation of some sections of the upper class of the Black nation , and the continuing criminalisation and demonisation of those at the bottom , since desegregation .
There ’s been an intensification of the class contradictions within the Black nationality so that , for example , Chicago ’s South Side used to have Black doctors and lawyers — but then you desegregate some suburbs and loosen the rigidity of that colour line , and professional Black people can move out , then the people left stranded in the inner-city communities are the poorest part of Black people , leaving these communities much less economically diverse than they were before desegregation .
So , there is a debate , a struggle , within the ruling class over how to handle the coming state of minority / majority ; and a profound and oppressive necessity to keep whole sections of non-white communities in caste - like oppression as proletarians fuelling the “ competitiveness ( profitability ) of US domestic production .
A look from the killing floor
It became really clear to me when I investigated pork processing in North Carolina .
In manufacturing , if the capitalists can export the factory , they move the factory to low - wage areas across the border .
But in some industries the capitalists just ca n’t shift the site of production : if it ’s transport , subways , trucking , meatpacking , restaurant work ….
You ca n’t move meatpacking plants to Guatemala because the meat ca n’t be profitably refrigerated and transported that far .
So instead , the capitalists import the workers from the low - wage areas .
Either they ship the factory to the Third World or they ship the Third World people here .
One of the advantages that US capitalism has over many rivals ( like Germany , Japan and other imperialist countries ) is that the US has a long border with a populous Third World country , and it can exploit that desperate labour in cruel but innovative ways .
The US ruling class wants to continue and refine that , and yet debate ways of developing a more stable and broader arrangement within the nationality structure that defines the US .
Here ’s what I ’m arguing :
That it ’s just not the same old shit and , first of all , Black people know this in some ways .
There ’s certain kinds of white superiority / Black inferiority that came out around this last election and some white people said , “ Well I just could never vote for a Black guy ” - – meaning : how could he be competent ?
And meaning : “ I do n’t trust a black man not to seek payback from those of us who took part in white racism . ”
There ’s a certain crude white racism that the Obama candidacy was an affront to ; and we should be prepared to take it on , and not tolerate it for a fucking second ...
We should not be stand - offish … `` Oh it ’s all the fucking same ' ' .
This is not tolerable and we should call it out and expose it whenever it appears .
Many people supporting Obama suspect that they may be able to knock those kinds of kinds of raw , old - time white racism out of the culture .
A lot of it ’s on the defensive already — raw white supremacy is no longer premissible in polite company .
It is not considered acceptable .
It has to be leaked out undercover , in whispers .
This shift in social norms comes out when some folks complain bitterly that there ’s just too much political correctness .
What they ’re saying is :
How come I ca n’t speak real thoughts publicly in civil society ?
It ’s because that kind of racism is already on the defensive .
What underlies this is that there are differences between what Obama and McCain represented in regard to the status of Black people .
And we need a living critique of the multicultural proposal that Obama ’s candidacy implicitly embodied .
We have to show how this change in the superstructure and its assumptions cannot really emancipate the masses of Black people , or the oppressed of other nationalities at the bottom of US class society .
We need to dissect what Obama ’s victory will actually mean ?
And which sections of Black people might see improvements because of the changes that a black president represents .
Obama ’s rise : Proof that people cause their own poverty ?
There ’s another thing to take into this discussion :
Some changes that an Obama presidency will bring domestically are not progressive .
You can see already two different narratives being promoted in regard to Obama ’s rise .
On one hand , there are people who say , “ This finally proves that Black people are equally competent and there is no justification for closing any sphere of society to Black people . ”
On the other hand , there are those who say , “ The rise of an Obama proves that there really is no more racism in America , and that the continuing impoverishment and social problems of Black communities cannot be blamed on the system . ”
This is , of course , the familiar way that highly reactionary forces in this country use the winning of civil rights laws .
They say , ``Look you got legal equality in 1965 ; if you ’re still poor two generations later , there ’s something wrong with you . ''
They say ( or imply ) that there ’s some special pathology among Black people : because once you got equality it was just up to you ; so there ’s just something wrong with you and your culture , so you should abandon your culture and take more personal responsibility .
It 's popular among Republican Party racists .
But also embodied in the Bill Cosby line — and it is promoted by Obama himself with his highly conscious talk of personal responsibility and Black fatherhood .
Structural racism
When people say , our problem ’s not the Klan anymore , it ’s now us killing each other , it denies the existence of structural racism .
It denies the ways in which a people are kept oppressed .
It treats slavery as an event in the past , not a legacy that defines everything around us .
There is a whole push to not talk about the past — you see it in the reactionary right , but also in Obama ( and his upholding of founding fathers and pioneers ! ) .
When we bring up slavery , we ’re explaining how this place looks now .
Why is the South so reactionary ?
You think it ’s not because of the blood of the African people and what went on there ?
Why do white people want guns in their houses ?
What ’s the history of it ?
What are the events and dynamics that this still arises from ?
You can get a glimmer of what an Obama victory can mean when you see how any mention of the oppression of Black people in the campaign was called ``playing the race card ' ' .
Here in the electoral campaign of a black person , there was almost zero discussion of the conditions of Black people and how they should be changed .
Obama ’s campaign has not meant that the condition of Black people is finally centre stage — his campaign pushed those conditions off the stage .
This is not “ our time has come ” .
This is , “ I ’m running and I ’m not discussing you . ”
And the moment Obama even mentions , “ Look , I do n’t look like the white guys on the dollar bill ” , the whole political establishment shouts back , ``Whoa , let ’s not be talking about race now . ''
In other words , the price ( the result ) of having a Black presidential candidate is the suppression of any discussion of the oppression of Black people .
And I supsect this will not be a temporary phenomenon .
It is part of what will come out of this election .
That will become a generalised phenomenon .
This is justified ( among Black people and among Democrats ) in the name of , “ He has to be president of all the people and if you just see him as a Black candidate you ’ll never win ” and all of that .
But really , there ’s a whole other thing going on and we actually have to help people articulate that because there ’s negative consequences of the system making this adjustment , and it includes perpetuating the demonisation of Black people and the argument that there are n’t structural reasons why Black people suffer the way they do in this hellhole .
So I think that ’s something worth peeling back , if you know what I ’m saying .
To sum this up :
When the Black nationalists say , ``He ’s just a black face on the same old white supremacy ” , I really think it ’s mechanical and ahistorical .
I think most people know better .
It ’s not the case .
It is a Black face on the same society — on US capitalist - imperialist society — but it also represents some sea changes in how that society treats , portrays and oppresses Black people .
And it may involve a certain acceptance of the assimilation of some strata of Black people , while intensifying the demonisation and hammering of those at the bottom .
The condition of Black people has been horrific in this country from its founding , heaping atrocities on African - descended people .
But there has never been anything we could call “ the same old white supremacy ” .
There ’s something very tired about this exactly because it does n’t understand the dynamism of this society .
And this has been , always , a very dynamic and changing system .
Conditions have always changed in leaps over this history .
From several different forms of slavery at the beginning , to sharecropping , to working - class conditions to permanent unemployment .
The oppression of African American people took the form of chains , then of segregation backed by lynching , now urban containment by police .
Similarly , the ideological justifications for it have changed a dozen times over 200 years .
And they ’re changing it again , you see .
And to just say , as the Black nationalists do , “ Well , it ’s just the same old thing ” , does n’t correspond with reality , and for that reason wo n’t get any serious hearing .
After all , these same Black nationalists said the same thing about Black mayors : `` These are just Black men who front for the white power structure . ”
It really does not understand the dynamics .
We need a revolutionary movement that does not see the events of today through the paradigms of the 1960s , that actually does n’t just cling to old verdicts , and that does n’t mechanically assume that this system is clinging to its own old verdicts .
Obama a pacifier ?
So , I think objectively , if you look at it this , the rise of Obama is a very important phenomenon .
It represents a major struggle within the ruling class over how to deal with both major international and major coming internal problems .
It is not mainly pacifying the resistance of the people — which is why he gives so little lip service to the struggle and demands of the most oppressed people .
Unfortunately , such resistance is not a permanent part of the political landscape ; unfortunately the oppressors do n’t always need to speak to radical challenges .
I would love to have a situation where the rulers need to produce a candidate to pacify the people ( like they did with McGovern in 1972 ) .
But I do n’t think that ’s what ’s going on right now .
And , looking at this question of Obama the “ pacifier ” from another side , I do n’t think that the outcome of this campaign is simply and inevitably the pacification of people .
It depends on how it turns out .
The US ruling class is very rough in its internal struggles .
It may rough Obama up badly .
I ’ve followed these campaigns closely , and you can get so far and it looks like this and this is going , and then they just slap some dude down and he ’s done .
They may slap him down and Black people with him .
And then it ’s in your face .
Sometimes political figures in this society are simply negated and removed from the scene — as George Wallace was in 1972 when he was getting in the way of Richard Nixon .
And such abrupt developments can really create an opening for a far more radical turn in things .
It ’s not simply , Obama is going to pacify people and we just have to ( somehow ) get people to not pay attention to these events .
We actually want people to look and see what ’s coming .
To learn from what is coming now .
As Mao said : “ To go through it and come out the other side . ”

< p>Researchers from Brown University and University of Victoria have determined that racial bias can be reduced by teaching people to differentiate facial features better in individuals of a different race .
The findings are part of a new study published Jan. 21 , 2009 , in < em > PLoS ONE , </ em > the online , peer - reviewed journal from the Public Library of Science . </ p>
PROVIDENCE , R.I. [ Brown University ] —
There may be a simple way to address racial bias :
Help people improve their ability to distinguish between faces of individuals of a different race .
Brown University and University of Victoria researchers learned this through a new measurement system and protocol they developed to train Caucasian subjects to recognize different African American faces .
Their efforts are summed up in “ Perceptual Other - Race Training Reduces Implicit Racial Bias , ” a study to be published Jan. 21 , 2009 , in PLoS ONE , the online , peer - reviewed journal from the Public Library of Science .
“ The idea is this that this sort of perceptual training gives you a new tool to address the kinds of biases people show unconsciously and may not even be aware they have , ” said Michael J. Tarr , a Brown cognitive neuroscientist and a senior author of the paper .
“ There is a strong connection between the way we perceive and categorize the world and the way we end up making stereotypes and generalizations about social entities . ”
Race and Face New research suggests that training people to recognize facial
The hope is that the researchers ’ training program could someday be used to train anyone who comes into contact with other races — police officers , social workers or immigration officials , said Tarr , the Sidney A. and Dorothea Doctors Fox Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and a professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences at Brown .
The research is the product of a wide collaboration .
Sophie Lebrecht , a third - year Ph.D student in the Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences and a member of Tarr ’s lab , is the study ’s lead author .
Jim Tanaka , a professor at the University of Victoria and Lara Pierce , a graduate student at McGill University , collaborated on the research .
Lebrecht was interested in the interaction of visual processing with other cognitive functions such as emotion or social processing .
She came up with the idea for the project with Tarr ’s encouragement .
Researchers used 20 Caucasian subjects for the overall study , which incorporated a measurement developed at Brown and dubbed the Affective Lexical Priming Score ( ALPS ) .
The ALPS measure is similar to , and builds on , a test developed at Harvard University known as the Implicit Association Test ( IAT ) , which helps to identify unconscious social biases .
The ALPS measurement involved first showing each subject a series of pictures of different races , such as African American and Caucasian faces .
All the faces were shown in black and white , so subjects would focus on facial features rather than skin color .
On each ALPS trial , each test subject was shown a picture of a face , which then disappeared .
The test subject then saw a word that could be real or nonsense — “ tree ” or “ malk , ” for example — and had to decide whether the word was a real word or nonsense word .
Real words could imply something positive or negative .
Lebrecht found that prior to training , subjects more quickly responded if the word was negative and followed an African - American face .
Subjects responded more slowly if the word was positive and followed an African - American face .
After using the ALPS to measure each subjects ’ implicit racial bias , the subjects took part in about 10 hours of facial recognition training .
Half learned to tell apart individual African - American faces and half learned simply to tell whether the faces were African - American or not .
The training worked on a number of levels .
Individual subjects improved their ability to tell the difference between separate Africa - American faces .
Those same subjects who improved that ability also showed the greatest reduction in their implicit racial bias as measured by the ALPS system .
Their positive associations with African - American faces increased and they had fewer negative associations with African - American faces .
While the researchers are not claiming they can eliminate racial bias , they suggest that teaching people to tell the difference better between individual faces of a different race is at least one way to help reduce that bias .
Lebrecht said that developing a system that teaches people to make those distinctions should be helpful in reducing generalizations based on social stereotypes .
“ If you give people the tools to start individuating , maybe they will make more individual ( rather than stereotypical ) attributions , ” she said .
Funding for the study came from the Perceptual Expertise Network , a collaborative award from the James S. McDonnell Foundation ; the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center at the University of California–San Diego ; the National Science Foundation , a National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada award ; and a Brown University National Eye Institute training grant ( the National Institutes of Health ) .
SEATTLE , Jan. 1 ( UPI ) --
One of the inventors of New Year 's
Eve novelty glasses with numbers for eyeholes said the 2009 version was the last to be produced by his Seattle company .
Richard Sclafani , who thought up the idea for the glasses with friend Peter Cicero in 1990 , said the idea took off and business peaked in the first double - zero year , 2000 , when half a million pairs of the glasses were sold , the New York Post reported Thursday .

Sclafani said his company is discontinuing the glasses for reasons including falling business due to competitors and the aesthetic challenges of making a pair of glasses for 2010 .
" It does n't look very good for 2010 .
You wind up with a ' 1 ' in front of one of your eyes , " Sclafani said .

Anti-RDBMS : A list of distributed key - value stores
Please Note : this was written January 2009 - see the comments for updates and additional information .
A lot has changed since I wrote this .
Perhaps you 're considering using a dedicated key - value or document store instead of a traditional relational database .
Reasons for this might include :
You 're suffering from Cloud - computing Mania .
You need an excuse to ' get your Erlang on '
You heard CouchDB was cool .
You hate MySQL , and although PostgreSQL is much better , it still does n't have decent replication .
There 's no chance you 're buying Oracle licenses .
Your data is stored and retrieved mainly by primary key , without complex joins .
You have a non-trivial amount of data , and the thought of managing lots of RDBMS shards and replication failure scenarios gives you the fear .
Whatever your reasons , there are a lot of options to chose from .
At Last .fm we do a lot of batch computation in Hadoop , then dump it out to other machines where it 's indexed and served up over HTTP and Thrift as an internal service ( stuff like ' most popular songs in London , UK this week ' etc ) .
Presently we 're using a home - grown index format which points into large files containing lots of data spanning many keys , similar to the Haystack approach mentioned in this article about Facebook photo storage .
It works , but rather than build our own replication and partitioning system on top of this , we are looking to potentially replace it with a distributed , resilient key - value store for reasons 4 , 5 and 6 above .
This article represents my notes and research to date on distributed key - value stores ( and some other stuff ) that might be suitable as RDBMS replacements under the right conditions .
I 'm expecting to try some of these out and investigate further in the coming months .
Glossary and Background Reading
The Shortlist
Here is a list of projects that could potentially replace a group of relational database shards .
Some of these are much more than key - value stores , and are n't suitable for low - latency data serving , but are interesting none - the - less .
Name Language Fault - tolerance Persistence Client Protocol Data model Docs Community Project Voldemort Java partitioned , replicated , read - repair Pluggable : BerkleyDB , Mysql Java API Structured / blob / text A Linkedin , no Ringo Erlang partitioned , replicated , immutable Custom on - disk ( append only log ) HTTP blob B Nokia , no Scalaris Erlang partitioned , replicated , paxos In- memory only Erlang , Java , HTTP blob B OnScale , no Kai Erlang partitioned , replicated ?
On - disk Dets file Memcached blob C no Dynomite Erlang partitioned , replicated Pluggable : couch , dets Custom ascii , Thrift blob D+ Powerset , no MemcacheDB C replication BerkleyDB Memcached blob B some ThruDB C++ Replication Pluggable : BerkleyDB , Custom , Mysql , S3 Thrift Document oriented C+ Third rail , unsure CouchDB Erlang Replication , partitioning ?
Custom on - disk HTTP , json Document oriented ( json ) A Apache , yes Cassandra Java Replication , partitioning Custom on - disk Thrift Bigtable meets Dynamo F Facebook , no HBase Java Replication , partitioning Custom on - disk Custom API , Thrift , Rest Bigtable A Apache , yes Hypertable C++ Replication , partitioning Custom on - disk Thrift , other Bigtable A Zvents , Baidu , yes
Why 5 of these are n't suitable
What I 'm really looking for is a low latency , replicated , distributed key - value store .
Something that scales well as you feed it more machines , and does n't require much setup or maintenance - it should just work .
The API should be that of a simple hashtable : set ( key , val ) , get ( key ) , delete ( key ) .
This would dispense with the hassle of managing a sharded / replicated database setup , and hopefully be capable of serving up data by primary key efficiently .
Five of the projects on the list are far from being simple key - value stores , and as such do n't meet the requirements - but they are definitely worth a mention .
Hadoop
We 're already heavy users of Hadoop , and have been experimenting with Hbase for a while .
It 's much more than a KV store , but latency is too great to serve data to the website .
We will probably use Hbase internally for other stuff though - we already have stacks of data in HDFS .
Hypertable
Hypertable provides a similar feature set to Hbase ( both are inspired by Google 's Bigtable ) .
They recently announced a new sponsor , Baidu - the biggest Chinese search engine .
Definitely one to watch , but does n't fit the low - latency KV store bill either .
Cassandra
Cassandra sounded very promising when the source was released by Facebook last year .
They use it for inbox search .
It 's Bigtable - esque , but uses a DHT so does n't need a central server ( one of the Cassandra developers previously worked at Amazon on Dynamo ) .
Unfortunately it 's languished in relative obscurity since release , because Facebook never really seemed interested in it as an open - source project .
From what I can tell there is n't much in the way of documentation or a community around the project at present .
CouchDB
CouchDB is an interesting one - it's a " distributed , fault - tolerant and schema - free document - oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP / JSON API " .
Data is stored in ' documents ' , which are essentially key - value maps themselves , using the data types you see in JSON .
Read the CouchDB Technical Overview if you are curious how the web 's trendiest document database works under the hood .
This article on the Rules of Database App Aging goes some way to explaining why document - oriented databases make sense .
CouchDB can do full text indexing of your documents , and lets you express views over your data in Javascript .
I could imagine using CouchDB to store lots of data on users : name , age , sex , address , IM name and lots of other fields , many of which could be null , and each site update adds or changes the available fields .
In situations like that it quickly gets unwieldly adding and changing columns in a database , and updating versions of your application code to match .
Although many people are using CouchDB in production , their FAQ points out they may still make backwards - incompatible changes to the storage format and API before version 1.0 .
ThruDB
ThruDB is a document storage and indexing system made up for four components : a document storage service , indexing service , message queue and proxy .
It uses Thrift for communication , and has a pluggable storage subsystem , including an Amazon S3 option .
It 's designed to scale well horizontally , and might be a better option that CouchDB if you are running on EC2 .
I 've heard a lot more about CouchDB than Thrudb recently , but it 's definitely worth a look if you need a document database .
It 's not suitable for our needs for the same reasons as CouchDB .
Distributed key - value stores
The rest are much closer to being ' simple ' key - value stores with low enough latency to be used for serving data used to build dynamic pages .
Latency will be dependent on the environment , and whether or not the dataset fits in memory .
If it does , I 'd expect sub - 10 ms response time , and if not , it all depends on how much money you spent on spinning rust .
MemcacheDB
Essentially just memcached that saves stuff to disk using a Berkeley database .
As useful as this may be for some situations , it does n't deal with replication and partitioning ( sharding ) , so it would still require a lot of work to make it scale horizontally and be tolerant of machine failure .
Other memcached derivatives such as repcached go some way to addressing this by giving you the ability to replicate entire memcache servers ( async master - slave setup ) , but without partitioning it 's still going to be a pain to manage .
Project Voldemort
Looks awesome .
Go and read the rather splendid website , which explains how it works , and includes pretty diagrams and a good description of how consistent hashing is used in the Design section .
( If consistent hashing butters your muffin , check out libketama - a consistent hashing library and the Erlang libketama driver ) .
Project - Voldemort handles replication and partitioning of data , and appears to be well written and designed .
It 's reassuring to read in the docs how easy it is to swap out and mock different components for testing .
It 's non-trivial to add nodes to a running cluster , but according to the mailing - list this is being worked on .
It sounds like this would fit the bill if we ran it with a Java load - balancer service ( see their Physical Architecture Options diagram ) that exposed a Thrift API so all our non-Java clients could use it .
Scalaris
Probably the most face - meltingly awesome thing you could build in Erlang .
CouchDB , Ejabberd and RabbitMQ are cool , but Scalaris packs by far the most impressive collection of sexy technologies .
Scalaris is a key - value store - it uses a modified version of the Chord algorithm to form a DHT , and stores the keys in lexicographical order , so range queries are possible .
Although I did n't see this explicitly mentioned , this should open up all sorts of interesting options for batch processing - map - reduce for example .
On top of the DHT they use an improved version of Paxos to guarantee ACID properties when dealing with multiple concurrent transactions .
So it 's a key - value store , but it can guarantee the ACID properties and do proper distributed transactions over multiple keys .
Oh , and to demonstrate how you can scale a webservice based on such a system , the Scalaris folk implemented their own version of Wikipedia on Scalaris , loaded in the Wikipedia data , and benchmarked their setup to prove it can do more transactions / sec on equal hardware than the classic PHP / MySQL combo that Wikipedia use .
Yikes .
From what I can tell , Scalaris is only memory - resident at the moment and does n't persist data to disk .
This makes it entirely impractical to actually run a service like Wikipedia on Scalaris for real - but it sounds like they tackled the hard problems first , and persisting to disk should be a walk in the park after you rolled your own version of Chord and made Paxos your bitch .
Take a look at this presentation about Scalaris from the Erlang Exchange conference : Scalaris presentation video
The Rest
The reminaing projects , Dynomite , Ringo and Ka are all , more or less , trying to be Dynamo .
Of the three , Ringo looks to be the most specialist - it makes a distinction between small ( less than 4KB ) and medium - size data items ( < 100 MB ) .
Medium sized items are stored in individual files , whereas small items are all stored in an append - log , the index of which is read into memory at startup .
From what I can tell , Ringo can be used in conjunction with the Erlang map - reduce framework Nokia are working on called Disco .
I did n't find out much about Kai other than it 's rather new , and some mentions in Japanese .
You can chose either Erlang ets or dets as the storage system ( memory or disk , respectively ) , and it uses the memcached protocol , so it will already have client libraries in many languages .
Dynomite does n't have great documentation , but it seems to be more capable than Kai , and is under active development .
It has pluggable backends including the storage mechanism from CouchDB , so the 2GB file limit in dets wo n't be an issue .
Also I heard that Powerset are using it , so that 's encouraging .
Summary
Scalaris is fascinating , and I hope I can find the time to experiment more with it , but it needs to save stuff to disk before it'd be useful for the kind of things we might use it for at Last.fm .
I 'm keeping an eye on Dynomite - hopefully more information will surface about what Powerset are doing with it , and how it performs at a large scale .
Based on my research so far , Project - Voldemort looks like the most suitable for our needs .
I 'd love to hear more about how it 's used at Linked In , and how many nodes they are running it on .
What else is there ?
Here are some other related projects :
Hazelcast - Java DHT / clustering library
nmdb - a network database ( dbm- style )
Open Chord - Java DHT
If you know of anything I 've missed off the list , or have any feedback / suggestions , please post a comment .
I 'm especially interested in hearing about people who 've tested or are using KV - stores in lieu of relational databases .
UPDATE 1 : Corrected table : memcachedb does replication , as per BerkeleyDB .
The impact of the shrinking market could be felt for years to come , as automakers will continue to cut production and employment , and reduce the number of new vehicles they bring to the market .
“ With these declines in revenues , you will see research and development budgets cut , ” said Jesse Toprak , chief auto analyst for Edmunds.com , a Web site that offers car - buying advice .
“ We are going to have fewer new vehicles and less variety for at least the next couple of years . ”
Mr. Toprak is forecasting sales of 12.4 million vehicles this year and 13.5 million in 2010 .
He said the chances of the industry reaching annual sales of 16 million were slim for the foreseeable future .
“ The question is , What will be the natural level of demand in the U.S. market when the economy recovers ? ” he said .
“ Based on our best guess , it is probably in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million . ”
Auto executives said on Monday that the industry had little chance of improving in the first half of 2009 because of a continued lack of available credit for prospective car buyers and a profound lack of confidence in an overall economic recovery .
“ The first quarter is going to be bad no matter how you look at it , ” said Emily Kolinski Morris , a senior Ford economist .
“ Once we get into the second quarter , we ’ll have a better idea . ”
G.M. ’s chief market analyst , Michael C. DiGiovanni , said the automaker was predicting industry sales of 10.5 million to 12 million vehicles for the year .
We 've already detailed the advanced advertising techniques being used to turn us into a society of shambling Baconator - craving zombies , but the manipulation certainly does n't end once they 've got you into the building ...
The economy is in the proverbial pooper and many are trying to cut back , but unfortunately , there 's a reason you came back with a new hi-def TV and 10 - gallons of discount mayonnaise last time you went to buy bread .
The retailers have gotten very good at what they do .

There few things more easy and profitable ( and fun ) than scamming drunks , so it comes as no surprise that bars have their own list of ploys .
Let 's look at a few of the ways you 're getting cockslapped along with your cocktail .
Less Socializing , More Drinking
Every time you use your mouth for frivolous non-drinking related activities like talking , you 're costing the bar money .
So they try their hardest to make sure your interactions remain at the basic head nodding and pointing out hot girls level .
Music is pumped up to ear splitting level , making conversation impossible and lights are kept dim , partly to disguise how dirty most bars are , but also because we feel uncomfortable talking to someone we can't see clearly .

Your " Friend " the Bartender
There are many ways to cut down on the amount of precious alcohol actually getting into your glass .
Taller , thinner shot glasses appear larger but actually contain less volume and , in fact , simply tilting the glass toward the customer slightly while pouring creates an optical illusion making you think you 're getting more than you are .
Measuring cups may have washers in the bottom ensuring you do n't get a full double , and narrow pourers are used on bottles ensuring a 3 - second pour gives you less booze than you might expect .
Oh , and in perhaps the most diabolical trick , fruity girl drinks may have the rim of the glass coated or straw filled with alcohol with little to none in the drink itself .
Come on bartenders , if you 're not there to get girls sloppy on oversized pink beverages what exactly are you there for ?

An even bigger dickhead than you thought .
Of course , as the night wears on the need for such intricate schemes melts away .
That 's when bartenders start charging whatever the hell they want on a person - by - person basis , using the " would I like to bone them ? " scale .
Also , never offer to pay for your group 's drinks as most bartenders assume anyone generous ( and dense ) enough to do such a thing wo n't mind them adding a dozen or so extra drinks to the tab .
It 's Friday .
You are the office , watching another Powerpoint by Jimmy , the product development bozo .

Now my question is :
Is it really this way ?
Because one of the most delightful , smartest , and sexiest woman I 've ever met was drunk after three hours in a bar drinking beer with orange slices in it , while that night I was drunk with cocktails and my drinks matched my shoes .
And I pee sitting down .
At least at home , because it 's more comfy , but that 's another story .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Users of Alli , the first weight - loss drug approved for sale over - the - counter in the United States , are finding what they likely suspected all along : pills are no magic substitute for diet and exercise .
Two audience members watch the 2007 " Farm Aid " concert in New York in this September 9 , 2007 file photo .
About two - thirds of American adults are overweight or obese , putting them at an increased risk for diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , osteoarthritis , stroke , gallbladder disease , sleep apnea and respiratory problems and even some cancers .
The direct and indirect costs of obesity is $ 117 billion each year , according to a 2000 report by the U.S. Surgeon General .

Yet as Americans engage in the New Year ’s tradition of resolving to shed pounds , the market for diet aids is expected to remain firm , even as the economy is mired in recession .
Americans spend $ 30 billion a year on weight - loss products and services , and two - thirds of the population is overweight or obese .
GlaxoSmithKline ’s Alli , a lower - strength version of Roche ’s prescription - only Xenical , created ’ a stir when it was approved 18 months ago .
Since then , it has become known for its unpleasant side effects , including incontinence , diarrhea and flatulence with “ oily spotting . ”
“ It works to inhibit absorption of fat from our diet .
Therefore the fat comes out in the stool , causing diarrhea , which patients do n’t like much , ” said Shirley TerMolen , a Chicago internist .
Because the side effects result from eating too much fat , TerMolen noted that some of her colleagues use the drug to help patients modify their behavior .
TerMolen said she has prescribed the drug but has not seen a lot of success .
“ For most people , they ’re just looking for a shortcut instead of just eating better and exercising , ” she said .
Donald Hensrud , a weight management specialist at Mayo Clinic , called the gastrointestinal side effects overstated .
But , he added , the intended effect “ is also overrated . ”
“ People who took the drug lost only 4 more pounds ( 1.8 kg ) than the placebo group after a year .
People have to ask themselves whether the expense of this medicine is worth a few extra pounds , ” Hensrud said .
A 30 - day supply of Alli costs $ 60 .
People who took Xenical , the prescription strength version , lost an average of 5 to 7 additional pounds ( 2.2 to 3.2 kg ) after a year compared with those who took a placebo .
Still , experts say weight loss of 5 percent to 10 percent is a worthy goal and a point where health improves .
Meanwhile , Alastair Wood , who chaired the Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that reviewed Alli in 2006 , said he ’s not convinced the drug is being used by the people who would benefit most .
In some cases , it is abused by people with eating disorders , he said .
“ It ’s a juxtaposition of an epidemic of obesity with the hope and expectation that we can treat it pharmaceutically , ” said Wood .
Glaxo stresses
Alli is not a “ miracle pill ” and that patients should adhere to a low - calorie , low - fat diet and engage in regular exercise .
Roger Scarlett - Smith , the company ’s president of consumer healthcare in North America , said 5 million people have tried it so far and he expects that number to ramp up in the first quarter , a strong season for weight - loss products .
It was approved for over - the - counter sale in Europe this week .
DISAPPOINTMENT
The history of weight - loss drugs has been fraught with disappointments .
One of the most high - profile was Fen - phen , a cocktail of fenfluramine and phentermine , which was taken off the market in 1997 after it was linked to valvular disease .
Also in 1997 , the FDA approved Abbott Laboratories ’ Meridia , or sibutramine , which blocks chemicals in the brain involved in regulating appetite .
The drug was linked to hypertension .
Sanofi-Aventis sells Acomplia , or rimonabant , in Europe , but not in the United States .
FDA rejected it in 2007 on concerns it causes neurological and psychiatric problems .
There are few promising treatments in the pipeline at a time when obesity is emerging as one of the biggest health crises facing the developed world .
Earlier this month , Orexigen Therapeutics unveiled results from a late - stage trial of its experimental drug Contrave , which fell short of the bar set by U.S. regulators .
Another candidate is Arena Pharmaceuticals ’ lorcaserin .
A mid-stage trail showed the drug fared well in helping patients lose weight .
Late - stage results are due in March .
Pfizer , one of several drug makers to drop development of a weight - loss drug from a once promising class that was found to cause psychiatric side effects , said it continues to pursue obesity treatments .
“ Some of the late - stage products ... not just Pfizer ’s pipeline but several other companies ’ pipelines , have not been successful , ” Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler told the Reuters Health Summit in November .
“ It involves so many different aspects .
It ’s not just the biological and potentially hereditary issues , but there are behavioral and cultural issues associated with that .
From a medical point of view , it is a tough nut to crack . ”
Merck &
Co said it too was putting major resources into combating obesity after halting development of a drug that works on the same part of the brain that makes people hungry after smoking marijuana .
New treatments are years away .
In the meantime , consumers will likely continue to buy what ’s out there .
“ I think ( Alli ) will probably be around for a long time to come .
It ’s a smart drug more from a marketing standpoint than from a clinical efficacy standpoint , ” Mayo ’s Hensrud said .
“ This is a multibillion - dollar industry . ”
The plant in Georgia that produced peanut butter tainted by salmonella has a history of sanitation lapses and was cited repeatedly in 2006 and 2007 for having dirty surfaces and grease residue and dirt buildup throughout the plant , according to health inspection reports .
Inspection reports from 2008 found the plant repeatedly in violation of cleanliness standards .
Inspections of the plant in Blakely , Ga. , by the State Agriculture Department found areas of rust that could flake into food , gaps in warehouse doors large enough for rodents to get through , unmarked spray bottles and containers and numerous violations of other practices designed to prevent food contamination .
The plant , owned by the Peanut Corporation of America of Lynchburg , Va. , has been shut down .
A typical entry from an inspection report , dated Aug. 23 , 2007 , said : “ The food - contact surfaces of re-work kettle in the butter room department were not properly cleaned and sanitized . ”
Additional entries noted : “ The food - contact surfaces of the bulk oil roast transfer belt ” in a particular room “ were not properly cleaned and sanitized .
The food - contact surfaces of pan without wheels in the blanching department were not properly cleaned and sanitized . ”

A code violation in the same report observed “ clean peanut butter buckets stored uncovered , ” while another cited a “ wiping cloth ” to “ cover crack on surge bin . ”
Tests on samples gathered on the day of that inspection were negative for salmonella .

The return of hard liquor was not just celebrated in taverns on Dec. 5 1933 , when the 21st Amendment was passed to officially repeal Prohibition .
Here , people lined up to purchase bottles at the Old Rose Distillery Co. for home parties .
Suddenly , everything old is New Deal again .
Reagan is out ; F.D.R. is in .
Still , how much guidance does the Roosevelt era really offer for today ’s world ?
The answer is , a lot .
But Barack Obama should learn from F.D.R. ’s failures as well as from his achievements : the truth is that the New Deal was n’t as successful in the short run as it was in the long run .
And the reason for F.D.R. ’s limited short - run success , which almost undid his whole program , was the fact that his economic policies were too cautious .
About the New Deal ’s long - run achievements : the institutions F.D.R. built have proved both durable and essential .
Indeed , those institutions remain the bedrock of our nation ’s economic stability .
Imagine how much worse the financial crisis would be if the New Deal had n’t insured most bank deposits .
Imagine how insecure older Americans would feel right now if Republicans had managed to dismantle Social Security .
Can Mr. Obama achieve something comparable ?
Rahm Emanuel , Mr. Obama ’s new chief of staff , has declared that “ you do n’t ever want a crisis to go to waste . ”
Progressives hope that the Obama administration , like the New Deal , will respond to the current economic and financial crisis by creating institutions , especially a universal health care system , that will change the shape of American society for generations to come .

Hanna Rosin :
This is the word that stood out for me in Obama 's list of values yesterday : " hard work and honesty , courage and fair play , tolerance and curiosity , loyalty and patriotism . "
The rest have echoes in traditional and more safe political dialogue .
But curiosity has a different sort of resonance .
Curiosity is what led his mother on the many of what must have seemed like reckless adventures , that eventually created the motley family he has today .
For a post - PC age , curiosity is a much better word than tolerance with its implications of holding your nose .
Her colleague Jessica Grose ( like Andrew ) plucked " non-believers " from the usual rhetoric :
There 's been much talk of Obama 's ushering in a " post- racial " America , but will he also be welcoming a post- religion America ?
Doubtful , but at least it 's a step in the right direction .
It 's just one anecdote , but : I stood with mostly African - Americans during the speech and the only time I ever heard booing of Obama , from many directions , was his shout - out to " non-believers . "

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has been fined $ 25,000 for walking onto the court and yelling at Nuggets guard J.R. Smith at halftime during Tuesday night 's game in Denver and for actions afterward , the league announced Friday .
Cuban took offense Tuesday when Smith threw an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward Antoine Wright late in the first half .
Cuban said Wright could have been severely injured and that he was going to ask the league to suspend Smith .
The NBA said Thursday Smith would not face discipline for the incident .
Cuban responded to the fine Friday with a tongue - in - cheek post on his blog , blogmaverick.com .
" The NBA tells me a tech should have been called on you for throwing the elbow and that I should pay a 25 k dollar fine because owners are n't supposed to get mad .
Ever , " Cuban states in the blog post , which is written as a letter and begins with " Dear JR . "
Nuggets coach George Karl has said he was OK with Cuban 's stance but took exception to him calling out a player from an opposing team .
Part of the fine also stemmed from Cuban 's language toward an official as he exited the court after the Mavs ' 99 - 97 loss at the Pepsi Center -- something Cuban has denied .
Cuban could be seen mouthing an obscenity shortly after Chauncey Billups made two free throws with 2.2 seconds left for the game - winning points following a highly questionable foul call against Jason Terry .
" In the spirit of the joy of my getting fined and your not getting the tech , have the Nuggets PR folks contact the Mavs PR folks and I will donate 25 k to the charity of your choice , " Cuban writes in his blog , presumably to Smith .
" Unless of course your coach thinks [ that 's ] the wrong thing to do , or the NBA says I can't because it would be a violation of a rule .
In which case , I will find a charity that I think you would like and make the donation in your name . "
The post ends with " bff m " -- short for " best friends forever , Mark . "
The penalty Friday was the 14th the league has announced against Cuban , who has been penalized about $ 1.5 million over the years and suspended from three games .
Information from ESPN.com 's Chris Sheridan and The Associated Press was used in this report .

The ram statues symbolise the powerful god Amun
Three ancient statues , engraved with a little - understood sub-Saharan language , have been unearthed in Sudan .
The ram statues symbolise the god Amun , and include the first discovery of a complete royal dedication in Meroitic script , only found before in fragments .
It is the oldest written sub-Saharan language and dates from the Meroe period of 300 BC to AD450 .
Archaeologist Vincent Rondot said it was " an important discovery " , but the inscriptions were hard to interpret .
The statues were discovered three weeks ago at el - Hassa , a site close to Sudan 's 50 - odd Meroe pyramids , about 200 km ( 120 miles ) north of the capital Khartoum .
Mr Rondot said : " It is one of the last antique languages that we still do n't understand .
" We can read it .
We have no problem pronouncing the letters .
But we can't understand it , apart from a few long words and the names of people . "
Experts are working on deciphering the inscriptions , using previously found fragments .
" It is absolutely essential to understand it ...
We only need to read the last words remaining on the inscription , " Mr Rondot , was quoted as saying by news agency AFP .
The dig , funded by the French foreign ministry , is also providing more information on the reign of a little - known king , Amanakhareqerem , mentioned in the inscriptions on the rams .
" Before we started the dig we only had four documents in his name .
We do n't even know where he was buried , " he said .
" We are beginning to understand the importance of that king , " he said , according to Reuters news agency .

Traffic lights call by resident in Camlik
RESIDENTS have called for traffic lights on some junctions in Camlik distriuct due to a number of rising accidents and near misses .
One resident commented : “ Since there is no traffic lights , pedestrians that use these junctions are under constant risk of traffic accidents while crossing , and a car can strike them at any moment .
“ To ensure the necessary alignment and security in areas where vehicle traffic is intertwined with each other or with pedestrian traffic , there should be some kind of electronic and light signals .
“ If there is no traffic signaling system , there are going to be traffic accidents .
And traffic accidents are increasing .
He added : “ The aim of the traffic laws and regulations is to ensure the safety of life and property of those who are in traffic .
“ However , necessary precautions should be taken in the main arterial areas where there is heavy traffic and especially at intersections .
Otherwise people and vehicles were abandoned to fate . ”
48 members of the Samouni family were killed in one day when Israel 's battle with Hamas suddenly centred on their homes
Helmi Samouni knelt yesterday on the floor of the bedroom he once shared with his wife and their five - month old son , scraping his fingers through a thick layer of ash and broken glass looking for mementoes of their life together .
" I found a ring .
I might find more , " he said .
His wife Maha and their child Muhammad were killed in the second week of Israel 's 22 - day war in Gaza when they were shelled by Israeli forces as they took shelter nearby along with dozens of relatives .
In total 48 people from one family are now known to have died that Monday morning , 5 January , in Zeitoun , on the southern outskirts of Gaza City .
Of all the horrors visited on the civilians of Gaza in this war the fate of the Samounis , a family of farmers who lived close together in simple breeze - block homes , was perhaps the gravest .
Around a dozen homes in this small area were destroyed , no more than piles of rubble in the sand yesterday .
Helmi Samouni's two - storey house was one of the few left standing , despite the gaping hole from a large tank shell that pierced his blackened bedroom wall .
During the invasion it had been taken over by Israeli soldiers , who wrecked the furniture and set up sand - bagged shooting positions throughout .
They left behind their own unique detritus : bullet casings , roasted peanuts in tins with Hebrew script , a plastic bag containing a " High Quality Body Warmer " , dozens of olive - green waste disposal bags , some empty , some stinking full - the troops ' portable toilets .
But most disturbing of all was the graffiti they daubed on the walls of the ground floor .
Some was in Hebrew , but much was naively written in English : " Arabs need 2 die " , " Die you all " , " Make war not peace " , " 1 is down , 999,999 to go " , and scrawled on an image of a gravestone the words : " Arabs 1948 - 2009 " .
There were several sketches of the Star of David flag .
" Gaza here we are , " it said in English next to one .
Helmi's brother Salah , 30 , had an apartment in the same house .
He too was pulling out what he could , including an Israeli work permit once issued to his father .
" They gave him a permit and then they came from Israel and they killed him , " said Salah .
In the attack he lost both his parents , Talal and Rahma , and his two - year - old daughter Aza .
During the war , Israel banned journalists from entering Gaza .
But the accounts of Salah and his neighbours outside the rubble of their homes yesterday corroborate the accounts from witnesses given in the days after the attack , accounts which led the UN to describe the killings at Zeitoun as one of the gravest episodes of the war and the Red Cross to call it , in a rare public rebuke , " a shocking incident " .
More than a dozen bodies were pulled from the rubble on Sunday , and one more yesterday , bringing the Samouni death toll to 48 , according to Dr Mouawia Hassanein , head of Gaza 's Emergency Medical Services .
With more bodies being recovered each day , the death toll from Israel 's three - week war now stands at 1,360 .
On the Israeli side , 13 were killed .
On the second Saturday of the war , after a week of Israeli air strikes , there came a wave of heavy artillery shelling which preceded the ground invasion of Gaza .
That night , Salah Samouni took shelter on the ground floor with 16 others from his family .
By the next morning , Sunday 4 January , more neighbours had come looking for shelter and the number now there was approaching 50 .
" They fired a shell into the upstairs floor and it started a fire , " said Salah .
" We called the ambulance and the fire service , but no one was able to reach us . "
Soon a group of Israeli soldiers approached .
" They came and banged on the door and told everyone to leave the house , " he said .
They walked a few metres down the dirt road and entered the large , single - storey home of Wa'el Samouni .
There they stayed for the rest of the day , now a group of around 100 men , women and children , with no food and little water .
Though there may have been Palestinian fighters operating in the open fields around the houses , all the witnesses are adamant that those gathered in Wa'el Samouni 's house were all civilians and all from the same extended family .
On the Monday morning , four of the men - Salah among them - decided to go out to bring back firewood for cooking .
" They fired a shell straight at us , " Salah said .
Two of the four were killed instantly , the other two were injured .
Salah was hit by shrapnel on his forehead , his back and his legs .
Moments later , he said , two more shells struck the house , killing dozens of them .
Salah and a group of around 70 fled the house , shouting to the soldiers that there were women and children with them .
They ran to the main road and on for a kilometre until ambulances could reach them .
Others stayed behind .
Wa'el Samouni 's father , Faris , 59 , lived next door to the house where the crowd had taken shelter .
He had a single - storey house with only a corrugated iron roof and so his family had moved next door to shelter , but he had stayed behind .
He was unable to leave his building for fear of being shot , but on the Tuesday the survivors called to him to bring water .
He ran quickly the short distance and joined them .
" Dead bodies were lying on the ground .
Some people were injured , they were just trying to help each other , " he said .
There among the dead Faris found his wife Rizka , 50 ; his daughter - in - law Anan ; and his granddaughter Huda , 16 .
Only on the afternoon of the following day , the Wednesday , were the survivors rescued when the Red Cross arrived to carry them out to hospital .
The Israeli military has said it is investigating what happened at Zeitoun .
It has repeatedly denied that its troops ordered the residents to gather in one house and said its troops do not intentionally target civilians .
Others in the family saw a different but equally grim fate .
Faraj Samouni , 22 , lived with his family next door to Helmi and Salah .
Again on the Saturday evening the family had sought shelter from the heavy shelling , a group of 18 of them gathering in one room for the night .
On the Sunday morning the Israeli soldiers approached .
" They shouted for the owner of the house to come out .
My father opened the door and went out and they shot him right there , " said Faraj .
With the body of his father Atiya , 45 , slumped on the ground outside , the soldiers fired more shots into the room , he said , this time killing Faraj 's younger half - brother Ahmad , who was four years old , and the child 's mother .
Yesterday there was blood on the wall of the small room where the child had been sitting .
Then the troops ordered them to lie on the floor .
But when a fire started burning in the room next door , sending in acrid smoke , they began shouting to be allowed out .
" We were shouting ' babies , children ' , " Faraj said .
Eventually the soldiers let them out and they ran along the street , passing the others who had gathered in Wa'el Samouni 's house and making their way out on to the main road and to safety .
When Faraj returned , he found his home completely destroyed , a pile of twisted iron bars and concrete .
On a small outdoor grill were the charred remains of the eight aubergines that the family had been cooking that Sunday morning for their breakfast .
Only on Sunday was he able to bury his father 's body and even then there was a final injustice : Gaza 's graves are now so crowded and concrete so scarce because of Israel 's long blockade that he had to break open an older family grave and put his father in with the other corpse .
" How can we have peace when they are killing civilians , even children ? " said Faraj .
" I support the ceasefire now .
We have no power .
If there was n't a ceasefire we could n't even bury our dead . "
Some Gazans speak privately of their anger at Hamas , blaming the Islamist movement that rules the small territory for dragging them into this conflict .
But by far the larger majority are speaking now of their bitter anger at Israel and their deep resentment at the apathy of the Arab world and the rest of the international community , which failed to halt the destruction and the killing .
" We blame everyone , " said Ibrahim Samouni , 45 , who lost his wife and four of his sons in the killings at Zeitoun .
" We need everyone to look at us and see what has happened here .
We are not resistance fighters .
We are ordinary people . "
NEW CASTLE — Josie Cutts has always enjoyed doing things with her mom , Nina , but said she never dreamed they would jump together into the frigid waters of the Atlantic Ocean Saturday along with 25 other hearty souls .
For Nina Cutts , it would be her fourth year of jumping into the frigid waters to help the Portsmouth Rotary Club raise money for several local nonprofit groups and high school scholarships .
There was only one way Nina and Josie would be able to fulfill the mother / daughter partnership .
The Kittery Point , Maine , women held hands as they ran from the beach at New Castle 's Town Common into the ocean and quickly ran back out .
" It was beyond freezing , " said Josie Cutts after she changed into some warm , dry clothes and warmed up inside the rotary club 's warming tent .
" It was really fun , really fun .
We screamed a lot . "
The rotary club staged its sixth annual Polar Bear Swim event Saturday afternoon to raise money for a variety of local nonprofit groups and college scholarships for Portsmouth High School students , according to Jamie DeStefano , the rotary 's president - elect .
Deb Rourke , the event 's chairwoman , said each adult swimmer has to contributed $ 250 each in sponsorships to participate .
She said each child age 12 to 18 has to contribute $ 100 in sponsorship money , and each member of the rotary 's Interact group at Portsmouth High School is allowed to contribute whatever money they can raise to swim .
Peter Billup of Eliot , Maine , the former chairwoman of the event , said the swim has raised a total of $ 40,000 over the past five years .
He said an average of 25 to 30 people swim in the frigid ocean water each year and tend to raise between $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 each year .
Billup said he is concerned the event might not raise as much money this year because of the struggling economy .
But there was no shortage of excitement and enthusiasm from those who showed up .
Karen Wendell , the rotary 's past president , and DeStefano were part of a group of rotarians and community members from Dover who dressed up as swashbuckling pirates and rode around the common on a pick - up truck decorated as a pirate ship .
Last year , Wendell said the group sported a Lara Croft Tomb Raider theme .
Swimmers young and old arrived in full force on the cold beach before 1 p.m. and stripped down to just bathing suits in some cases or to sweat pants and T - shirts .
Mark Dooley , New Castle 's deputy fire chief , said the department had three EMTs and three divers in the water along with four other firefighters standing by with a fire - rescue ambulance if any swimmer needed medical attention .
Dooley said the air temperature was a cool 24 degrees and the water temperature was 40 degrees when the group of swimmers ran into the ocean for their plunge .
Dooley said as long as the swimmers did n't remain in the water or in their wet clothes too long after leaving the water , they would avoid hypothermia .
The swimmers quickly made their way to a warming tent equipped with two gas heaters where they enjoyed steaming hot bowls of chili and clam chowder along with warm beverages .
" It 's the worst on your feet , " said one female swimmer as she ran toward the warming tent .
Wendell , who completed her fifth annual plunge , said , " It was cold .
It was really , really cold . "
Josie Cutts agreed that running out of the water was more difficult than jumping into the freezing water .
" When you ran up the beach , it was really awful , " said Josie Cutts , adding " It was definitely worth it . "
When asked what it takes to work up the courage to jump into such freezing cold water , Billup said it is quite simple .
" You can't think about it too much .
You just do it .
It 's cold .
It 's a real shock to your system .
Once you 're out of the water and you 're wrapped in a blanket and you 're having chowder and chili , you feel like you 've accomplished something , " he said .
However , the picture has changed significantly since then , and in the first three months of this year the withdrawal figure fell to £ 5.2 billion as mortgage costs increased and borrowers grew concerned about house prices .
At that point , money from housing withdrawals represented 2.5 per cent of post - tax income , a figure which fell to - 2.4 per cent in the third quarter .

Last week , President - elect Barack Obama said he was open to " good ideas " from anyone , even from the New York Times ' Paul Krugman .
( Video here . )
" If Paul Krugman has a good idea ... then we 're gonna do it , " said Obama .
He was speaking about " good ideas " for his economic stimulus package at the time , but we 'd written that we hoped the sentiments might extend to good ideas on any important issue that his administration might face , including some good ideas of our own that we'd offered to his transition team , who had consulted with us , as they are working on review of the dreadfully - failed U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) .
Well , as it turns out , the New York Times ' Paul Krugman does have some very good ideas , as noted in an op - ed yesterday , this time on why the Obama administration must bring accountability for the crimes of the Bush Era .
The must - read column , headlined " Forgive and Forget ? " begins this way ...
Last Sunday President - elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an investigation of possible crimes by the Bush administration .
" I do n't believe that anybody is above the law , " he responded , but " we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards . "
I 'm sorry , but if we do n't have an inquest into what happened during the Bush years - and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama 's remarks to mean that we wo n't - this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law because they do n't face any consequences if they abuse their power .
Let 's be clear what we 're talking about here .
It 's not just torture and illegal wiretapping , whose perpetrators claim , however implausibly , that they were patriots acting to defend the nation 's security .
The fact is that the Bush administration 's abuses extended from environmental policy to voting rights .
And most of the abuses involved using the power of government to reward political friends and punish political enemies .
Krugman goes on to detail , among other things , the bastardization and politicization of the Bush DoJ's Civil Rights division , as we detailed , most recently , earlier this week following the DoJ Inspector General 's stunning report on Bush tool Bradley Schlozman 's violations of federal law in hiring practices at the Department and his subsequent lies to Congress about them .
Attorney General nominee Eric Holder said , during confirmation hearings this week , that he'd review the Bush US Attorney 's decision to not prosecute Schlozman for breaking the law and lying about it to Congress , and then later added , further encouragingly , that he believed waterboarding was torture , and that torture was illegal .
Thus , our friend David Swanson argued , he was now " locked in " to prosecution of those Bush crimes .
Krugman notes in his op - ed that " at least six important government agencies experienced major scandals over the past eight years - in most cases , scandals that were never properly investigated .
And then there was the biggest scandal of all : Does anyone seriously doubt that the Bush administration deliberately misled the nation into invading Iraq ? "
Finally then , Krugman gets to the heart of his argument : that , in fact , Obama does n't have the right to not invesigate and hold the former administration accountable , if he is to keep his oath of office .
The entire last section of his column is worth quoting ( and reading ! ) :
Why , then , should n't we have an official inquiry into abuses during the Bush years ?
One answer you hear is that pursuing the truth would be divisive , that it would exacerbate partisanship .
But if partisanship is so terrible , should n't there be some penalty for the Bush administration 's politicization of every aspect of government ?
Alternatively , we 're told that we do n't have to dwell on past abuses , because we wo n't repeat them .
But no important figure in the Bush administration , or among that administration 's political allies , has expressed remorse for breaking the law .
What makes anyone think that they or their political heirs wo n't do it all over again , given the chance ?
In fact , we 've already seen this movie .
During the Reagan years , the Iran - contra conspirators violated the Constitution in the name of national security .
But the first President Bush pardoned the major malefactors , and when the White House finally changed hands the political and media establishment gave Bill Clinton the same advice it 's giving Mr. Obama : let sleeping scandals lie .
Sure enough , the second Bush administration picked up right where the Iran - contra conspirators left off - which is n't too surprising when you bear in mind that Mr. Bush actually hired some of those conspirators .
Now , it 's true that a serious investigation of Bush - era abuses would make Washington an uncomfortable place , both for those who abused power and those who acted as their enablers or apologists .
And these people have a lot of friends .
But the price of protecting their comfort would be high :
If we whitewash the abuses of the past eight years , we 'll guarantee that they will happen again .
Meanwhile , about Mr. Obama : while it 's probably in his short - term political interests to forgive and forget , next week he 's going to swear to " preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . "
That 's not a conditional oath to be honored only when it 's convenient .
And to protect and defend the Constitution , a president must do more than obey the Constitution himself ; he must hold those who violate the Constitution accountable .
So Mr. Obama should reconsider his apparent decision to let the previous administration get away with crime .
Consequences aside , that 's not a decision he has the right to make .
Hear , hear .

It is now the ultimate status symbol in a town obsessed by status .
Mr. Obama was spotted last week trying out his new BlackBerry  or actually a more sophisticated , encrypted variation  and aides say that he uses a computer in the study next to the Oval Office but that he has agreed to limit the number of people he would exchange e-mail with .
In the process , he created a new measure for Washington to judge who really has the ear , or the thumb , of the president .
For decades , the capital scoured state dinner invitation lists and Camp David visitor logs for clues to who was in and who was out .
Former President Bill Clinton established a new class of insider with his Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers , although those usually came with an implicit price tag as he tried to raise campaign money .
Former President George W. Bush provided fewer opportunities for the elite to demonstrate their eliteness by virtually abandoning state dinners , but there were invitations to his Texas ranch to clear brush , a dubious distinction , perhaps , during 100 - degree Crawford summers .
Now there is President Obama ’s e-mail , the first used by a commander in chief while in office .
“ This is the 21st - century version of the same special access that certain people are always granted to the president , ” said Joel P. Johnson , a senior White House adviser under Mr. Clinton .
“ In F.D.R. ’s White House , it was Harry Hopkins and Harold Ickes .
There will be a similar select few in this White House . ”
Those select few who have Mr. Obama ’s e-mail address , say people informed about the matter , include Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff ; David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett , both senior advisers ; and Robert Gibbs , the press secretary .
But cabinet members like the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , said they did not have it .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is a frequent BlackBerry user , but a spokesman said he did not know whether she had the president ’s address .
Trusting shopkeeper keeps store open on day off ... and leaves customers a note and honesty box
Shopkeeper Tom Algie faced a dilemma over Christmas - how to give himself and his three staff time off but without letting down his customers .
So he came up with a solution to suit everyone : leaving the hardware store open with an honesty box .
He left a note telling shoppers who came in on Boxing Day to serve themselves and then leave their payment in the box he had rigged up .
Perhaps astonishingly , his plan worked .
Trusting shopkeeper Tom Algie wanted a day off and left his DIY store open with a note and honesty box - and returned to find £ 187 inside
When Mr Algie , 47 , returned at 4.15 pm to close up , he was delighted to find the shop in Settle , North Yorkshire , had taken £ 187.66 - and two euros .
The father of two said : ' I did n't think twice about leaving the shop open .
Settle is a lovely quiet rural town and there 's never any trouble here .
I put my faith in my customers and I was n't disappointed .
' It was a spur - of - the - moment decision .
I just wanted to spend the holidays with my family but thought it would be quite nice to open up the shop . '
As well as the cash , Mr Algie also found some notes of thanks .
One read : ' Thanks Tom .
This is why we moved to Settle .
This shop would have been cleaned out in two - and - a - half minutes in Bolton . '
Some of the comments left by grateful - and honest - shoppers
Another said : ' I 've just come from the centre of Manchester .
I forgot just how lovely Settle is .
This has made my day . '
The honesty box - which he dubbed his newest member of staff - was made out of a funnel and plastic cereal box , and put behind the counter at his shop Practically Everything .
His note read : ' Yes , I have given everyone the day off , including me , so please choose the items you want and place the right money inside , Merry Christmas . '
Customers also left notes saying what goods they had bought and this , combined with a quick check of his stock , confirmed that Mr Algie 's trust was not abused .
Instead of being behind the counter , the divorcee had spent the day with his son Joe , 23 , and daughter Beth , 18 ,
He added : ' When I got back , I could only see one £ 5 note in the box and perhaps my faith in human nature was slightly shaken .
However , the long tube was stuffed with notes and change , and after a bit of vigorous shaking , the day 's takings spilled out on to the kitchen table . '
The biggest amount was £ 17 for a set of three - step ladders .
Mr Algie , who saved the store from closure when he bought it six years ago , believes he was not short - changed as people put in a little extra if they did not have the right change .

Sales at the nation ’s largest retailers fell off a cliff in October , casting fresh doubt on the survival of some chains and signaling that this will probably be the weakest Christmas shopping season in decades .
The remarkable slowdown hit luxury chains that sell $ 5,000 designer dresses as badly as stores that offer $ 18 packs of underwear , suggesting that consumers at all income levels are snapping their wallets shut .
Sales at Neiman Marcus , the luxury department store , dropped nearly 28 percent in October compared with the same month last year .
Sales fell 20 percent at Abercrombie & Fitch , nearly 17 percent at Saks , 16 percent at Gap and nearly that much at Nordstrom .
Of the more than two dozen major retailers that reported on Thursday , most had sales declines at stores open at least a year , the majority of the decreases in double digits .
Deep discounters like Wal - Mart and BJ ’s Wholesale Club reported gains .
The birthday of the historical Buddha is celebrated on different dates by various schools of Buddhism .
In most of Asia , it is observed on the first full moon date of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar ( typically May ) .
But in other parts of Asia , the day falls earlier or later by a month or more .
Theravada Buddhists combine observance of Buddha 's birth , enlightenment , and death into one holiday , called Vesak or Visakha Puja .
Tibetan Buddhists also combine observance of these three events into one holiday , Saga Dawa Duchen , which usually falls in June .
Most Mahayana Buddhists , however , separate observance of Buddha 's birth , death , and enlightenment into three separate holidays held at different times of the year .
In Mahayana countries , Buddha 's birthday usually falls on the same day as Vesak .
But in some countries , such as Korea , it is a week - long observance that begins a week ahead of Vesak .
In Japan , which adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 19th century , Buddha 's Birthday always falls on April 8 .
Whatever the date , Buddha 's Birthday is a time for hanging lanterns and enjoying communal meals .
Joyous parades of musicians , dancers , floats , and dragons are common throughout Asia .
In Japan , Buddha ’s birthday — Hana Matsuri , or “ Flower Festival ” — sees those who celebrate going to temples with offerings of fresh flowers and food .
Washing the Baby Buddha
One ritual found throughout Asia and in most schools of Buddhism is that of washing the baby Buddha .
According to Buddhist legend , when the Buddha was born , he stood straight , took seven steps , and declared " I alone am the World - Honored One . "
And he pointed up with one hand and down with the other , to indicate he would unite heaven and earth .
The seven steps the Buddha took are thought to represent seven directions — north , south , east , west , up , down , and here .
Mahayana Buddhists interpret " I alone am the World - Honored One " to mean ' I represent all sentient beings throughout space and time '— everyone , in other words .
The ritual of " washing the baby Buddha " commemorates this moment .
A small standing figure of the baby Buddha , with the right hand pointing up and the left hand pointing down , is placed on an elevated stand within a basin on an altar .
People approach the altar reverently , fill a ladle with water or tea , and pour it over the figure to " wash " the baby .

In my final year of art school ( which was 1987 ) I had a friend from Japan who owned the Sharp X68000 — in fact the computer was only ever sold in Japan .
As you can see in the commercial above this machine was very friendly for folks who liked to work with video and graphics , and that was n’t by accident as the box was powered by a Motorola 68000 CPU which was the same family of chips that powered the other artist friendly machines of that era which were the Macintosh and the Amiga .
The first model of this system ran at 10 MHz , had 1 meg of of RAM and no built in hard drive , so it ’s sort of amazing just how much this system could do .
It ’s also interesting to note that many game designers in Japan created arcade games using the X68000 and today you can find emulators for the system .
In the video below the 2nd commercial is for the Sharp X68000 , notice how they ’re pushing the “ high resolution graphics ” and music capabilities of the machine :
And here ’s a photo of a later model which reminds me a great deal of the NeXT from the sleek black look which was unusual at the time :
Latvia rocked by protests
By Stefan Steinberg
16 January 2009
On January 13 , Riga , the capital of the Baltic state of Latvia , was rocked by protests and demonstrations that left around 25 people injured following clashes with police .
Police made an estimated 106 arrests .
A crowd of around 10,000 people had gathered Tuesday in Riga to protest in the city ’s historic Dome Square .
The rally was called by opposition political parties , trade unions and non-governmental organizations against government measures to shift the entire burden of Latvia ’s accelerating economic crisis onto the backs of the general population .
Protesters also complained of government corruption and incompetence .
The existing Latvian government consists of an unstable coalition of six right - wing , pro-business and extreme nationalist parties , and includes the country ’s Green Party — TP / LPP/LC / ZZS / TB/LNNK ( People ’s Party / First Party of Latvia / Latvia ’s Way / Latvian Alliance of the Green Party and Farmers Union / For the Fatherland and Freedom / Latvian National Independence Movement ) .
At the end of the demonstration in Riga , a number of protesters threw snowballs and stones at government buildings , breaking some windows , to which police responded violently .
In a public statement on Wednesday , Latvian President Valdis Zatlers denounced the protests , but also conceded that trust in the government , including its ability to deal with the country ’s accelerating economic crisis , had “ collapsed catastrophically ” .
Zatlers called for “ new faces in the government ” in order to appease popular discontent .
He said the changes should be made by March 31 , or else he would propose a referendum that could dissolve the parliament .
One member of the Latvian parliament , Krisjanis Karins , a former leader of the opposition New Era party , remarked that the latest protests were indicative of a clear radicalisation by sections of the population .
He drew a parallel to the most recent events in Greece , where there has been a series of protests and demonstrations against economic stagnation , rising poverty , widespread corruption and a disintegrating education system .
In the past , Karins said , protests in Latvia tended to follow a pattern of “ standing , singing and just going home ” , but the young protesters who showed up on Tuesday evening “ seem to think the Greek or French way of expressing anger is better ” , he said .
“ In our neck of the woods , this just does n’t happen ” , he said .
“ But it did this time … .
In six months , we ’re going to look back and yesterday will be a watershed ” , he concluded .
Latvian currency and economy face meltdown
For many years following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Latvia was regarded as one of the leading “ Baltic Tiger ” states , repeatedly notching up double - digit economic growth rates from 2000 onwards .
Now , however , the international financial crisis has revealed the vulnerable belly of Latvia and other Baltic and East European economies .
Like the other Baltic states , Estonia and Lithuania , Latvia ’s recent economic success was based on large inflows of foreign capital .
The sudden drying up of such capital flows in the wake of the international finance crisis has plunged the Latvian economy into calamity and forced the government to take emergency measures to prevent a collapse of the country ’s currency , the lat .
Any implosion of the lat would result in its decoupling from its fixed exchange rate with the euro .
This in turn would have had a huge destabilising effect on investor confidence across Eastern Europe , threatening all the other economies of the region that are tied to the euro .
In order to prevent such a scenario , the Latvian central bank has spent a fifth of its reserves in recent months while appealing for international assistance to prop up its economy .
In December the European Commission , the IMF , the World Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) and a number of EU member states agreed to provide Latvia with a € 7.5 billion stabilization loan .
Fears of a knock - on effect from a collapse of the Latvian currency and economy for all of Eastern Europe were expressed in the fact that the Czech Republic , Poland and Estonia together contributed €400 million to the bailout , despite the fact that their own economies are in a precarious position .
Nevertheless the comprehensive financial support by EU agencies and the IMF did not deter the Moody ’s rating agency from downgrading Latvia just two weeks after the loan package was agreed .
The agency expects public sector debt levels in Latvia to rise steeply during the next three years , from a current 10 percent of GDP , to around 50 percent of GDP in 2011 .
A collapse in tax revenues combined with the Latvian government ’s own bailout program for the country ’s banks will inevitably inflate the government ’s budget deficit .
Some economic experts are now predicting a double - figure contraction of the country ’s gross domestic product in 2009 .
Salaries are expected to fall substantially , and unemployment is expected to rise dramatically .
According to an analysis by the Working Day Latvia staffing company , given the current rate of job losses unemployment levels in Latvia may reach 20 percent in 2009 .
Under conditions of a looming economic meltdown and a growing radicalisation by the country ’s population , the trade movement in the Baltic region is doing everything in its power to defuse the current crisis .
In neighbouring Lithuania the trade unions planned their own protest to take place in Vilnius against government policy on Thursday .
From the outset the unions emphasised they have no intention of challenging the unpopular government led by Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis
At a press conference on January 14 the chairman of the Lithuanian Professional Unions Confederation , Arturas Cerniauskas , told journalists , “ We hope that the Riga scenario will not be repeated ” .
Cerniauskas stressed , “ Our demands are only economic .
We are not trying to topple the current government , because certain decisions made by this government are acceptable to us .
Some decisions , however , are unacceptable .
We want the government to wake up and change some of its decisions ” .
He also made clear his organisation would not attempt to achieve a broad mobilisation .
Growing tensions across Europe
The protests in Latvia are indicative of economic , social and political tensions across Europe .
Only one day after the demonstrations in Riga , a 2,000 - strong protest involving students and farmers outside the parliament building in Sofia , the capital of Bulgaria , ended in violent clashes with the police .
Widespread anger at the corruption and incompetence of the Bulgarian political elite has been exacerbated by the current gas crisis , in which the Balkan state has suffered severe heating and power shortages due to its total reliance on Russia for energy .
These latest events demonstrate how rapidly the deepening international financial crisis is leading to violent confrontations throughout Europe .
The political repercussions of the crisis found their first expression in the lobbying of banks by ordinary investors and daily protests by citizens in Iceland at the end of November .
Then Greece was shaken by a series of demonstrations and protests throughout the month of December .
In the meantime , the prime minister of Belgium has resigned and the Belgium government reorganized as a direct consequence of the finance crisis .
The coming weeks and months will undoubtedly see further political convulsions throughout Eastern and Western Europe .

US Defense Secretary warns new naval officers on civilian control of military
By Bill Van Auken
31 May 2007
In a speech before the US Naval Academy ’s graduating class May 25 , Defense Secretary Robert Gates issued pointed advice to the newly minted officers that they must respect the Constitution and not view the Congress and the media as their enemies .
The remarks were widely reported as part of the round - up of Memorial Day weekend exercises in flag - waving hoopla and the hypocritical tributes of politicians to the American troops whose lives have been sacrificed in the criminal war of aggression in Iraq .
Gates ’s speech in Annapolis , however , deserves more serious consideration .
That an American secretary of defense feels obliged to make such a pitch to the latest crop of professional naval officers has serious political implications .
The defense secretary began by reminding the graduating midshipmen that to receive their commissions as Navy ensigns or Marine Corps second lieutenants they must swear an oath “ to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
“ Today , I want to encourage you always to remember the importance of two pillars of our freedom under the Constitution — the Congress and the press , ” Gates continued .
“ Both surely try our patience from time to time , but they are the surest guarantees of the liberty of the American people . ”
He described Congress as “ a co-equal branch of government that under the Constitution raises armies and provides for navies , ” while insisting that “ the American military must be non-political and recognize the obligation we owe the Congress to be honest and true in our reporting to them .
Especially when it involves admitting mistakes or problems . ”
Turning to the media , Gates cited the recent exposure of the abominable conditions facing maimed veterans of the Iraq war at Walter Reed army hospital .
“ The press is not the enemy , ” he said , “ and to treat it as such is self - defeating . ”
Gates summed up : “ As the Founding Fathers wisely understood , the Congress and a free press , as with a non-political military , assure a free country .
A point underscored by a French observer writing about George Washington in 1782 .
He wrote : ‘ This is the seventh year that he has commanded the army and that he has obeyed the Congress ; more need not be said . ’ ”
The constitutional issues that Gates touched upon in his commencement remarks are profound and their political evolution over a protracted period in American political life deeply troubling .
The Declaration of Independence includes as one of its charges against the British monarch was that “ He affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power . ”
The Constitution placed all of the powers of war in the hands of Congress while giving it the responsibility for organizing and regulating the armed forces , as well as determining their funding and rules of conduct .
The decision to wage war , how that war is conducted and when to call a halt to it were all envisioned as the province of the Congress .
The president was declared to be the commander in chief of the army and navy , a title that the framers of the Constitution saw as assuring civilian control of the military , not as elevating the president above the state and the people as the sole wartime decision - maker .
Subordination of the military to civilian control , the maintenance of an apolitical officer corps and the effective power of Congress over war making have all been under sustained attack for an entire historical period .
The growth of US militarism and the malignant power that it exerts over every facet of American life has been widely recognized since the only military commander to become president in the 20th century , Dwight D. Eisenhower , warned against the threat to American democracy posed by the growth of a “ military industrial complex . ”
The growth of that complex has gone far beyond anything that Eisenhower could have imagined , with the US militarism — counting the Pentagon budget , “ emergency funding ” for the Iraq war , the Department of Energy ’s spending on nuclear weapons and other military related allocations — easily consuming close to a trillion dollars annually .
Moreover , the officer corps of the all - volunteer military has become increasingly politicized , heavily Republican and drawn from the most conservative layers of the American population .
This politicization within the commissioned ranks bubbled to the surface repeatedly under the Clinton administration , with open denunciations of the president by senior officers and a wholesale rebellion over its attempts to drop the reactionary ban on gays in the military .
The escalation of militarism and the open challenge to constitutional principles of congressional and civilian control have reached an unprecedented and explosive level , however , in the context of the Bush administration ’s “ global war on terrorism . ”
Indeed , given the present toxic political environment in Washington and the record of the Bush administration over the past six years , it is hard to review the transcript of Gates ’s remarks at Annapolis without hearing an implicit indictment of the current “ commander - in - chief . ”
Bush has transformed this title from a guarantee of civilian control over the military into an instrument for claiming unfettered and near - dictatorial powers for himself , based upon his supposed association with the military .
This has included the power to order the military into illegal wars of aggression , the power to detain so - called “ enemy combatants ” in military prisons like Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib without charges or trials and the power to order military interrogators to carry out acts of torture .
The entire one - sided battle over the Iraq war funding legislation — ending in the inevitable Democratic capitulation last week — was waged by the Bush administration based on the argument that Congress has no business sticking its nose into questions of war , which are best left to the “ professionals , ” the military commanders .
Thus , speaking before an audience of construction contractors early this month , Bush denounced the Democrats in Congress for daring to propose a timetable for even a partial withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
“ The question is , who ought to make that decision ? ” he asked .
“ The Congress or the commanders ? ”
He went on to declare , idiotically : “ I ’m the commander guy . ”
Similarly , in a May 24 press conference called after the Democrats had formally agreed to grant Bush all the money he asked for to continue and escalate the Iraq war , with no strings attached , Bush answered a question about Congressional criticism of his policies .
“ Look you want politicians making those decisions , or do you want commanders on the ground making the decisions ?
My point is , is that I would trust [ General ] David Petraeus to make an assessment and a recommendation a lot better than people in the United States Congress .
And that ’s precisely the difference . ”
Of course this claim of unwavering trust in the “ commanders on the ground ” is all nonsense .
The administration had to sack those who were in charge of the Iraq war — Generals John Abizaid , the head of Central Command , and George Casey , the commander of forces in Iraq — and find senior officers who did not oppose the White House proposal for a “ surge ” of tens of thousands more troops into the war .
The real relations between the White House and the civilian leadership in the Pentagon , on the one hand , and the armed forces general staff , on the other , have never been more acrimonious than during the tenure of Bush ’s previous Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Nonetheless , even rhetorically endowing uniformed commanders with a supposedly unquestionable authority to determine how a war is conducted and whether or not it should be ended represents a direct assault on the principle of civilian control of the military .
Before replacing Rumsfeld at the Pentagon , Gates — a former CIA director implicated in bloody covert US operations from Afghanistan to Nicaragua — was a member of the Iraq Study Group , which proposed a tactical shift aimed at salvaging something from the catastrophe that US imperialism has created in Iraq .
This included proposals for scaling down and reconfiguring American occupation forces and seeking diplomatic openings to Iran and Syria .
Also included in the ISG report was a pointed recommendation that , with Rumsfeld ’s ouster , “ the new Secretary of Defense should make every effort to build healthy civil - military relations ... ”
Gates ’s advice to the graduating midshipmen appears to be part of an attempt to fulfill this mandate .
It also may well reflect growing concern within sections of the American ruling elite that the Bush administration ’s unrestrained embrace of global militarism , its promotion of lawlessness by the military and its insistence that it is the commanders — not the elected members of Congress — who should determine the course of the Iraq war pose real dangers to the political and social order in the US itself .
To the extent that the principle of civilian control of the military is denigrated and undermined , the threat of its opposite grows , i.e. , military control over the civilian population , in a word , dictatorship .
Claiming that it secured necessary protections , the Environmental Protection Agency has signed off on President Bush ’s proposal to weaken mining regulations .
The previous regulation , enacted in 1983 , banned waste dumping within 100 feet of a stream or river whose water quality could be adversely affected .
The new regulation calls for some additional safeguards that were n’t supported by Bush , but eliminates mining restrictions and the previous dumping ban .
Even with the supposed protections , the proposal has met opposition not just from environmental organizations , but from the American public and head lawmakers in the states that have the biggest stake in the matter .
[ social_buttons ]
According to the Sierra Club , 2 out of 3 Americans oppose weakening the regulation .
Furthermore , the governors of both Tennessee and Kentucky have spoken out against the proposal , yet the mining industry - backed plan is set to cruise into place this week .
The proposal still must be signed , however , to be enacted .
While this is almost a guarantee , taking action could cause a delay .
If the proposal does not become a regulation by December 20th , then Obama will have the opportunity to overturn it as soon has he takes office a month later .
It is the hope of the current administration that this will be signed this week , so it is imperative that we contact the EPA as soon as possible .

Cash4Gold Will Offer One - Third of the Actual Value for your Gold
You should read it ... later .
In a nutshell , Brent sent in scrap gold valued elsewhere at $ 180 and was offered one third of that amount by Cash4 Gold .
Brent balked at their $ 60 check and called their customer service line , where he immediately got a new offer : $ 178 !
On October 6th , that Cockeyed article was featured on Consumerist.com ( http://consumerist.com/5059452/how-to-avoid-getting-ripped-off-by-cash4gold).
Consumerist is so popular that thousands of people read the article , and the high Consumerist pagerank meant that the Cockeyed article would take its place at the tippy - top of Google results on searches for " Cash 4 Gold " .
Anyone searching for " Cash4 Gold " had a very good chance at this new insight :
Their cash offers for gold are measly .
I guess someone at Cash 4 Gold noticed , because a week later , I got an email from Joe Laratro :
If there ’s something I hate more than the taste of chalk , it ’s buying Christmas presents .
I ’m great at buying gifts for myself – I know exactly what I want and I ’m never disappointed with the colour or quality .
But I ’m clueless when it comes to friends and family .
No matter how hard I try , I always end up buying the wrong thing and have to witness that familiar grimace as they open their unwanted gift .
This year I ’ve decided to go one better and deliberately buy the worst gifts I can find .
That way , no - one will be any more disappointed than usual , and I can have some fun .
Power Juicer
It looks great on the TV , does n’t it ?
You fill it with fruit and vegetables and it squirts out a healthy refreshing drink !
The drink may be fluorescent green and smell like cabbage , but hey , think of the health benefits !
A juicer is a truly terrible gift .
It says “ You look like shit !
You stuff your face with fast food all day – your body must be crying out for nutrition !
You obviously have no idea how to cook , so here ’s a machine you just shove fruit into .
Think you can manage that ?
You ’ll have to gulp a glass of freshly - squeezed broccoli every time I visit , just so I think you love your gift . ”
Ha !
Add a Spa day voucher if you feel really cruel .
Glass Clown
If there ’s one thing worse than a real clown , it ’s a delicately crafted , multicolour Italian glass clown .
Yes , from the country that brought you Ferrari and Michelangelo , Italy has now added gaudy deformed ornaments to their prestigious list .
Why ?
Did a glassblower wake up one morning and think “ Hey !
I mak - a ma fortune by blowing a clown !
Bellissimo ! ” A sad day for Europe .
This gift says “ I ’ve thought of the most unattractive , scary figure I could think of .
I ’ve had it made from psychedelic glass that clashes with everything you own .
I ’ve had it flown all the way from Italy .
Because I ’ve put so much effort into this gift , you will have to display this monstrosity in the most prominent place in your house .
I am then going to buy you one every Christmas for the next 20 years . ”
Embarrassing CD
I ’ve been the recipient of many cringeworthy discs in my time – some of my relatives must really hate me .
Any serious music fan is going to be seriously offended by offerings such as this :
Just be sure you do n’t purchase something that is so bad , it ’s good .
It just has to be really bad .
Your musical gift of love shouts out “ This CD shows how little attention I pay to your musical tastes .
This CD is going to stand out in your serious music collection like a glowing pus-filled boil .
Put it on now !
Put on your dancing shoes and boogie on down , party boy !
Rahahahh . ”
Pet Gifts
It ’s fun to irritate a new mother by buying baby - related gifts on her birthday .
So why not buy pet gifts for your animal loving relatives ?
A box of snacky bones or a scratching post is totally useless to them , but their furry friends will love you forever !
It ’s like stretching one gift to two recipients .
Brilliant .
This gift says “ I know your pet is the only thing in your miserable life that loves you , so I ’ve decided to reward him , the poor creature .
You ’ll now have to spend Christmas feeding your gift to the dog . ”
Balloon Ride
Nothing says “ I could n’t be bothered to think about your gift ” more than a free ride in something .
And a balloon ride is the worst trip of all .
On the face of it , a graceful and romantic balloon ride sounds like fun , but as far as I ’m concerned it ’s dangerous , scary , pointless and , did I mention dangerous ?
At least with skydiving you get a parachute .
This gift is great for unpleasant elderly relatives .
It shouts “ A trip of a lifetime – I hope so , because you wo n’t be around for another one !
Once you realize you ’re standing in a picnic hamper 10,000 feet above ground held up by a bag of air , those long - overdue heart palpitations might finally kick in !
By the way , can you leave me that antique vase in your will ? ”
Follow these tips and your Christmas shopping trips will be a breeze !

Traders on Wall Street have endured a torrid start to 2009 Wall Street has suffered its worst January on record as a barrage of bad US economic data continues to shake investors ' confidence .
The Dow Jones Index ended the month down 8.8 % in what some analysts see as a bad omen for the year ahead .
The broader S&P 500 index fell by 8.6 % , also a record fall for January .
The Dow fell 1.82 % on the last trading day of the month after official figures showed that US GDP fell sharply in the final quarter of 2008 .
World markets also suffered - the MSCI world index closed down 8.6 % on the month .
GDP falls US economic output fell by 3.8 % in the last three months of the year , the biggest quarterly decline since 1982 .
It was also the second quarterly decline in a row - the first time that has happened since 1991 .
And this was just the latest in a long line of bad economic figures .
On Thursday , US Commerce Department figures showed that orders for long - lasting manufactured good from US factories fell for the fifth month in a row .
Figures released at the beginning of the month showed that more people lost their jobs - 2.6 million - in 2008 than in any year since World War II .
A number of the most recognised companies in the US have announced massive job cuts during January .
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing announced on Wednesday that it was cutting 10,000 jobs .
Earlier in the week , construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar announced it would cut about 20,000 jobs , while carmaker General Motors said 2,000 of its workers would be laid off .
Earlier this month , Microsoft said it would cut more than 5,000 jobs .
Sales slump Retail sales continue to slump as consumers tighten their belts while the US housing market shows no signs of recovery .
On Thursday , figures showed that sales of new homes in the US dropped by 14.7 % in December .
They also showed that for 2008 as a whole , sales fell by 37.8 % to 482,000 homes , the weakest results since 1982 .
In 2007 , 776,000 homes were sold .
Not even the inauguration of President Obama on 20 January led to a sustained rally on Wall Street .
However , the new administration hopes that its $ 819bn ( £ 563 bn ) economic stimulus package , which passed through the House of Representatives on Thursday and goes to the Senate next week , will mark a turning point in the fight against the economic downturn .

[ darcs-users ] sad news and steady changes
Hi everybody ,
As you have noticed I have recently begun to push patches to the darcs unstable repository .
I wanted to give you a some background in this change , along with some sad news .
In the recent months , there has been a little bit of tension in the darcs community between folks that that would like a more agile and Haskell - oriented approach on the one hand , and folks that would prefer a more stable approach with a broader outlook on the community .
Adding to this , we also have the fact looming overhead that David ( starting from January ) will be buried in his teaching engagements .
We have thought this over quite a bit , and have come to some conclusions about the best way to move forward .
This is where the sad news comes in .
David Roundy will be stepping down as unstable maintainer and darcs project leader .
I will taking over in these roles and building a new darcs team ( it will certainly take more than one of us to fill his shoes ! ) .
Thanks very much to David for having given us darcs in the first place , for the tremendous effort he put into darcs 2 and for putting together a fun , welcoming darcs community .
David , we 're going to miss you , and I do hope you will be checking in from time to time ( and hey finding a few spare moments to send patches and answer questions ) .
I hope that that we will make you proud with the work we will be doing polishing darcs up , and turning a great revision control system into something truly world class .
And of course , do let us know when you 're ready to come back and take the lead ... :-)
So what comes next ?
My first priority as maintainer would be to complete the work from the darcs sprint .
I will be using the darcs unstable branch to merge in the remaining changes over the next week .
When the dust has settled , I will transfer the patches over to the stable branch and probably collapse the two branches again .
The second priority is to ensure that darcs 2.1.1 is released promptly , with GHC 6.10.1 support and otherwise no changes .
In the medium term , business will carry on as usual .
I will be starting a new email thread shortly so that we can decide on the upcoming darcs roadmap .
Thanks everybody , -- Eric Kow < http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Eric.Kow>

The House of Lords has voted to accept a minor Opposition Amendment regarding the removal of innocent people 's DNA profiles , human tissue samples and fingerprints from centralised Government database , during the first part of the Report stage of the controversial Counter - Terrorism Bill 2008
See the debate and the vote : Tuesday , 4 November 2008 Counter - Terrorism Bil
The wording of the amendment :
" National guidelines on fingerprint and sample database ( 1 ) The Secretary of State shall by regulations publish national guidelines for governmental agencies establishing -- ( a ) a procedure by which a person can request a statement of what information relating to fingerprints and samples is held on them or on a dependent ; ( b ) a procedure by which a person can request that such information held on them or a dependent is destroyed ( c ) the circumstances in which a request under paragraph ( b ) may be refused .
( 2 ) If a request made under paragraph ( 1 ) ( b ) is refused under paragraph ( 1 ) ( c ) , the relevant agency shall write to the person setting out why such information will not be destroyed and when such circumstances as prevent it being destroyed may no longer apply .
( 3 ) In drawing up guidelines under subsection ( 1 ) , the Secretary of State shall consult such bodies as he thinks appropriate .
( 4 ) Regulations under subsection ( 1 ) shall not be made until a draft copy is laid before , and approved by resolution of , both Houses of Parliament . "
Given that there are no penalties for any bureaucrats or politicians who refuse to comply , or who deliberately delay this process , it is unlikely that any such new regulations will make any practical difference .
The Government could simply copy the existing ACPO Guidelines , which make it as hard as possible for innocent people to have their DNA profiles and samples and fingerprints , removed .
The only positive aspect of this wording " national guidelines for governmental agencies " is general enough so that it is not restricted to just the sneaky Counter - Terrorism DNA Database , run by the Metropolitan Police Service , which is what is under " clarification " in this part of the Bill , but it applies to all Government and Police DNA and fingerprint databases , including the controversial National DNA Databases .
UPDATE : 19th November 2008
The House of Commons has rejected even this minor amendment .
See the Public Whip for the detailed list of how MPs voted .
Why is the Opposition to this Labour Government so useless ?
Hilary Duff lands new TV deal with NBC

Sheikh Sharif Ahmed ( left ) and Sheikh Yusuf Indohaadde during a news conference iin June 2006 .
Indohaadde , the former Defense Minister for the Islamic Courts Union , appeared on al Qaeda propaganda tapes .
Somalia ’s newly expanded parliament elected the former leader of the Islamic Courts Union as president of Somalia .
The move comes just days after the Djibouti wing of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia joined in a power - sharing deal with the now - defunct Transitional Federal Government .
Sheikh Ahmed Sharif was elected president of Somalia in the second round of balloting held in the capital of neighboring Djibouti .
Sharif received 293 of the 421 votes cast , while Masalah Mohamed Siad , the son of a former president of Somalia , received 126 votes .
The current and a former prime minister of Somalia withdrew from the race after poor showings in the first round of voting .
The Somali parliament has been meeting in Djibouti as the security situation continues to deteriorate .
The Ethiopian military , which has occupied southern Somalia since January 2006 after ousting the Islamic Courts , completed its withdrawal from Somalia this week .
Shabaab and allied Islamist groups from the Asmara wing of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia have overrun most of southern Somalia , leaving small pockets under TFG control .
Baidoa , the seat of government , fell to Shabaab forces on Jan. 26 , the day after Ethiopian forces withdrew from the town .
The Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia is an offshoot of the Islamic Courts Union , which took control of Somalia during the summer and fall of 2006 .
Sharif partnered with wanted al Qaeda leader Hassan Dahir Aweys during the 2006 conquest of central and southern Somalia , including the capital of Mogadishu .
But Sharif has always been viewed as a “ moderate ” Islamist but the European Union and the US State Department , despite his close associations with al - Qaeda linked Somali leaders .
Under the leadership of Aweys and Sharif , the Islamic Courts Union implemented sharia , or Islamic law throughout southern Somalia .
Islamic Courts suicide bombers attacked the weak Transitional Federal government , while the Islamic Courts ran terror training camps , courted foreign fighters , and released videos through al Qaeda ’s propaganda arm .
Aweys , confident in his victory , called for the creation of a “ greater Somalia ” in the horn of Africa .
“ We will leave no stone unturned to integrate our Somali brothers in Kenya and Ethiopia and restore their freedom to live with their ancestors in Somalia , ” Aweys said during an interview with Shabelle Radio in 2006 .
Aweys and Sharif fled Somalia during the 2006 Ethiopian invasion .
Aweys settled in Asmara , Eritrea , while Sharif was briefly imprisoned in Kenya .
At the behest of the US State Department , Sharif was released from Kenyan custody and fled to Yemen and then Saudi Arabia .
Aweys and Sharif established the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia and along with Shabaab launched the deadly insurgency that killed more than 16,000 Somalis in two years .
The two leaders split over the prospects of negotiations with the Transitional Federal Government .
Sharif favored a power - sharing deal that would restore the Islamists to power , while Aweys sought to defeat the Ethiopian military and drive it from Somalia .
Over the summer of 2008 , Aweys claimed to have usurped the leadership of the ARS .
The extent of the divide between Aweys and Sharif is unclear .
In early January , it was rumored the two leaders would meet in Egypt .
With Shabaab and allied Islamist forces in control of nearly all of southern Somalia , it remains to be seen if Aweys and Sharif will reconcile or if the factions will continue to vie for political control of the war ravaged eastern African state .

After a series of software development mishaps this week , Sid Savara , who was scheduled to demo his pet project at Manoa Geeks discovered that the project was at risk of not being completed in time .
Sid had been looking forward to the event all week : a chance to showcase himself in front of the who ’s who in Hawaii ’s tech community .
During the final stretch , however , Sid encountered some issues .
Sid weighed his options , made his decision , and lived with the fall out .
A Difficult Situation – Weighing The Options
As the deadline loomed , the software development team , ( consisting entirely of Sid ) discovered themselves hopelessly behind schedule .
They were unable to work through implementation as quick as they had hoped , and at this rate the deadline was going to get the better of them .
Tradeoffs needed to be made , long hours and additional developers were considered : everything was on the table .
Sid thus considered his options :
Get It Done At All Costs .
In this scenario , Sid would work through the issues , forgoing hours of sleep , time with his friends , and likely hampering his other goals .
It ’s a strategy that has been used successfully in the past , and a perennial crowd favorite .
Everyone loves a good war story , where the hero works on the beta software right up until the last minute and the demonstration is pulled off successfully .
The option of choice sure to elicit toasts , pats on the back , and “ back in my day ” stories for years to come .
Present it Half Finished .
Work through some of the problems , and present a lame demo of a half - completed project .
To compensate for the lack of functionality , slick powerpoint presentations , bullet points and talking around the issues will be used to distract the audience .
Generally the fall back plan after # 1 has fallen through .
Given the current state of affairs , as much as # 1 would be preferable , this option had to be considered as a likely scenario .
Nobody likes a lame demo , especially the people giving it .
Just Let It Go .
The unthinkable : admit temporary defeat , cancel his commitment , and continue life as normal .
This would be difficult for someone as accomplished and unaccustomed to failure as Sid , and truly a measure of last resort .
The Decision Is Made – and The Fallout
After careful consideration , Sid decided to Just Let It Go .
He emailed the organizer , Ryan Ozawa , and told him he would n’t be able to demo anything , but would still attend Manoa Geeks .
Friends , history shall judge whether it was the right time to withdraw .
Ryan swiftly rendered this stern judgment ( reprinted in its entirety ) :
Aloha e Sid , Bummer !
But it ’s most important that you be there !
See you then .
Ryan
Aloha e Sid , indeed .
( loosely translated aloha means any number of things : hello , love , welcome , goodbye )
The Demo Is Scrapped – Yet Somehow , The World Goes On
Manoa Geeks was yesterday evening , and from all appearances , the lack of Sid ’s demo presented little consequence , save for perhaps making a liar out of Ryan on Twitter .
The sponsor , ILovePhotos showcased a development build of their application that has been getting fantastic reviews around the web , and put on a great event .
The free pizza and company were excellent , and Ryan ’s planning , if anything , was easier with one less demonstration to account for .
The lesson ?
Sometimes we make commitments we can’t live up to , and we need to just let it go .
Drop the ball once in a while .
It ’s ok : I , and Ryan , give you permission .
Aloha e friends .
PS – This should n’t be misconstrued as carte blanche to just let everything fall apart .
Back out of your commitments too often without reason and you risk coming off as flaky , and someone who cannot keep their word .
From time to time however , we all have setbacks , bad days , or simply overcommit .
Relax , and just let it go .
As European diplomats poured into the region seeking a cease - fire , Israel and Hamas spoke defiantly of victory .
Phones in Gaza homes rang repeatedly with recorded Israeli military messages saying , “ We are getting rid of Hamas . ”
That goes beyond the stated goals of Israel ’s top leaders , who have emphasized that the operation is intended to stop Hamas from firing rockets into Israel .
The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said after a meeting with officials from the Czech Republic , Sweden and France that Israel would “ change the equation ” in the region .
She added that in other conflicts , “ countries send in forces in order to battle terrorism , but we are not asking the world to take part in the battle and send their forces in  we are only asking them to allow us to carry it out until we reach a point in which we decide our goals have been reached for this point . ”
The Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar , speaking from a hiding place in a recorded speech on Hamas television , said : “ The Israeli enemy in its aggression has written its next chapter in the world , which will have no place for them .
They shelled everyone in Gaza .
They shelled children and hospitals and mosques , and in doing so , they gave us legitimacy to strike them in the same way . ”
Palestinian medical officials estimated that the death toll during the war reached 550 on Monday .
The United Nations estimated that about a quarter of those killed were civilians .
Three Israeli soldiers were killed and 24 were wounded when an Israeli tank mistakenly fired at them Monday night , The Associated Press reported .
Hamas has killed five Israelis since the conflict began .
" He 's obviously got unbelievable potential , but he had some distractions getting ready for this fight .
The movie .
The commercials .
If Fedor wants to keep winning , and winning well , he needs to train professionally .
Right now he won with his old tricks .
" The fact that Fedor won , do n't get me wrong , I 'm very happy about .
But he won this fight because of the training before this fight .
The experience he had before this fight .
The trainers did everything we could to get him ready .
But for title fights , we can't train the way we trained for this one . "
Carly Simon Helps Get Clemency for John Forte
Singermay have aided in getting clemency for the so - called " Fourth Fugee " .
Next month Forte will be a free man after serving half of his 14 year sentence in Federal prison after being granted clemency by
The rapper is one of 16 people who were gifted a " get out of jail free card . "
It 's almost like winning the lottery because over 2,000 requests are sitting on the President 's desk now .
John , who went to prep school with Carly Simon 's son Ben , was busted after being caught with 31 pounds of coke at Newark Intl Airport in NJ back in 2000 .
Simon lobbied for Forte 's release by speaking with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch .
How does one justify 31 pounds of cocaine ?
Sounds like a baaad habit .
Keeping true to his promise of transparency , President Barack Obama issued an order today taking the first step toward lifting the veil of secrecy that had shrouded government information for the last eight years .
According to a White House statement :
" In The Presidential Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government ( pdf ) , and the Presidential Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act ( pdf ) , the President instructs all members of his administration to operate under principles of openness , transparency and of engaging citizens with their government .
To implement these principles and make them concrete , the Memorandum on Transparency instructs three senior officials to produce an Open Government Directive within 120 days directing specific actions to implement the principles in the Memorandum .
And the Memorandum on FOIA instructs the Attorney General to in that same time period issue new guidelines to the government implementing those same principles of openness and transparency in the FOIA context . "
Government - transparency advocates had hoped for such a decree .
They have long decried restrictions on information set off by the October 2001 memo issued by Attorney General John Ashcroft telling federal agencies that his office would support their decisions to withhold information .
Ashcroftâs memo stated :
" When you carefully consider FOIA requests and decide to withhold records , in whole or in part , you can be assured that the Department of Justice will defend your decisions . "
Ashcroftâs memo reversed the memo on FOIA issued in 1993 by Attorney General Janet Reno .
Bombs teach the wrong lesson
Bombs teach the wrong lesson
New Zealand 's Tertiary Education Union ( TEU ) is calling on the elected Israeli and Palestinian governments to respect the peaceful role that education institutions play in communities , and keep their war out of Palestine 's schools and tertiary education institutions .
The TEU condemns yesterday ’s deadly bombing of a Gaza school and the earlier the use of Gaza ’s Islamic University and the Training College as targets for Israeli bomb attacks .
Yesterday ’s attack on a school in Jabaliya refugee camp reportedly killed 30 and wounded many more .
Meanwhile the extent of the damage to the Islamic University , which has been hit by six air strikes in recent days , is still unknown .
Luckily there were no casualties , as the university was evacuated when the Israeli assault began .
The training college was less lucky , with 8 students killed and more injured in attacks on December 27 .
“ Israel 's bombing of education institutions is a horrific action in an increasingly horrific war , ” said Tangi Tipene , one of the TEU ’s transitional presidents .
“ To retain our civility universities , schools and education institutions need to be sanctuaries from violence . ”
The Islamic University was established in 1978 with the approval of Israeli authorities and is the most important institution of higher education in Gaza , serving more than 20,000 students , 60 percent of whom are women .
“ Children died in yesterday ’s attack on a school .
We do n’t know the reason for the attack but we do know Israel claims the university was harbouring a suspected arms depot for Hamas .
It has given no evidence yet for this claim , but if it is true that is tragic use of one of Palestine 's ' most important cultural and educational symbols , ” said Tipene .
“ Hamas can hope for neither victory nor peace if it turns the things it values into military depots .
Likewise Israel cannot hope to retain any moral control over the war if it attacks the home of higher learning in Gaza . ”

Over at the Android bat cave , there 's some interesting news going down .
Today , Android announced the public release of its " cupcake " branch .
This new branch offers a number of application enhancements , including bug fixes , a video recorder , the ability to save MMS attachments and more .
System enhancements include better bluetooth support , better HTTP handling and , most importantly , a new JavaScript engine built on Squirrel Fish .
Unlike the main Android trunk release , which is built on Linux 2.6.25 , cupcake has been built on the updated Linux 2.6.27 .
Notably , the new system software offers basic x86 support and will allow third party manufacturers to develop and deploy their own handset - specific APIs .
Cupcake is a development branch rather than a release branch .
According to the cupcake roadmap page , it remains distinctly a work in progress .
This first release represents a big commit of changes since Android 's 1.0 release ; future plans are for smaller updates as the cupcake changes stabilize .
The announcement page emphasizes that cupcake is an outgrowth of Android 's roadmap ; the roadmap allows for project forking with development continuing on in private branches , which is what cupcake is .
The cupcake branch updates will eventually be merged back into the main Android trunk .
This will probably not happen until early to mid January due to the American holiday season .
Given the number of bug fixes covered by the cupcake release , this will likely be a welcome update for most Android users .
Earlier this month , the OpenCL specification was released by the Khronos group .
Khronos is a group made up of representatives from companies in the computing industry .
The group focuses on creating and managing standards for graphics , multimedia and parallel computing on everything from mobile devices to desktop and workstation computers .
Part of Khronos ' charge is OpenGL and all it's relatives with the Open - prefix , so naming also makes sense .
The goal of OpenCL is to make certain types of parallel programming easier and to provide vendor agnostic hardware accelerated parallel execution of code .
That 's a bit of a mouth full , but the bottom line is that OpenCL will give developers a common set of easy to use tools to use to take advantage of any device with an OpenCL driver ( processors , graphics cards , ect. ) for the processing of parallel code .
While there are already tools available that enable parallel processing , these tools are largely dedicated to task parallel models .
The task parallel model is built around the idea that parallelism can be extracted by constructing threads that each have their own goal or task to complete .
While most parallel programming is task parallel , there is another form of parallelism that can greatly benefit from a different model .
In contrast to the task parallel model , data parallel programming runs the same block of code on hundreds ( or thousands or millions or ... ) of data points .
Whereas my video game may have threads for handling AI , physics , audio , game state , rendering , and possibly more finely grained tasks if I 'm up to the challenge , a data parallel program to do something like image processing may spawn millions of threads to do the processing on each pixel .
The way these threads are actually grouped and handled will depend on both the way the program is written and the hardware the program is running on .
As we 've said many times in the past , graphics is almost infinitely parallelizable .
Millions of pixels on the screen can all act ( mostly ) independently of each other .
Light weight threads handle the calculation of everything that has to do with a particular pixel .
As pixels get smaller and we pack more on screens , there is more opportunity for parallel work .
Graphics cards are currently the best data parallel processing engines we have available .
And once OpenCL drivers are available , developers will have access to all that horsepower for any other data parallel tasks they see fit .
Now , it wo n't make sense to run a word processor on your graphics card , as there just is n't enough happening at once to take advantage of the hardware .
Single threaded performance on a GPU is n't that great , especially compared to a general purpose CPU , and trying to run code that is n't massively parallel just is n't going to be a great idea .
But there are plenty of things that can benefit from the GPU .
Basically any multimedia processing can benefit , from video and audio decoding , editing , and encoding , to image manipulation , to helping speed up your math homework ( brute force computation ala Maple , Matlab , and Mathematica could certainly benefit from the GPU ) .
There could be some interesting encryption and / or compression techniques that are born out of the data parallel approach as well .
The best applications of data parallel computing have likely not been seriously considered at this point , as it takes time to get from the availability of tools to the finished product , let alone the conception of ideas that have heretofore been precluded by the realities of parallel programming .
But OpenCL is n't a miracle that will make everything speed up .
Rather it is a vehicle by which developers will be able to make a small subset of tasks orders of magnitude faster using hardware that is already in most people 's computers .
Which is certainly nice .
But let 's take a closer look .

Every time I see the aged Henry Kissinger , I am reminded of the worst sort of pornography .
In fact , I am reminded of a snuff film .
Henry Kissinger is likely one of the most notorious killers on the planet , a monster that makes Charles Manson look like a silly school boy .
Manson did not actually kill anybody .
He had his brainwashed zombies engage in the dirty work .
Kissinger did n’t kill anybody either .
He had the Pentagon , the CIA , and various cutthroat clients do his dirty work , that is to say the dirty work of the global elite .
Charlie had a few deranged girls on LSD do his bidding .
Henry enlisted whole armies to commit the crimes he engineered for his bosses .
Renowned war criminal and global elite minion Henry Kissinger discusses Gaza and publicly calls for Obama to create a New World Order out of current state of global affairs .
“ Henry Kissinger ’s role in the Cambodian genocide , Chile , and East Timor , makes him a first class war criminal , arguably at least in the class of Hitler ’s Foreign Minister Joachim Von Ribbentrop , hanged in 1946 , ” notes Edward S. Herman .
“ But Kissinger has the impunity flowing naturally to the leaders and agents of the victorious and dominant power .
He gets a Nobel Peace prize , is an honored member of national commissions , and is a favored media guru and guest at public gatherings . ”
Kissinger sabotaged the 1968 Vietnam peace talks , thus allowing the Vietnam War to drag on for another four years , ultimately at a cost of three or four million dead Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans .
Kissinger personally persuaded Nixon to extend the war to Cambodia and Laos which led to another million civilian deaths .
According to Nixon ’s chief of staff H.R. Haldeman , Kissinger sadistically relished in the details of mass murder campaigns with code names such as “ Operation Breakfast , ” raids that slaughtered 350,000 civilians .
Kissinger made the murder of Chilean socialist Salvador Allende his pet project .
He was chairman of the Forty Committee , a CIA working group whose task was to cause chaos inside the country which would lead to a military coup .
“ The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves , ” quipped Henry .
“ l do n’t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people . ”
Nixon and Kissinger made sure the Chilean fascist organization Patria y Libertad received training in guerrilla warfare and bombing .
“ When the coup finally came , in September 1973 , it was led by the most extreme fascist members of the military , and it was unrelenting in its ferocity .
Allende was assassinated , ” writes Mark Zepezauer .
“ Several cabinet ministers were also assassinated , the universities were put under military control , opposition parties were banned and thousands of Chileans were tortured and killed , many fingered as ‘ radicals ’ by lists provided by the CIA . ”
Kissinger went out of his way to protect the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
“ At a time when Pinochet was the target of international censure for state - sponsored torture , disappearances , and murders , Kissinger assured him that he was a victim of communist propaganda and urged him not to pay too much attention to American critics , ” writes Lucy Komisar .
Kissinger and Nixon paved the way for the rise of Pol Pot and the murder of over a million Cambodians .
Kissinger green lighted Suharto ’s invasion of East Timor .
On October 8 , 1975 , a member of the National Security Council , Philip Habib , told meeting participants that “ It looks like the Indonesians have begun the attack on Timor . ”
Kissinger ’s response to Habib was , “ I ’m assuming you ’re really going to keep your mouth shut on this subject . ”
Kissinger was not concerned about the loss of life .
He was worried that the use of US - made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny .
60,000 Timorese were ultimately hunted down and slaughtered by Suharto ’s thugs .
“ President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger , who gave the go ahead to Suharto ’s invasion of East Timor and subsequent massive war crimes there , and the same Kissinger , who helped President Nixon engineer and then protect the Pinochet coup and regime of torture and murder and directed the first phase of the holocaust in Cambodia ( 1969 - 75 ) , remain honored citizens , ” laments Herman .
It was the Kissinger engineered “ secret bombing ” of Cambodia that led to the rise of Pol Pot , who butchered and starved to death over a million of his fellow countrymen .
Despite all of this , Henry Kissinger is looked upon admirably by the establishment and its corporate press as an “ elder statesman . ”
He gets on television and tells us how things should be done .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In the video here , he repeats the corporate media lie about Hamas and the Palestinians .
In 1988 , according to the Washington Post , Kissinger “ recommended at a private gathering recently that Israel prohibit television reporters and cameras from the violence - torn occupied territories and that the Palestinian uprisings be suppressed ‘ brutally and rapidly , ’ according to a memo paraphrasing his remarks …
The memo said Kissinger emphasized repeatedly that under no circumstances should Israel make concessions during the current period of violence . ”
Prior to Hamas , Kissinger vilified the PLO .
“ When Henry Kissinger was secretary of state , he did more than most to demonize the Palestine Liberation Organization and hamper the settlement of the Palestinian issue , ” the Post wrote on April 2 , 1989 .
“ Apparently , however , he does not feel he did enough .
From his private offices in New York , he is now firing barrages of editorial missiles at the organization and the concept of Palestinian rights .
It is true , he says , that the PLO has recognized Israel , accepted Security Council Resolution 242 and renounced terrorism , but these commitments are too vague to build on . ”
But what really rankles in the video here is Kissinger ’s call for Obama to create a New World Order .
“ It ’s a great opportunity , ” declares Kissinger .
Indeed , for the Bilderberger and Rockefeller minion Kissinger , the election of Obama and the manufactured crises all around are a “ great opportunity ” to usher in world government .
In order to better understand what Kissinger has in mind — what the global elite have in mind ( since Kissinger does not speak on his own , same as he did not engineer all the coups and staggering mass murders attributed to him on his own ) — let us reflect on what he said on May 21 , 1992 , at a Bilderberg meeting held in Evian , France :
“ Today , America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [ referring to the 1991 riots in Los Angeles ] .
Tomorrow they will be grateful !
This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [ i.e. , an “ extraterrestrial ” invasion ] , whether real or promulgated [ emphasis in original ] , that threatened our very existence .
It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil .
The one thing every man fears is the unknown .
When presented with this scenario , individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well - being granted to them by the world government . ”
Finally , considering Kissinger ’s track record and the long , sordid , and bloody one of the New World Order , we can be assured the world government imagined by Henry and crew will not think twice about murdering a few million people in order to realize their demented dreams .
Such acts are business as usual for the ruling elite .

Like any child who has lost a parent , it was only natural that Benazir Bhutto 's eldest daughter would wish to express her grief for her murdered mother .
Less obvious , perhaps , was that the tribute would come in the form of a mournful rap song .
Now the song , written and performed by 18 - year - old Bakhtawar is being broadcast regularly on Pakistan 's state - run television , part of a flood of tributes paid to the former prime minister a year after her assassination .
" You have beauty and intelligence , everything you did have relevance , " sings Bakhtawar , with a borrowed Brooklyn accent , over looping beats .
" Shot in the back of your ear , so young in 54th year , murdered with three kids left behind , a hopeless nation without you , you are in all their hearts . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The teenager , a student at Edinburgh University , then repeats a chorus line , from which the song takes it name : " I would take the pain away . "
The song , which has also been posted on YouTube , features a five - minute video of photographs and clips of the murdered former premier , including footage from the election rally at the Liaquat Bagh park in Rawalpindi which she had addressed just moments before an assassin launched a lethal gun and bomb attack on 27 December , 2007 .
Bakhtawar is a keen music fan and was apparently encouraged to sing by her mother .
Shortly before her mother 's death , the teenager asked a journalist friend in the US to introduce to the Grammy Award - winning rapper and music producer Puff Daddy .
While Bakhtawar 's dirgelike rap is unlikely to secure her a Grammy of her own , the seemingly heartfelt tribute might win her some fans .
Sherry Rehman , currently Pakistan 's Information Minister and for many years a close aide to Ms Bhutto , said of the song : " It is the tribute of a grieving daughter to her iconic and loving mother . "
Bakhtawar is one of three children of Ms Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari , who inherited the leadership of her Pakistan People 's Party in the aftermath of hie wife 's death and was subsequently elected president of the country .
Their 20 - year - old son , Bilawal , who was jointly named co-chair of the party , is a student at Oxford University , while their other daughter , Aseefa , 15 , is also studying abroad .
When Ms Bhutto returned to Pakistan from exile in October 2007 , Mr Zardari remained in Dubai .
In her final book , book ' Reconciliation : Islam , Democracy and the West ' , that was published after her death , Ms Bhutto wrote of the decision : " We understood the dangers and the risks of my return , and we wanted to make sure that no matter what happened , our daughters and our son , Bilawal , would have one of us to take care of them . "
The Holidays Are So Fucking Sad , Part Three : " Work is the best medicine , Comrade Elf ! "
Are you ready to boycott Amazon yet for the holidays and hit the independent publishers for your books this year instead ?
Amazon U.K. is working its employees seven days a week through Christmas , forcing them to do 10 - and - a - half hour compulsory shifts on weekends and insisting they walk 14 miles a shift in order to pack the precious cookbooks and bland video games of the UK 's leisure classes .
Additionally , workers are being fired for getting sick even with a valid doctor 's note , because time is money .
Business for Amazon is up 31 % this year to the tune of something like 15 billion , even as the rest of the world 's economy crumbles like coal at the bottom of a stocking ( a stocking made of shit ) .
In addition to whipping their employees into a frenzy of constant work and stress , Amazon is pitting them against one another in teams and insisting that to earn a bonus they must pack 140 units an hour , and that everyone in the team must hit this mark for the bonus to take effect .
A reporter went undercover for the London Times and recorded everything :
More from this fucking article ( " Yuri !
I haff cyanide caplets in back teeth .
I squeeze to die and then you suck my lips to join me when boss turns head to ogle Olga . "
" I heard that , Dmitri !
You are fired ! " ) ( " Look , we hired you because you said you were not a pussy , Dina .
Are you a pussy ?
Is that what you want Jeff Bezos to think ?
Do you want Jeff Bezos to think that all pregnant Ukrainians are pussies who can't handle the flu ? " ) ( " I do n't care if tomorrow is CHRISTMAS MORNING .
You be here at five AM to stuff Grand Theft Auto into bubble wrap while I glare and finger myself through the pockets of my suitpants . " ) ( " Mommy -- why does it say " God is dead " in dried blood all over my new Hannah Montana DVD ? " ) ( " Look : all the allegations are true .
But we are the closest thing to Jesus and Santa Claus that you got , modern world !
Are you gonna tell JESUS CHRIST AND SANTA CLAUS to shut down the magic shop and go on vacation ? " )
Personally , I 've done eighty hour a week seasonal jobs before and enjoyed the opportunity to work like a fucking hound dog to avoid holiday depression and come away January 1st with a pocket full of cash and a head full of new stories about pain and misery .
But I have to believe that not all of the people being tortured by Amazon in the United Kingdom are writers who appreciate the chance for squalor and camaraderie in the vapid modern age .
I have to believe some of the people working there have kids , and that those kids are n't getting parents for Christmas .
Or they are getting coked - up , pissed - off , cry - themselves - to - sleep parents who beat them with wrapping paper tubes and call them ungrateful sponges to pass on that good old fashioned capitalist holiday S&M.
In other news , Jeff Bezos was named Publisher 's Weekly 's Person of the Year for 2008 , in addition to sticking his tongue so deep in Oprah 's ear about the Kindle that it came out her mouth and went into the clits , dicks , and assholes of the nation 's most powerful Christmas shopper contingent : people who are home during the day and who may have never held a job in their lives .
Amazon is being evil all over the place lately , groping like a frenzied , punch - drunk porn star for new opportunities to create hell on earth .
Watch out or Amazon will fuck you !
Someday we will all toil for Amazon in some capacity , but until that day comes , let 's all have a little sympathy for the workers who are there already , setting the standard high so that we will have packing stats to beat when it is our turn .
These heroic workers will be snatched up where they fall , wrapped in invoices , sealed in cardboard boxes , and delivered SuperSaver to cemeteries in 3 to 5 business days .
This past year will go down in history as the year when carmaking almost shriveled up and died , but so much more happened .

We 've no doubt 2008 will go down in the books ( if they print books in the future ) as one of the most important years in automobile history .
When selecting the biggest stories of the year we had to ignore our bias towards the most popular and entertaining stories , of which there were many , and focus on what events had the biggest impact on the car industry and culture we cherish .
Here they are , from least to most important stories of 2008 .

Max Mosley had two almost insurmountably difficult challenges in his life — one chosen and one thrust upon him .
No one can blame him for the unfortunate situation of his birth , with a pater familias best known for being Britain 's leading Nazi .
Embracing the world of racing and taking on the role as head of the FIA , arguably one of the hardest jobs in all of motorsports , was the trial he assumed .
For a time the controversies of racing kept the controversies of his past at bay .
That was until March 30 , 2008 .
When British tabloid News Of The World published a video alleging Mosley engaged in sex acts with five prostitutes which , at the very least , were sado - masichistic .
At worst , there were suggestions the acts were inspired by a Nazi prison camp ( allegations not helped by Mosley clearly speaking in a mock - German accent and the prison uniforms ) .
There were immediately calls for his head , with most observers expecting him to step down or be fired .

Most of us can only dream of having the skills and training to make it in a professional racing series like Formula One , the funds to compete in a series like One Lap of America , or the ability to keep oneself from dying of boredom behind the wheel of an always - turning - left NASCAR race .
Then hope came in the form of a type of racing for the rest of us born with little - to - average skill and only a few dollars in our pocket .
Two racing series have emerged .
With a $ 500 maximum cost there 's nothing cheaper and more competitive than the 24 Hours Of Lemons , which rewards clever wrenching as much as good driving .
For the more advanced , the National Auto Sport Association has proven a fun and cost - effective alternative to the SCCA .
Participation , coverage and enjoyment has hit new levels of interest , especially as the rest of world 's racing leagues succumb to investor and sponsorship dollars drying up due to the Carpocalypse .

Pininfarina is one of the oldest and most respected design and manufacturing firms in Italy , known for countless famous design partnerships .
After years of dwindling profits and business , it was hoped founder Batista Pininfarina 's grandson Andrea could help turn around the business as its new CEO .
Tragically , Andrea Pininfarina died in a Vespa accident at the age of 51 .
Pininfarina 's death was a dual loss to both his family and his family 's business , putting in peril the company he was in the process of reorganizing .
There 's still hope for the company .
The Pininfarina B0 electric car was a big hit at the Geneva Auto Show and , unlike many of the company 's concepts , the vehicle will be a mass - production electric car set to roll of the lines at the end of 2009 .
Fittingly , the car is dedicated to Andrea .

She may not have silenced all her critics , but with the wave of the checkered flag Patrick has shattered one glass ceiling .

He may not be allowed to drive in France and he can't beat the Stig , but Hamilton is the man .

Not since the original VW Beetle has a small car captured the imagination of the world like the Tata Nano .
The $ 2,500 car from Indian motor company Tata Motors may bring a small car revolution to the Indian Subcontinent much in the same way the Beetle and Model T expanded the world of car ownership ... if they ever build it .
Labor troubles and factory problems have slowed the production of the car .
Although a recent spy photo of the Nano reignited rumors the car could see a production debut on December 28th , Ratan Tata 's 71st birthday , we 'll believe it when we see it .

The rise in fuel costs during the first half of the year ( more on that later ) corresponded with a rise in interest in alternatives to a mere internal combustion engine .
Upcoming hybrid vehicles like the 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid , which goes to market next year , and the 2011 Chevy Volt have captured the imagination of the press and , hopefully , consumers .

Electric propulsion aside , automakers are still looking for ways to cut down on emissions and fuel usage .

GM hopes to propel sales with the Chevy Cruze , their 45 MPG answer to the question of how to bring MPG to the masses .

We 're still waiting to see which of these technologies will break out from the pack , but one thing 's for certain , American 's want it to be easy for them to buy green — and in the first half of the year at least , they were willing to pay a premium for it .

The rapid rise of gas prices at the beginning of the year were followed by a just - as - stunning drop during the second half .
But let 's focus on that first half jump .
Gas prices pushed consumers to shun large trucks and SUVs in unprecedented numbers , accelerating the marketing of alternative propulsion methods and also the collapse of the companies hoping to bring these methods to us .
When gas prices hit $ 5.40 a gallon in April of 2008 on the California coast we were on the verge of tears .
It was so troubling Chrysler tried to sell cars by offering three years of gas at $ 2.99 a gallon , which seemed like a good offer to some ( not so much now ) .
Rather than offering lower price gas we told you how to save gas or , failing that , steal gas .

The Ford F - 150 saw its monthly reign as the nation 's top seller end at the hands of the Toyota Camry , Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic .
People started trading sex for gas and the spike in gas prices and corresponding drop in SUV / Truck sales presaged bad things .
It would take an economy - shattering event to reverse the runaway increases in gas prices .
Advertisement
Advertisement
That economy - shattering event was the subprime mortgage crisis — a crisis in confidence forcing hundreds of thousands of potential vehicle buyers into turtle mode , hiding themselves and their money under their shells .
It showed us first - hand a truism we should have remembered from those post - 9/11 months before the U.S. automakers stepped up with 0 % financing to " help keep America rolling " — that is , when people are scared , they do n't buy cars .
We call it the Carpocalypse , and with ramifications beyond just Detroit and the not - so - Big Three , it could almost get its own top ten list .
It was just that big of a story .
Frankly , even post - bailout , it 's still that big of a story .
So what happened ?
The problems have been around for a while .
The domestic automakers were in the process of restructuring when the collapse of the housing market precipitated the partial collapse of the banking industry which caused the economy to accelerate into a recession at the worst possible time for the auto industry .
People , worried about their jobs or their homes , stopped buying cars .
This hit Ford , GM and Chrysler the hardest because they were already reeling from slumping truck and SUV sales following the increase in gas prices .
Advertisement
On September 30th we reported on how the stock market collapse took GM and Ford stock down to a price per share of $ 8.51 and $ 4.17 , respectively .
In the following months Ford dropped to a low of $ 1.26 and GM reached as low as $ 2.79 a share .
Car sales , for all automakers , fell off a cliff in October .
With it came gas prices , hitting levels we have n't seen in half a decade .
All of a sudden a bankruptcy for GM seemed plausible .
Then things went even more crazy when Chrysler and GM began merger talks .
Advertisement
Eventually , the not - so - Big Three took to begging Congress .
Unfortunately , they raised more ill will than operating capital by taking private jets instead of flying commercial .
In addition , because none of them have watched cable television in years , they did n't expect the three - ring circus of Congressland , and came bearing no real plan .
They learned their lesson , created real plans and drove to the Capitol where they were greeted with a big " no " orchestrated by Senate Republicans .
Advertisement
Having been rebuffed by Congress , the automakers won their bridge loans from The White House , though it may not be enough .
The toll of the Carpocalypse is far from certain , but we know it 's spreading .
Chrysler has ceased production and no one knows when or if they 're coming back .
Honda posted its first half - year operating loss in more than a decade and Toyota , for the first time since the 1930s , may have a one - year loss .

The Acura NSX is dead .
The Chinese may buy Hummer .
GM is selling other stuff , too .
If you have a job producing cars in the US you better start praying .
If you have a job with a manufacturer - sponsored racing team you ought to join them .

We know where this started but we 're not sure we know where it 'll end .
The Carpocalypse is the biggest story of 2008 .
We 'll be drinking on New Year 's to the hope it wo n't be the biggest story of 2009 as well .
Everything you know about ARGs is WRONG 22 Dec , 2008
Warning : this post contains explicit language .
This is a re-version of a talk I gave at the Let 's Change the Game conference held on Friday 5 December 2008 .
It was a very casual , irreverent talk , but one that I hoped would bring some light relief to the day as well as ( possibly in a rather confrontational manner ) highlight some of the current problems - as I perceive them - with this whole " alternate reality game " business .
Unfortunately there is n't a recording of the talk , so what I 've done is taken my slides and interspersed them with expanded commentary from my rather haphazard speakers notes .
This should give you a flavour of what I presented on the day .
I wanted to open with a reminder of what I was supposed to be talking about :
The taboos of alternate reality games - the number of people playing , the types of people playing and the degree of immersion and ask : where did it all go wrong ?
( and , hopefully , have some pointers as to how to put the world to rights ) .
which admittedly was written in rather a hurry .
And in no way was I honing ( writing ) my slides during the talks earlier on in the day .
I mean : I did have a pretty good outline of what I wanted to talk about , and had a good idea of the tone I wanted to strike , too .
There are , it seems to me , a number of differing interpretations as to what an ARG is , exactly , and that makes them quite easy to attack .
If you do n't know what something is , it 's quite easy for it not to have lived up to your expectations .
Predictably , I also had some glib advice I wanted to impart , too .
This is where I wanted to really set the tone :
This talk was none of the above things .
It was n't researched .
It was n't objective , and it certainly was n't inoffensive .
I 'm pretty sure that I set out deliberately to say things that others might not have wanted said .
Part of the reason for me wanting to style the talk in a somewhat offensive or expletive - laden honest manner was because of this chap :
Digression : Charlie Brooker writes the Screen Burn column in the Guardian , presents and produces Screenwipe on BBC 4 and also wrote Dead Set .
He is horrifically talented and also quite rude .
Also , since TVGoHome he 's been one of my heroes , and with this slide I was trying to point out that the whole talk was effectively a homage to his style of ranting .
So .
Who here 's actually designed an ARG ?
A smattering of hands go up .
I 'm actually quite impressed and pleased - there 've been a number of talks earlier on in the day that have been about ARGish experiments in teaching and learning , and they 've generally produced findings that were new to me .
Well .
We all suck .
We suck because of these reasons - no matter whether they 're actually true or not :
Do n't have enough players
Our games never have enough players - no matter who you ask .
This is probably because there 's some sort of horrific disconnect between the people asking the question , or making the assertion , that ARGs do n't have enough players .
Witness : lots of people knew about Perplex City , but not " enough " people played Perplex City ( compared to , say , watching Doctor Who on primetime television on a Saturday night in the UK .
Or , if you 're American , watching Heroes on NBC ) .
The " not enough players " is frequently something that 's brought up by broadcasters or advertisers - organisations or bodies that are used to , effectively , spamming a whole bunch of people with more or less the same content , whether that 's a tv show or movie or billboard .
The people who play are weird
Or : they 're not " mainstream " .
They 're the kind of people who , well , play ARGs .
They live in their parents ' basement and do n't ever see sunlight .
Also , they 're probably geeks .
They are not people who dress in white and are smiley and play sports games on the Wii together like a proper nuclear family .
The people who play have no money
So what 's the point in advertising to them ?
I mean , they 're weird , right ?
They 're not mainstream
See above .
I 'm basically making the same point here again , but imagine if I used the word " niche " and sneered at you .
We make games for the hardcore
What the fuck kind of " normal person " ( see : sneering ) wants to de-steg a jpeg , or write a distributed brute force attacker against military grade encryption ?
Jesus .
Whatever happened to the kind of people who like playing Singstar ?
Or , you know , Snake ?
We 're too expensive
TV shows are expensive to make .
Movies are expensive to make .
ARGs should be cheap .
Do n't come near me with your minimum six figure budget ever again , you charlatan .
I mean , they 're just a bunch of websites , right ?
Ca n't you do that on Geocities ?
We do n't scale
It 's fine sending a cake to twenty people .
You just try sending a cake to twenty thousand people though .
Or twenty million .
We lie
What 's all this " This is not a game " shit we have to put up with ?
Novels frequently comprise made - up stories .
We do n't really think all fiction ACTUALLY HAPPENED , do we ?
Are n't we more intelligent than that ?
So why do we resort to tricks and stunts to get people to play our games ?
Ca n't we just say that they are what they are - and have people play them ?
If we carried through the THIS IS NOT A GAME mentality and required it to be an attribute of every alternate reality game - whatever that is - we 'd end up with the Blair Witch Project every single time .
And if movies had to carry the characteristics of one of their number across the entire genre , they'd be stuffed , too .
So now that I 've insulted everyone who 's paid to come here , I 'd like to start with an apology .
When Adrian kicked off today , he told a nice story about one of the speakers who was excited about presenting today - this was going to be the first talk he'd done where he would n't have to " explain what an ARG was " .
This being a conference about ARGs , you'd be pleased to know that no one was going to have to do the whole " this is what an ARG is " thing .
Well , tough luck .
I 'm going to define an ARG and tell you what one is .
I 'm going to make this easy and break the phrase " alternate reality game " into smaller chunks so everyone can follow me .
" Alternate Reality . "
What the fuck ?
Picture , if you will , this alternate reality .
It 's the early nineteenth century .
Our protagonist , Ms. Bennet , is in want of a good husband , preferably one with a good fortune .
This is n't an alternate reality .
We have a word for this .
For this sort of " made up world " with " made up people " .
It 's called fiction :
See ? FICTION .
This is what Merriam Webster has to say about fiction :
something invented by the imagination or feigned ; specifically : an invented story b : fictitious literature ( as novels or short stories ) c : a work of fiction ; especially : novel
See , when people say that alternate reality games , which have this really silly pirate sound like ARG , are geeky , it might have something to do with the fact that we 've used the phrase " alternate reality " to describe what the rest of the world understands as " made up world and character " , which apparently is " fiction " .
Now I understand that the distinction that we may be trying to make is that an " alternate reality " implies multiple media , but the word fiction does n't imply only one medium anyway .
Look .
Let me make this even easier :
Here 's the definition for the word story .
Do you see what I 'm getting at here ?
The Beast , Perplex City , Art of the Heist , Project Mu , Who is Benjamin Stove , The Lost Experience , ilovebees .
They 've got characters .
They 're set in worlds .
Most , if not all , of those worlds and characters are n't real .
Some of them have involved " real " characters or settings .
But they 're , on the whole , made up .
They are , to a large degree , stories .
That 's that sorted then .
No more " alternate reality " bullshit .
We can use the word " fiction " or " story " instead , so normal people can understand us .
Next ?
Ah , yes .
" Game " .
We all know what a game is , right ?
See , there 's World of Warcraft .
Which , although not entirely a game , has game - like bits in it .
When it 's not being an evil addiction engine .
I mostly just wanted to show a picture of my guild .
See , there 's our commissioning editor .
Just in case you do n't know what a " game " is , I 've looked it up for you .
Here 's what Merriam Webster has to say about " game " :
1 a ( 1 ) : activity engaged in for diversion or amusement : play activity engaged in for diversion or amusement ( 2 ) : the equipment for a game b : often derisive or mocking jesting : fun , sport < make game of a nervous player > often derisive or mocking jesting 2 a : a procedure or strategy for gaining an end : tactic b : an illegal or shady scheme or maneuver : racket 3 a ( 1 ) : a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other ( 2 ) : a division of a larger contest ( 3 ) : the number of points necessary to win ( 4 ) : points scored in certain card games ( as in all fours ) by a player whose cards count up the highest ( 5 ) : the manner of playing in a contest ( 6 ) : the set of rules governing a game ( 7 ) : a particular aspect or phase of play in a game or sport < a football team 's kicking game > bplural : organized athletics c ( 1 ) : a field of gainful activity : line < the newspaper game > ( 2 ) : any activity undertaken or regarded as a contest involving rivalry , strategy , or struggle < the dating game > < the game of politics > ; also : the course or period of such an activity < got into aviation early in the game > ( 3 ) : area of expertise : specialty 3 < comedy is not my game > 4 a ( 1 ) : animals under pursuit or taken in hunting ; especially : wild animals hunted for sport or food ( 2 ) : the flesh of game animals barchaic : pluck c : a target or object especially of ridicule or attack — often used in the phrase fair game
I 'd like to point out a few things here .
One is the appearance of the word " play " in the first definition , as well as the word " amusement " .
The second is that an alternate reality game where the game are wild animals hunted for sport or food would be totally awesome and is on my list of Next Things to Make .
Anyway .
Here 's a slide to show you what " play " is if you do n't understand the English language :
and here 's what my computer 's dictionary has to say about the word " play " :
1 [ intrans . ] engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose : the children were playing outside | her friends were playing with their dolls .
• [ trans . ] engage in ( a game or activity ) for enjoyment : I want to play Monopoly .
• amuse oneself by engaging in imaginative pretense : the boys were playing cops and robbers .
enjoyment ; and
; and recreation
In case you can't get what I 'm driving at , the key words there were :
This strikes me as meaning , more or less , that the phrase " alternate reality game " , as we had like this :
actually means " story game " .
As in : thing that tells a story and a game .
Look .
Let me make this even easier :
Adam Martin posted to the ARG - SIG mailing list , which is a mailing list for people who every so often have an argument about what " ARG " means , that perhaps the word ARG is now just a label and in fact means " story game " .
Now , I 've been to college with Adam and then worked with him at a startup and while he says many things , this is possibly one of the best things he 's ever said and is probably something I 'd kiss him for .
ARGs are just things that you can play and that tell stories .
ARG does n't mean anything .
Story Games .
See ?
Now let 's look at the first bit of that phrase .
I 'm going to give you three principles of good storytelling .
You should believe what I say here , because I have absolutely no experience in terms of telling good stories , but everything in terms of experiencing them .
I have , for example , all of the Pixar DVDs in my collection at home , so I must know what I 'm talking about .
Speaking of which :
This is an excerpt of the script for WALL•E , the latest Disney / Pixar movie .
It tells the story of ... oh , forget about it .
It 's one of the finest movies ever made .
Watch this , and then despair , because you have to tell stories as good as this .
This leads to Clue # 1 . Clue # 1 is : " Tell a good story , in the context of all storytelling . "
Stories in videogames are shit .
I do n't care if you have anything you 're going to try and use to protest that assertion to me : you 're wrong .
BioShock is a wonderful game .
In the grand canon of all storytelling in the entire universe , ever , it 's in the long tail of mediocrity .
I do n't care if it 's supposed to make you cry or anything - crying is n't by any means the only way to judge whether a story 's good or not .
The reason why I bring this up is because Adrian was telling me about a panel he was on earlier this month at Channel 4 - here , in fact - when he was putting forward his equally valid assertion that all stories in games have , thus far , been shit .
I happen to agree with him .
A videogame writer who was on the panel with him disagreed , and put forward the example of Grand Theft Auto IV .
Adrian wisely disagreed , pointing out that if you compare Grand Theft Auto IV to , say , The Godfather , purely in narrative / storytelling terms , the latter trumps the former in much the same way as you'd be shocked by waking up next to a dead horse 's head .
GTA IV may well have a good story with respect to other videogames , but again : in the context of everything , ever , it 's not that good .
Games can , and should , be better at telling stories .
Clue # 1 means that you should all try much , much harder .
Sean Stewart and Elan Lee make fricking awesome games with awesome stories because , in part , Sean Stewart is a fricking awesome author .
At work , we say that we can teach a good storyteller about games , but we can't teach someone who 's a crap storyteller how to write .
Get a good writer , or give up .
Clue # 2 is " Less is more " which I kind of forgot how to expand upon during the talk , but in essence , means this : I do n't want to have to read your blog posts .
It 's very easy to write .
It 's very hard to cut down and edit .
It 's very easy to write lots of nonsensical blog entries , God knows I see enough every day on the interwebs .
That 's without even trying to tell a story .
Pare down what you need to tell a story .
Watch Charlie Brooker 's Screenwipe on television writing , it 's on iPlayer or , on certain sites of dubious virtue .
Tell a story using the minimum that you need and do n't subscribe to bloggorhea .
This applies to both text and A/V content .
Your audience just does n't have the time to wade through that stuff .
Clue # 3 is " The internet is not video " .
If I see another broadcaster or , well , anyone , proclaim that the future of entertainment is something like Lonelygirl or KateModern or some other tv show on the web , I 'll kill a broadcaster , thus in the long run doing something concrete to deal with my rage .
The internet can do much more than video .
I 've already ranted about this before .
What 's interesting about the internet - one of the interesting things - is that it allowed content creators to end - run around big , expensive distribution platforms .
They used things like YouTube .
Video is not the only thing that you can do .
End of .
That 's my three clues .
Next ?
Oh yes .
The Game part of Story Game .
Here 's my number one point .
Games are supposed to be FUN .
Jesus Christ , when did ARGs stop being fun ?
To help with this , I have formulated a suggestion for you all to take in before you leave and start making even more ARGs :
Please , no more of this shit :
viewing source code
" de - stegging " ( which , to be honest , sounds a bit like tea - bagging , and you do n't want to know what that means if you do n't already know )
waiting for stuff to happen
breaking codes
breaking more codes
making use of esoteric knowledge ( for no apparent reason )
viewing more source code
solving stupid puzzles ( for no apparent reason )
( encouraging me to ) buy stock in UV torch companies ( because of above stupid puzzles and esoteric codes )
more waiting ; and importantly
not telling me what to do
Now , it 's not that I do n't want to be told what to do .
It 's that I want to have some sort of semblance , an idea , the merest hint of a suggestion , as to what I should do next .
This is what we in the industry call ' good game design ' , and it involves not putting a bunch of random puzzles online and hoping that interwebnauts will figure it all out in the end , because , OH MY GOD , that 's not fun .
Instead , I would like more of this :
short , snappy , fun gameplay ( which may be entirely appropriate in the context of a longer , less snappy and more involved arc )
stuff like what 42 Entertainment did with Last Call Poker : which was embed the game of Poker , something a sizeable proportion of the normal human populace understands , into a game that not many people understood
stuff like what Jane McGonigal did with The Lost Sport , which was create a playground game that anyone , anywhere , could play , any when .
Ignore all the rest of the stuff for The Lost Ring like the amnesiac sportspeople , that 's just a red herring .
Ignore the blog network too , that was just a diversion .
And the classy , expensive trailer video .
Just concentrate on the game .
You know , the fun bit .
Oh , playtesting .
That 's good .
Because , you know , you 're making a game .
So test it .
Just like you 'd test your user interface .
use proper game design .
That means thinking and not going " Well , I guess if we just ROT - 13 this piece of text , then it 'll be fun ! "
make your games repeatable .
A non-repeatable live ARG ( ie one that starts at one time , runs for a period of time , and then finishes and is only really playable while it 's live ) is the equivalent of investing a sizeable proportion of money on a big budget prime - time tv show that you demand everyone watch at the same time and can't record to watch later .
In the world of I WANT EVERYTHING NOW , that 's known as Being Stupid .
Oh , and be social .
You know , with your friends .
So we 've come to the startling conclusion that we make games , which are fun , and that people can play , and we tell stories , which are less fun , but can move people and encourage people to do things .
Like games .
Anyway , it 's not that complicated .
Or is it ?
I 'm going to have to go into some science now .
Calm down now , it 's not a shampoo commercial .
Look , here 's the first chart .
It 's a chart of a pie chart , and how much of the pie chart resembles Pac Man .
Some of you may have seen it before , but then again , some of you probably have n't , and I 'm the last talk of the day , so I 've got to wake you up .
Okay , here 's the real chart :
It 's quite simple .
On your X - axis , on the left hand side you 've got things which are very game - like , like , say , Gears of War 2 , and to the right you 've got things which are more story - like .
You know , like books .
On the Y - axis , you 've got at the bottom " hardly anyone " , also known as " nobody " which is a relative term , really , and " everybody " which is also relative and depends on who you 're talking to .
For some people , " everybody " is probably " Big Brother on eviction night " if you 're Channel 4 or " the number of people who bought a Harry Potter book " if you 're JK Rowling or " the number of people who secretly went to see Titanic or Mamma Mia " if you 're in the business of throwing shapes onto walls .
Now , here 's some of the projects that we 've worked on superimposed onto the graph .
We 've got Young Bond , which was more game -y than We Tell Stories , both of which probably got more people to " play " then Perplex City , but to be honest , I just made up all the numbers and placed the graphics on the graph more or less at whim so you got the general idea .
Now , Alice has already talked about what she hopes us to do next year for the Channel 4 ARG , and on the next slide , I show where we 're aiming for :
It 's Magical Pony Unicorn Land , which is smack bang in the middle of " story " and " game " as well as right up there with " everybody in the whole world playing " or " the number of people who watched the X - Factor Finale " .
So no pressure then .
Ah .
I said I 'd have one more thing .
Here it is :
No more of this , please :
This is not a sodding game : by which I mean the ludicrous assumption that every ARG has to pretend that it is n't an ARG and that it might really be happening and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN'T YOU PEOPLE JUST ACCEPT THAT SOME THINGS ARE JUST MADE UP .
You know , if we could say a game was a game then we might have a better time promoting it because people would know what they were getting .
Lazy calls to action , by which I mean :
helping a teenage girl ;
helping an attractive teenage girl ;
helping an attractive amnesiac teenage girl ;
helping attractive amnesiac teenage girls ;
" the fucking order " or , " some secret society " or anything to do with the Illuminati or any of that crap ;
more fucking countdowns : you 're trying to get people who have relatively short attention spans online and you want them to wait ?
And you 're going to remind them ?
treasure hunts : oh , I 'll smack the next person who proposes a treasure hunt and thinks it will make people play
millions of blog entries : that no one will read apart from five people
jumping through fucking hoops : by which I mean
masturbatory platform excitement
What 's that , you say ?
Masturbatory platform excitement ?
Oh , that 's this :
seeing an intriguing movie credit that leads you to
an intriguing website that leads you to
an email address that leads you to
an autoresponder that leads you to
a phone number that leads you to
a voicemail that leads you to
a physical address that leads you to
a secret note that leads you to
another intriguing website that leads you to
a secret code that leads you to ...
Enough already .
This was interesting and new when it was , well , interesting and new .
But it 's not .
It was fine when The Beast did it , but now a certain portion of your audience is used to stuff like that , and secondly : stop doing it because you can do it !
Do it because it makes the game better and the story better !
Just because you can splurge over as many platforms as you want is n't a reason or an excuse to .
It 'll make your game worse .
Use platforms when they make sense and use them naturally .
In short ?
NO .
Do n't do it .
Please stop .
Okay , last suggestion and then we can all go to the pub .
This , I promise , is actually some interesting and relevant advice :
Do you want a game that 's going to get lots of eyeballs , or lots of engagement ?
Those two things may well require two different and mutually exclusive optimisation strategies .
Engagement requires something that 's more game - like .
Things you can get people to do .
Viewers may mean more stunts , and more shallow interaction .
Bluntly : are you creating a marketing campaign that people will talk about , but not necessarily large numbers of people will play , or are you creating a game that you do want lots of people to play .
And lastly , do you actually need a really big story ?
That 's it .
The End. Happy Holidays !
ASA 's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has found 12 previously unknown pulsars ( orange ) .
Fermi also detected gamma-ray emissions from known radio pulsars ( magenta , cyan ) and from known or suspected gamma-ray pulsars identified by NASA 's now - defunct Compton Gamma - Ray Observatory ( green ) .
Since theirdiscovery 40 years ago , pulsars ??
the rapidly spinning , highly magnetizedcrushed cores of exploded stars ?
have largely been detected via the pulsingradio signals emitted by their lighthouse beam - like jets .
But astronomers have suspectedthat these pulses give only the slightest hint of the true power of thesecosmic dynamos .
With thelaunch of NASA ?s FermiGamma-ray Space Telescope ( formerly GLAST ) in June of last year , scientistsare finally getting a glimpse of the powerful hearts of these stellar beasts .
In its first four months of operation , Fermi detected more than three dozen pulsars , 12 of which are new gamma - ray - onlypulsars .
" Weknow of 1,800 pulsars , but until Fermi we saw only little wisps of energy fromall but a handful of them , " said pulsar astronomer Roger Romani ofStanford University in California .
" Now , for dozens of pulsars , we 'reseeing the actual power of these machines . "
Theastronomers now find that some pulsar bursts are generated far above the star 'ssurface .
Romani andhis colleagues presented the Fermi findings earlier this month at the annualmeeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach , Calif .
Romani saidthat these were just the " first wave of such discoveries , " and thatthey will usher in " a new era of high - energy pulsar physics . "
Sweepingbeams
Pulsars ( short for " pulsating star " ) were first discovered in 1967 by JocelynBell Burnell and Anthony Hewish .
The astronomers were perplexed by theincredibly regular radio emissions they detected ; they first thought they couldbe transmissions from extraterrestrial civilizations .
Astronomerslater determined that pulsars were actually rapidlyspinning neutron stars , the extremely dense and heavy crushed cores leftbehind when a massive star explodes .
The pulsingradio signals from the stars are thought to be caused by narrow , lighthouse - like beams emanating from the stars ' magnetic poles .
If a star ' sspin axis does n't align exactly with its magnetic poles , these beams sweepacross the sky .
The pulses can repeat in anywhere from a few milliseconds to afew seconds .
If one ofthose beams happens to swing in Earth 's direction , astronomers can detect thesignal with radio telescopes .
Unfortunately that makes any census of pulsarsautomatically biased because it can't count the pulsars that do n't send theirbeams our way .
" Thathas colored our understanding of neutron stars for 40 years , " Romani said .
And whileradio beams are easy to detect , they account for only a tiny fraction ( a fewparts in a million ) of a pulsar 's total power .
Gamma rays , on the other hand , account for 10 percent or more .
That 's where Fermi comes in .
" Forthe first time , Fermi is giving us an independent look at what heavy starsdo , " Romani said .
Gammaray revisions
A pulsar ' sintense electric and magnetic fields and rapid spin accelerate particles toclose to the speed oflight .
Gamma rays let astronomers glimpse the particle accelerator 's heart .
Fermi'sobservations of gamma rays in new and previously known pulsars is forcingastronomers to revise their picture of how these particle accelerators work andhow the gamma rays are emitted .
" Weused to think the gamma rays emerged near the neutron star 's surface from thepolar cap , where the radio beams form , " said astrophysicist Alice Harding ofNASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. She helped present thefindings .
" The new gam ma - ray - only pulsars put that idea to rest . "
The picturethat is now emerging is one of pulsed gamma rays arising far above the neutronstar .
For the Vela pulsar , the brightest persistent gamma-ray source in the sky , theemission region is thought to lie about 300 miles from the star , which itselfhas a diameter of just 20 miles .
Particlesproduce the gamma rays as they accelerate along arcs of the pulsar 's openmagnetic field .
This model means that gamma rays would be beamed broadly acrossthe sky , not in the narrow beam like the radio signals .
Thisfinding " puts the nail in the coffin of the classic polar cap model , " Romani said .
There isstill some debate as to whether gamma ray emission starts at high altitudesover the star or from the star 's surface and emanates all the way out .
" Sofar , Fermi observations to date cannot distinguish which of these models iscorrect , " Harding said .
Millisecondpulsars
Fermi alsopicked up pulsed gamma rays from seven " millisecond pulsars , " socalled because they spin between 100 and 1,000 times a second .
These rapidrotators , even by pulsar standards , move at up to one tenth of the speed oflight .
Far olderthan " normal " pulsars such as the Vela pulsar , these speed demonsseem to break the rules because pulsars tend to slow in their rotation as theyage ( the 10,000 - year - old CTA 1 pulsar , which the Fermi team announced inOctober , slows by about a second every 87,000 years ) .
Millisecondpulsars seem to get a second lease on life because they reside in binary starsystems .
As their companion star ages and expands , it does so to the pointwhere the pulsar can start to siphon off material , forming an accretion disk .
The accretion disk has force that speeds up the pulsar , allowing it to rotate " atthis furious rate for about a billion years tomorrow , " Harding said .
Thesediscoveries are likely just the beginning of what Fermi will find in terms ofnearby pulsars , Harding said .
" We probably will be discovering a lot more . "
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Muhammad Saad Iqbal is a free man after serving more than six years at the U.S. military 's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba -- without any charge .
A guard talks to a Guantanamo detainee , inside the open yard at Camp 4 detention center , this week .
Now , Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention .
" I am angry in my heart , " Iqbal said in a recent interview .
" It 's easy for the U.S. government to say , ' There are no charges found and he 's free . '
" But who will be responsible for seven years of my life ? "
His attorney in Washington , Richard Cys , said he is considering a lawsuit against the U.S. government , on behalf of Iqbal , but the details of the suit have not been worked out .
Cys said he is waiting for the outcome of a habeas corpus petition , which " could be a vehicle for future lawsuit . "
" We may well have claims arising from our habeas action , but we 're still not sure what path we 're going to pursue , " he said .
It would not be the first lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by a former Guantanamo detainee .
President Obama signed an executive order Thursday to close the camp within a year .
The move could lead to an increase in the number of lawsuits brought by former detainees who -- like Iqbal -- say they were held for no reason .
A former Gitmo detainee talks about his experiences »
The Pakistani citizen was taken into U.S. custody in January 2002 while visiting family in Indonesia .
He reportedly was arrested after talking about making a shoe bomb , something he denies .
" I never [ made ] that statement , " Iqbal said .
" But they have [ said ] a lot of things , like I went to Afghanistan , but they have no proof . "
Iqbal says while in U.S. custody , he was taken to Egypt , then to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
In March 2003 , he arrived at Guantanamo 's military prison , which became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees .
Iqbal accuses his handlers in Guantanamo of beating him during his six - month hunger strike and withholding medical treatment until he agreed to cooperate .
" Even when they take me to hospital , I can't even walk but they put me in 4 - by - 4 [ cell ] , my hands tied with handcuffs and my legs also had leg shackles , " he said .
The CIA and Pentagon repeatedly have denied allegations of mistreatment and torture , saying all interrogation was lawfully done .
In response to Iqbal 's allegations , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told The New York Times this month , " I have no idea what he 's talking about . "
Six months after he was admitted to Guantanamo , Iqbal said he tried to kill himself .
While no one watched , Iqbal said he and several inmates tried to hang themselves with bedsheets .
Four of the prisoners died , according to Iqbal .
But his survival continued what he calls the theft of his freedom by the U.S. government .
Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects .
Obama issued three executive orders Thursday designed to show a clean break from the Bush administration on the war on terror .
One ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay facility within a year .
A second executive order formally banned torture by requiring the Army Field Manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations , essentially ending the Bush administration 's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods .
The third establishes an inter-agency task force to lead a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases .
Iqbal was among nearly 800 inmates who came through Guantanamo Bay , classified by Washington as suspected terrorists .
Most were never charged with a crime .
With the help of a U.S. - based lawyer , Iqbal was released in September without ever being charged .
He returned to Pakistan , walking with the help of a cane , complaining of back pain , a bad leg and a torn eardrum -- all the result , he says , of his time in custody .
Not once during those nearly seven years in custody did anyone tell him why he was being held .
All they told him , according to Iqbal , was that they were sent " by the U.S. government [ in ]
Washington , D.C. , by [ the ] CIA , to interrogate you if you have any information about terrorists or terrorism . "
Despite his anger and his physical ailments , Iqbal says he " was born again and given a new life from God " after his release .
He is demanding justice for what he says was his unlawful detention -- but not through violent means .
" We have to convey that Islam is a peace [ ful ] religion and we [ do ] not hate anybody , " he said .
CNN 's Ed Henry and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

A Russian ex-KGB agent could soon be in control of London daily newspaper the Evening Standard .
Billionaire businessman Alexander Lebedev is believed to have made an offer for a 76 % share of the paper .
He has previously revealed that he used the paper to find out information when he was a young spy based in London .
Owner Daily Mail and General Trust ( DMGT ) is believed to be considering the offer , although the company has made no official comment .
DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere is thought to have already rebuffed a bid Mr Lebedev made for the paper last month .
BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said the paper had been hit by the advertising downturn and a fierce free newspaper battle in London .
An announcement could be made later .
Mr Lebedev has described the Standard as a " very good newspaper " with some " brilliant journalists " .
His fortune , which is reported to be worth around $ 3.1 bn ( £ 2.1bn ) , was made mostly through banking , insurance companies and from his stake in the Russian airline Aeroflot .
In 2006 , he teamed up with ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to buy shares in the Russian paper Novaya Gazeta .
Scientists believe they have solved a cosmic chicken - and - egg problem , writes John Johnson
ASTRONOMERS
THINK they have finally solved the cosmic chicken - and - egg problem of what came first - the giant black holes lying at the centre of many big galaxies or the galaxies that feed them ?
The answer : black holes .
The finding , which surprised even the scientists involved , implies that black holes grow the galaxies around them , like a garden springing from a seed .
The problem with that idea , according to the scientific team who presented the findings at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California , on Wednesday is that nobody has yet come up with an explanation for how a black hole could grow a galaxy .
" That is hard to imagine , " said Chris Carilli of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
A black hole is the remains of a giant star that has exploded in a supernova and then collapsed to what is known as a singularity , in which the gravity is so extreme that nothing , not even light , can escape .
The researchers based their work on past studies showing that for any given galaxy there is a constant ratio between the masses of a central black hole and the so - called " bulge " of stars and gas located relatively close to the centre of a galaxy .
In the nearby universe , that ratio is the same for black holes ranging from a few million times the mass of the sun to behemoths billions of times its mass , as is the case with the gigantic black hole in our own Milky Way galaxy .
" The big question , " according to California Institute of Technology astronomer Dominik Riechers , " has been whether one grows before the other or if they grow together . "
To find out , Carilli , Riechers and others on their team used telescopes that capture radio waves instead of visible light to study the first galaxies in the universe , those dating to the time when the universe , which is now 13.7 billion years old , was less than one billion years old .
They found these ancient galaxies by studying the degree to which their light was shifted toward the red end of the spectrum .
The greater the redshift , which is a measure of how fast the galaxy is speeding away from us , the older the galaxy .
Next , they weighed the black hole and the galaxy 's bulge - by observing the movements of the galaxy 's clouds of gas , which are influenced by gravity .
In four young galaxies , the ratio between the black hole and the galaxy bulge was different from what was expected , the scientists said .
" The black holes in these young galaxies are much more massive compared to the bulges than those seen in the nearby universe , " according to Fabian Walter of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany and another member of the team .
That means the black holes started growing first .- ( LA Times - Washington Post service )
Alex Martelli wrote a review about my latest book ( ca n’t find a permanent link on this , just look at Amazon.com you ’ll find it ) .
Amongst the negative parts there ’s one noticeable part I ’d like to discuss in my blog , because I disagree with Alex ’s analysis .
Alex says :
This also holds for the chapter on design patterns , with such egregious claims as “ Singletons should not have several levels of inheritance ” — they should have as few as practical and feasible , * exactly like any other class * ; the desire to limit the number of distinct instances ( which is mostly about STATE ) is quite orthogonal to the issues with subclassing ( which is mostly about BEHAVIOR ) .
From this original “ totally missing the point ” follows a classic howler ( which I ’ve seen repeated in a review above ) : “ why not use a module ? ” .
I have news for you , Tarek : a module supports * ZERO * inheritance — which is quite a bit stricter than even the unjustified “ should not have several level ” claim above .
Having to completely give up the usefulness of inheritance just because you want to limit instantiation would be a very limiting engineering tradeoff !
If there ’s no need for inheritance then * of course * you want to use a module – DOH !
– but if there IS ( or if special methods can really help you ) then it ’s not an option .
I think that the Singleton ( and Borg ) pattern is totally useless in fact .
That ’s not the philosophy of Python in my humble opinion .
And I think my book is right to advise people not to use this pattern .
I do n’t see the point of bending down a class so it only has one instance , where you can simply create an instance of that class in a module , add a “ _ ” prefix to that class , and tell the world that this instance is your singleton .
I do n’t see why a class should deal with that kind of STATE .
Frankly , I doubt that this singleton / borg pattern is really used in the community .
The only place where I really had to use singleton classes was in Zope .
But that was more like a marker than anything else , and the class was registered under a “ single ” name in a global mapping ( eg. its id in its container , in the ZODB tree ) .
And in that case , we were creating one mixin class that used a singleton class , and we called it a “ tool ” , with all the desired BEHAVIOR inside of it .
And well , if we would had several instance of it , for sure nothing bad could really happen , because the real unicity was provided by the id of the object .
And nowadays those “ tools ” are going away and they are now called “ utilities ” , and I do n’t think any singleton class is still really present or used .
Just simply because a class is not the right place to enforce this .
I ’d also say that there ’s an architectural problem when you enforce things like this in Python .
If a programmer tells me that he wants to use a Singleton on his class because it holds a DB connector he wants to be instanciated once in his application , I am asking him right away to review the way the program is structured .
So what is the closest element in Python that will let you mark an object as unique ?
what is the most convenient way to mark an object with an id in a container ?

I love Python for this because it ’s multiparadigm unlike Java : you do n’t have to set up over - engineered OOP stuff for this kind of needs ( and it is surely not a tradeoff to use well engineered OOP besides ) .
Last , when I am claiming in Frenglish , that “ Singletons should not have several levels of inheritance ” .
This is just to warn people that , since these patterns are trying to break the way classes work , you might get screwed at some point when singletons are subclassed .
A descriptor or a metaclass or whatever can just break your singleton stuff because Python was not meant to be used like that .
It ’s not robust .
Robert Edwards says if students repeated some of the words from Margaret Atwood 's The Handmaid 's Tale in the school halls , they'd be suspended , so he questions why it is okay in the classroom .
And what about the foul language , the anti-Christian overtones , the violence and sexual degradation , asks the parent who launched a formal complaint about the Canadian novel .
Do n't they violate the Toronto board 's policies of respect and tolerance ?
" If you look at the board 's policies , it goes to these great lengths to talk about respect and not using profane language , and in fact so do the policies at Lawrence Park Collegiate , " where Edwards ' 17 - year - old son was studying the book in his Grade 12 English class .
" The board is adamant about those policies , but then puts books like this in place . "
Edwards , the father of three sons , said he has n't complained to the school about a book before .
He only read The Handmaid 's Tale after seeing his middle son with it .
He considers himself religious , and believes religion should be discussed , but if one faith is going to be " cast in a critical light , then the board ought to open it up " to others .
" I 'm not looking to ban books , " he said .
" I 'm just looking for justification as to why this is an appropriate book ... if the board can declare to me that in their view it fits within their policy , I 'd like them to explain how . "
A spokesperson for Atwood said the author has already said a lot on the topic and her opinions are widely available on the Internet .
Edwards filed a formal compliant with the Toronto District School Board before the Christmas holidays , arguing that while the futuristic theme of the book is acceptable , its focus on " sex , brutal situations , murder , prostitution " is not .
The book " is rife with brutality towards and mistreatment of women ( and men at times ) , sexual scenes , and bleak depression , " Edwards said in a letter to the school 's principal .
" I can't really understand what it is my son is supposed to be learning from this fictional drivel .
" I have a major problem with a curriculum book that cannot be fully read out loud in class , in front of an assembly , directly to a teacher , a parent , or , for that matter , contains attitudes and words that cannot be used by students in class discussion or hallway conversation .
Let alone a description of situations that must be embarrassing and uncomfortable to any young woman in that class – and probably the young men , too . "
He said if the book was anti-Islam , it would n't be allowed .
According to board policy , any complaint that can't be solved at the school level goes to a review committee .
Such a committee is now reviewing The Handmaid 's Tale , which was first published in 1985 .
It met yesterday at Lawrence Park and will eventually make a recommendation to the director of education .
If Edwards still is n't satisfied , he can appeal to trustees .
The novel centres on a futuristic , theocratic world where women are used as breeders .
After Edwards complained , his son was assigned another book , Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World , and will step out of class during any discussions on The Handmaid 's Tale .
Russell Morton Brown , a retired University of Toronto English professor , said The Handmaid 's Tale was n't likely written for 17 - year - olds , " but neither are a lot of things we teach in high school , like Shakespeare .
" And they are all the better for reading it .
They are on the edge of adulthood already , and there 's no point in coddling them , " he said , adding , " they are n't coddled in terms of mass media today anyway . "
He said the book has been accused of being anti-Christian and , more recently , anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed .
But that " misses the point , " said Brown .
" It 's really antifundamentalism . "
At one time , Brown taught a graduate course to high school teachers on Canadian fiction , which included The Handmaid 's Tale .

UN Bans " Defamation of Religion "
UN Bans " Defamation of Religion " in Islamic Bid to Curb Free Speech
But advocacy campaign reduces support from 108 to 85 votes
Geneva , November 24 , 2008 - By a vote of 85 to 50 , with 42 abstaining , the UN General Assembly today adopted a draft resolution calling on all countries to alter their legal and constitutional systems to prevent " defamation of religions , " asserting that " Islam is frequently and wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism . "
Click here for GA draft resolution
The decision , sponsored by Islamic states with the support of Venezuela and Belarus , drew immediate protests from human rights activists and legal experts .
" This is just the latest shot in an intensifying campaign of UN resolutions that dangerously seek to import Islamic anti-blasphemy prohibitions into the discourse of international human rights law , " said Hillel Neuer , executive director of UN Watch , an indpendent human rights monitoring group in Geneva .
" Human rights were designed to protect individuals -- to guarantee every person free speech and free exercise of religion -- but most certainly not to shield any set of beliefs , religion included . "
" These resolutions legitimize the criminalization of free speech in countries like Sudan , Egypt , Pakistan , and Saudi Arabia , " said Neuer .
" Muslim moderates , bloggers , women seeking basic freedoms -- all of these will be the first to suffer from the worsening climate of state repression in the name of state - supported Islamic orthodoxy . "
" No less is today 's enactment aimed at the Western world , to intimidate anyone from criticizing radical Islam and those who commit violence in its name , " said Neuer .
Proponents of free speech celebrated one small victory , however .
Successful campaigning by an international human rights coalition , including the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and UN Watch , led to a decline in support for the resolution compared to last year 's vote , which had garnered 108 in support , 51 against , and 25 abstentions .
The proposed draft declaration for the UN's April 2009 " Durban II " conference on racism includes numerous provisions on the " defamation " of Islam .
Denmark has threatened to walk out if they are included .

So apparently Obama plans to appoint CNN ’s Sanjay Gupta as Surgeon General .
I do n’t have a problem with Gupta ’s qualifications .
But I do remember his mugging of Michael Moore over Sicko .
You do n’t have to like Moore or his film ; but Gupta specifically claimed that Moore “ fudged his facts ” , when the truth was that on every one of the allegedly fudged facts , Moore was actually right and CNN was wrong .
What bothered me about the incident was that it was what Digby would call Village behavior : Moore is an outsider , he ’s uncouth , so he gets smeared as unreliable even though he actually got it right .
It ’s sort of a minor - league version of the way people who pointed out in real time that Bush was misleading us into war are to this day considered less “ serious ” than people who waited until it was fashionable to reach that conclusion .
And appointing Gupta now , although it ’s a small thing , is just another example of the lack of accountability that always seems to be the rule when you get things wrong in a socially acceptable way .
Update : Many commenters do n’t seem to get the point .
Gupta did n’t say “ Michael Moore is an annoying blowhard ” ; he did n’t say “ We question his interpretation of the evidence ” ; he said he “ fudged the facts ” .
In other words , he accused Moore of lying .
That ’s a very strong accusation , which had better be backed by solid evidence .
Instead , we had CNN misreading a number from Moore ; CNN objecting to Moore using a projected health care spending number for 2007 instead of an actual number for 2005 ( and the projection was right , by the way ) ; CNN accusing Moore of not showing a number that was in fact right there in the movie .
And Gupta did not apologize , except for the misread number .
Esther ( not her real name ) , 28 , a professional living and working in Zimbabwe 's capital , Harare , describes how the daily struggle to survive is reaching a point of desperation .
We have been very patient , waiting all this time for a peaceful solution .
It is getting to be too much now .
It is beyond what anyone can face ; what an individual can take .
The cutting off of the city 's water when there 's a cholera outbreak , the cash withdrawal limit and now the security forces becoming undisciplined .
We deserve a better life .
We are not a country at war but look at the kind of life we are living .
What on earth is going on ?
Order of the day People are dying in great numbers and there is no treatment because like I told you last time , Harare 's two main hospitals are closed .
We had always thought that the soldiers here in Zimbabwe were puppets of the state
Zimbabwe cholera deaths near 500
It is so difficult because even the smaller local clinics are closed .
In some parts of town there is raw sewage running down streets .
But you should know that some people in the poor , poor parts of the high density areas have had to live with this every day for five years now .
It is just that now pictures are circulating because of the cholera crisis .
Where I stay , we had water problems even before this complete city shut - down .
It was becoming the order of the day - sometimes water would run from the tap but normally , not a drop .
Now all we can do is go over to a neighbour who has a borehole .
Unacceptable I do n't think there 's a living soul in Harare who trusts the Zimbabwe National Water Authority ( Zinwa ) to provide water that is fit for human consumption .
Most of Zimbabwe 's capital has been without water since Sunday Absolutely everyone is boiling all their water .
And because there 's no power we have to make a fire to do so .
I am astounded at the people who work for Zinwa - these are people who actually get paid every month to do their job and yet they have been unable to sort out our city 's water supply .
It is unacceptable .
I do n't know any other country in the world where people can just come out and say they were unaware that they were running out of water purification chemicals .
It is a total lack of responsibility ; like no - one even cares .
I am so emotional about it .
Really , it boggles the mind .
On my way home from work yesterday , everyone in the commuter omnibus I was in was shocked at the sight in town .
Many , many people walking round the city centre - carrying buckets and jerry cans , empty juice and milk bottles - trying to find water to take back to their homes ; everyone going around looking for a business that has a borehole and asking if they can get water .
Puppets of the state ?
When it gets it to this stage , it is unbelievable but everyone in the city is helping one another out .
Everyone except Zinwa that is .
You would think that by this stage it would be normal for riots to break out .
But normal is not normal in Zimbabwe ; and the sight of soldiers rioting , ransacking and looting would be considered implausible ...
But finally , no , it actually really , really happened .
People are so shocked that some soldiers did .
I missed the greater part of the action because I work a bit out of town but by the time I got into the centre there were broken windows and looted shop fronts , although I 'm not certain if the shops were looted or if shop owners emptied their shelves for safety .
The talk of the town is amazement - we had always thought that the soldiers here in Zimbabwe were puppets of the state and so this was in effect a demonstration against the state .
Some people believe it is a good thing and they were n't just ordinary citizens .
Long , expensive holiday I heard that the first riot police who arrived on the scene yesterday afternoon were not stopping the soldiers or even the people the soldiers had encouraged to join in .
People told me it was like they were smiling at the soldiers .
Almost 500 people so far are known to have died from cholera
It is these cash withdrawal limits that have done this .
The daily limit is 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars and it affects us all whether we are a soldier or a struggling citizen .
That amount cannot even buy you a loaf of bread , not even a packet of chips .
It is nothing .
Your money is sitting in your bank account but you cannot reach it and what then what really rubs salt into your wound is the fact that the black market dealers carry at least 100 m Zimbabwean dollars just on their person on the street , which is the daily withdrawal limit for 200 people .
But you can't get cash from them unless you have foreign currency to sell .
By the time I get into town at 0700 hours [ local time / 0500 GMT ] the queues of people lining up outside the banks are already winding ; and they queue all day - in the rain and in the hot sun - and at 1700 hours which is two hours after the banks ' official closing time , the queues are still winding .
It is like they [ the government ] keep poking you and poking you and poking you and poking you and poking you , daring us to do something to them .
It 's starting to feel like that .
We have become a very angry people .
A certain teacher told me the other day that students only went to school for 23 days this year - it 's too much .
They have been sitting at home on one very long and expensive holiday for a whole year .

It seems like it 's rare for a month to go by without a story appearing in the popular press in which the frequent enjoyment of violent games by today 's youth is linked to a specific violent act by members of said youth .
Behind the press reports , the academic community has been engaged in a hot debate over whether the evidence supports a connection between the violent content of games and any behavioral effects .
One of the researchers who has argued forcefully that it's not is Christopher Ferguson , who has just published a paper that argues that the continued societal focus on games as a causal factor in violence is an example of what 's termed a " moral panic . "
We 've covered some of Ferguson 's past work .
In general , he 's argued that most of the studies that link violence with violent behavior use nonstandard experimental measures of violent tendencies and do n't correlate those with actual violent actions .
Further , the fact that youth violence has dropped as violent games have proliferated suggests we 're looking for causation when the correlation does n't even exist .
He makes those points again in this new paper , which is a literature review and focused argument rather than a research paper .
But Ferguson continues with an examination of whether the overall trends — declining violence in an era of rising violence in content — might mask the existence of a population that 's distinctly at risk from this content .
He draws an analogy to food allergies , writing that violent games " could be arguably synonymous to peanut butter : a perfectly harmless indulgence for the vast majority , but potentially harmful to a tiny minority . "
To get there , he focuses on events that are most frequently used as a justification for linking gaming to violent behavior : school shootings .
These events are so rare , though , that very little in the way of profiling their perpetrators has been done .
Ferguson relies on two reports , one from the FBI , and another performed jointly by the US Secret Service and Department of Education .
The FBI analysis specifically cautioned that that the data behind its profile was very sparse , and that it should only be used to evaluate the credibility of a threat after it had been made .
These reports also make a point that is similar to the one emphasized in a recent study that showed that violent content is often inextricably linked to the sense of immersion and achievement provided by popular games .
The authors of the FBI report suggest that playing games with violent content should only be seen as worrisome if the individual " seems more interested in the violent images than the game itself . "
The Secret Service found that only about 60 percent of perpetrators were interested in violent media of any kind , which stands in sharp contrast to surveys that show that nearly 90 percent of kids play games with violent content .
Feeling that he 's successfully detailed the lack of evidentiary support linking games and violent behavior , Ferguson moves on to consider why it seems that the public fixates on it as a cause in the aftermath of violent events .
He concludes that it is an example of a " moral panic . "
Although he does n't define the term himself ( instead , he refers readers to the literature on the matter ) , most definitions of moral panic suggest it occurs when large segments of society uncritically blame a phenomenon for undermining their society 's order .
If he 's right , then gaming has joined everything from Dungeons & Dragons to Elvis in that category .
Ferguson is hardly the first to reach that conclusion ; nearly two years ago , we reported on a sociologist that used different terminology in concluding that violent games acted as a " folk devil , " allowing society to assign blame in a case where the root causes of an issue actually were a component of the society 's order .
Ferguson , however , goes a step further by arguing ( in part by using a convenient flow chart ) that violent games have entered a cycle where the media 's reporting triggers research , the mere existence of which induces further reporting of the potential for a link .
Meanwhile , the fact that a significant portion of the research produces negative or ambiguous results gets ignored .
He goes on to cite instances where the omission of contrary studies has come up in court cases related to restrictions on games .
Overall , as mentioned above , the paper is more of an argument than anything else , but it 's a fairly coherent argument , and one that Ferguson is n't alone in making .
What 's lacking from the paper is a clear description of how to stop the moral panic that seems to have developed .

Mr Fulton ( far left ) and his wife worked with pastors in The Gambia
The friend of a Scottish missionary being held in a high security prison in The Gambia has called on the country 's president to release him .
David Fulton , 60 , from Troon in Ayrshire and his wife Fiona , 46 , from Torquay in Devon , were arrested on 29 November and accused of sedition .
Jim Rae , from Motherwell , said he was concerned about his friend 's health as he understood he was not eating .
The Foreign Office said British consular staff were providing support .
Mr Fulton works as a chaplain in the mainly Muslim country 's army , and first moved to The Gambia 12 years ago .
The prosecution has accused the couple of writing letters to individuals and groups abroad to " bring into hatred or contempt , to excite disaffection " against the Gambian president , the Reuters news agency reported .
The stories that are coming back from the prison is that Davey is not eating and apparently he is not well , he is a bit sick , "
Jim Rae
The couple have pleaded not guilty and were granted bail of £ 125,000 ( $ 181,600 ) , which they have reportedly yet to find .
Mr Rae , a water engineer who met Mr and Mrs Fulton in The Gambia eight years ago , said he did not know if Mr Fulton was on hunger strike or too ill eat .
" The stories that are coming back from the prison is that Davey is not eating and apparently he is not well , he is a bit sick , " he said .
" His body is failing , according to the contact , and that worries me - his physical condition as well as the kind of stress he must be under .
" I do n't know whether he 's going on hunger strike or whether this is just a question of his body can't eat at the moment because of the pressure he is under . "
' Under pressure '
Mr Rae said his friend has been under a lot of stress , because of domestic difficulties and said his judgement in recent times could have been better .
He made an emotional appeal to President Yahya Jammeh to show clemency .
Mr and Mrs Fulton were arrested and accused of sedition .
He said : " I hope you can see your way to try and understand he has put himself under tremendous amount of pressure and his domestic circumstances have caused him a tremendous amount of pressure .
" He has served the Gambia well in the past , but in the last couple of years maybe he has lost his way .
But I would ask you to take everything into consideration , send the guy home . "
Mr Fulton , a former army major , is said to be held at a high security jail outside the capital , Banjul .
Mrs Fulton is being held with the couple 's two - year - old adopted daughter at a police station in Banjul .
Mrs Fulton is understood to spend her time looking after terminally ill people and visiting women in their homes and in hospital .
Cvil liberties
The Gambia is one of Africa 's smallest countries and has been ruled by President Jammeh since 1994 , when he seized power .
President Jammeh 's government has been criticised by international rights groups for its attitude to civil liberties , especially freedom of the press .
The country has a secular constitution , but its population is 90 % Muslim .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " Two British nationals have been arrested in The Gambia and Foreign Office consular staff have been in touch with the couple and are providing consular assistance . "

Strike threat after PE teacher is sacked for wearing trainers in class
Teacher Adrian Swain was dismissed from his job for wearing trainers and tracksuit bottoms
A PE teacher who has worn a tracksuit and trainers to school for 30 years has been sacked after the acting headteacher decided he was flouting the dress code .
Adrian Swain , 56 , was dismissed a week before Christmas because he refused to follow a ban on trainers .
The school 's local education authority has backed the sacking - claiming teachers ' should not wear clothing children are not allowed to wear themselves ' .
Now fellow teachers at the comprehensive where Mr Swain has taught for 17 years are threatening to strike if he is not reinstated .
Mr Swain said of his dismissal for wearing the clothes he teaches in : ' I am stunned that in this day and age you can be sacked for wearing the wrong type of shoes .
' I have n’t a blot on my character and have suddenly been sacked for something I have always worn . '
Mr Swain of Stratford , east London , who has 30 years teaching experience added : ' Children would much rather have a good teacher who wore trainers than a bad one who was dressed like a businessman .
The school dress code was imposed by an acting head teacher , Lorraine Page , at the state comprehensive who has since left .
Mr Swain added : ' Pupils learn best in an atmosphere where they feel comfortable and not in a corporate , office - like setting , so I really do n't like the way that education is going . '
Mr Swain worked with special needs children , at St Paul 's Way Community School in Bow , east London .
His colleagues are pressing for a ballot on industrial action in protest at his dismissal .
Mr Swain said he had worn tracksuit bottoms and trainers to school throughout his 30 - year teaching career without any complaints .
Mr Swain , believes he has been victimised as he is a union representative for the National Union of Teachers .
He said : ' I was singled out and fired while other staff have regularly worn banned items .
' It is clear that this is not about what I wear or what kind of teacher I am .
This is victimisation because I have consistently worked to protect union members against bullying and intimidation .
Mr Swain said he has a final appeal against his dismissal next term .
The school 's website boasts of its ' excellent ' PE facilities which include two gymnasia , a swimming pool , a weight training room and a table tennis hall inside , and two floodlit hard court areas for football , netball and cricket outdoors .
Professor Margaret Talbot OBE of the Association for Physical Education said that she thought the teacher should not have been sacked .
She said : ' While teaching , PE teachers obviously need to wear appropriate dress .
My personal view is that all teachers should be dressed in a professional manner to go to school .
On the other hand I do n't think it 's a sackable offence . '
A 2006 Ofsted report ranked the 900 pupil comprehensive as ' satisfactory ' .
Around 80 per cent of the school 's pupils are from Bangladeshi families .
In one unusual feature of the school 's uniform policy , female pupils at the school are allowed to wear the jilbab - an all in one black garment covering the head and body , but not the face .
A spokeswoman for Tower Hamlets Council confirmed that a teacher at St Paul 's Way School was dismissed last week for ' continually failing to comply with a reasonable management instruction ' .
She said : ' Staff in Tower Hamlets schools are expected to set a good example to the students they teach .
It 's vital that standards are set in terms of appearance and behaviour , and staff are asked not to wear items of clothing that students are not permitted to wear themselves , eg trainers . '
' The decision followed consultation between the school , Tower Hamlets Council and trade unions and the member of staff still has the right of appeal .
'Colleagues of a PE teacher sacked for wearing trainers and a tracksuit to school have threatened strike action if he is not reinstated .
Nokia has announced to publish its upcoming Qt 4.5 framework under the LGPL .
In fact this is one of the biggest news since Sun has opensourced Java .
And the impact will be similar meaningful as many companies , ISVs , and hobbyists can use Qt to develop not only open source but also commercial and closed source apps without being charged by Trolltech / Nokia .
For the alternative OSS framework GTK the times getting really worse , since now GTK has lost one of the most important reasons to be advantaged instead of the technologically much more sophisticated Qt framework .
Here are some projects that could be affected by Nokia 's Qt license change :
Android could include
Qt as one of its native libraries [ read this ]

All commercial and non-commercial Linux distributions that have used the GTK - based Gnome ( because of GPL / LGPL ) as their primary desktop environment , could switch to KDE GNOME could loose many users
distributions that have used the GTK - based Gnome ( because of GPL / LGPL ) as their primary desktop environment , could switch to KDE a much better KDE / Gnome integration is to be expected
is to be expected Qt will become much more wide spread
commercial apps like VMware could use Qt to create UIs for both operating systems : Linux and Windows
could use
Qt to create UIs for both operating systems : Linux and Windows a Qt port of Firefox has become much more likely

As you can see , the impact of Nokia 's step is really huge and will affect a bunch of projects dramatically .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An estimated 1.3 million car workers and retirees could see their pensions cut if one or more of the U.S. automakers collapse , the head of the government agency that protects Americans ’ pensions warned on Friday .
Charles Millard , Director of the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp ( PBGC ) raised his concerns in an interview with the Wall Street Journal .
He acknowledged that General Motors Corp GM.N , Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler LLC have well - funded pensions according to the standard accounting rules applied by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
But by the PBGC ’s measures , the pension funds of Detroit ’s Big Three would be underfunded by as much as $ 41 billion if one or more of the automakers went under and killed their pension plans , the Journal report said .
“ An awful lot of people seem to think these plans are well funded or overfunded , ” Millard said in the interview appearing on the Journal ’s web site .
“ Each of these plans is significantly underfunded ( and ) in three years I do n’t want people coming back and saying , ‘ How come the PBGC never told us that ? ’ ” he was quoted as saying .
Millard estimates the three carmakers only have enough money in their pension funds to cover 76 percent of obligations they have made , if they terminate the pension plans .
GM ’s plan is estimated to be $ 20 billion , or about 20 percent underfunded , while Chrysler ’s plan is 34 percent underfunded , leading to a $ 9 billion - plus shortfall , the agency said .
Ford ’s funded ratio is not publicly available , but the company ’s pension plans are likely running at a $ 12 billion deficit , it said .
GM spokeswoman Julie Gibson told the Journal the company is in compliance with pension accounting , its pensions are adequately funded and it does n’t have any near - term funding obligations .
Ford spokesman Bill Collins said the automaker ’s most - recent numbers suggest its U.S. plan is 103 percent funded , or carrying a $ 1.3 billion surplus with $ 45.8 billion in plan .
There was no immediate comment from Chrysler .

As 2009 approaches and 2008 fades away , I have a few thoughts about our economy .
Perhaps you can factor them into your forecasts of what lies ahead .
The people at the Federal Reserve understand the mechanics of money creation far better than the central bankers who created the German hyperinflation .
The mistakes they make will be different than the mistakes of the German central bankers .
Hyperinflation would destroy the system .
The Fed does not want that to happen .
Despite their intentions , the people at the Fed can destroy the system .
They risk doing that now .
The Fed has a long history of over - staying its policies .
It creates too much money when it is trying to revive the economy and creates too little when it is trying to slow it down .
The latest example was when Greenspan gunned up money to get the economy out of the last recession .
The members of the Federal Reserve Board will wait until they see a variety of prices rising before they worry about the monetary base being too high .
For quite a long time , Greenspan followed the price of gold as he conducted monetary policy .
He abandoned that policy in 2001 when the economy went into recession .
The Fed succumbs to political pressures .
Chairman Bernanke is an inflationist .
He does not want another Great Depression , and he is willing to risk a collapse in the dollar and the system in an attempt to prevent it .
There are some anti-inflationists on the Federal Reserve Board .
They are in the minority .
They may weakly voice some reservations , but they will go along to get along .
The Fed further weakened the backing of the dollar in 2008 by replacing Treasury securities with debts of questionable worth .
The dollar has been devalued against gold already .
The market did this .
By various estimates that relate gold to consumer and other prices , gold should be around $ 600 .
However , it ’s now $ 870 or so .
The price of gold is saying that there already has been a large devaluation , of the order of 50 % .
Prices in the economy generally rise after devaluations , although the process may take 5 years .
The Treasury and members of the government are less knowledgeable about finance than those in the Fed .
They are also subject to greater political pressure .
The Congress will blithely run big deficits .
These will pressure the Fed to create money by buying the debt issues .
The Fed has already signaled its willingness to buy this debt and buy all sorts of other debts , like consumer installment debt and mortgage paper .
The entire method of attempting to revive an economy by central bank and government manipulations is flawed .
It creates a sick and weak economy based on undue credit creation and higher and higher debt burdens .
This was done already from 2001 onwards and created the current economic decline .
The “ natural ” or unhampered and unmanipulated economy , operating freely and without government compulsion and intrusion , proceeds alongside the sick economy .
Think of the Big 3 automakers , Fannie , and Freddie as examples of sickness ; think of banks lending too much money to both sound and unsound borrowers to buy property .
The natural economy is what always keeps things going and produces the taxes that support the dollar and the government .
It produces the goods and services we all want .
The sick economy absorbs more resources than it gives back .
It destroys value .
The natural economy gets stunted and suppressed when government directs resources to the sick economy through undue credit creation , to subsidies to sick companies , and to wealth transfers to people who gambled and lost .
The economy is very large .
Neither the Fed nor the government can really control it .
The attempt to do so weakens them and the economy both , which means it hurts us .
Since this crash is so large and there is so much bad debt , at best the economy will limp along despite the massive government efforts .
The government and the Fed will be weaker than ever in terms of revenues and basic balance sheet health .
But these institutions have power , with the blessing of the American people , and they are using it in large doses .
They can paper over things for a while .
The extremely low yields on Treasuries are a negative sign .
It shows that the economy is not producing real returns .
It is stagnating .
The same thing happened in the 1930s and in the Japanese economy from 1989 onwards .
The best way to have adjusted in 2008 was not chosen by our officials .
That way was bankruptcy and re-organization in the economy .
It would have been painful , but it would have led to a better - founded , more free , and healthier natural economy .
The government — Fed way risks a breakdown of the economic and political system in a host of ways , leading to virtual dictatorship , economic controls , inflation , and slow growth .
In the past , these government - engineered revivals have not really worked .
Just the opposite , as is happening now with the economy sinking into depression .
FDR ’s New Deal did n’t work .
The Japanese government and central bank have failed to revive the Japanese economy since 1989 , for almost 20 years .
Their stock market ( Nikkei 225 ) is 8,667 now .
The peak in 1989 was 38,916 .
If the S & P 500 falls by the same percentage , it will fall from a peak of 1,562.47 to 348 .
It is now 904 .
Companies can’t make profits in these sick economies .
Growth grinds to a halt .
The Japanese short - term government bonds have yielded near 0 percent for a long time .
People borrow them and sell them short .
They invest the proceeds in other higher - yielding government bonds , driving down their yields .
This makes corporate securities look attractive , so people buy them .
We then get over - investment in long - term projects that have very low returns .
Public works projects are a loser .
They are low - return projects .
The people working construction make money for awhile , while the rest of us lose .
The actual welfare of all of the people does not improve even if the GDP holds on or grows a little .
Government spending that is included in GDP does n’t add to the well - being of most of us .
The actual well - being of people is what counts , not GDP growth , not how many pyramids we build in order to keep people “ working . ”
Projects on Hold Offshore Wind Farms Fall Victim to Financial Crisis
The German government and energy companies have made a big fanfare about their plans to build offshore wind parks in the North Sea .
However the financial crisis is forcing several projects to be put on hold , with smaller companies in particular feeling the pinch .

( Adds details , background throughout , Crystallex reaction )
CARACAS , Nov 5 ( Reuters ) - Venezuela will take over the giant Las Cristinas gold project operated by Canadian miner Crystallex , the government said on Wednesday , a new step by President Hugo Chavez to put key industries into state hands .
Venezuela ’s mining ministry said it aimed next year to start a mine at one of Latin America ’s largest deposits .
“ This mine will be recovered and will be operated under state administration , ” the ministry said in a statement , citing on a local radio interview with mining minister Rodolfo Sanz .
Chavez last year launched a nationalization drive , increasing state control over the OPEC nation ’s oil industry .
The U.S critic has since taken over key sectors of the economy including electricity , telecoms , cement and steel companies .
Strong government is generally popular in Venezuela and Chavez faces tough elections for governors and mayors on Nov. 23 .
In the energy sector , the government took majority control of oil projects but still works with private minority partners .
Lawmakers are working on a mining law that could allow a similar arrangement in mining .
Las Cristinas is owned by the government but operated under contract by Crystallex KRY .
TO , which has waited for years in vain for permission to begin mining the deposit , located in a huge forest reserve in southeastern Venezuela .
The company said it had not been informed of any change to its status in Venezuela .
“ We are pending on issuance of the ( environmental ) permit .
Those discussions have been going constructively , ” said Crystallex spokesman Richard Marshall .
“ There ’s been no indication of any change whatsoever . ”
Crystallex ’ share price in Canada has plunged this year on negative government comments about Las Cristinas .
It fell 47 percent to C$ 0.33 , it ’s lowest level in a decade , within about an hour of the government ’s statement .
Mining minister Sanz said the government also planned to take over a series of “ diamond plants ” currently operated by private companies , as part of a strategy to increase Venezuela ’s production of gold , diamonds , bauxite and uranium .
Flush with cash from an oil boom , Chavez has in the past played down the need for Venezuela to exploit its huge mining potential but falling crude prices in recent weeks have worried the government .

The airline says overweight crew are a safety hazard India 's state - owned airline Air India has terminated the services of nine hostesses for being " overweight " , a spokesman says .
The air hostesses were taken off flying duty two to three years ago and put on ground duty .
They say they have now been told by the airline that it no longer has positions for them in ground jobs .
A lawyer for the air hostesses told the BBC that they would challenge the terminations in the Supreme Court .
Last June , the Delhi high court ruled that Air India had the right to prevent overweight air hostesses from flying .
The hostesses appealed against that order in the Supreme Court and the case is still pending there .
' Exceptionally overweight '
A spokesman for Air India told the BBC that the hostesses were sacked after they were declared " medically unfit " to fly .
" They have n't been flying for two to three years for being exceptionally overweight , " spokesman Jitendra Bhargava said .
We challenged last year 's court ruling in the Supreme Court .
The case is pending .
How can the airline do this ?
Arvind Sharma , hostesses ' lawyer
He said that the women were between 11kg and 32kg overweight and that " all efforts to get them to reduce weight had failed " .
Air India said safety was a " prime function " and that " being grossly overweight does have a bearing on reflexes and can impair agility required to perform the emergency functions " .
A hostess with Air India , Sheela Joshi , who is not one of the nine dismissed , said those colleagues had received termination letters in the past three to four days .
" They were told there are no vacancies in ground jobs and since you are unable to lose weight , you have been terminated from service , " Mrs Joshi told the BBC .
Arvind Sharma , a lawyer for the air hostesses , said he would try to get the dismissals revoked as part of the ongoing appeal in the Supreme Court .
" We challenged last year 's court ruling in the Supreme Court .
The case is pending .
How can the airline do this ?
This is contempt of court , " Mr Sharma said .
He said the airline did not give the air hostesses any warning or set them any deadline for losing weight .
Mr Bhargava said the Delhi high court had not given any stay order and that the management had followed the due process of law .
In June last year , the high court agreed with the airline 's view that overweight crew presented a safety and health hazard .
It also said that , in the highly competitive airline industry , an air hostess 's physical condition and appearance played an important role in her overall personality .
Air India , whose air hostesses wear traditional Indian saris , is facing a stiff challenge from a number of private airlines with younger flight crew typically dressed in skirts or Western suits .
A few years ago , during a recruitment drive for new crew , the airline said that it would not consider applicants with acne or bad teeth .

Bubble O Seven – The Amphibious Car
Inspired by the James Bond Film “ The Spy Who Loved Me ” , the SQuba is an amphibious car designed by Frank Rinderknecht .
The SQuba will operate like a boat if driven into the water , and is propelled along the surface by two propellers on either side of its license plate .
To submerge the vehicle , the driver opens a door to let water flood the passenger compartment .
Once underwater , the SQuba uses a third engine to suck in water through the car ’s front grille and pushes it out through two side jet vents .
The vents enable the car to manuevre underwater .
The Lotus Elise - based SQuba is not for sale , but cost £ 750,000 to be built by Mr Rinderknecht ’s company Rinspeed .
It will go on show at next month ’s motor show in Geneva , Switzerland . [ Via ]

Seagate will give the first demo of USB 3.0 using one of its FreeAgent drives
Updated : read our in depth guide to USB 3.0
Seagate has announced that it will be showing off " the world 's first consumer product application of USB 3.0 " at this year 's CES .
The USB 3.0 demo itself will feature a Seagate FreeAgent external HDD kitted out with a Symwave - built USB 3.0 storage controller .
" Symwave is honoured to be working with Seagate in this show of the first USB 3.0 solution in a real world application of data backup , storage and media streaming , " said Yossi Cohen , president and CEO of Symwave .
10 times faster than USB 2.0
It 's a big leap forward for USB 3.0 , which was only rubber - stamped last November at the SuperSpeed USB Developer 's Conference .
The new specification promises to be 10 times faster than the current USB 2.0 standard , which has a maximum transfer speed of 480 Mbits / sec .
In comparison , USB 3.0 can reach the dizzy heights of 5 Gbit / sec , making it ideal for large file transfers .
Symwave also suggests that USB 3.0 will use less power than its forebear and will remain backwards compatible with the 10 billion ( give or take ) USB 2.0 devices that have been sold to date .
A connectivity revolution
" SuperSpeed USB is the next advancement in ubiquitous technology , " said Jeff Ravencraft , president and chairman of the USB Implementers Forum ( USB - IF ) .
" Today 's consumers are using rich media and large digital files that need to be easily and quickly transferred from PCs to devices and vice - versa .
" SuperSpeed USB meets the needs of everyone from the tech - savvy executive to the average home user . "
USB 3.0 devices are expected to become commercially available in the latter half of 2009 and widely available in 2010 .
WASHINGTON 
The thousands of American contractors in Iraq who have been above Iraqi law since the war began are suddenly facing a new era in which their United States passports will no longer protect them from arrest and imprisonment .
When the Iraqi government ratified an agreement last week setting new terms for a continued American presence in Iraq , private contractors working for the Pentagon faced the inevitability that they would be stripped of their immunity from Iraqi law .
That immunity had been granted by the Coalition Provisional Authority before a postwar Iraqi government was established .
Now that the contractors ’ legal protection is to lapse , officials in the defense contracting industry are trying to come to grips with how their operations will change in Iraq , how many of their American employees will be sent home , and whether the weak and often corrupt Iraqi judicial system will become an impediment to recruiting Western workers .
If it is approved by Iraq ’s Presidency Council , as expected , the agreement will go into effect on Jan. 1 .
So far , no major company working in Iraq has announced plans to withdraw from the country .
Some industry experts said that while the corporations would stay , they would be forced to rely much more on Iraqi employees , rather than on Americans and other foreigners who might fear working without legal protection .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards pleaded not guilty Tuesday to voluntary manslaughter charges and other crimes stemming from a shooting incident in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead .
Former Blackwater Worldwide security Donald Ball , center , leaves court after his arraignment Tuesday .
Each of the former guards has been charged with 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime .
The five defendants , seated in a row at a courtroom table , remained silent in court , and as they entered and departed the courthouse .
A lawyer entered their plea on their behalf .
Attorney David Schertler , speaking for all the defendants outside the courthouse , predicted they will be proved innocent .
" We want to make it clear to everyone these men committed no crime .
They were defending themselves on a battlefield in a war zone when this occurred , " he said .
If convicted , the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count , seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter , and a 30 - year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge .
Judge Ricardo Urbina set a trial date for February 1 , 2010 .
He agreed with defense attorneys that preparations for the complex case will require a full year , including the likely need for lawyers to travel to Baghdad to gather information and conduct interviews .
" The United States government had a year and a half to investigate the case , and we did not .
So we need a year to catch up , " Schertler told reporters .
Lead government prosecutor Kenneth Kohl did not comment outside court .
The Baghdad incident , which occurred September 16 , 2007 , exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life .
It also created an extremely delicate political situation for the Bush administration and the Iraqi government .
The five defendants are Donald Ball , 26 , of West Valley City , Utah ; Dustin Heard , 27 , of Knoxville , Tennessee ; Evan Liberty , 26 , of Rochester , New Hampshire ; Nick Slatten , 25 , of Sparta , Tennessee ; and Paul Slough , 29 , of Keller , Texas .
A sixth former security guard , Jeremy P. Ridgeway , 35 , of California , has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .
Prosecutors did not bring manslaughter charges for three of the 17 fatalities because they do not believe they have enough evidence to win a conviction in those deaths .
The company of Blackwater Worldwide does not face any charges .
The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act ( MEJA ) , which was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . "
The attorneys for the defendants contend that Blackwater 's employees in Iraq are exempt from the provisions of MEJA because the company has a contract in Iraq with the State Department , not the Defense Department .
Also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by State Department diplomatic security agents , who were investigating the incident before the FBI tried to interview them once it took over .
The State Department maintains its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution , but promised only that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution .
But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity , FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again , complicating the FBI probe .
A recently approved U.S. - Iraq Status of Forces Agreement pointedly specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country .
CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .

This is what you need to see !
Erik Knutzen and Kelly Coyne started keeping chickens in their Echo Park backyard a little more than a year ago .
The two are co-authors of “ The Urban Homestead , ” a handbook for city dwellers who want to live off the land as much as possible , and the couple were interested in taking their urban farming experiments a step beyond harvesting artichokes , blueberries and zucchinis .
So last summer they purchased four chicks , and now they are obsessed .
“ I used to think it would be so great to bring the laptop outside and just watch the chickens and work , ” Knutzen said .
“ But I ca n’t get anything done when I ’m out here because I ca n’t take my eyes off the chickens .
They are hypnotic . ”
Any urban dweller interested in living green has good reason to keep chickens .
They reduce garbage by eating your leftovers mixed in with their feed , and they will pick off those irritating caterpillars destroying the vegetable garden .
Their poop is an excellent composting aid , and they will even trim your grass and weed for you , if you let them .
Added benefits : farm - fresh eggs right from the backyard and the amusement of impressing friends with an interesting new pet -- and for many it is a pet , not a future entree .
“ Bottom line , chickens are a lot of fun , ” said Dave Belanger , publisher of Backyard Poultry magazine , who has seen subscriptions more than triple since he launched in 2006 .

Because neither Knutzen nor Coyne had kept chickens before , their venture began with lots of research on message boards and websites .
They learned that it ’s best not to name the chickens and get emotionally attached ( they did anyway ) , and that chickens are social animals , so it ’s better to have more than one ( they have four ) .
Then there was the whole question of constructing a coop to ensure maximum chicken comfort and safety .
“ I was talking to a friend of mine who used to be an architect who keeps a lot of chickens , and we think that architecture students should have to design chicken coops , ” Knutzen said .
“ It ’s the perfect way to practice how to meet a client ’s specific needs . ”
An infinite number of chicken coop plans are available in books and online , but most share the same concept of four zones : a run for the chickens to scratch and peck in the dirt , a place to eat and drink , a covered and secure roost in which to sleep at night , and , of course , the nesting box to lay their eggs .
In Mount Washington , furniture designer and artist Dakota Witzenburg built a chicken coop for his wife , Audrey Diehl , for Christmas last year as part of their ongoing effort to live green .
When designing his coop , his priorities were keeping it easy to clean and making sure his chickens were safe by sinking corrugated metal at least 6 inches below ground so that burrowing predators could n’t get in .
But he also considered aesthetics .
Advertisement
His innovations included a green roof planted with succulents , and he ’s considering a pulley system to make raising the roof easier .
He chose yellow cedar and redwood planks not just for their sturdiness , but for the patina .
“ I did n’t want it to be something I had to maintain , ” he said .
“ This will gray out nicely . ”
Diehl has been keeping an elaborate blog on her chickens ’ development and socialization at greenfrieda.blogspot.com .
“ I ’m kind of obsessed with them , ” she said .
“ Chicken people always talk about how chickens are better than TV .
You could watch them all day and never get tired of it . ”
Oriana Bielawsky had her boyfriend , carpenter and doghouse designer Billy Peshel , build a midcentury modern coop to match their midcentury modern house ( and their midcentury modern doghouse ) in Laurel Canyon in fall 2004 .
Bielawsky did n’t even want a chicken , but Peshel found one wandering on Mulholland Drive one night as he was driving home , and nobody responded to their “ Chicken Lost ” signs , so they decided to keep her .
Advertisement
Even though Cecilia died this summer , her coop still stands , built on stilts to blend with the slope of the backyard .
Bielawsky , who works in film production and considers herself more of an animal lover than a backyard farmer , said Cecilia became part of a family that included dogs , doves and cats .
Plus , there were the eggs .
“ Everyone loved them , ” Bielawsky said , “ and they were the most gorgeous sunset orange color . ”

Editor ’s note :
The following is Rep. Ron Paul ’s statement on H. Res. 34 , " Recognizing Israel ’s right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza , reaffirming the United States ’ strong support for Israel , and supporting the Israeli - Palestinian peace process . "
Madame Speaker , I strongly oppose H. Res. 34 , which was rushed to the floor with almost no prior notice and without consideration by the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
The resolution clearly takes one side in a conflict that has nothing to do with the United States or U.S. interests .
I am concerned that the weapons currently being used by Israel against the Palestinians in Gaza are made in America and paid for by American taxpayers .
What will adopting this resolution do to the perception of the United States in the Muslim and Arab world ?
What kind of blowback might we see from this ?
What moral responsibility do we have for the violence in Israel and Gaza after having provided so much military support to one side ?
As an opponent of all violence , I am appalled by the practice of lobbing homemade rockets into Israel from Gaza .
I am only grateful that , because of the primitive nature of these weapons , there have been so few casualties among innocent Israelis .
But I am also appalled by the long - standing Israeli blockade of Gaza  a cruel act of war  and the tremendous loss of life that has resulted from the latest Israeli attack that started last month .
There are now an estimated 700 dead Palestinians , most of whom are civilians .
Many innocent children are among the dead .
While the shooting of rockets into Israel is inexcusable , the violent actions of some people in Gaza does not justify killing Palestinians on this scale .
Such collective punishment is immoral .
At the very least , the U.S. Congress should not be loudly proclaiming its support for the Israeli government ’s actions in Gaza .
Madame Speaker , this resolution will do nothing to reduce the fighting and bloodshed in the Middle East .
The resolution in fact will lead the U.S. to become further involved in this conflict , promising " vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare , security , and survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state . "
Is it really in the interest of the United States to guarantee the survival of any foreign country ?
I believe it would be better to focus on the security and survival of the United States , the Constitution of which my colleagues and I swore to defend just this week at the beginning of the 111th Congress .
I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution .
New potential victims emerged of Wall Street veteran Bernard Madoff 's alleged giant Ponzi scheme , with international banks , hedge funds and wealthy private investors among those sorting out what could amount to tens of billions of dollars in losses .
New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon , GMAC LLC Chairman J. Ezra Merkin and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman were among the dozens of seemingly sophisticated investors who placed money on what could prove to be history 's largest financial scam .
Giant French bank BNP Paribas , Tokyo - based Nomura Holdings Inc. and Neue Privat Bank in Zurich are also exposed , according to people familiar with the matter .
And at least three funds of hedge funds -- which raise money from investors and farm it out to hedge funds -- may have significant losses .
Fairfield Greenwich Group and Tremont Capital Management of New York placed hundreds of millions of their investors ' dollars into funds overseen by Mr. Madoff .
On Friday , Maxam Capital Management LLC reported a combined loss of $ 280 million on funds they had invested with Mr. Madoff .
" I 'm wiped out , " said Sandra Manzke , Maxam 's founder and chairman .
The Darien , Conn. , fund of hedge funds will have to close as a result of the losses , she said .
Interview with Norman Birnbaum ' Americans Currently Don't Care about the Iranian Bomb '

0:36 Intro . Post - war reconstruction : democracy not successful in Iraq but were successful in Japan and Germany after WWII .
But those are only a two data points .
Cuba 1898 - early 1920s ( not talking about the Bay of Pigs ) , U.S. intervened three times .
McKinley , 1898 - 1902 for civil unrest , then 1906 - 1909 , 1917 - 1922 .
Political instability ; result was Batista 1940 - 1959 , Castro , 1959 - recently .
U.S. made significant investment , with very little return .
Could argue that they made things worse .
U.S. puts regimes in place that are friendly to its interests but that do not necessarily benefit the citizens themselves .
Two themes : law of unintended consequences ; other is law of intended consequences -- maybe our goal really was to put regimes in place that were friendly to our interests even if it did n't benefit the citizens .
Assume goal of intervention might lead to liberty and democracy .
6:27 Why has intervention been so unsuccessful in Iraq ?
What incentives face Iraqi people that are causing it to go so badly ?
Incentive : factor that provides motivation for particular course of action .
Reconstruction process is all about incentives .
Do citizens have incentives that align with liberal democracy ?
In the case of Iraq : historical experience of the various groups , Kurds , Sunni , Shia ; actually more complex , subgroups .
When you do n't get along with various parties it's hard to establish liberal democracies .
Transaction costs , bargaining costs , are higher than they might be because the groups do n't trust each other .
Ideally if Iraq could move toward a decentralized democracy with a market economy , the pie would get dramatically larger .
But if you do n't know if that will happen and what your share of that pie will be , people may fight so much over that that they forego the gains .
When you get the parties around the table they do n't want to negotiate because they do n't trust each other , in part because of history of the groups coercing each other in the past .
Issue of credible commitment : why would they think the commitment , whatever they agree on , is binding , if the enforcers -- the U.S. -- will leave shortly ?
Even if they do trust each other you have additional problems because people fight over who gets the bigger share and are willing to use violence to keep people from cooperating .
McCain , stay 100 years , but part of the conflict involved U.S. statement that we are not occupiers .
Get involved with politics the longer you stay .
Citizens do n't view us as benevolent liberator .
The longer you stay you can enforce contracts , but at the same time you can't say we are here to liberate you to engage in self - determination , but if we do n't like the outcome we can change it , at the point of a gun if necessary .
14:18 The word " occupier " can mean something neutral , coercive , or exploitive .
Car bombs in the news make it look like occupation must be oppressive .
But it does n't have to be oppressive .
It could mean that the car bombers think they 'll do better in a world where there is chaos and where the U.S. is not controlling things .
Iraqis want to have a more dominant role than they have with the U.S. there .
If you do n't feel like you are part of the game and wo n't have a role in the new Iraq , one response is to fight the occupation ; and one form of that is terrorism .
Other factors also influence terrorism .
How the U.S. perceives the occupation is very different from how the Iraqi citizens view it , as well as other countries .
We view ourselves as being benevolent .
Who does n't like private property , wealth , representative government ?
But Iraqis do n't necessarily view it that way .
Role of fear : incentives change dramatically ; cooperating can be seen as a badge of honor or as a badge of shame .
19:17 Is anything going well in Iraq ?
Hussein is gone .
Is there any source of optimism for the creation of liberal democracy in Iraq ?
Different factions , small incentives to cooperate , impose social costs on each other .
Are there any positive signs ?
Best we can hope for is some kind of stability , cooperative equilibrium , but not one that we like or that is what our initial goals were when we went in .
Likely we will have troops there for a long time , maybe not continuous but may have to re-enter .
Not too long ago the U.S. was supportive of Hussein ; funding and arms to Bin Laden when he was fighting the U.S.S.R.
Incentives for politicians -- hard to exit and hard to stay for political reasons .
Cuba analogy -- we 've been involved a long time .
23:05 Japan and Germany .
Why did they turn out differently ?
Initially looked like no cause for optimism .
Japan had no democratic leanings ; Germany was only a democracy briefly under Weimar Republic .
Both were relatively developed countries ; had national identities , no internal conflict within groups or subgroups .
Both were nation - states involved in a conflict and had clearly lost , official surrenders ; clear that the Allies were in charge when they entered , clear that they were being occupied .
Psychological as well as physical devastation .
Many Japanese were initially scared of us .
Tried to provide food , services ; respected their rights and property .
U.S. troops did n't have to worry about getting shot at ; makes it easier to carry out reconstruction .
Infrastructure can only be used successfully if it can be used in cooperation and peace .
A school is not useful if it can be blown up .
Microsoft culture is what makes it the company it is .
If its building burned down , rebuilding it would just be a matter of resources .
The MS building in the middle of Iraq would n't be useful ; culture is n't there to use it .
Underlying culture and institutions existed to use the infrastructure in both Germany and Japan .
Is that hindsight ?
Japan had a culture of militarism ; people were certainly unsure of what their role would be in the post - war world and new hierarchy .
Why did n't they try to disrupt the reconstruction as we see in Iraq ?
Protests , problems with food delivery .
But there were already national institutions in place that had carried over .
MacArthur realized that to overcome the trust issues he had to overcome the trust issues .
First thing he did was have his picture taken with the Emperor - - viewed as being a leader .
Used the Emperor to help sell reforms , facilitated cooperation among the citizens .
Played a key role in writing the Constitution ; passed it through the Diet , got their approval .
Improved the credibility of the efforts , lowered the transaction costs .
Meeting the Emperor could have gone the other way .
Communist element as well that wanted a say in the new Japan .
35:05
On the surface the Iraqi story looks somewhat similar .
What 's the difference ?
Japanese citizens vs. Iraqi citizens ; in Iraq people have primary identifications within their group or subgroups .
We all want different stuff ; is my group or subgroup being represented ?
Constitution was approved by a representative body but the U.S. played a key role in selecting the people in the representative body .
Baathist party members could n't be trusted ; but then people disenfranchised .
Japan much more inclusive because existing political institutions existed .
Diet before the war had limited power but was well - established institution , well - known by Japanese citizens .
Instead of wholesale change it was tinkering on the margins .
Lower - cost effort ( not monetary cost ) .
Not suggesting that sparing Hussein would have been a good idea .
Emperor did n't need to coerce citizens to get their cooperation .
Iraq was relatively peaceful inside the country under Hussein ; but how did you get that peace ?
If you were a threat to it , throw you in jail or kill you .
Large segments of the population did n't trust Hussein , whereas the Emperor had the affection and respect of the Japanese citizens .
39:56 Germany .
International war , national government that we were fighting and that we defeated ; clear government that we were taking over .
Lucius Clay .
MacArthur had a lot more unilateral power in Japan than Clay had .
Clay received a lot of influence from D.C. Reconstruction of Germany was successful not because of occupation but despite it .
Kept many economic controls , rationing schemes , that were in place under the Nazis ; did n't allow market forces to operate .
Doing same thing in Iraq .
Central planning , attempting to rationally construct a set of institutions that can't ever be constructed by a foreign government .
Ludwig Erhard went on the radio and lifted the price controls .
Knew economy was suffering under the controls and rations .
Clay scolded him ; Erhard responded that if he'd told them they would n't let him do it .
Occupation had brought him in as an advisor .
Key driver behind the opening of the economy .
Was n't the central planning .
Historical accounts , all this infighting between government agencies and bureaus .
Seen in Iraq now .
Public choice problem .
People blame Bush for having no plan , not trying hard enough .
But another way to view it is that the bureaucrats measure success by the number of their employees and size of their budgets , so you get infighting between agencies and bureaus .
Not limited to Iraq or Republican administration .
Issue of government and ability of government to centrally plan the complex array of institutions necessary for liberal democracy .
Failures are bipartisan if you look at it historically .
47:08 Somalia and Haiti : U.S. tried to do something from the top down and failed .
More relevant for Iraq and Afghanistan .
Also more relevant because the threat to the U.S. in the future is not likely to be from a superpower but from weak and failed states and rogue groups .
Noble motivations , U.S. and U.N. went into Somalia just to keep the peace .
Mission creep ; one way to get power is to expand the mission .
Humanitarian aid brought to one side is viewed by the other side as helping the enemy and shoot .
U.S. had to decide whether to shoot back or to exit .
Black Hawk Down .
Trying to impose solutions top - down where it does n't fit .
Haiti : Aristede overthrown , U.S. restored him to power ; elected originally , sham , but friend of the U.S. , illiberal .
Liberal in the classical sense , devoted to liberty .
Care about liberal democracy , protection of property , civil freedoms , do n't want elected person able to exploit the minority .
Majority rule .
Hamas is a democracy .
Organizing elections is the easy part .
Establishing binding constraints on the people who win the election is the hard part .
Collective decision making but winner can't abuse minorities or its political rivals .
Aristede 's rivals did n't view him as legitimate and used violence to overthrow him .
U.S. went in 1994 , there until 1996 .
Failed in our goals , Aristede forced into exile .
Looked to U.S. to intervene to help him retain his power .
No investment in infrastructure , subsistence level because government takes your stuff .
Policy makers have a fetish with nation states ; but consider alternatives .
Trying to prop up states might get democracy but not liberal democracy .
Good argument for allowing weak and failed states to collapse .
Pure cost on their citizens , provide benefits to their cronies at the expense of their citizens .
Empowering the worst governments in the world .
When a state is collapsing it indicates something .
Like most interventions it 's motivated by the view that we can do better ; but when we recognize the limits , unintended consequences , public choice issues , we should be skeptical .
58:07 Optimism for Iraq initially : highly educated population , commercial infrastructure .
Why was that wrong ?
Debate over foreign aid .
Foreign aid is a form of intervention , to manipulate outcomes .
Development / foreign aid debate .
They do n't save enough , so we need to fill up the gap ; fails ; well , they just do n't know how to use it ; invest in schools ; giving them money to invest , why are n't we seeing convergence to development ?
Incentives and information , lack of property rights .
Information problem , do n't know how to allocate aid correctly because there is no market feedback or profit - loss mechanism .
Easterly 's work : have to focus on the searchers , the low level , not top - down .
Education is an input , human capital , invest in it to produce other stuff .
But need other inputs .
Iraq had some entrepreneurship .
Why has n't U.S. been able to leverage that ?
There was private initiative , but profit opportunities were minimal .
Workers in factories waited for directives .
Black market , merchants , but big issue is one of security .
Worrying about safety , curfews make it hard to engage in trade .
State is important , police , but the state can't be everywhere .
People are cooperative on their own .
Where those beliefs and values are absent at the present moment in time , need continued coercion and force to maintain certain amount of cooperation .
Most skeptics know that self - proclaimed psychics such as Uri Geller , who claim to be able to bend cutlery with just their minds , are actually using magic and trickery to do so .
Of course , if they could really bend metal with just their minds you have to wonder why at some point they always have to touch the spoon .
The answer is obvious to skeptics : because the only way to bend a spoon is by physically bending it !
But how ?
In this video demonstration I bend spoons and forks and give you just enough information so that you can figure how how to do it yourself ( without actually providing a full reveal of the trick ) .
This video demonstration was inspired by James “ the Amazing ” Randi , whose miniature likeness supervises the entire process ( you have to watch the video to see what I mean ) .
As Randi likes to say , “ if psychics are bending spoons with psychic power they ’re doing it the hard way . ”
This video demonstration was shot in the library of the Skeptics Society and was filmed , edited , and produced by Josh Timonen , the highly talented web designer and videographer for RichardDawkins .net .
Josh has produced a number of excellent DVDs with Richard in conversation with a number of thinkers ( e.g. , “ The Four Horsemen ” with Dawkins , Dennett , Hitchens , and Harris ) .
Go to www.richarddawkins.net to check them out .
So watch this video and then go to a restaurant tonight where they use relatively cheap cutlery ( i.e. , easy to bend ) and amaze your friends and family !

" it is overwhelmingly Israel that kills first after a pause in the conflict : 79 % of all conflict pauses were interrupted when Israel killed a Palestinian , while only 8 % were interrupted by Palestinian attacks ( the remaining 13 % were interrupted by both sides on the same day ) .
In addition , we found that this pattern -- in which Israel is more likely than Palestine to kill first after a conflict pause -- becomes more pronounced for longer conflict pauses .
Indeed , of the 25 periods of nonviolence lasting longer than a week , Israel unilaterally interrupted 24 , or 96 % , and it unilaterally interrupted 100 % of the 14 periods of nonviolence lasting longer than 9 days . "
Time : Documents confirm misconduct by Siegelman prosecution Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008
Print This Email This New documents have surfaced to show possible prosecutorial misconduct in the case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Siegelman , whose appeal will be heard next month by a federal court , was convicted of corruption in 2006 in a case that has aroused widespread suspicions of political bias .
As reported last year by RAW STORY , the investigation of Siegelman was initiated by US Attorney Leura Canary in 2002 , at the same time as her husband William Canary , a long - time associate of Karl Rove , was a campaign advisor for Bob Riley , who defeated Siegelman that November in his bid for relection .
Canary has claimed that she had recused herself after spending more than six months investigating Siegelman , well before the prosecution went to trial , but it is widely believed that she continued to guide the case from behind the scenes .
Now Time has obtained documents , submitted by a staffer in Canary 's office to Department of Justice watchdogs in 2007 , which confirm these doubts and also indicate other irregularities .
The documents include a written statement from the aide saying that Canary " kept up with every detail of the case , " as well as emails from Canary to her subordinates offering ideas for how to manage the case , one of which which ultimately convinced the judge to increase Siegelman 's prison sentence .
The aide also provided emails showing attempts by jurors to warn that one member of the jury was romantically interested in a member of the prosecution team and had even asked members of the prosecution for personal advice .
In addition , some jurors who were suspected of improper conduct were interviewed by the prosecution before the judge could speak to them , in direct violation of the judge 's orders .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor Co on Monday posted an unadjusted 30.2 percent plunge in U.S. auto sales in October under pressure across all vehicle segments amid the slowing domestic economy and weak consumer confidence .
Ford , which posted an $ 8.7 billion second - quarter net loss , on Friday is expected to report a third - quarter net loss and to update its plans for maintaining liquidity to cope with the U.S. sales slowdown now seen continuing through next year .
The sales declines landed hardest on the SUV and crossover segments for the Ford , Lincoln and Mercury brands combined .
For October , sales fell to 132,838 vehicles from 190,195 vehicles a year earlier , including all of Ford ’s brands , the automaker said .
Ford , Lincoln and Mercury brand sales fell 29 percent from a year earlier .
In those brands , car sales fell 26.8 percent , crossover sales 38.8 percent , SUV sales 53.9 percent and truck and van sales 19.2 percent .
The automaker has launched a redesigned version of its top - selling F - 150 pickup truck , including a new national ad campaign that started on Sunday .
It also has accelerated plans to shift some truck production in North America to cars .
The automaker said it had its highest retail market share in two years , supported by its top - selling F - Series pickups , where sales fell 16.3 percent to 43,324 from a year earlier .
Among other key vehicles , Ford reported that sales of its Focus compact car fell 18.2 percent , while sales of the Fusion midsize sedan fell 3.3 percent .
The results were not adjusted for an additional selling day in October 2008 versus a year earlier .

Now that the cold weather is here , we should remember that more Americans die during the cold months than at any other time of year , notwithstanding any global warming .
The figure below , which is based on data from the US National Center for Health Statistics for 2001 - 2007 , shows that on average 7,200 Americans die each day during the months of December , January , February and March , compared to the average 6,400 who die daily during the rest of the year .
On this basis , there were 95,000 “ excess ” deaths during the 121 days in the cold months ( December to March , assuming a non-leap year ) .
So bundle up if you go outside , and keep warm indoors as well .
Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays .

In the week since The Chronicle of Higher Education published its annual survey of university presidents ’ pay  a week in which the nation ’s economic troubles worsened  several of the highest - paid presidents said that they would give back part of their pay or forgo their raises .
Pat Callan , president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education , said he had never heard of such a wave of givebacks .
“ When you see a cluster like this , ” he said , “ it seems like sort of belated recognition that this presidential pay thing has gotten out of hand .
People are getting tuition increases , some faculty are facing layoffs , it just does n’t look too good for presidents , no matter how capable they are , to be getting so much money .
Americans have had a touching faith in higher education ; it ’s losing its good image with the public . ”
The chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis , Mark S. Wrighton , announced on Thursday that he would take a 5 percent cut from his base salary on Jan. 1 and another 5 percent reduction on July 1 .
The Yamaha MyRoom II is a product I ’ve been searching for all my life .
It is essentially a small , soundproof room that will fit in your apartment and offers you the opportunity to indulge in one of life ’s ultimate de-stressing / relaxation techniques …to just f**king scream … without your neighbors calling the cops .
Apart from my personal favorite panacea above , the booth would also be excellent for learning an instrument , having a loud conversation in the wee hours of the morning , escaping the neighbors ’ arguments , studying , recording music or even doing a spot of karaoke .
The most exciting use for this soundproof booth , however , would undeniably be for the rush of thrashing your guitar along to some hard - core punk - rock / metal with your amp to 11 and scrrrrrrreaming the lyrics .
Ah , good times .
Yamaha ’s MyRoom II is a remake of their original MyRoom and now comes equipped with air - conditioner , touch - panel controls and adjustable lighting ; all with a build - time of around two hours – less than an IKEA flat - pack wardrobe .
It measures around 4.5 by 6 feet and is available in a few different configurations – including one specifically for music practice – ranging from around $ 6,500 and $ 15,000 in price .
If this room were a little bigger , I ’d call it MyHome .
Think about it …a brand new soundproof apartment where you can be as loud as you please .
I reckon they should make a model triple the size to fit a bed , bathroom and fridge and then stack them to make an apartment block … perhaps not in seismic Japan though .

But Hulu reflects its broadcast TV roots .
It 's not much of a step beyond a robust cable TV video - on - demand service -- there are programs , comments by users and ( as of today ) a recommendation engine .
Sling.com , the new video site from the makers of Slingbox , is more of a Web 2.0 creature .
Officially launching this week although still in beta , Sling is Hulu with a Facebook - like layer of social networking on top , along with a heavy dose of opinion from the staff .
In other words , it 's not just TV , it 's about TV , albeit in not - so - obvious ways ....
After making its public debut in March , the NBC Universal - News Corp. joint venture Hulu quickly raised the table stakes for online video sites .
Its videos were not just free and abundant , they had a Hollywood pedigree .
Yes , it lacks the holy - moly - that 's - awesome ! power of YouTube , but its signal - to - noise ratio is far higher than any user - generated - video site's .
... Much of Sling 's most recognizable programming comes from almost two dozen networks and studios that Hulu supplies , but it supplements those feeds with content from about 100 additional cable networks , online TV channels and independent studios .
It 's an overwhelming amount of stuff , which is where the social layer of Sling comes in .
Like Hulu , you can banter on comment boards about particular shows or episodes .
But you can also create an electronic trail of commentary for others to follow .
The Facebook News Feed analogy applies here :
By becoming a fan of other Sling.com users , you 'll be able to monitor the feeds they create of ratings made and comments posted .
( For privacy reasons , the feeds do n't include a list of the programs you watch on Sling , said Jason Hirschhorn , president of Sling Media Entertainment Group . )
The feeds provide a starting point for a journey through Sling 's programming , which is particularly helpful for clips - oriented channels such as Break.com and The Onion .
More important , they give Sling.com the feel of a user - generated content site .
Although Sling users can't upload clips , they can help curate the massive quantity of material supplied by Sling 's partners .
The aforementioned features can all be found in similar form at Veoh , which has even more content than Sling because it does allow user uploads .
( Veoh also has links to ABC 's programs -- e.g. , " Lost , " " Desperate Housewives , " " Grey 's Anatomy , " all of which play in a separate ABC - branded window -- and Sling does n't . )
What makes Sling different is that it augments the guidance provided by users with plenty of tips from the Sling staff .
( A recommendation engine is on its way too , Hirschhorn said in a recent interview . )
In addition to suggested programs and channels , the staff compiles playlists , or collections of themed clips .
Examples include a series of videos featuring Elvis impersonators and a string of celebrities singing on Sesame Street .
But for now , at least , the playlists are hidden on the site -- there do n't appear to be any links , so you have to know the URLs to find them .
Sling.com 's videos are advertiser - supported , and the number of commercials inserted is significant on the site 's full - length movies .
The ad load is n't as noticeable on the shorter clips , and seems to vary from channel to channel .
The site does n't have to generate truckloads of cash to be valuable to Sling , though .
It also supports and promotes the parent company 's hardware products , such as the Slingbox , which pipes TV programming from a cable or satellite TV receiver to a laptop or smartphone .
Sling provides a Web - based interface for Slingbox transmissions , eliminating the need for Slingbox owners to download special software onto their computer or phone .
Those customers , in turn , give Sling.com a built - in audience .
I ran into a few glitches on the site in recent weeks , with some videos refusing to play on Firefox and others crashing on Internet Explorer .
In short , it was standard beta - release stuff .
On the whole , Sling.com struck me as an appealing alternative to Hulu with a promising approach to the needle - in - a - haystack problem caused by the proliferation of video programming online .

If Mozilla has its way , you 'll soon be able to watch streaming video on sites all over the web without ever having to use a plug-in .
The software maker announced Monday that native support for the open - source Threora video format will be added to Firefox 3.1 , the next version of its popular web browser .
Theora files can be embedded directly into web pages just like images and viewed in any browser that supports Theora playback – no plug - in to download , no special software to install .
Furthermore , Mozilla has set up a $ 100,000 grant to foster the development of new tools , player technologies and codec enhancements to display , store and stream Theora videos and its companion Vorbis audio format .
The grant will be administered by the non-profit Wikimedia foundation .
Mozilla VP of engineering Mike Shaver and Mozilla director of evangelism Christopher Blizzard both have detailed posts about the announcement .
There 's also a post on the official Mozilla blog .
Monday 's news is sure to cause a heap of worry at Adobe , Apple and Microsoft .
The giants own the web 's leading media playback and streaming technologies , and collect the lucrative licensing payments for their use .
Both audio and video on the web are currently wrapped up in a mess of proprietary file formats , patents and downloadable software players that need to be frequently updated .
The clear leader is Adobe Flash , the near - ubiquitous technology used by YouTube , Google Video and almost every website currently streaming video or audio .
The Flash Player plug - in is free , and much of the code behind it has recently been released under a permissive open - source license .
But the Adobe 's authoring tools are expensive , and large - scale deployments of Flash content require proprietary , enterprise - class server software .
Further down the food chain are Apple 's QuickTime and Microsoft 's Silverlight playback technologies .
And let us not forget MP3 , the king of digital media formats , and its many offshoots .
Any software maker who wants to create a program that plays MP3 audio or the high - definition H.264 video format must pay a licensing fee back to the patent holders .
Theora and Vorbis are both free of such restrictions .
They are distributed under an open - source license , and they have been championed by free software proponents for years with ( so far ) little headway .
The stewards of the web have had plans for an open video standard for some time , however .
The WHAT Working Group , a non-profit organization that researches emerging web standards , has included plans for open - source video and audio playback in its draft for the HTML 5 specification .
HTML 5 is widely expected to become ratified as the web 's default markup language in the coming years .
While modern browsers are only expected to follow recommendations that have already been finalized , there 's nothing holding browser makers back from adopting and nurturing the bleeding - edge stuff as well .
Opera has also embraced Theora for video playback – the company has built experimental support into the latest versions of its browser .
So , all Mozilla is really doing is getting a head start .
The difference is that it's also putting a whole lot of money where it 's mouth is .
There 's little chance Theora support in Firefox will dislodge Flash as the dominant video format on the web anytime soon .
Adobe 's technology is too fully baked into the user experience , and only 21 % or so of web surfers use Firefox .
But native support in Firefox will be a huge step towards removing the barrier currently dissuading people from posting Theora video .
Right now , Flash is the only sensible choice .
Hopefully , Mozilla 's initiative will change that .
Villagers demonstrate in in Laghman province as president Hamid Karzai condems Sunday 's military operation and says 16 civilians were killed guardian .co.uk
The Obama administration warned the US public yesterday to brace itself for an increase in American casualties as it prepares to step up the fight against al - Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan and the border regions of Pakistan .
Against a background of widespread protests in Pakistan and Afghanistan over US operations since Obama became president , the vice - president , Joe Biden , said yesterday that US forces would be engaged in many more operations as the US takes the fight to its enemies in the region .
The Obama administration is to double the number of US troops in Afghanistan to 60,000 and when asked in a television interview if the US public should expect more American casualties , Biden said : " I hate to say it , but yes , I think there will be .
There will be an uptick . "
Greater US involvement in Afghanistan is a political risk for Obama , with the danger that mounting American casualties could make the war as unpopular as Iraq .
Obama , in his first military action as president , sanctioned two missile attacks inside Pakistan on Friday , killing 22 people , reportedly women and children among them .
The attacks drew criticism from Pakistani officials at the weekend .
The Pakistani president , Asif Zardari , told the US ambassador to Islamabad , Anne Patterson , that the strikes " do not help the war on terror " .
According to reports , he also warned her that " these attacks can affect Pakistan 's cooperation in the war on terror " .
A foreign ministry spokesman , Mohammad Sadiq , said : " With the advent of the new US administration , it is Pakistan 's sincere hope that the United States will review its policy and adopt a more holistic and integrated approach towards dealing with the issue of terrorism and extremism .
We maintain that these [ missile ] attacks are counter - productive and should be discontinued . "
Biden , in an interview with CBS news , defended the strikes , saying that Obama had repeatedly said on the campaign trail he would not hesitate to strike against any high - level al - Qaida targets .
He suggested cooperation between the US and Pakistani counter - terrorist agencies would increase , with more US training for Pakistani counterparts .
Over the last year , there have been at least 30 US missile attacks on Pakistan 's tribal area , which is used as a haven for insurgents fighting international troops in neighbouring Afghanistan .
On Sunday , the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , condemned a separate US operation within Afghanistan that he said killed 16 Afghan civilians , prompting hundreds of villagers to demonstrate against the American military .
The US said the raid , on Saturday in Laghman province , killed 15 armed militants , including a woman with an rocket - propelled grenade .
But Afghan officials said they killed civilians , including two women and three children .
In Laghman 's capital , hundreds of protesters demanded an end to overnight raids .
Karzai warned the killing of innocent Afghans during US military operations was " strengthening the terrorists " .
He also announced that his government had sent Washington a draft agreement that seeks to give Afghanistan more oversight over US military operations .
The document has also been sent to Nato headquarters .
The death toll on Pakistan 's borders and within Afghanistan has caused widespread public anger , with resentment directed at the US , as well as the Afghanistan and Pakistan governments .
" It undermines the position of the government , its ability to negotiate [ a peace deal ] with the militants when the Taliban can say : ' You 're not even master in your own house , ' " said Ayaz Amir , a newspaper columnist and an opposition member of Pakistan 's parliament .
" It undercuts the credibility of a government , whose credibility is already low . "
Some of the strikes in Pakistan have killed senior al - Qaida militants but they tend to live with local families in the tribal area , making civilian casualties inevitable - which are then used by the Taliban as a recruitment tool .
Rustam Shah Mohmand , an analyst who was formerly Pakistan 's ambassador to Afghanistan , said that Pakistan had leverage it could use , by stopping supplies to Nato troops in Afghanistan to pass through its territory or threatening to withdraw the Pakistani forces deployed along the Afghan border . "
" If anything , the policy [ of missile strikes ] is going to be more focused , more aggressive , under Obama .
There is going to be a ' surge ' in Afghanistan , " said Mohmand .
" The Americans can't wage this war without Pakistan 's assistance . "
2007年、将来いつかF#が.NETプラットフォームで最上の言語になるだろう(参考記事・英語)ということが発表された。昨夜、F#がVisual Studio 2010のリリースに含まれることが発表された。
Microsoft支援による初の機能言語であるF#は、Camlに基づいている。OCamlは、機能的で、必須で、オブジェクト指向のプログラミングス
タイルの構成をサポートするという理由などから、その基礎として選ばれた。機能プログラミングは、F#やOCamlなどの言語に人びとを引き付けるようなことである一方、もう1つの側面は、他の.NETフレームワークを利用するために重要である。
現段階ではF#は、.NET
4.0の機能と見なされていない。それどころか、J#と全く同様の方法で、別個のredistributableでシップされる。これにより、
Microsoftは引き続きMonoおよびCLR
2.0プラットフォーム上でF#をサポートすることができる。
他の新し いMicrosoft言語と同様の精神で、F#コンパイラおよびツールは、Microsoft Public Licenseのもとオープンソースになる(リンク)。このライセンスは、すべてのMicrosoftライセンスに限定されず、本質的に著作権に関する通知を所有
し、作成者を訴えない限りは、したいことは何でもできると書いてある。
Visual Studioでは、F#は単独で使用されることを想定していない。Microsoftは、デベロッパがF#を使用してアプリケーションの中核を構築するこ
とを奨励しているが、プレゼンテーション層に関しては、VBやC#を使用することを勧めている。Don Syme氏(リンク ) は、以下のように続ける。
高品質なF#のコアツールを提供することに向けたわれわれの取り組みは、プレゼンテーションリッチオブジェクト指向プログラミング環境としての
Visual Studioの素晴らしい強みを拡大するように意図されている。結果として、今回のリリースでプレゼンテーションおよびデザイナーリッチプログラミング言 語としてのC#およびVisual Basicの強みを利用する決定をした。これは、F#ユーザがVisual Studioデザイナーツールを使用して、C#またはVisual Basicコードを生成し、これらのコンポーネントをそれらのF#アプリケーションに組み込むことを意味する。
F#は、OCamlの本質を超えてしまっているが、それらを完全に放棄しているわけではない。F#
Power Packコンポーネントを使用して、デベロッパはOCamlでコンパイル可能なF#コードを記述することができる。これには、言語の制限サブセットを使用
することが必要になるが、できれば一線を越えてF#専用コードに入った場合に、デベロッパに知らせるツールがあると大変よい。
Dom Syme氏は、最後に以下のようにまとめている。
F#は、Microsoft Research 、CambridgeおよびMicrosoft Developer Division間の高度な共同開発プロジェクトである。
言語アーキテクトとして、関わることが出来て大変うれしく思う。そして、今後もMicrosoft Researchにとどまることになる。われわれの素晴らしいチームには、ケンブリッジ、レッドモンド、バンクーバーおよび中国からのメンバーがおり、ド

Pokemon was quite a phenomenon a few years back .
Kids were trying to collect all the cute monsters from the TV series and pretty much anything related to the popular cartoon .
This girl took the the Pokemon motto “ Gotta catch ’em all ” seriously and I think she just may have pulled it off .
If not she came pretty close , just look at all the Pokemon and Pikachu stuff she managed to get her hands on .
I guess she could open her very own Pokemon Museum , or make a fortune selling it to other fans who I ’m sure would love to add to their own collections .
The Pokemon - mobile is by far the most impressive item on this fanatic ’s collection .
Nicely done , I guess … altghough it is a bit scary .

Looking to save money on a pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes this holiday season ?
Try searching for Manolo Blahnicks .
A handful of new Web sites with names like Typo Bay and Typo Buddy are out to help shoppers save money by searching eBay for misspelled brand names .
Such items often have fewer bidders because they do n’t appear in search results for people who spell the items correctly , and therefore can be had at a cheaper price .
It ’s a well - known strategy among longtime eBay shoppers , but one that owners of these sites are hoping will translate into big business  relatively speaking  as shoppers look to save money this holiday season .
Typo Buddy started about six months ago and already has up to 80,000 visitors on a good day , said its president , Jonathan Lieberman , an Internet entrepreneur in San Diego .
“ I expect in this market , where people are ever more vigilant for deals , that we ’ll do really well this holiday season , ” he predicted .
With Democrat Mark Udall cemented at the top of the polling for the race to replace retiring Republican Senator Wayne Allard in Colorado , the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) is yanking advertising dollars in the battle for that seat and leaving Udall 's opponent , Bob " Big Oil " Schaffer , on this own .
" That 's what they decided and we 'll live with it , " said Schaffer campaign manager Dick Wadhams .
" Our tracking shows this race is in single digits with a large body of undecided voters still out there .
" Yeah , and if Udall loses Colorado , I 'll go be the pool boy at The Bush Home for Criminal Ex-Presidents in Crawford Texas next year .
The real answer is that the NRSC knows that Schaffer is toast in Colorado and they need to start funneling cash to states where six months ago they would not have imagined reelection problems -- like Georgia , Kentucky and Mississippi .
A victory in Kentucky by Democrat Bruce Lunsford would retire Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and deal a huge blow to the dwindling Senate GOP caucus while , at the same time , Republicans Saxby Chambliss in Georgia and Roger Wicker in Mississippi are hanging on by a thread .
Another survey by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices , a nonprofit organization , found that 40 percent of hospital staff members reported having been so intimidated by a doctor that they did not share their concerns about orders for medication that appeared to be incorrect .
As a result , 7 percent said they contributed to a medication error .
There are signs , however , that such abusive behavior is less likely to be tolerated .
Physicians and nurses say they have seen less of it in the past 5 or 10 years , though it is still a major problem , and the Joint Commission is requiring hospitals to have a written code of conduct and a process for enforcing it .
Still , every nurse has a story about obnoxious doctors .
A few say they have ducked scalpels thrown across the operating room by angry surgeons .
More frequently , though , they are belittled , insulted or yelled at — often in front of patients and other staff members — and made to feel like the bottom of the food chain .
A third of the nurses in Dr. Rosenstein ’s study were aware of a nurse who had left a hospital because of a disruptive physician .
“ The job is tough enough without having to prepare yourself psychologically for a call that you know could very well become abusive , ” said Diana J. Mason , editor in chief of The American Journal of Nursing .
Laura Sweet , deputy chief of enforcement at the Medical Board of California , described the case of a resident at a University of California hospital who noticed a problem with a fetal monitoring strip on a woman in labor , but did n’t call anyone .
“ He was afraid to contact the attending physician , who was notorious for yelling and ridiculing the residents , ” Ms. Sweet said .
The baby died .

Of course , most doctors do not spew insults or intimidate nurses .
“ Most people are trying to do the best job they can under a high - pressure situation , ” said Dr. Joseph M. Heyman , chairman of the trustees of the American Medical Association .
January 7 , 2009 -- Isaac Shuisha , an Israeli citizen and student involved in the Palestine solidarity movement in Sydney , spoke to Green Left Weekly ’s Simon Butler about the reasons behind Israel ’s assault on Gaza and the campaign for a free Palestine .
Shuisha is a member of the socialist youth organisation , Resistance .
[ See also ``Jewish and Israeli opposition to Israel 's slaughter in Gaza ' ' . ]
What has motivated you to be a part of the campaign against Israel ’s ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people ?
Growing up in Israel , you are exposed to a very specific narrative about the history of Israel / Palestine .
In this story , all that “ we Israelis ” ever wanted is to live in peace , but alas , all the Arab people surrounding us want nothing less than to drive us all into the sea .
In Israel , this is considered to be the indisputable truth , which you hear every time you read the paper , every time you go to school , every time you talk to your parents .
This is why most Israelis support the current attacks on Gaza : after being exposed to this overwhelming brainwashing , people really believe that this attack on Gaza is the only way to defend ourselves .
But as I grew up , I started to be exposed to the way Palestinians are oppressed .
The reality in front of my eyes stood in strong contrast to the “ truth ” I had always been told .
I started to learn about the real history of Palestine and the formation of Israel .
I realised that I have an obligation to speak out .
One of Zionism ’s strongest ideological tools is trying to make Zionism synonymous with Judaism .
So as a person from a Jewish family , especially an Israeli Jewish family , I am expected to have a certain view of this conflict .
But unlike what Zionism claims , not all Jews are , “ by default ” , members of this sectarian , racist political sect called Zionism .
This is why it is crucial for me to take a stand against Zionism and the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people .
How would you describe the mainstream media ’s coverage of the assault on Gaza ?
Ever since the first , shocking reports of the carnage , the Australian mainstream media have been doing everything to appear “ neutral ” .
At best they ’ve reported as if this is a war between two armies .
The reality is that there are not two equal sides facing off here .
You have one of the strongest military powerhouses in the world , armed to the teeth with tanks , fighter jets , battleships , and advanced technology , against an oppressed , besieged population , living in the most densely populated area on Earth , using old guns and home - made primitive rockets .
The corporate media uncritically treats Israel as a victim who is “ retaliating ” , rather than as the aggressor who is bombing refugee camps .
The United States is fully backing Israel ’s massacre in Gaza while other Western nations , including Australia , refuse to condemn Israel ’s brutality .
Why do the Western powers support Israel ?
Israel is a colonial - settler state , and its existence is dependent on oppressing the indigenous people of Palestine – the Palestinians .
The United States and Australia are no different in that respect , as both nations were created on the blood of their indigenous peoples .
So the United States , Australia and Israel all share a history of colonialism in common .
Furthermore , the United States gives Israel about US $ 4 billion a year in military aid .
It also has various other economic assistance agreements in place that artificially subsidise the Israeli economy .
Without this money , the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza would be completely unsustainable .
But what is their interest in supporting Israel ?
The Middle East is one of the most important regions in a world still dominated by an oil economy .
There are very clear interests for the Western powers to have an “ island ” of a loyal capitalist , imperialist state in a region whose people are strongly anti-imperialist .
The Israeli government ’s agenda with this latest assault appears to be to destroy Hamas and cripple further resistance to the occupation of Palestinian land .
Will they succeed ?
Since its inception , Israel has tried to split the Palestinian resistance movement .
Hamas itself was created in the 1970s with the help of Israel , as it was seen to be in Israel ’s best interest to have an opposition to Yassir Arafat ’s Fatah organisation .
After many years the tables were turned , with Hamas winning the Palestinian elections in 2006 in light of Fatah ’s increasing collaboration with Israel .
The fact that Israel currently targets Hamas only strengthens the reputation of Hamas among Palestinians as the strongest resistance force at the moment .
But Israel is mistaken if they believe that crippling Hamas will end Palestinian resistance .
As long as there is oppression there will be resistance .
Can protests around the world in support of Palestine make a difference ?
Many of us have a fresh memory of a similar struggle , the struggle against apartheid in South Africa .
Despite the clear differences , many of the features of South African apartheid are very similar to the Israeli oppression of Palestinians .
We have seen how a global campaign helped bring apartheid in South Africa down .
The global campaign in solidarity with Palestine is increasing steadily and must continue .
These voices of protest , from around the world , do reach Palestine .
Having a mass of people raising their voices in solidarity and pressuring their own governments to assist the Palestinian struggle is a key condition for the movement , especially in these dark times .

The bank , which spent much of the past decade expanding globally , said the Government had increased its holding by converting its £ 5 bn current preference shares into ordinary stock , allowing RBS to lend more as it will not have to pay the government the 12 pc dividend it demanded as a preference share holder .
That move will see the Government 's stake in RBS increase from 58 pc to 68 pc .

This book is about learning how to use R for performing data mining .
The book follows a " learn by doing it " approach to data mining instead of the more frequent theoretical description of the techniques available in this discipline .
This is accomplished by presenting a series of illustrative case studies for which all necessary steps , code and data are provided to the reader .
The book writing style establishes it as a good source for practical classes on data mining , but also as an attractive document to professionals working on data mining in non-academic environments .
Most of the main data mining processes and techniques are covered in the book by means of the presentation of four detailed case studies :
Predicting algae blooms
Predicting stock market returns
Detecting fraudulent transactions

Texas sues Houston tanning salon that says it fights cancer Abbott sues Darque Tan over ads
Tanning salons are banned from saying they have health benefits
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott sued Houston - based Darque Tan on Monday , charging the company falsely claims to reduce cancer risks by increasing vitamin D levels in the body .
The lawsuit claims the company 's tanning beds are approved only for cosmetic tanning , but advertising and an online video on the company 's
Web site suggest the devices deliver high levels of vitamin D .
The state argues the claims are in violation of the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act , Deceptive Trade Practices
Act and various health codes .
The Texas Health and Safety Code prohibits tanning salons from claiming indoor tanning devices provide health or medical benefits .
" They are only approved as cosmetic tanning devices , " said Tom Kelley , a spokesman for the Attorney General 's Office .
" The company cannot claim health benefits beyond that .
They are not approved to make health claims , period .
It 's as simple as that . "
Abbott 's office is seeking civil penalties up to $ 20,000 per violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act and $ 25,000 per day for each violation of the Health and Safety Code .
' Natural biological process '
Robbie Segler , Darque
Tan 's owner , could not be reached for comment Monday .
The lawsuit also names Monica and Jason Jones , who operate eight Darque Tan stores in San Antonio , as defendants .
They could not be reached for comment .
According to the company 's Web site , Darque Tan has 87 locations in eight states , including more than 30 in the Houston metropolitan area .
Segler has said that his ads did not violate state law .
" A tanning bed producing vitamin D is analogous to saying a tanning bed produces darker skin , " Segler told the Houston Chronicle in May .
" Both are the consequence of a natural biological process .
I 'm not telling you that darker skin is good for you or bad for you .
I 'm not telling you that vitamin D is good for you or bad for you , " Segler said .
The Food and Drug Administration discourages the use of tanning beds and lamps and has not approved tanning beds as devices capable of delivering vitamin D .
Only a small amount of sunlight is needed for the body to manufacture vitamin D , and does not require a suntan , according to the American Academy of Dermatology .

Isikoff : Rove may testify in prosecutor 's Attorneygate probe David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This
One of the biggest blockades to potential revelations regarding the Bush administration 's politicization of the Justice Department has been the refusal of officials like Karl Rove and Harriet Miers to testify before Congressional committees investigating the matter .
That stonewalling may soon end , now that an independent federal prosecutor is probing the dismissal of nine US Attorneys , among other facets of the Justice Department scandal .
The White House has said they plan to cooperate with the special prosecutor 's probe , dropping their reliance on the executive privilege claims they have used to stymie Congress , Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff tells MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow .
The two were discussing prosecutor Nora Dannehy 's investigation , which was explored in a Wednesday Washington Post article .
The paper reported that Dannehy has issued several subpoenas in the case and met with defense lawyers representing the government officials suspected of misconduct .
Isikoff told Maddow of a little - noticed letter sent from the Justice Department to a US Appeals Court , which is considering an attempt by the House of Representatives to pursue Contempt of Congress charges against Bush administration officials who have ignored subpoenas .
In the Sept. 30 letter , Isikoff says , the Justice Department tells the court of assurances it received from White House counsel Fred Fielding that if Dannehy " determines that access to information from the White House would be helpful to assist her review , the White House will provide her with such information . "
That 's an encouraging sign for those hoping for more answers about the firings .
" So they 're essentially saying they 're not going to claim privilege over key information that Nora Dannehy may want , " Isikoff said .
" Harriet Miers and Karl Rove 's testimony ?
According to this letter , they 're not going to claim privilege over information that she determines she needs . "

REVEALED :
The haunting life story behind one of pop 's most famous songs ...
Eleanor Rigby
The words , familiar to countless millions around the world , are among the most poignant in popular music : ' Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name ; nobody came . '
Set to a haunting melody by Lennon and McCartney and backed by a string octet masterfully arranged by George Martin , the song broke new ground with its heartrending refrain :
' All the lonely people , where do they all come from ? '
Its funereal orchestration and bleak message of isolation , depression and desolation were a far cry from the upbeat hits the public had come to expect from The Beatles - yet it climbed straight to number one and changed the face of pop music in the process .
Seen for the first time ...
Eleanor Rigby 's signature on a school geography textbook found in a coal shed in the family 's former home
Since its release 40 years ago , the tragic heroine of this two - minute masterpiece has become a source of endless fascination for Beatles ' enthusiasts .
Indeed , interest is so strong that next week a 1911 salary ledger from Liverpool City Hospital bearing the details of ' E. Rigby ' , a 14 - year - old scullery maid , is expected to fetch up to £ 500,000 at auction .
In truth , this unknown teenager almost certainly had nothing to do with the much - loved song .
( In all likelihood her first name was not Eleanor , and Sir Paul McCartney , who donated the item to charity having been sent it by a fan , concedes that she had no bearing on the process of composition . )
In a neat churchyard in the leafy Liverpool district of Woolton , however , lies the final resting place of the real Eleanor Rigby - the woman widely regarded as the subconscious inspiration behind the classic song .
It was here , at the St Peter 's Church fete , that John Lennon and Paul McCartney met for the first time .
The church is a stone 's throw from Lennon 's childhood home on Menlove Avenue .
He sang in the choir and frequently played in the graveyard , which he referred to with characteristic irreverence as the ' bone orchard ' .
The tombstone of Eleanor Rigby has become a landmark to Beatles fans visiting Liverpool and was even featured in the video for the band 's 1995 reunion single , Free As A Bird .
But though many people believe this is the final resting place of the woman who gave the song its name , until now any details about her life have remained an intriguingly blank slate .
Today , for the first time , a Daily Mail investigation painstakingly unravels the true story of Eleanor and tracks down the last surviving member of her close family .
What emerges most poignantly is that whatever her association with the song may be , there is no denying that the Rigby family history is eerily consistent with The Beatles ' bleak tale .
Tragic :
The grave of Eleanor Rigby in Liverpool .
She is widely believed to have been the ' subconscious ' influence behind the Beatles song
There are no surviving pictures of Eleanor , who was born on August 29 , 1895 , at 8 Vale Road in Woolton - which , intriguingly , backs onto Menlove Avenue , where Lennon grew up .
The patriarch of the family was her grandfather John Rigby - her mother 's father - a stonemason who presided over the poky , two - bedroom terrace house crammed with five adults and the infant Eleanor .
Eleanor 's real name , in fact , was Eleanor Whitfield , but with the Rigby family line on the cusp of dying out , her grandfather appears to have insisted that she take his surname - and this is how it appears on the family gravestone .
Eleanor 's father , a journeyman joiner called Arthur Whitfield , passed away while she was still a child , so she remained in the family home until shortly after her 15th birthday , when her mother , Mary Elizabeth , remarried .
That marriage produced two half - sisters for Eleanor - Edith and Hannah Heatley - who would become the guardians of Eleanor 's memory as , one by one , the Rigby family passed away .
Eleanor was devoted to her sisters and lobbied to be appointed godmother to Edith , which she duly was .
But as the years went by and her schoolfriends married and started families of their own , Eleanor 's existence became more solitary , and she was forced to eke out a living by helping her mother , a laundress .
It was not until the age of 35 - positively ancient in those days - that she was eventually married to Thomas Woods , a railway foreman 17 years her senior .
The marriage , witnessed by her half - sister Hannah , was a joyous occasion but her happiness was not to last long .
Eleanor proved incapable of bearing children - a source of great heartbreak - and on October 10 , 1939 , a month after the outbreak of World War II , she suffered a massive brain haemorrhage .
The Beatles single that made Eleanor Rigby 's name famous
And so it was that at the cruelly young age of 44 , Eleanor died in the same house where she had been born , was interred in the graveyard of St Peter 's Church , and had her name added prominently on an increasingly crowded headstone .
Precisely one year later , John Lennon was born , going on to play out much of his childhood against the background of that same church .
His schoolboy band , the Quarrymen , would cut their teeth at the church fete , and Paul McCartney would join him to sunbathe in the graveyard .
It was during this time , many Beatles experts are convinced , that the seed of an idea was planted which would subsequently grow into the song Eleanor Rigby .
' I am absolutely convinced that this woman is the real Eleanor Rigby - there are just too many coincidences , ' says Ray Connolly , the respected Beatles biographer .
' That graveyard was a place John , in particular , knew very well , but it was also pretty close to Paul 's house at the time .
' Paul has come up with various explanations for how they came up with the name Eleanor Rigby down the years , but the subconscious is a very powerful thing when you 're writing music , and there is no accounting for it .
Anyone who was growing up at the time will remember the kind of character The Beatles were singing about in that song .
' You 'd see these lonely old ladies going to church every Sunday .
Perhaps they 'd lost their husbands in the war , or who knows what sort of tough lives they 'd lived , but there was a sadness about them .
' Nobody has told the story of the real Eleanor Rigby before , and it 's absolutely fascinating that her life has such parallels with the woman in the song . '
John Lennon and Paul McCartney : Both collaborated on Eleanor Rigby and both had played as youngsters in the graveyard where a tombstone carries her name
The lonely tale of the Rigbys did not end with her death , however .
Having died childless , the family line was continued by her sisters , who moved into the family home on Vale Road and lived there together until they died , within a month of each other , in 2001 - long after Eleanor 's husband Thomas Woods had passed away .
Neither married or had children , and when they died their entire estate - amounting to £ 40,000 - passed to Robert Donnellan , who , by his own admission , barely knew them but was the husband of a late friend of theirs .
They knew no other family member or friend for them to leave their estate to .
Graham Paisley , the verger of St Peter 's Church , says : ' Edith and Hannah were two elderly spinsters who lived a very quiet life and were not demonstrative in any way .
' They seemed to lead quite a lonely life , but they always had each other , and I know they were very close indeed .
I 'll never forget Edith standing at the side of Hannah 's grave at her funeral , looking utterly desolate .
' It really was n't much of a surprise that she died so soon afterwards , because I do n't think she had anyone left in the world . '
Indeed , the only remaining memories of sisters Eleanor , Hannah and Edith consist of a few scraps of paper bearing a rudimentary family tree .
Entire lives reduced to the dates of birth , marriages and deaths in spidery handwriting , bequeathed to a man ( Mr Donnellan ) for whom they are nothing more than names and numbers .
In the course of this investigation , however , two other developments have unfolded .
Firstly , in the Vale Road house which was the Rigby family home for well over a century , a school geography textbook has been found bearing the signature of a young Eleanor Rigby .
The book was found , hidden in the depths of the coal shed , by university worker Alice Bennett when she moved into the property in 2003 .
Inside the cover it has been signed with the names Eleanor Whitfield and Eleanor Rigby Whitfield - a perfect match to the signature on her official marriage certificate from December 28 , 1930 .
If a salary ledger for an unspecified ' E. Rigby ' can raise £ 500,000 at auction , what price this artefact , signed by the woman whose headstone has become a Beatles icon ?
Miss Bennett told me : ' When I first moved into the house , my neighbour told me that Eleanor Rigby used to live here , but I did n't really believe it was her until you showed me the signature on Eleanor 's marriage certificate .
I 've put it in a bank vault for safe keeping , and only told a few of my friends about it until now .
I 'm a huge Beatles fan and I adore the lyrics to Eleanor Rigby .
' This is a little piece of history and I 'm not sure how much it might be worth , but I do n't want to sell it anyway . '
With Eleanor having died childless , and her spinster sisters following the same path , it would appear that this dog-eared copy of Gills Oxford and Cambridge Geography is virtually all that remains of her .
Just two miles away , however , in a semi- detached house in the Liverpool suburbs , I finally tracked down Thomas Rigby , Eleanor 's cousin and her last surviving close relative .
The 88 - year - old retired accounts clerk told me : ' I was aware of my cousins Edith and Hannah , but we never kept in close touch after their mother had died .
' As for Eleanor , the only recollection I have is of my father talking about how he paid for her piano lessons .
He spoke fondly of her , as I recall .
' There was talk of Eleanor Rigby on the television this week , and I 've often been asked if I 'm any relation to this woman in a famous Beatles song .
I 've always told them that the answer is no .
' Of course , I heard a lot of Beatles ' music in the Sixties - you could n't get away from it in Liverpool in those days .
But I like proper ballroom dancing , not these pop bands , and as far as I 'm concerned The Beatles started all that off .
' Now I find that my cousin really was Eleanor Rigby , as you can imagine I have mixed emotions about it .
I never knew her , which is very sad , but that 's just how life turned out , I suppose . '
It is worthy of note that Thomas , like his cousins , has no children .
Indeed , of six siblings born to Eleanor 's uncle William and aunt Louisa Rigby - Thomas 's parents - only two of them married .
Another child , Arnold , died in infancy , but Thomas , Albert , William and Louisa lived their entire lives under the same roof as their mother .
' Some may regard it as unusual , but we were very happy with the arrangement , ' says Thomas .
' We were there for each other as a family , and that was enough for us .
' A lot of time has gone by , and Eleanor 's side of the family has run out .
They were ordinary , hardworking folk , the Rigbys - joiners , bricklayers , farmers and the like - not the kind of people you expect to go down in history .
And now there 's nobody left . '
So it seems that the only memories remaining of Eleanor Rigby are a few scraps of paper , an old , long - forgotten school textbook , and an iconic gravestone .
Elsewhere in the churchyard , Eleanor 's sisters , Hannah and Edith , are buried with Eleanor 's mother in an altogether more anonymous plot .
Nobody ever wrote a song about them , but as the Rigby dynasty approaches the end of the line , it seems this somewhat sad family were indeed just the kind of ' lonely people '
The Beatles wrote about all those years ago .
While it is roughly 1 ½ days left of the Bush presidency , and much longer time until all the data is available , I still do n't think it is not too early to give a preliminary assessment of the Bush presidency .
I will here focus on the economic aspects .
Assuming a 1.3 % decline ( 5 % decline at an annual rate ) in Q4 2008 , the economy grew 16.9 % between Q4 2000 and Q4 2008 , which is less than 2 % at an annual rate .
The equivalent number for the Clinton presidency was 3.6 % , for papa Bush 's presidency 2.1 % and for Reagan 's presidency 3.5 % .
Thus , the economy performed even worse than when his father was president , and much worse than during the Reagan 's and Clinton 's presidencies .
If you adjust for population growth , these annual numbers are about 1 percentage point lower .
As was noted before , industrial production fared even worse , being virtually unchanged .
The entire increase in GDP came in services , with government services increasing particularly fast , as the share of GDP going to government purchases rose to 17.6 % in Q4 2000 to 20.4 % in Q3 2008 ( Some of that probably went into manufacturing of for example fighter aircrafts and other military equipment , but that only makes manufacturing of private products look even worse ) .
The Q4 2008 numbers are n't ready yet , but considering the rapid decline in private sector output in that quarter and the spending increases suggested by the budget numbers , it will probably land at slightly below 21 % .
This weakness is also reflected upon in the labor market , as unemployment rose from 3.9 % to 7.2 % even as the labor force participation rate fell from 67 % to 65.7 % .
As a result , the employment to population ratio fell from 64.4 % to 61 % .
While 5.7 million new jobs were created according to the household survey , that was nowhere enough given the increase in population .
Not that much of a " Bush boom " in other words .
Now , to be fair , it would be wrong to blame Bush for the dismal performance during his presidency .
He inherited an economy that was falling into a recession because of the tech stock bubble , and while the housing bubble in 2001 - 2006 did provide a limited boost , it also dragged down the economy in 2007 and 2008 .
By contrast , Clinton was really lucky to inherit an economy that was just recovering from recession and then enjoyed the pleasant phase of the tech stock bubble while leaving office just before the bust was apparent in growth statistics .
The main blunder of Bush was to reappoint the man guilty for the current problems , Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman , but then again that was a mistake also made by Reagan , papa Bush and Clinton .
He also increased spending far too much ( more on that below ) and implemented policies that in the name of his " ownership society " vision aggravated the housing bubble .
He did however also pursue some good policies , mainly the 2003 tax cuts , which did in fact create a lot of sound growth , particularly in 2003 and 2004 .
When it comes to the budget , the most striking thing is the how much the budget balance weakened .
In fiscal year 2000 , the budget had a surplus of 2.4 % of GDP whereas in fiscal 2008 it had a deficit of 3.2 % .
While that was below the post - World War II record of 6.0 % in 1983 , Reagan had inherited a large deficit from Carter and by the end of his term , the deficit was only slightly above where it started .
This reflected both a decline in tax revenues and a surge in spending .
Revenues fell from 20.9 % of GDP to 17.7 % .
This reflects in part how revenues in 2000 was inflated because of capital gains tax revenues from the inflated stock market and in part it reflect the active tax cut decisions made by Bush .
Spending at the same time rose from 18.4 % of GDP to 20.9 % .
This increase is even worse if you consider that because of lower interest rates , interest payments fell from 2.3 % to 1.7 % .
Excluding interest payments , spending rose from 16.1 % to 19.2 % , the most dramatic increase since World War II .
To some extent Bush can blame this on cyclical factors , but he certainly shares a great deal of responsibility for this as he actively initiated several new spending programs , including the " No Child Left Behind " act , the Medicare drug benefit bill and of course the Iraq war .
Also , during his first 6 years in office he only vetoed 1 spending bill from Congress , and that was a relatively minor one and also done for the wrong reason ( I 'm talking about funding of stem cell research ) .
After the Democrats won the 2006 congressional election , he did seem to improve .
He proposed no new spending bills and started to veto several spending bills passed by the Democrats .
However , once the financial crisis made a turn for the worse , so did Bush , who pushed for and implemented massive bailouts of Wall Street financial companies and Detroit car companies .
To summarize , while Bush has done a few good things , most notably his relative skepticism to the " global warming " - hysteria , the 2003 tax cuts and a few spending vetoes in his last few years , the overall assessment is very negative given his support for Greenspan , the massive increase in spending and the bailouts .
Not surprisingly given how bad the policies were , the economic performance was also very weak .
Because of those failures , he paved the way for the incoming Obama administration , who will continue and increase the dose of Bush 's more destructive sides .
The ondes Martenot ( which is French for “ Martenot waves ” , also known as the ondium Martenot , Martenot and ondes musicales ) is one of the first electronic musical instruments ever created .
It was invented in 1928 by Maurice Martenot and it ’s sound was very similar to a theremin – except with much more control over the timbre of the sound .
I ’d stop short of calling it a real synthesizer , but it did have switches to control the sound .
It even came with 4 very different speakers that could be switched on and off .
The eerie sounds of the ondes Martenot were produced by thermionic valves ( or vacuum tube ) .
The Martenot was produced for 60 years all the way up until 1988 , but a knockoff called the Ondea started being produced in 2001 .
The really cool thing about this instrument is how it ’s played .
On first sight , it looks like it operates like a piano , however it can be played either via the keyboard itself or by sliding a metal ring worn on the right - hand index finger in front of the keyboard .
This allows the musician to play sweeping , wavering sounds very similar to the theremin .
The keys on the keyboard actually have a little bit of lateral motion and you can modulate the pitch of a note up or down by pushing it left or right .
( Maybe all those posers who vibrate their finger on the key when they play a synth with modulated sound dream of these )
Now , it does n’t matter if you press a key or more the ring , those do n’t actually produce any sound (! ) .
To produce a sound , first you must pull out a small drawer on the left hand side that contains various many controls .
One oblong - shaped key controls the volume of the note by how far it is pressed – the deeper the push , the louder the note .
Â
Additionally , how it is pressed determines the attack of the note : quick taps produce short , staccato notes and more controlled and deliberate presses play legato .
Also in this drawer are flip - style switches that control the Martenot ’s sound .
Each switch has its own sound color which can be stacked up to create a compound sound , just like an organ .
The switches feature a sine wave , triangle wave , a pulse wave noise , and many other sounds .
If that is n’t enough , the are 4 different speaker systems ( called “ diffusers ” ) that can be used to modify the sound .
There is a standard speaker , a speaker with springs that add a type of reverb to the sound , a speaker with a “ gong ” as a diaphragm which produces very interesting harmonics and a speaker that is similar to a stringed instrument called a Lyre – great for drones and rich textures .
Of course , you can use more than one speaker at a time and switch between them on the fly ( take that , Leslie speakers ! )
There really are n’t very many people can play this instrument as very few of these actually exist , however Jean Laurendeau is an absolute master .
Here is a video of him demonstrating the instrument .
everything in moderation …
Atheism should not become bizarro theism , even though it 's human nature for it to lean in that direction .

There ’s a bizarre symmetry when believers and unbelievers debate the existence and influence of the supernatural on our temporal world .
Both sides offer an answer , one side using an ancient book and the other deferring to science .
But as flawed as a book of uncertain origins and a tumultuous history may be as a guide , using the word of a PhD to confirm that science knows something for sure is n’t always the right way to go either .
In some cases , ardent atheists seemed to have decided that rather than providing logical views on nature , science holds absolute answers to well … everything .
Somewhere along the line , they ’ve forgotten that atheism and agnosticism do n’t offer a new set of answers to existential questions .
Instead , they offer the chance to cast aside old dogmas and discover the universe for what it is , taking in all the surprises it has to offer .
When you refuse to use a supernatural placeholder for the unknown , you do n’t get to treat science as a new set of answers to anything and everything .
You get to use it as a tool for exploration and when you ’re debating something with a theist , you need to focus on conveying that deferring to a deity is a way of saying that you do n’t know without admitting it .
Theism offers absolute certainty on any subject matter .
Atheism and agnosticism offer the prospect of unrestricted exploration .
There is a very different focus here and this gets lost when you only care about debunking .
Unlike televangelists say with their simple catchphrases , atheism is n’t the belief that everything came from nothing .
It ’s also not a belief that nothing “ made ” everything since the word “ made ” is misleading .
Atheism is the idea that somehow , our universe came to be the way it is and by using an ancient book or an indefinite being that ’s somehow omnipotent and omniscient , we ’re cheating ourselves , resorting to magics when everything has a logical explanation and we just need to find it .
It ’s hardly an extreme position but sometimes , like all people , atheists can get a little out of hand when emotions run high .
I ’ve often seen passionate atheists talk about how people should be “ saved from religion . ”
How exactly is this different than saving people from hellfire by converting them to your faith in the supernatural ?
Same goes for tales of overcoming the pull of religion and peer pressure from a theist circle of family and friends to “ embrace science and reason . ”
They seem to have a vague similarity to tales of overcoming aimless lives to find a purpose in God and faith .
This does n’t mean that atheism is a religion itself and that atheists are just substituting faith with science as their placeholder for the unknown .
It just means that human minds work in a certain way and passionate atheists can act in the same way as passionate theists since their neural wiring is going to be very similar .
A human brain is still a human brain and if we really want to be open - minded skeptics , we need to be able to account for its limitations and its patterns .
So here ’s something important to think about if you identify yourself as an atheist or like me , a skeptical agnostic .
You decided to look at the universe in a profoundly different way from your theist counterparts .
Instead of having answers handed down to you , you decided to explore the universe through research and investigation .
Why act like zealous theists when your mindset is supposed to be fundamentally different ?
Let 's see ... 700 billion for Banking companies that constitute 0.4 % to the GDP , and zero dollars for Automakers who contribute more than 4 % to the GDP ?
Nothing for the 3 million plus middle - class workers who constitute more than one in ten U.S. Jobs , and a free Trillion or so to the few thousand well - paid paper - pushers on Wall Street , who contribute even less to the U.S. Economy ( and care nothing ) than our genius legislators in Washington !
The money sent to Wall Street is going down a gilded rathole , with no real oversight , where it is even now being squirreled away in non-productive takeovers , propping up dummy corporations and paying for multi-million dollar ' retention bonuses ' to people whose only experience is retaining other peoples ' money under false pretenses .
Meanwhile , the Auto Companies would be required to pay back , with interest , the meager amount they are BORROWING ( less than 5 % of the Wall Street GIVEAWAY ! ) with more stipulations and strings than a Hollywood Actor 's contract !
Just like when - Chrysler - borrowed - government money - in the 1980's , Senator Shelby of Alabama says the Taxpayers will never get it back .
Gee ... he was WRONG about Chrysler back in 1979 , when they paid it back EARLY and WITH INTEREST !
As a matter of fact , Senator Shelby used almost the exact same words 20 years ago !
Based on the ignorant and ill - informed comments made by him over the last few weeks ,
It appears the distinguished gentleman from Alabama is just as pig-headed and immune to the facts as he was 20 years ago !
Some thing never change .
But why let the facts get in the way of an entertaining propagandistic political rant ?
Most of the out - of - date complaints voiced by ill - informed - members of Congress and the media are about situations and subjects that have already been addressed by the Auto Industry recently or even years ago .
Concessionary contracts , cuts in bonuses and pay for both workers and management , downsizing and other issues have been a fact of life for a while now -- something Congress either does n't know or is deliberately ignoring for political expedience .
And mileage , quality and other product concerns have reached parity or even exceeded the foreign competitors in recent years .
Technological gains from the auto industry are one of the most impressive and least - reported occurrences over the last ten years , but Senators and pundits like outdated terms like ' dinosaur ' and ' failed business plan ' because they pander to ignorant constituents better than using the facts and realistic analyses .
This is nothing more than shameless Union - Busting by the hypocritical Bible - Belt Republican Senators , thinking they will protect the heavily Government - Subsidized Auto - Transplant jobs in their states .
Unfortunately , these political hacks are too ignorant to realize that , in addition to the tens of thousands of auto dealer , supplier and other jobs that rely on the Big 3 in those states that will go away overnight , when the Detroit Automakers go bankrupt , so will the suppliers of 40 - 60 % of the parts to those transplant factories .
Those factories will then have to shut down and lay off workers , thus sending the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies those plants received down the tubes along with the Big 3 !
These days there is also much ill - informed rhetoric in Congress , the Media and the public at large about ' Overpaid Auto Workers ' from people who do n't even know what the jobs pay , let alone what the work entails and how hard an Autoworker works ( union or non-union ) .
Some people scream that they want the Big 3 UAW workers to ' get in line ' with the pay of the foreign transplants .
Maybe the UAW should listen , since the hourly wage at foreign transplant factories like Toyota , Nissan , et al is actual MORE per hour than the UAW workers at the Big 3 !
They also call for big cuts in union wages , as if they did n't know the 2007 UAW contract has a 50 % cut in starting wages for new workers , along with numerous other concessions and givebacks that are unprecedented in ANY industry - let alone in the Auto Industry .
It is ironic that the workers at the non-union auto plants , as well as most hourly workers in America owe their 40 - hour workweek , safe workplaces , their health care plans , and most of their other benefits to workers in the UAW who fought , and in some cases died for the rights of ALL workers to be fairly treated and compensated .
Unfortunately , too many people get suckered into the class - warfare jealousy that tries to make you resent the person making a dollar an hour more than you , in order to distract you from the people who are stealing millions !

Swedish file - sharers have previously been protected from police action , since any offenses they commit do not generally carry a prison sentence .
Now , the government is considering new legislation which will give the police powers to go after regular file - sharers , even if their actions were previously only punishable by a fine .
Swedish file - sharers have traditionally enjoyed a certain amount of freedom , but that could all change if the government gets its way .
At the moment , the police ca n’t go after uploaders of copyright works , unless their activities could attract a jail sentence of two years or more .
Now , according to a Dagbladet report , Minister for Justice Beatrice
Ask will receive a report from the police this Friday , which will recommend that they should be able to investigate file - sharers whose actions would have previously only been punishable by a fine .
The proposed legislation , based on the controversial Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) we previously reported on , will give the police ( and private companies ) more power to go after individual file - sharers .
It would also enable the police to find out who sent an email to who , along with details of telephone calls .
The IPRED proposals , which have faced widespread opposition , aim to increase penalties and criminalize breaches of intellectual property law inside the EU .
The new law was already heavily opposed by Swedish Pirate Party Chairman Rick Falkvinge , who told TorrentFreak : “ These laws are written by digital illiterates who behave like blindfolded , drunken elephants trumpeting about in an egg packaging facility .
They have no idea how much damage they ’re causing , because they lack today ’s literacy : an understanding of how the Internet is reshaping the power structures at their core . ”
Addressing fears that any legislation could be applied retroactively , i.e file - sharers could be pursued for previous breaches , Minister for Justice Beatrice Ask already asked for the deletion from the proposals of any such provisions .
She further told Dagbladet that her ministry wont comment before they receive the interim report from the police on Friday .
However , they are clear on one thing – there will definitely be new legislation .
Adil Najam
Yesterday , the headlines screamed of yet more US drone attacks within Pakistan leaving 18 dead .
Today , they bemoan 11 killed in Swat in continuing fighting between military and militants .
Meanwhile , following on earlier reports of extremists banning women from entering cloth markets in Swat , now we hear of restraunts in Quetta banning the entry of women after succumbing to the fear tactics of fanatics .
The tragedy is that news of barbarism – men killed and hung in the public square because their shalwar was not hiked up to the right length – have become so common that one does not even register as unusual .
We at ATP do not want to be and can not be a newspaper .
But we must stand witness to what is happening .
We can neither be silent at , nor accepting of , the mayhem around us .
We create this post as a space where we will periodically update the outrage that is befalling our society .
It is not possible for a blog to chronicle all that is happening , but lest we forget – or , even worse , we get used to – the outrage , let us at least speak out against it when we can .

Locals said most of the people killed in Charbagh and Sangota during shelling were civilians , who were finding it difficult to move to safer places due to the perpetual curfew and escalating clashes .
Two persons were killed in firing at ambulances belonging to Medicine Sans Frontiers and Edhi , which were shifting the injured to a hospital .
Three officials also sustained injuries in the incident .
Bodies of the slain officials were lying in Charbagh .
The injured were writhing in pain but nobody could go near them .
It could not be ascertained as to who fired at the ambulances as militants and security forces blamed each other for the incident .

> Semantic Web Use Cases and Case Studies
Case Study : Improving Web Search Using Metadata Peter Mika , Yahoo !
Research , Spain
Presenting compelling search results depends critically on understanding what is there to be presented on the first place .
Given that the current generation of search engines have a very limited understanding of the query entered by the user , the content returned as a result and the relationship of the two , the opportunities for customizing search results have been limited .
Opening up search
The majority of Web pages today are generated from databases , and Web site owners increasingly are providing APIs to this data or embedding information inside their HTML pages with microformats , eRDF , or RDFa .
In other cases , structured data can be extracted with relative ease from Web pages that follow a template using XSLT stylesheets .
SearchMonkey reuses structured data to improve search result display with benefits to both search users , developers , and publishers of web content .
The first type of applications are focusing on remaking the abstracts on the search result page : Figure 1 shows the kind of presentations that structured data enables in this space .
Based on data , the image representing the object can be easily singled out .
One can also easily select the most important attributes of the object to be shown in a table format .
Similarly for links : the data tells which links represent important actions the user can take ( e.g. play the video , buy the product ) and these links can be arranged in a way that their function is clear .
In essence , knowledge of the data and its semantics enables to present the page in a much more informative , attractive , and concise way .
Figure 1 : search results using SearchMonkey
The benefits for publishers are immediately clear : when presenting their page this way publishers can expect more clicks and higher quality traffic flowing to their site .
In fact , several large publishers have moved to implement semantic metadata markup ( microformats , eRDF , RDFa ) specifically for providing data to SearchMonkey .
On the other hand , users also stand to benefit from a better experience .
The only concerns on the users ’ part is the possibility of opting out and having a system free of spam .
Both concerns are addressed by the Yahoo Application Gallery .
As shown in Figure 2 , the Gallery allows users to selectively opt in to particular SearchMonkey applications .
Users also have a small number of high - quality applications that are turned on by default .
The gallery is also an effective spam detection mechanism : applications that are popular are unlikely to contain spam .
Also important to note that the presence of metadata does not affect the ranking of pages .
Pages that are trusted by the search engine based on other metrics can be also expected to contain trustable metadata .
For developers , the excitement of the system is in the possibility to take part in the transformation of search and develop applications that are possibly displayed to millions of users every day .
Needless to say , many publishers become developers themselves , creating applications right after they have added metadata to their own pages .
Figure 2 : Yahoo Application Gallery ( a larger version of the image is also available )
Architecture
The high level architecture of the system ( shown in Figure 3 ) can be almost entirely reconstructed from the above description .
The user ’s applications trigger on URLs in the search result page , transforming the search results .
The inputs of the system are as follows :
Metadata embedded inside HTML pages ( microformats , eRDF , RDFa ) and collected by Yahoo Slurp , the Yahoo crawler during the regular crawling process .
Custom data services extract metadata from HTML pages using XSLT or they wrap APIs implemented as Web Services .
Metadata can be submitted by publishers .
Feeds are polled at regular intervals .
Figure 3 : High level architecture of the system
Developers create custom data services and presentation applications using an online tool ( see Figure 4 ) .
This tool is a central piece of the SearchMonkey experience : it gives developers access to all their services and applications .
When defining new custom data services , first some basic information is provided such as name and description of the service and whether it will execute an XSLT or call a Web Service .
In the next step , the developer defines the trigger pattern and some example URLs to test the service with .
Next , the developer constructs the stylesheet to extract data or specifies the Web Service endpoint to call .
( Web Services receive the URL of the page as an input . )
When developing XSLTs , the results of the extraction are shown immediately in a preview to help developers debug their stylesheets .
After that the developer can share the service for others to build applications on and can also start building his own presentation application right away .
Note that custom data services are not required if the application only uses one of the other two data sources ( embedded metadata or feeds ) .
Creating a presentation application follows a similar wizard - like dialogue .
The developer provides the application ’s name and some other basic information , then selects the trigger pattern and test URLs .
Next , SearchMonkey shows the schema of the data available for those URLs taking into account all sources ( embedded metadata , XSLT , Web Services , feeds ) .
The developer can select the required elements which again helps to narrow down when the application should be triggered : if a required piece of the data is not available for a particular page , the application will not be executed .
Then as the main step of the process , the developer builds a PHP function that returns the values to be plugged into the presentation template .
As with stylesheets , the results of the application are shown in a preview window that is updated whenever the developer saves the application .
In practice , most PHP applications simply select some data to display or contain only simple manipulations of the data .
The last step is again the sharing of the application .
Figure 4 : Online application development tool ( a larger version of the image is also available )
As the description shows , the representation of data is a crucial aspect of SearchMonkey , since the output is simply a result of executing a set of transformations on Web data .
Some of these transformations are performed using XSLT and some are complex enough to require a full - blown programming language such as PHP .
What connects these pieces is a canonical representation of structured data .
To understand better the choices made in dealing with structured data it is useful to summarize the main requirements that any solution must fulfill .
These are as follows :
An application platform based on structured data .
As described above , the starting point of SearchMonkey was the observation that the ( vast ) majority of Web pages on the Web are generated from some sort of a database , in other words driven by structured data .
Publishers are increasingly realizing the benefits of opening up both data and services in order to allow others to create mash - ups , widgets or other small , non-commercial applications using their content .
( And in turn , developers are demanding more and more the possibility to have access to data . )
The preferred method of opening up data is either to provide a custom API or embed semantic markup in HTML pages using microformats .
Thus SearchMonkey requires a data representation ( syntax ) that could generally capture structured data and a schema language that provides a minimally required set of primitives such as classes , attributes and a system of data types .
The syntax and semantics should allow to capture the full content in typical microformat data and the languages used should be open to extensions as much as possible .

The syntax and semantics should allow to capture the full content in typical microformat data and the languages used should be open to extensions as much as possible .
Web - wide application interoperability .
The queries received by a search engine and the content returned as a result cover practically all domains of human interest .
While it would have been easier to develop , a solution that would limit the domains of application would not meet the need of a global search product as it would not able to capture the long tail of query and content production .
The question of interoperability is complicated by the fact that the application may be developed by someone other than the publisher of the data .
On the one hand , this means that data needs to be prepared for serendipitous reuse , i.e. a developer should be able to understand the meaning of the data ( semantics ) by consulting its description ( minimally , a human readable documentation of the schema ) .
On the other hand , the framework should support building applications that can deal with data they can only partially understand ( for example , because it mixes data from different schemas ) .
Changes in the underlying representation of the data also need to be tolerated as much as possible .

Changes in the underlying representation of the data also need to be tolerated as much as possible .
Ease of use .
It has been often noted that the hallmark of a successful Semantic Web application is that no user can tell that it was built using semantic technologies .
That novel technology should take a backstage role was also a major requirement for SearchMonkey : the development environment is targeted at the large numbers of Web developers who are familiar with PHP and XML technologies ( at least to the extent that they can understand an example application and start extending or modifying it to fit their needs ) .
However , developers could not have been expected to know about RDF or RDFa , technologies that still ended up playing a role in the design of the system .
Key benefits of semantic technology
Semantic technologies promise a more flexible representation than XML - based technologies .
Data does n’t need to conform to a tree structure , but can follow an arbitrary graph shape .
As the unit of information is triple , and not an entire document , applications can safely ignore parts of the data at a very fine - grained , triple by triple level .
Merging RDF data is equally easy : data is simply merged by taking the union of the set of triples .
As RDF schemas are described in RDF , this also applies to merging schema information .
( Obviously true merging requires mapping equivalent classes and instances , but that is not a concern in the current system . )
Semantics ( vocabularies ) are also completely decoupled from syntax .
On the one hand , this means that RDF does n’t prescribe a particular syntax and in fact triples can be serialized in multiple formats , including the XML based RDF / XML format .
( An XML - based format was required as only XML can serve as input of XML transformations . )
On the other hand , it also means that the resources described may be instances of multiple classes from possibly different vocabularies simply by virtue of using the properties in combination to describe the item .
The definition of the schema can be simply retrieved by entering URIs into a web browser .
RDF - based representations are also a good match for some of the input data of the system : eRDF and RDFa map directly to RDF triples .
Microformats can also be re-represented in RDF by using some of the pre-existing RDF / OWL vocabularies for popular microformats .
Given the requirements , the benefits and drawbacks of these options and the trends of developments in the Web space , the choice was made to adopt RDF - based technologies .
However , it was also immediately clear that RDF / XML is not an appealing form of representing RDF data .
In particular , it does not allow to capture metadata about sets of triples such as the time and provenance of data , both of which play an important role in SearchMonkey .
Other RDF serialization formats have been excluded on the same basis or because they are not XML - based and only XML - based formats can be input to XSL transformations .
These considerations led to the development of DataRSS , an extension of Atom for carrying structure data as part of feeds .
A standard based on Atom immediately opens up the option of submitting metadata as a feed .
Atom is an XML - based format which can be both input and output of XML transformation .
The extension provides the data itself as well as metadata such as which application generated the data and when was it last updated .
The metadata is described using only three elements : item , meta , and type .
Items represent resources , metas represent literal - valued properties of resources and types provide the type (s ) of an item .
These elements use a subset of the attributes of RDFa that is sufficient to describe arbitrary RDF graphs ( resource , rel , property , typeof ) .
Valid DataRSS documents are thus only valid as Atom and XML , but also conform to the RDFa syntax of RDF , which means that the triples can be extracted from the payload of the feed using any RDFa parser .
Figure 5 provides an example of a DataRSS feed describing personal information using FOAF ( the Friend - of - a- Friend vocabulary ) .
Figure 5 : DataRSS feed example
A new format also brings along the question of query language .
Since DataRSS is both XML and RDF , the two immediately available options were XPath and SPARQL .
However , it was also immediately clear that both languages are too complex for the task at hand .
Namely , presentation applications merely need to filter data by selecting a simple path through the RDF graph .
Again , the choice was made to define and implement a simple new query language .
( The choice is not exclusive : applications can execute XPath expressions , and the option of introducing SPARQL is also open . )
As the use case is similar , this expression language is similar to a Fresnel path expressions except that expressions always begin with a type or property , and the remaining elements can only be properties .
Figure 5 also gives some examples of this query language .
Conclusions
The current applications populating this platform are relatively modest transformations of structured data into a presentation of the summary of web pages .
However , the platform is open to extensions that use structured data to enrich other parts of the search interface or to be deployed in different settings such as a mobile environment .
Lastly , in building on semantic technologies SearchMonkey has not only accomplished its immediate goals but is well prepared for a future with an increasingly more semantic web where the semantics of data will drive not only presentation but the very process of matching user intent with the Web ’s vast sources of structured knowledge .

Finally , some good news from America : Chrysler boss Tom LaSorda has confirmed that the PT Cruiser is about to be axed .
Most of us have a personal bogey - car , and the PT Cruiser has been mine pretty much since it first reared its ugly head nearly a decade ago .
It 's hard to believe that when it first appeared it won something approaching cult status , with Chrysler struggling to build enough to meet demand on both sides of the Atlantic .
But , of course , the PT suffered the fate that befalls almost all deliberately fashionable products , becoming desperately uncool in short order .
The Cruiser came as part of a wave of knowingly retro models , an automotive design movement that led to a very dead end .
To be fair to the Chrysler , despite its sometimes crappy build quality it was far from being the least original of the generation of backward - looking models it was born into , and time has been unkind to almost all of its spiritual siblings - the VW Beetle , Rover 75 , Jaguar S - Type and X - Type .
Indeed the only one of the deliberately retro models that seems to have stuck is BMW 's take on the Mini , which at least has the redeeming quality of being a good car and a fairly imaginative reinterpretation of the values that made the original so special .
But I 'm raring to go to the PT Cruiser 's wake , and I 'm intending to take along a wooden stake and a clove of garlic .
I might need them , too - Chrysler is apparently trying to raise some much - needed cash by selling off the rights to build the Cruiser and the production line to enable someone else to do so .
That means there 's the outside chance we have n't seen the last of it yet .
Too much paracetamol can damage the liver Scientists have made a discovery which they hope could reduce liver damage and prevent deaths caused by paracetamol overdoses .
They found overdose patients who suffer the greatest liver damage have higher levels of a protein known as cyclophilin A in their urine .
The University of Edinburgh team says treatments to block the harmful effects of the protein may aid such patients .
About 200 people die each year in the UK following a paracetamol overdose .
Last year 20 overdose patients underwent a liver transplant .
The researchers said that measuring levels of the protein could also enable doctors to determine much sooner which patients are most at risk of liver failure .
PARACETAMOL
Widely used painkiller
For adults , recommended safe dose 500 mg - 1,000 mg ( one or two tablets ) every four to six hours Should not take more than 4,000 mg ( usually eight tablets ) in 24 - hour period
In higher doses can cause potentially fatal liver damage Leading cause of acute liver failure in Western world
In rare cases a normal dose can be enough to cause liver damage
This would mean that high - risk patients could be placed on a liver transplant waiting list sooner , providing more time to find a suitable donor organ .
Lead researcher Dr James Dear said : " Around 30 % of patients who have developed significant liver injury following a paracetamol overdose die .
" If we can find a way to block the protein cyclophilin A , we would hope to limit further damage to the liver .
" Alternatively , measuring levels of the protein could indicate straight away which patients will need a liver transplant .
" Waiting a number of days means that valuable time is lost in trying to find a suitable match .
Even gaining an extra day or two could save a life . "
Dr Varuna Aluvihare , a consultant hepatologist at King 's College Hospital , London , said a test to assess which patients needed a liver transplant would potentially be of great use .
However , he warned that in many cases patients who had taken an overdose of paracetamol did not present to specialist services until it was too late to offer effective treatment .
He said that at the specialist unit at King 's more than half of all cases of acute liver failure were due to paracetamol overdose .
Part of the problem was that symptoms took three to four days to appear , but by that stage the damage had already been done .
The findings will be presented at a meeting of the British Pharmacological Society .

Mr Sterligov is deeply committed to his Orthodox Christian faith
German Sterligov was only 24 when he founded the company in his own name , and , taking advantage of a lack of regulation , swiftly built a financial empire with offices in London and New York .
He later attempted to run for the Russian presidency .
But now , 15 years after he made his first million , he has quit and opted to live a traditional peasant lifestyle deep in the Russian countryside with his wife and five children .
" My life has never been better - I still can't believe I have such a full and interesting life , " he told BBC World Service 's Outlook programme .
" The turkey chicks have just hatched - that 's our exciting bit of news right now .
We have found happiness as a family - and I can still hardly believe we managed to escape Moscow , with all of its mercenary atmosphere , the envy and the hustle .
" I can hardly describe the state of mind we 're in , any more than you can describe the taste of ice cream .
You have to taste it to know it . "
New capitalist
Mr Sterligov now lives in a small cottage , which he describes as " a Russian stove , windows , walls and a ceiling " .
He also has two tractors , a bulldozer and an old Toyota - although in winter , the farm is only accessible by horse - drawn cart .
The nearest house is 11 km ( seven miles ) away .
GERMAN STERLIGOV
University dropout Named first company Alisa , after his dog Became deeply religious ( Orthodox ) in 1996 Launched highly profitable coffin business Staunch nationalist and amateur historian Campaigned on anti-abortion , pro-death penalty platform Had 2003 presidential bid blocked by Kremlin
But he said that even when he was wealthy , he did not live the typical lifestyle of the Russian mega -rich .
" We did not have elephants or swimming pools , " he said .
" But it is true , we always lived in the richest , most elegant and exclusive neighbourhoods , in large , expensive houses . "
Outside of Moscow , he had properties and offices in Battery Park near Wall Street in New York , and in Curzon Street , central London .
Mr Sterligov achieved success by borrowing unsecured cash from financial institutions still struggling to get to grips with a new , capitalist system .
He invested in stocks and set up an international trading company .
Within three months he had paid back all the money he owed .
In his heyday German Sterligov employed more than 2,500 people .
But that has now dwindled to just two - both labourers , who teach the Sterligovs how to do things such as build walls and fix fences .
Happier family
Mr Sterligov sold up after his political ambitions had come to nothing .
He had begun with a campaign for a governorship in Siberia , followed by an effort to be mayor of Moscow and finally Russian president .
" I basically wanted to change the life of the Russian people for the better , " he said .
In such an urgent situation there is no time for discussion - this is when the head of the family , the man , has to make all the decisions
German Sterligov
He explained that he had built up huge debts because of the cost of his political campaigning .
As a result , he sold his house in Moscow , all his properties and stock , and paid back his debts .
He then went camping in the forest , and built a house with the money left after everything else was sold .
" In such an urgent situation there is no time for discussion - this is when the head of the family , the man , has to make all the decisions , " he said .
" It was hard for my wife , she was n't used to the life of the peasant , she was used to the life of the millionaire .
Now she is grateful , because my kids live a normal , real life .
My family is definitely happier . "
Mr Sterligov 's children are educated at home , as he believes that allowing them to go to school would " just corrupt them " .
They will not be allowed to attend university for the same reason .
" Universities are full of depravity - they would just pick up moral corruption there .
So it 's out of the question , " he said .
Mr Sterligov is a staunch nationalist and became deeply religious 10 years ago - although he did not want to talk about this , describing it as " so personal " .
" I do n't have any money left - all I have is the money in my pocket .
And I have geese , some cattle , a ram , and now , my turkeys .
" We are almost totally self - sufficient .
All I have to buy in is sugar , salt and tea , and occasionally bread , when we are too lazy to mill our own flour . "
WASHINGTON  Lisa P. Jackson , chosen to head the Environmental Protection Agency , said at her confirmation hearing Wednesday morning that her first task would be to restore scientific and legal integrity to an agency battered by charges of political interference and coziness with industry .
But she evaded questions on whether as administrator of the E.P.A . she would immediately grant authority to California and 16 other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions , promising only a speedy review of the issue .
Nor did she directly answer questions on whether and how the agency would address regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act , an authority granted the E.P.A. by the Supreme Court in 2007 .
The Bush administration has declined to act on either matter .
Her promise to be guided by science and the law was an implicit rebuke of the management of the E.P.A. under President Bush , where career officials ’ recommendations were sometimes ignored in decisions regarding lead in the air , arsenic in water , and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
“ Science must be the backbone of what E.P.A. does , ” Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
“ If I am confirmed , I will administer with science as my guide .
I understand the laws leave room for policymakers to make policy judgments .
But if I am confirmed , political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A. ’s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes . ”
This is the Israeli Defense Force 's official YouTube channel , where they are posting several gun camera videos per day of bombs falling on Gaza .
That is , until Google temporarily shut it down .

It 's back up now , but a message on the idfnadesk channel 's profile ( Age : 60 , the wit ) explains :
We were saddened earlier today that YouTube took down some of our exclusive footage showing the IDF 's operational success in operation Cast Lead against Hamas extremists in the Gaza Strip .
Fortunately , due to blogger and viewer support , YouTube has put back up some of the footage they removed .

Naturally , the comments sections turned into a firestorm of hateful back - and - forths before they were disabled , which was probably a condition for re-upping the censored videos .
It 's a propaganda campaign , pure and simple .
Even though you can see far worse in the chillingly note - perfect AC - 130 stage in fucking Call of Duty 4 , there are people dying in those buildings , and no , not all of them are terrorists .
No war in history has been fought without the warring parties attempting to control the story with info dissemination .
But using a forum like YouTube , a public community where smartbombs destroying buildings in a populated city are adjacent to sleeping kittens and 12 year olds ' rants on why homework sucks , and where said 12 year olds ( literally , and those of 12 - year - old intellect ) can fill the comment sections with racist hate - spew — is this where we draw the line ?

Oh , and any of said hate spew in the comments here will be grounds for an immediate banhammer .
And it has a gun camera and its own YouTube channel too .
Yesterday , the the White House was talking about bankrutpcy for the Big Three , too , but it seems that GWB does n’t want to let that happen on his watch .
If bankruptcy is the course , he ’s going to force Obama ’s hand .
I posted Don Boudreaux ’s WSJ editorial , “ Bankruptcy Does n’t Equal Death , about the Big Three , and the possibilities of bankruptcy in lieu of bailout , on my Facebook page .
I was particularly fond of Boudreaux ’s comment , and quoted it :
A government bailout of the Big Three keeps huge amounts of productive inputs in firms that ca n’t use them efficiently
This is the unseen that most people never consider .
Yes , there are people working for these companies that will truly suffer under bankruptcy .
But the flip - side , is that some of these people can be re-employed in a restructured auto industry , others will find work in other arenas , etc .
We tend to overlook the resource allocation , though .
Now , no matter what happens , GM , Ford , and Chrysler are not locking the doors tomorrow , but if they did , there would follow a greatly reduced demand for steel , machine parts , machine tools , rubber components , etc .
There are industries and businesses which do not yet exist , because their input costs are higher than they could be .
In response to my post , my friend Shawn commented :
That quote may be true , but Michigan may look like a third - world country before “ the market ” can recover on its own .
Rampant job loss is NOT the lesser of two evils .
… What if the Bailout does allow the automotive companies to restructure without the IMMEDIATE pressure of failure ?
… I would rather risk the POSSIBILITY of a bailout working versus the CERTAINTY of immediate , massive job loss here in Michigan .
I told him that 300 million people had the opportunity to bet on the Big Three , by purchasing their stocks at $ 3 / share .
And 300 million people apparently disagree .
This is reason enough to suggest that bailing out the auto industry is a bad idea .
But I do n’t want to appeal to popularity .
There is no more certainty in a short - term bailout than there is to suggest bankruptcy will inevitably lead to total collaps of the industry .
What if it does n’t work ?
There is , after all , a non-zero chance that even with $ 17.4B worth of TARP funds , the Big Three are doomed to fail .
At some point in time , failure reaches a critical mass that * can ’t* be propped up , no amount of money or effort , no matter how Herculean , can save the company (s ) .
It ’s possible that we ’re living this right now , and if this is true , any diversion of public funds towards assisting this industry is merely throwing good money after bad , and serves to exacerbate and prolong our suffering .

POLICE POT HYPE
The police 's assertions that marijuana is a major threat to road safety is not supported by the science or the numbers .
These " drugged - driving " laws were designed to let police profile the young , the poor , people of colour and people with non-regulation haircuts .
I guess federally licensed medical marijuana users like myself should consider ourselves banned from driving for life , but the neighbour driving , gooned on antihistamines can relax .
Sounds fair .
Sure , pot can impair some people , but it does n't impair every user , and it does n't impair every time .
What about cell phones , coffee , smokes , loud passengers , food in hand , medications , inexperience and plain old stupidity ?
Canadians smoke more pot than any other country .
We use the most potent pot and we admit to toking and driving more than any other country .
Why are we not seeing four or even five times as many crashes as we are ?
Like everything police say about marijuana -- it is all just a lot of hype .
This policy will clog our courts , saddle tens of thousands of Canadians with criminal records , and do nothing at all to improve road safety .
The public is being duped .
This is just another scam to keep cops busy , lawyers rich , and jails full .

Coldplay 's song Viva La Vida is on the Grammys shortlist
Grammy nominees Coldplay have been sued by rock guitarist Joe Satriani , who claims the band 's song Viva La Vida uses one of his riffs .
In court papers filed in Los Angeles on Thursday , he said the song used " substantial original portions " of his 2004 instrumental If I Could Fly .
Satriani , 52 , wants a jury trial and is seeking damages and " any and all profits " for the alleged plagiarism .
Coldplay are shortlisted for seven Grammys , including song of the year .
Viva La Vida is credited to the band 's four members - singer Chris Martin , bass player Guy Berryman , guitarist Johnny Buckland and drummer Will Champion .
The song 's title was inspired by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo .
It appeared on the album Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends - which was released in June and went to number one in 36 countries - and was also one of their hit singles .
Satriani's track appears on his album Is There Love in Space ?
OKAY now the comic should actually post .
Like I said , plan for this week is four regular strips and one New Year 's filler comic .
See you tomorrow .
' Eunoia ' , which means ' beautiful thinking ' , is the shortest word in the English language to contain all five vowels .
This book also contains them all , but never at the same time .
Each of Eunoia 's five chapters is univocalic : that is , each chapter uses only one vowel .
A triumphant feat , seven years in the making , this uncanny work of avant - garde literature is one of the most surprising and awe - inspiring books of the year .
A challenging feat of composition and technical skill , Bök has worked this into a series of compelling narratives and rhythms .
Writing is inhibiting .
Sighing , I sit , scribbling in ink
this pidgin script .
I sing with nihilistic witticism ,
disciplining signs with trifling gimmicks - impish
hijinks which highlight stick sigils .
Is n't it glib ?
Is n't it chic ?
Ear Training and Music Theory Software
Learn to play any simple melody by ear with my Free Ear Training software below .
Updated January / 11/15
See changelog and todo list Videos : 1 . Learn how playing by ear works .
2 . How to use the ear trainer and apply it .
3 . How the statistics section works
I can already pickout a song 's notes by ear
Can you do it in near real time with few mistakes ?
Even if you can , try the song mode option .
Picking out a song slowly by guess and check is n't what we 're talking about here .
Being able to replicate a given note by whistling or singing it back is not perfect pitch or relative pitch .
I 'm not sure why but there 's a lot of confusion about this .
The best way to play by ear is to practice playing by ear
While practicing picking out the notes of your favorite songs is a great way to practice , mastering intervals gives the ability to double check the answer in your head allowing confidence when selecting the next note .
With this program you directly see which intervals you need practice on and practice them more frequently .
The detailed statistics it provides will guide you to what you need to train most .
Practicing only using random songs you like will get you better but not in the very targetted way you will improve by using my program .
It makes it extremely easy to isolate what you need improvement in and lets you target ascending / descending or harmonic , any set of intervals .
I do recommend practicing picking out random songs but I recommend mastering your intervals with my program first , afterwards try the ' song mode ' feature and ' previous note reference ' .
Is associating a song bad thing in the long run ?
Absolutely not .
Even when you 've mastered intervals without song associations it 's impossible to avoid having a song , or many songs , come to mind that are related to the chord or interval being heard .
This is perfectly a natural thing does not damage your ability for identification at all .
Think about school , we learned A is for apple and B is for Bee , with those associations literally wallpapered sometimes to the first grade classroom walls .
I learned A is for apple but I do n't have to think of A is for apple every time I see the letter A in a word , which is what some people have tried to suggest .
Learning to read takes time even after you get associations for every letter , and of course for some you may not really need to make an association .
I was someone who could n't learn certain intervals until I finally associated a song to them .
It 's actually very common .
That 's why I made this program , and yes , I do n't have to think of the song now every time I hear or recreate the interval .

The United Nations aid agency in Gaza says it has run out of food in its distribution centres , which feed more than 700,000 Palestinians .
Gaza 's only power plant has again shut down because of a fuel shortage , as the result of Israel 's blockade .
Israel closed the border into Gaza more than a week ago , in response to cross border attacks by Palestinian militants .
The senior liaison officer with the UN Relief and Works Agency , Saahir Lone , says the implications of the embargo are grave for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians .
" If this interruption to food lasts more than a few days , the most vulnerable people in that society , of which there are many now ... the implications are very serious , " he said .

News reports say that researchers from the John Innes Center in the UK have grown a potentially cancer - preventing tomato .
These tomatoes genetically altered to grow with the dark purple pigment anthocyanin are hoped to either prevent or reduce the effects of a number of chronic diseases including cancer .
When the purple tomatoes were fed to mice in the laboratory , their lives were significantly extended–and one can assume not simply over the excitement of eating a purple tomato !
Researchers conducting this study say its still too soon to tell how much an effect these GMOs will have on human health–and of course the key is still getting these veggies into people diets .
But the successful introduction of this compound into the vegetable makes this GMO a huge success for metabolic engineering .
Oh–and one other thing : anthocyanin is found in snapdragon flowers naturally –but I would n’t go out and start chewing on the petals .
These researchers say that the best way to prevent cancer is still to eat a balanced , healthy diet–not to bulk up on this single compound .

Nobel Prize - winning playwright Harold Pinter , who had cancer , died on Christmas Eve aged 78 .
He wrote more than 30 plays including The Caretaker and The Birthday Party .
His film scripts include The French Lieutenant 's Woman .
His style was so distinctive , " Pinteresque " entered the Oxford English Dictionary .
His wife , Lady Antonia Fraser , said : " He was a great , and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years . "
He had been due to pick up an honorary degree earlier this month from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London but was forced to withdraw due to illness .
His death will leave a huge gap that will be felt by the whole political spectrum
Tony Benn , former politician
Tributes paid to Harold Pinter
In pictures : Harold Pinter BBC Creative Director Alan Yentob told the BBC : " He was a unique figure in British theatre .
He has dominated the theatre scene since the 1950s . "
Michael Billington , Pinter 's friend and biographer , said he was " devastated and saddened " by the news .
He told the BBC : " Harold had been ill for a very long time , but he had a titanic will and one imagined he would go on fighting .
" He was a fighter in the field of politics , he fought strenuously against American and British foreign policy , but also in his work you see this , there is a combative spirit in his work .
" He was a generous and loyal man and very attached to the people whom he sincerely liked . "

Also an actor , poet , screenwriter and director , Pinter was known for his left - wing political views and was an outspoken critic of US and UK foreign policy .
Veteran politician Tony Benn said Pinter was a great figure on the political scene .
" His death will leave a huge gap that will be felt by the whole political spectrum , " he said .
Pinter won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005 and the citation said " in his plays he uncovers the precipice in everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression 's closed rooms " .
He was awarded a CBE in 1966 , later turned down a knighthood and became a Companion of Honour , an exclusive award in the gift of the Sovereign , in 2002 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
So sad .
The last of the 20th century 's great Brits has left us .
Will anybody ever pierce our hearts and minds with the vigour of Pinter 's ever again ?
I doubt it .
Michael , Earlston , UK Pinter was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in 2002 and following treatment , announced that he was on the road to recovery .
Three years later , he announced that he had given up writing for the theatre in order to concentrate on political work .
A production of No Man's Land starring Michael Gambon and David Walliams is due to open at the Duke of York 's theatre in London on Friday . •
A new version of Mark Lawson 's extended 2005 interview with Harold Pinter will be broadcast on Radio 4 on Friday at 1915 GMT .

New Phishing Attack Targets Online Banking Sessions With Phony Popups
' In - session phishing ' the latest Web - based method for phishers to steal users ' banking credentials
Researchers have discovered a sophisticated , new method of phishing that targets users while they are banking online -- sending phony popup messages pretending to be from their banks .
The so - called " in-session phishing " attack prompts the victim to retype his username and password for the banking site because the online banking session " has expired , " for instance , via a popup that purports to be from the victim 's bank site , according to researchers at Trusteer , which today published an advisory ( PDF ) on their findings about the potential for such a phishing attack .
Amit Klein , CTO of Trusteer , says although he and his research team have not spotted full - blown attacks like this in the wild as yet , they have witnessed precursors to it .
The attack goes like this :
The phisher injects legitimate Websites with malicious JavaScript so that when an online banking customer visits one of those sites while banking online , he gets targeted .
The malware exploits weaknesses in the browser that lets the attacker " see " the banking site URL where the victim is logged in , and then the phisher automatically generates a popup posing as that bank .
If the user falls for the popup lure and enters his banking credentials , the phisher then gets those credentials .
" This is the next generation of sophisticated phishing attack , " Klein says .
" It combines an online vector -- the attacker waits for user to come to a genuine site that 's hacked -- and browser shortcomings to detect which site the user is logged into in a different window or tab .
This provides a very powerful avenue to conduct a sophisticated attack . "
The popup message could take other forms , such as a customer satisfaction survey from the bank or a special promotion , according to the researchers -- anything that could dupe the user into handing over credentials .
Klein says placing a low - profile piece of malicious JavaScript on a high - profile Website is n't difficult to do , and the malware is basically invisible to the user .
" Once the JavaScript is rendered , it does the job ... and sees where you are logged in , " he says .
And the attack is possible without the attacker accessing the actual bank site at all , he notes .
The malware on the Website does n't get downloaded to the victim 's machine , so it 's tougher to detect , according to Trusteer .
And Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari , and Chrome all contain a JavaScript vulnerability that lets a Website check if a user is currently logged onto another Website , leaving a temporary " footprint " that lets the attacker trace that site , including a bank .
For in -session phishing to be successful , the attacker has to maintain a list of bank Websites it will look for , and then it can send the phony popup to the victim .
Jeremiah Grossman , CTO and founder of WhiteHat Security , says the attack would be fairly simple to pull off .
" There is no shortage of hacked Websites to piggyback on .
And you 'd probably use this method if you really do n't want to be detected since there is no traditional malware as part of the attack , " Grossman says .
" You are just stealing some information from the browsers session and customizing a new page based upon it . "
Grossman , who , along with Robert " RSnake " Hansen , had previously researched detecting users online , says the fact that there is no malware infecting the machine itself makes the in-session phishing attack especially dangerous .
It would be difficult for antimalware tools to detect , he notes .
This new attack is n't as effective as traditional spear phishing , however , notes Joshua Perrymon , CEO of PacketFocus .
" This just adds more timing and complexity to the attack .
It also depends on the user clicking on the first link , " Perrymon says .
Trusteer offered a few tips for users to protect themselves from an in-session phishing attack : deploy browser security tools ; log out of banking and other sensitive online apps and accounts before going to other Websites ; and be suspicious of any popups during a Web session if you have n't clicked on a hyperlink .

Mutare , Zimbabwe
Godwin Muti was one of the first people to descend on Chiadzwa when word spread that diamonds had been discovered in the arid and impoverished part of eastern Zimbabwe .
Mr Muti , 31 , an unemployed father - of - two , was wallowing in poverty .
He could hardly pay rent for a one - room house where he lodged in the old township of Sakubva in Mutare city .
Teachers abandoned classrooms to join the diamond rush - their pupils followed
When he heard about the diamonds , he joined thousands of others in the rush to Chiadzwa , then an unknown and desolate place .
A few months later his life had been transformed .
Suddenly he was living in the middle - class suburb of Dangamvura , the proud owner of a sedan car and a number of homes that had been beyond his wildest dreams .
Dealers flocked to Mutare from all over the world , including South Africa , Mozambique , Nigeria , Guinea , Mauritania , Lebanon , Iraq , Israel and Belgium .
So once Mr Muti got the diamonds from the fields he could immediately sell them .
They were prepared to part with as much as $ 200 ( £ 134 ) per carat - a handsome price considering panners could sell stones up to 15 carats .
Mr Muti's only problem was the police and their dogs that would constantly chase him and his fellow miners from the fields .
About 20,000 panners rushed to the diamond fields But Mr Muti , and thousands of others , soon found a way round that obstacle - they formed syndicates with the police officers manning the fields .
Suddenly , poor police officers earning less than $ 10 ( £ 7 ) a month were driving new cars too .
The authorities launched several operations to rid Chiadzwa of illegal miners but the hunt for precious gems continued unabated .
Then three weeks ago Mr Muti was surprised to see helicopters hovering over the diamond fields .
Then heavily armed soldiers arrived .
That was the beginning of a brutal campaign to remove illegal miners and the diamond - dealers once and for all .
It was dubbed Hakudzokwi kumunda , meaning " Operation you would never go back to the diamond fields " .
Scattered bodies Reports then began to filter through that bodies of dead panners were piling up at the mortuary in Mutare Provincial Hospital .
The hospital said their mortuary is not working well and the piling of bodies is straining their facilities
Police spokesman Brian Makomeke Nineteen decomposing bodies at the facility have still not been claimed .
This prompted the police to make a public appeal last week to relatives with missing loved - ones to visit the mortuary .
" The hospital authorities have said their mortuary is not working well and the piling of bodies is straining their facilities , " said police spokesman in Manicaland , Inspector Brian Makomeke .
" Some of the deceased panners might be foreigners and we are not sure because they had no form of identification . "
An unknown number of bodies were scattered in the forests surrounding the fields .
Several had died from gunshot wounds while others had succumbed to diseases like cholera .
About 20,000 illegal panners , who had come from all over Zimbabwe to make the diamond fields their permanent homes , fled in all directions .
' Hell on earth ' Within a week of the operation there was not a single miner left in the diamonds fields .
Mr Muti was lucky to escape unhurt .
But he says it was hell and vowed not to return to the fields as long as the soldiers are there .
Factories were left with skeleton staff at the height of the diamond rush " I thank my gods I escaped unhurt , " he says .
" It was hell on earth .
The soldiers are shooting to kill . "
Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition is calling for the alleged violations to be documented so the perpetrators can be brought to justice once normality returns to the country .
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights accused the army of heavy - handed tactics to remove the illegal miners .
And the regional co-ordinator of ZimRights , Reverend Stephen Maengamhura , accused the authorities of " a wholesale violation of rights " .
He puts the number of bodies in mortuaries across the province at 106 .
" I am not employed and this was my only means of survival , " Mr Muti says .
Why should I suffer when I can easily go to Chiadzwa and become a rich person ?
Former maths teacher Moses Mawire " I may now be forced to sell what I bought when I was in Chiadzwa . "
His story is similar to that of thousands of other desperate Zimbabweans who descended on Chiadzwa , seeking instant fortunes .
Teachers , especially those in schools close to the diamond fields , abandoned their classrooms to join the diamond rush - their pupils followed .
Even factories and industries were left with skeleton staff after workers downed tools and headed for Chiadzwa .
Moses Mawire , 37 , a senior mathematics teacher at a secondary school close to Chiadzwa , has not reported to duty for almost a year now .
" Why should I suffer when I can easily go to Chiadzwa and become a rich person ? " Mr Mawire said .
The reporter 's name and those of the diamond miners have been changed for their protection .

Aside from the ATS = CIA claim ...
I noticed that John speaks very highly and with pride of his time here at ATS .
When he speaks of threads where there was good discussions , or how ATS members were at his side to prove or debunk something ... he speaks with pride .
I have no doubt that his problem with ATS is the management and not the members .
It is obvious that he loved the board and members .
Imho ...
Just as there was only one " real " James Bond ..... Connery .
To me there is only one " real " ATS Conspiracy Master .....
Lear
He should still be here , and unfortunately his departure is the members loss .
nuff said !
The few times I laughed out loud were both courtesy of Kerry .... the first was the look on John 's face when she asked him who Jimmy Doolittle was ... priceless ...
The second was when she referred to Minot AFB as Min-aw ( using the French pronunciation )
John eventually corrected her , but it went over like a lead balloon !!
I was also very interested in his AIDS discussion , and how he is trying to get a certain plant / herb out of China that supposedly may hold the cure .
His Bob Lazar out takes are hilarious ... my favorite was how they would wipe Bob 's memories after he interacted with a Grey .
All in all I thought this was a fantastic interview with a member of our ATS Community .
It breaks my heart the way things have worked out .
I have lost much of the respect I had for Management because of the way John Lear was axed ... but ATS is bigger than just S.O and Springer ... and I have never been a brown noser .
Sorry .. wish I could tow the company line on this one ... say I wo n't watch the interview out of loyalty ... but that is not to " Deny Ignorance " , in fact it is just the opposite .
Long Live John Lear
( CNN ) -- Staffers at a federal prison in central Florida fired shots to break up a large - scale fight that sent eight inmates to hospital emergency rooms Sunday afternoon , officials said .
Eight inmates were injured Sunday in a fight at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida , officials said .
Authorities did not say what led to the fight at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Sumter County .
A statement from the prison said one inmate suffered a gunshot wound , but did not say whether the person was struck by a prison staff member 's bullet .
The other seven were " stabbing / shooting victims , " said a spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center , where the inmates were taken .
The hospital did not elaborate .
No prison staffers were seriously hurt in the incident , which the FBI is investigating , said Charles Ratledge , spokesman for the prison .
The fight broke out in the recreation yard of the United States Penitentiary No. 2 , a high - security facility , about 2:20 p.m .
The Coleman complex consists of four institutions .
The other three facilities -- another U.S. penitentiary , a medium - security and a low - security facility -- were not affected , said Bureau of Prison spokeswoman Traci Billingsley .
" The inmates ignored staff orders to stop their assaultive behavior , and shots were fired by institution staff to prevent possible loss of life , " Ratledge said .
Five medical evacuation helicopters -- three from the hospital -- landed at the prison and transported the injured inmates on the 15 - to 20 - minute flight to Orlando Regional , hospital spokesman Joe Brown said .
The prison complex is in near Coleman in Sumter County , about 50 miles northwest of Orlando , Florida .
The community was never endangered by the fight , U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said .
CNN 's Nick Valencia , Susan Candiotti and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .

The number of job vacancies in the IT sector fell by nearly a quarter in the last three months of 2008 , according to the latest research by SSL and Computer Weekly .
The drop is worse than the falls seen during the dot.com crash in 2001 , and is quickly approaching the steep decline in the job market of the 1991 recession .
Compared to the previous quarter , there were 24.3 % fewer jobs advertised from October to December than there were from July to September .
Some job roles saw larger drops in demand than others .
Skills still in demand include Oracle , Java , SQL , C# , .net and SAP .
Salary levels also reflected the drop , with advertised salaries remaining at the same level as last year .
This is the first time this has happened since 1992 .
The research , by Salary Services Limited ( SSL ) and Computer Weekly , predicts that the worrying trends will continue into 2009 .
George Molyneaux , research director at SSL , said , " It is quite possible that recruitment will virtually dry up during the next quarter in a trend not seen since the third quarter of 1991 . "
Finance is still the most affected sector , with a drop of 32.1 % in demand .
Software houses saw demand fall 21.6 % , and manufacturing , retail and media all saw falls .
The public sector was the only one to buck the trend , with 9.5 % more jobs being advertised since the previous quarter .
The main ramifications of the credit crunch had previously been contained in London , but the last quarter of 2008 saw its tentacles spread into the rest of the UK .
Recruitment is down by 27.5 % in the north east of England , 17 % in Scotland , 22.1 % in the south of England , and 10 % in Wales and the west of England .
Molyneaux said there may be some good news in the form of a respite from offshoring .
" The availability of people with the required skills combined with major falls in the value of sterling should start to make it more attractive for companies to retain UK IT operations , " he said .
SAN FRANCISCO  Hewlett - Packard dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday by hopping over a low bar .
The company said its core business was not declining as quickly as it was at other major technology companies , prompting investors to drive its shares up nearly 15 percent .
In a preview of a full earnings report it plans to give Monday , the company also said that its fourth - quarter results had exceeded its earlier projections .
The relatively good news comes as the broader technology industry has started to report the effect of a worldwide economic retrenchment in recent weeks .
Companies like Cisco Systems and Intel , reporting a rapid decline in consumer spending starting in October , have prepared investors to expect revenue declines of 10 percent or more .
More insight on how the tech sector is faring will come on Thursday when Dell is scheduled to release its third - quarter results .
“ She told me everything was all settled ; I do n’t have to worry about anything , ” Miss McClelland said .
“ All I had to worry about was getting the rest of the money to her . ”
According to a suit brought by the Illinois attorney general in November , Foreclosure Solutions Experts does little or nothing to help consumers , and when it does take action , the result is often a repayment plan unsuited to the borrower ’s ability to pay .
The suit alleges that the company never contacted Miss McClelland ’s lender , HSBC .
Illinois is one of the states that bans upfront payments to foreclosure rescue companies .
The attorney general ’s office has received “ thousands ” of complaints about such companies , said Michelle Garcia , an assistant attorney general , and the suit against Foreclosure Solutions Experts is one of 22 filed by the state .
Stacy Strong , who runs Foreclosure Solutions Experts , did not return calls for comment .
Advocates say foreclosure rescue scams are particularly insidious because they prey on people ’s desperation and because they victimize those who can least afford it .
Borrowers seeking loan modification are often frustrated that they cannot reach the right people at their lender or that the lender insists on a repayment plan they cannot keep , said Ira Rheingold , executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates .
“ When you ’re desperate , that ’s when the crooks come out , ” Mr. Rheingold said .
“ You ’ve tried everything , and a guy calls you up on the phone or there ’s an ad on TV , and you have no other options , what do you do ?
You go to those guys .

“ People probably know in their heart of hearts that they may be getting ripped off , just like most people understood on their mortgages that they were getting in too deep , but bankers said yes , so it must be O.K .
It ’s the same thing .
The real problem is that we continue to fail to have systems in place that help people . ”
Eleven states have agreed to come up with a regional low carbon fuel standard which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks , while at the same time helping the country to wean itself off its dependence on oil .
Connecticut , Delaware , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Vermont all agreed on the initiative which would create a ceiling on the average amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the development and burning of fuels .
“ Working together , the 11 states from Maine to Delaware will cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks , spur the development of clean energy technologies like advanced bio-fuels and electric cars , and reduce our dependence on petroleum , ” Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Ian Bowles said in a statement .
California was the first state to enact such a carbon fuel standard plan , which is currently under development .
“ Like California , these other states are leading the way in recognizing that we must take action now to fight global warming , ” California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said .
Transportation accounts for roughly one - third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States .
“ This partnership will work closely on a standard for the entire region , ” said Governor Ed Rendell on Monday , announcing the agreement .
“ In conjunction with Pennsylvania ’s energy policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase clean energy development , this work done by this partnership will ultimately grow our economy and protect our planet by fostering a cleaner environment . ”

It seems to be an article of faith among many land use commentators – both coming from the pro- and anti-planning positions – that Houston is a fundamentally unplanned city , and that whatever is built there is the manifest destiny of the free market in action .
But is this true ?
Did Houston really escape the planning spree that resulted from Progressive Era obsessions with local planning and the subsequent grander plans of the post - WWII age of the automobile ?
Michael Lewyn , in a paper published in 2005 , argues that commentators often overlook Houston ’s subtler land use strictures , and recent developments in the city ’s urban core reaffirm this .
It is definitely true that Houston lacks one of the oldest and most well - known planning tools : Euclidean single - use zoning .
This means that residential , commercial , and industrial zones are not legally separated , though as I will explain later , Houston remains as segregated in its land uses as any other American city .
But single - use zoning is not the only type of planning law that Houston ’s government can use to hamper development .
As Lewyn lays out in his paper , minimum lot sizes and minimum parking regulations abound in this supposedly unplanned City upon a Floodplain .
He discusses a recently - amended law that all but precludes the building of row houses , a stalwart of dense urban areas ( the paper is heavily cited and poorly formatted , so I ’ve removed the citations ) :
Until 1998 , Houston ’s city code provided that the minimum lot size for detached single - family dwellings was 5000 square feet .
And until 1998 , Houston ’s government made it virtually impossible for developers to build large numbers of non-detached single - family homes such as townhouses , by requiring townhouses to sit on at least 2250 square feet of land .
As Siegan admits , this law “ tend[ed ] to preclude the erection of lower cost townhouses ” and thus effectively meant that townhouses “ cannot be built for the lower and lower middle income groups . ”
Houston ’s townhouse regulations , unlike its regulations governing detached houses , were significantly more restrictive than those of other North American cities .
For example , town houses may be as small as 647 square feet of land in Dallas , 560 square feet in Phoenix , and 390 square feet in Toronto , Canada .
Though this law was eventually changed to allow denser homes within Houston ’s ring road ( though not nearly as dense as some American cities allow ) , this change only affected a quarter of Houston ’s homeowners , leaving the rest still as regulated as ever .
Not to mention the fact that even for those within the ring road , the rules only matter to new construction , leaving the vast majority of the building stock in compliance with the old rules .
Not to be outdone by minimum lot restrictions , the parking planners are also hard at work in Houston .
As Donald Shoup explains in his magnum opus on parking regulations and the free market , minimum parking regulations are an oft - used and under - appreciated way for city planners to decrease density , push development farther from the city ’s core , increase an area ’s auto dependency , and decrease walkability and the viability of mass transit .
Houston ’s planning code mandates that developers , regardless of what they perceive as the actual demand , build 1.25 parking spaces per apartment bedroom , and 1.33 spaces per efficiency apartment .
Retail stores are also saddled with these parking minimums , and even bars as Lewyn notes are required to build “ 10 parking spaces per 1000 feet of gross area , ” flying in the face of common sense .
To add insult to injury , the city requires that structures on major roads have a significant setback from the street , and the only rational thing to do with this unbuildable space is to put the mandated parking there , meaning that Houston actual codifies the hideous and inconvenient parking lot - out - front model of sprawl that is so typical across the US .
Another form of planning that Houston has , which is celebrated by the self - titled Antiplanner , is the institution of supposedly voluntary deed restrictions , or private land use covenants agreed upon by the owners of the property under restriction .
I ’m personally torn over the “ libertarianness ” of such schemes – are they truly voluntary ?
Can an individual owner of a property opt out of them once they ’ve been signed ?
What ’s the statute of limitations ?
One thing that makes me suspect that they perhaps are n’t as “ free market ” as they seem is that though the contracts are between individuals , Houston ’s city code allows the city attorney to prosecute these lawsuits at no cost to the supposed victims – fellow property - owners .
In this way , as Lewyn explains , Houston ’s land uses are just as “ Euclidean ” as in other American cities :
But in Houston , restrictive covenants are so heavily facilitated by government involvement that they resemble zoning regulation almost as much as they resemble traditional contracts .
Houston ’s city code , unlike that of most American cities , allows the city attorney to sue to enforce restrictive covenants .
The city may seek civil penalties of up to $ 1,000.00 per day for violation of a covenant .
Thus , Houston forces its taxpayers to subsidize enforcement of restrictive covenants even when litigation is too costly for individuals to pursue .
In its covenant litigation , the city focuses on enforcement of use restrictions ( that is , covenant provisions requiring separation of uses ) , as opposed to enforcement of other restrictions such as aesthetic rules .
By subsidizing enforcement of use restrictions , Houston ’s city government subsidizes segregation of land uses–and in fact , land uses in Houston are only slightly less segregated than in most cities with zoning codes .
More recently , Houston ’s supposedly laissez - faire attitudes towards planning have again been tested by the proposed 23 - story tower at 1717 Bissonnet Street .
The tower would have been in a low - rise residential neighborhood , within walking distance of Rice University .
After years of wrangling , the project was finally denied by the city , on grounds that the developers failed to prove that the project would not adversely affect traffic flow ( a pretty arbitrary and un-libertarian requirement considering Houston ’s legendary congestion and the fact that developers have little say over where the city places its roads ) .
And this , despite the fact that many of the tower ’s prospective residents – Rice students and staff – could have either walked or biked to school / work .
Boosters of Houston ’s land use policy – those who believe that Houston ’s land use patterns are the free market , revealed – never mention the restrictive minimum lot size and minimum parking requirements .
They mention deed restrictions as free market innovations but fail to see how the city ’s prosecutors turn private concerns into public budget drains .
And though the Antiplanner in his aforelinked comments on Houston recognizes the anti-density movement that reared its ugly head after the 1717 Bissonnet proposal , he evidently does n’t see this as seriously detracting from Houston ’s anything - goes land use policy .

ROSEVILLE , Calif .  Gary Garcia probably knows the early - morning rhythms of the streets here in this city just north of Sacramento better than anyone besides his fellow garbage truck drivers .
Anything that breaks the morning pattern is obvious to them , which makes it easy for the garbage collectors to perform an added job  eyes for the police .
“ See , here ’s an odd vehicle here , ” Mr. Garcia said , gesturing toward a red Ford sedan parked by itself , far from the nearest house , on a street where every other vehicle sat neatly in a driveway .
He drove by slowly , peering down into the car but seeing nothing on the seats .
“ It ’s an odd place to be parked . ”
It is a low - tech approach to surveillance , relying not on satellite cameras , space - age radiation detection devices or even neighborhood Webcams .
In more and more towns , drivers and garbage collectors are helping the police keep up with what is happening on the streets .
Some of the nation ’s biggest waste collection companies , including Waste Management and Republic Services , have been participating in the program for several years , allowing police departments to train their workers on what to look for .
We are in a period of forced liquidation , which has happened only eight or nine times in the past 150 years .
The fact that it 's historic does n't make it any more fun , of course .
But it is a pretty interesting time when there is forced selling of everything with no regard for facts or fundamentals at all .
Historically , the way you make money in times like these is that you find things where the fundamentals are unimpaired .
The fundamentals of GM are impaired .
The fundamentals of Citigroup are impaired .
Virtually the only asset class I know where the fundamentals are not impaired - in fact , where they are actually improving - is commodities .
Farmers cannot get a loan to buy fertilizer right now .
Nobody 's going to get a loan to open a zinc or a lead mine .
Meanwhile , every day the supply of commodities shrinks more and more .
Nobody can invest in productive capacity , even if he wants to .
You 're going to see gigantic shortages developing over the next few years .
The inventories of food worldwide are already at the lowest levels they 've been in 50 years .
This may turn into the Great Depression II .
But if and when we come out of this , commodities are going to lead the way , just as they did in the 1970s when everything was a disaster and commodities went through the roof .
What I 've been buying recently is agricultural commodities .
I 've also been buying more Chinese stocks .
And I 'm buying stocks in Taiwan for the first time in my life .
It looks as if there 's finally going to be peace in Taiwan after 60 years , and Taiwanese companies are going to benefit from the long - term growth of China .
I have covered most of my short positions in U.S. stocks , and I 'm now selling long - term U.S. government bonds short .
That 's the last bubble I can find in the U.S.
I cannot imagine why anybody would give money to the U.S. government for 30 years for less than a 4 % yield .
I certainly would n't .
There are going to be gigantic amounts of bonds coming to the market , and inflation will be coming back .
In my view , U.S. stocks are still not attractive .
Historically , you buy stocks when they 're yielding 6 % and selling at eight times earnings .
You sell them when they 're at 22 times earnings and yielding 2 % .
Right now U.S. stocks are down a lot , but they 're still very expensive by that historical valuation method .
The U.S. market is yielding 3 % today .
For stocks to go to a 6 % yield without big dividend increases , the Dow will need to go below 4000 .
I 'm not saying it will fall that far , but it could very well happen .
And if it gets that low and I 'm still solvent , I hope I 'm smart enough to buy a lot .
The key in times like these is to stay solvent so you can load up when opportunity comes .

Mr. Obama first broached the idea with Mr. Emanuel weeks ago , say people familiar with their exchanges .
" You ’d have my back , " he is said to have told Mr. Emanuel .
Mr. Obama believes , and the skeptics acknowledge , that few people are better suited for the job on paper .
Mr. Emanuel , who turns 49 this month , knows the White House , having been a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton .
In a brief career as an investment banker after that , he made millions and became familiar with Wall Street ; in the House , he helped negotiate the government bailout of the financial system that the next president inherits .
And by all accounts , Mr. Emanuel knows Congress like few others ; in his second term , in 2006 , he engineered House Democrats ’ victories to regain the majority .
The Democrats in turn elected him as their caucus chairman ; he was immediately viewed — not least by himself — as a prospective speaker .
A centrist Democrat , Mr. Emanuel knows policies as well as politics , easily distills complex issues into a simple message and is renowned for always seeing several steps ahead in the legislative process .
But there ’s the matter of his temperament — or , as Mr. Emanuel says , “ I swear a lot . ”
He also yells a lot , and in his sentences his favorite expletive can serve as subject , verb or adjective when he is facing down either recalcitrant Democrats or Republican opponents .
As the House Democrats ’ campaign chairman for 2006 , he swore at Hispanic and African - American House members , nearly all of whom had safe seats , to contribute more of their personal campaign finances to the party effort .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi intervened to smooth things over .
To many Democrats , including some who are close to both men , Mr. Obama ’s choice of Mr. Emanuel to run the White House seems at odds with the atmosphere Mr. Obama enforced at his Chicago campaign headquarters .
The motto there was “ No drama with Obama , ” in contrast with the backbiting and shakeups in rivals ’ campaigns .
We are concerned about the economy .
We worry about the stock market , investments , and retirement .
We hesitate to open bank statements .
We are told :
It will get better .
It will get worse .
It will rebound .
How do we cope ?
We have to make do with less .
Lots of articles offer advice : Eat at home .
Take the bus .
Rearrange , do n't redecorate .
At the heart are these questions :
What can you live without ?
Can we be happy with less ?
Can we do it when the American way seems to be distilled lately to all about believing that we need and deserve more ?
What I keep thinking about is what it was like when I really did have less .
In my 20s I lived in Washington , D.C. , and made $ 13,000 .
I had an apartment and a car .
I packed my lunch and saved up to go out for dinner .
Was I really as happy as I remember ?
Yes .
Most of us probably were .
The reason is n't complicated .
We wanted less .
I was proud to be paying rent .
I wanted to drive instead of take the bus so making the car payment for my used 1971 VW Beetle was great .
I bought clothes on sale or at consignment stores , and when friends moved they passed along furniture they did n't want .
But over time , through reading and traveling and meeting people , I learned about nicer cars and better clothes .
I bought into the status symbol they stood for .
I began to want a real couch and a newer car and I began to fantasize about someday buying a house .
Later my hopes included owning a Subaru and – I laugh to remember this – I thought I 'd have the perfect wardrobe when I could buy one ( yeah , one ) really good purse .
Today , four houses later and many closets filled with shoes and purses , I can feel deprived simply by thinking about making my car last a couple more years .
Everything I have now is nicer than what I had at 25 , but it 's easy to feel poor .
Why ?
Because I have seen – and imagined – better .
Wealth is relative to desire .
Every time we yearn for something we can't afford , we become poor – regardless of our resources .
It 's when we are satisfied with what we have , that we become rich .
The hard part is understanding that and adjusting accordingly .
We know there are nicer things and we see people who have them .
For this you can blame television and magazines .
Through them , we can see easily what others buy and own and wear .
Every new thing whispers its promise of happiness then gradually slides into the background of everyday life .
Then we notice that someone else has a different or nicer thing .
And we suddenly need it , too .
This is n't the same as ambition or reaching for a goal ; it 's more about tweaking how we think about what we want .
This is why many of us recall feeling better when we were younger .
We felt as if we had enough because we had n't yet begun to compare ourselves with others .
We did n't expect that we should have a lot more .
It 's our expectations that trip us up .
We substitute one material desire for another , convinced each time that the next whatever will make us happy .
And we then seek out that happiness through spending money .
But what we need is less desire , not more money .
There are two ways to make a man richer , writer - philosopher Jean - Jacques Rousseau reasoned :
Give him more money or curb his desires .
The solution this year : Expect less and want less .
Perhaps the way to sort a real desire from just wanting is to wait a few weeks and see if the want changes .
Or maybe to listen carefully to the dialogue inside .
Is the inner voice saying " I like this " ... or " They will be impressed " ?

Those of you who know me well know I ’m not the most modest person in the world .
For those of you who do n’t know me very well : I ’m not the most modest person in the world .
So when I tell you I ’ve just spent the past couple of days feeling very , very small and tiny , you ’ll know that whatever made me feel that way must have been phenomenal .
Well , it was n’t something .
More like 300 someones .
I was invited to join the Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow ( MLT ) conference in Doha , Qatar , which brought together over 300 of the most incredible Muslims I ’ve ever had the honor of meeting from over 75 countries to discuss some of the most pressing issues facing Muslims today .
( There has been lots of press about the conference .
It was organized by the New York - based American Society for Muslim Advancement , the Cordoba Initiative , the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations , and sponsored by the Doha International Center for Interfaith Dialogue ) .
There is absolutely no way I can possibly convey how brilliant , dynamic and articulate each and every person I met was .
Suffice to say , I was walking around meeting people and then going “ Oh my God !
I was talking to who ? ! ” when I looked them up in the biography books we were given ( And yes , I do realize how nerdy and stalk - ery that sounds ) .
Case in point :
Talking to an MLT while we were both in the bathroom waiting for a stall to open up and finding out she was not only Malcom X ’s daughter , but an author , lecturer and activist .
Sitting next to another MLT on the bus and finding out it was Debbie Al - Montaser , principal of the Khalil Gibran International Academy .
Joking at the buffet line with another MLT who turned out to be the editor of Emel and a participant in the Doha Debate which we watched later that night .
Talking with another MLT for an hour before finding out she was the author of Spirit 21 , a blog I check at least every couple of days .
Speaking to a Turkish woman who called herself a journalist only to find out she was the producer of Behind Walls , a documentary of women ’s relationship with Islam filmed in 13 different countries .
And so on and so forth .
As you can see from the examples I ’ve given , there were some truly incredible and fantastic women in attendance , who made up almost half the participants and half the panelists .
Which , I ’ll have to admit , almost made me jump for joy .
( You can read the biographies of all the MLTs here ) .
Women who were all leaders in their own right , and each and every one of them was truly unique , highlighting the diversity of Muslim women .
There were veiled and unveiled women , women in suits and women in abayas , women from the U.S. and women from South Africa , women who were rappers and women who were judges .
The MLTs were all of different nationalities , ideologies , work sectors and basically different in every which way .
As the MLT website stated :
“ An Italian imam , a Saudi fashion designer , an Iranian rapper , a Pakistani madrasa reformer , an American blogger , and a Dutch lawyer are among the participants attending the MLT conference . ”
The most colorful bag of M&Ms you can imagine .
Kudos to the organizers for managing to bring together all these incredible people from every corner of the world under one roof .
The one thing they all have in common ?
A faith that is threaded through their lives and actions .
Oh , and an almost insane ability of multitasking .
Ask anyone what they ‘ did ’ and you ’d get an answer that sounded like this :
“ In the morning I ’m a lecturer at university .
Then in the afternoon I go work at the NGO I founded .
In the evening I give khutbas at the mosque where I ’m an imam , and at night I work on my book , which is a more in - depth look at the topic I tackled in my PhD . ”
Truly , the MLT conference illustrated not only the diversity but the sheer braininess of the ‘ creme ’ of the Muslim community .
Civic leaders , religious leaders , opinion leaders and every kind of leader from every kind of field was represented .
And it was n’t all rainbows and butterflies : there were differences of opinion , healthy and not - so - healthy debates and many intense and heated discussions .
All serving to illustrate that Muslims are not , as many would believe , a monolithic entity .
If the entire conference was nothing except us sitting together and talking , then I would have judged it a tremendous success .
As it was , I ’ve come out of this conference truly optimistic and invigorated , and met a lot of people I would have never gotten the chance to meet in a million years .
And I ate a lot of good hummus while in Qatar . 🙂
The Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow ( MLT ) is a global program , social network , and grassroots movement meant to cultivate the next generation of young Muslim leaders .
By empowering young , dynamic Muslim leaders from all walks of life , the MLT program creates a platform to promote their message and develop the tools needed to galvanize lasting social change worldwide .
The MLT program generates a free and open public space where this community can vigorously debate ideas , share best practices , and help one another become better leaders .
With ethnic , religious and social diversity as key strengths , the MLTs are stepping up as spokespersons and activists for peace and tolerance around our globe today .
MLT is the largest global program creating a new generation of Muslim civic leadership .

According to an online survey , cliches like " at the end of the day " , " 24/7 " and " literally " are among the most reviled .
Here are 20 more that particularly irk Magazine readers .
1 . My vote for most irritating cliche has to be " basically " .
I even manage to irritate myself by using it , although I do try not to .
AS , Salford , England 2 .
A few minutes ago I said " basically " was the most irritating cliche .
I 've changed my mind : " To be fair " is the most awful thing anybody can ever say , particularly since it is invariably followed by a biased and utterly unfair comment .
Ian , Sheffield 3 .
My most hated expression has to be " to be honest " .
What does it mean ?
Are you normally dishonest then ?
To my shame you might even catch me saying it .
John Airey , Peterborough 4 .
It has to be " going forward " , used by business people / politicians , as in : " Going forward , we need to do ... X. "
Since time is irreversible , it 's totally unnecessary .
No one experiences life " going backward " .
Alex Brodie , London 5 .
As far as irritating cliches go , the phrase " the fact of the matter is " must top the list .
The fact of the matter is , that it rarely is the actual fact of the matter .
It is usually just the speaker 's own opinion .
C Starkey , London 6 .
Overused cliches I dislike are " let 's face it " and " let 's be honest " .
Clive , Nottingham 7 .
The worse cliche I hear is " touch base " .
If anyone knows where that came from please let me know so I can go back in a time machine and stop it from ever being said .
I have a feeling it was a 1980s invention .
Hazel , Notts 8 .
I was looking at your well - worn phrases and although " at the end of the day " is a bad one , I absolutely detest anyone saying " 110 % " or " 150 % " or any other variant .
It is 100 % and nothing more .
You can't get more than a whole .
I 'm glad I got that off my chest ...
Par , Dundee 9 .
My old boss used to tell us that everything was " in the pipeline " .
One disgruntled staff member commented that this pipeline seemed to be a very long and very clogged - up sewer .
Al , Wellington NZ 10 .
The phrase I hate is " the reason being " .
Particularly when used by people who are trying to sound educated .
They invariably show off their lack of education with the next phrase .
Alex Knob , UK 11 and 12 .
" I 'm not being funny but ... " is one of THE most annoying things that a person can say , and is usually followed by a highly irritating and officious remark .
Beginning a sentence with " You know " is another one , especially popular with sportsmen such as David Beckham .
Please make these and other irritating cliches illegal .
Rosie Spectacle , Tunbridge Wells , UK 13 and 14 .
I hate , hate , hate it when people invite me to " touch base " with them at a later date .
Or how about when someone announces that they 'll have made a decision " by the end of play today " ?
However , possibly the most annoying of all cliches must be when those misguided amongst us declare the importance of " singing from the same hymn sheet " .
" Go do one " , I say ...
Kristian Turner , Cambridge 15 .
" Ca n't get my head round it " - a ridiculous thing to say !
Kay Rhodes , Sutton Coldfield , UK 16 and 17 .
Cliches to hate : 1 ) Basically 2 ) A raft of proposals
3 ) To roll out ( new initiatives etc ) .
Steve Barnett , Sunderland 18 .
" Do n't just talk the talk , you got to walk the talk " .
How annoying is that ?
Richard Bridges , Barnet 19 .
" Lessons will be learned " .
Most pointless and annoying cliche ever .
Laura Albins , Ipswich 20 .
The use of the word " actually " .
I find it so annoying when listening to reports on the Today programme that I end up " actually " counting the times the word is used .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday October 31 2008
Our calculation of the chances of four out of five US presidents being left - handed was slightly awry in the article below .
We gave the probability as 0.00009 , given that one in 10 of the population is left - handed .
That is the probability of any particular sequence of one right - handed and four left - handed presidents .
The odds of that occurring in any order would be 0.00045
Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race - Barack Hussein Obama 's Islamist takeover , say , or John " Bush " McCain 's plans to steal the election - a truly sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed .
Some see the devil 's hand at play in an election that , whatever the outcome , will see America make a a fundamental shift , not from right to left , but from right - handed to left - handed .
Both Obama and McCain are sinistral - lefties to you and me - in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office .
One of them will be the fourth left - handed president out of the five past holders of the world 's most powerful office , a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists .
Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president , and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left - handed .
The victor will become the sixth lefty out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war , stretching back to Harry Truman .
The other postwar lefties - in - chief are Gerald Ford , the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan , George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton .
Since 1974 the only right - handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush .
Roughly one in 10 of the population is left - handed , so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking : the probability is 0.00009 .
Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out .
Certainly , the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers ; only two of them , Churchill and Callaghan , were left - handed .
But Daniel Geschwind , a professor of human genetics at UCLA , thinks it is beyond coincidence .
" Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant , and probably means something , " he said .
Membership of the rarefied group also extends across the political divide and into US public life .
Apart from Obama and McCain , it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey , the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore , New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson 's neighbour Ned Flanders .
Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns .
The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98 % of right - handed people , but is on the left for only about 60 % of left - handers .
About 10 % of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere - far more than their right - handed brethren - and about 30 % straddle both sides .
How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood , but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left - handed maths professors at MIT , for instance , as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee , not to mention Winfrey , Gore and Bloomberg .
Left - handed US presidents go back to James Garfield , who , legend has it , could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other .
The rollcall has not always been a happy one .
Garfield was assassinated in 1881 ( though the assumption that left - handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked ) .
Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left - handed US president , and we know all too well what happened under him .
Fidel Castro is also a member of the club , as is Osama bin Laden .
Over the centuries , southpaws , as they have been known since the early days of baseball - have had a rough ride .
Etymology tells the story .
" Sinister " comes from the Latin word for left , later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky .
According to the Left - Handers Club , a support group based in Surrey , the Devil is almost always portrayed as left - handed .
The basics of life , from desks to scissors and computer mouses , are geared to the right - handed majority .
Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium .
Kristy Ainslie , a biomedical engineer in San Francisco , knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience .
Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group , Lefties for Obama , partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream .
She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties :
" When you are left - handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be willing to stand out from the crowd .
That 's not bad training for a president . "
• Ed Pilkington is right - handed
Elections Canada alleges the Conservative Party of Canada deliberately violated federal elections law by spending about $ 1.1 million over its national limit on media advertising and deliberately filed misleading statements in its official returns .
In a sworn affidavit released yesterday by the Conservative Party , a senior investigator in the office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections claimed last week 's extraordinary search of the party 's national headquarters was justified in order to obtain evidence supporting the allegations .
Ronald Lamothe , assistant chief investigator in the office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections , stated investigators would look for material " that could reasonably be believed to evidence " of the offences .
He sought hard - copy and electronic copies of correspondence , emails , invoices , accounting records and all kinds of other papers that would outline discussions between Conservative officials and its media production and buying agencies Retail Media , Yield or Yield Integrated , Republic Publicité + Design Inc .
Specifically , Lamothe cited three potential offences under the Canada Elections Act .
The third allegation comes under the obligation to file " true and complete reports . "
The allegation is that the party 's official agent filed returns with Elections Canada " that it knew or ought reasonably to have known contained a materially false or misleading statement " on its expenses .
The range of penalties for exceeding the election expense limit for a party 's chief agent is $ 1,000 fine , three months imprisonment or both .
A registered party is liable to $ 25,000 fine .
The information to obtain the search warrant says the Conservative spending limit was $ 18,278,278.64 , and that the party claimed it spent $ 18,019,179.28 , leaving it $ 259,099.36 short of its maximum election expenses spending limit .
" Had the Conservative Party of Canada included the amount of $ 1,375,451.91 that it spent for the ( regional ) media buy as a party election expense , it would have exceeded its spending limit by $ 1,116,352.55 , " stated Lamothe .
That money was allocated to local campaigns of 67 candidates , two of whom did n't get the 10 per cent of votes required to claim expense rebates , it said .
" It also improperly generated a potential reimbursement of 60 per cent of the media buy - related election expenses , " for the local campaigns that participated , the affidavit says .
In the end , elections investigators , backed by RCMP officers , concluded their raid after two days .
The warrant , filed in Toronto , was sealed .
It was later unsealed Friday , but not to be made available to the public until sometime Monday or later .
Outraged over the unprecedented search , officials of the Conservative Party of Canada released the package of nearly 650 pages of the search warrant documents today .
Senior party officials took the unusual step of briefing a limited number of reporters on the documents at a downtown hotel Sunday afternoon .
Speaking on condition they not be identified by name , they framed some potentially more damaging emails that Lamothe cited in his package .
One of those emails included an email by an employee at the party 's media buying agency referring to a call from the head of the Conservative Fund , Irving Gerstein .
" They may be spending up to their legal limit on this campaign , " wrote David Campbell advising others of Gerstein 's call .
" They are also thinking of ' switching ' some of the time over to the ridings .
It sounded like the reason was to legally maximize advertising expenditures . "
A senior official said emails may contain " heated language " in the course of a campaign , but no evidence of illegality .

A Conservative official said the party never denied its campaigns are " centrally organized … that our national campaigns and our regional organizers were the drivers for this . "
All ads produced and aired regionally contained the necessary local taglines , he said .
But in some cases , he said candidates who agreed to go in on buying media advertising time " had second thoughts , " and had to be told it was " too late . "
" Transfers of money , including sales of goods and services by national parties to local parties is perfectly legal under the act .
It 's all part of running a modern , integrated national campaign . "
But the officials denied the party deliberately sought to skirt national limits by using up spending room in local campaigns that were less likely to produce wins for the party , or that the Conservatives sought to direct media spending into ridings that were more likely to win them .
They scoffed at suggestions it might have made the difference in a dozen or so ridings and won the election , saying it is " crap . "
He said the party exercised its right to advertise " in a free and legal manner .
The content is ours to do .
We took great pains to organize these regional buys to be consistent with Elections Canada , particularly the billing , invoicing and the authorization taglines . "
The official said " this is not just about money or rebates . "
If it was , he suggested , there were easier ways for the party to get $ 1.2 million than through contested rebates from Elections Canada .
Party officials said the search was sweeping and " outrageous . "
Dropping the moderate language about a " visit " from investigators , supported by the RCMP , they said Elections Canada " stormed " the party 's headquarters .
Party officials said they had complied with all requests last year from Elections Canada to turn over documents , but never received one request from the commissioner 's office which did interview their media buyer .
The party says Elections Canada has not applied the same rules equally to the Liberals , Bloc Québécois or NDP , which saw their national campaigns do similar " media buys " for local or regional campaigns .
They also saw similar funds transferred between national and local campaign offices and similar expense claims submitted , and refunded , by Elections Canada .

After yet another fierce , 45 - minute gun battle , Majdi Abed Rabbo was ordered once again to negotiate his perilous way across the already badly - damaged roof of his house , through the jagged gap in the wall and slowly down the stairs towards the first - floor apartment in the rubble - strewn house next door .
Not knowing if the men were dead or alive , he shouted for the second time that day : " I'm Majdi .
Do n't be afraid . "
All three men – with Kalashnikov AK - 47 rifles , wearing camouflage and headbands bearing the insignia of the Izzedine el Qassam brigades – were still alive , though one was badly injured and persuaded Mr Abed Rabbo to tighten the improvised bandage round his right arm .
The youngest – perhaps 21 – was taking cover behind fallen masonry from where he could see the Israeli troops who had sent the visitor .
Nervously , Mr Abed Rabbo told them : " They sent me back so I can take your weapons .
They told me you are dead . "
It was the youngest who replied defiantly : " Tell the officer , ' If you 're a man come up here ' . "
When the soldiers had arrived at about 10 am , Mr Abed Rabbo , 40 , had no inkling that over the next 24 hours he would make four heart - stopping trips , shuttling across increasingly dangerous terrain between the Israeli forces and the three besieged but determined Hamas militants who had become his unwelcome next - door neighbours .
He would recall every detail of an episode which , in the telling , resembles the more melodramatic kind of war movie , but which was all too real for a man who by the end had lost his house and thought ( wrongly ) that his wife and children were dead .
He had also witnessed at too close quarters the last stand of the men from the Qassam brigades in the face of relentless Israeli ground attacks and Apache helicopter fire .

Civilians were not killed in this episode , as they were in all too many during Operation Cast Lead .
Instead , it offers a rare and detailed glimpse of an actual engagement between the Israeli military and Hamas fighters .
And while it helps to reinforce Israel 's contention that Hamas operates in built - up civilian areas , it also suggests that its own commanders were prepared to use civilians as human shields to protect Israeli troops .
It is one man 's version of what happened , of course .
But as the soldiers would find out when they checked later , Mr Abed Rabbo is a former member of the Fatah - dominated intelligence , still being paid by the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah .
He believes the Hamas gunmen had no right to be in the house next door .
But he also strongly objects to the use made of him by the Israeli military .
" I could have been killed , " he explained .
The soldiers arrived on 5 January , the second day of their ground offensive , with a Palestinian he knew only by his family name of Daher .
After telling him to remove his trousers and roll up his shirt to establish he had no weapons , the soldiers told him to bring out his wife , Wijdan , 39 , and family .
Then , with Mr Abed Rabbo escorted at gunpoint by three soldiers and his family still in the yard , the troops searched his house up to the roof .
The Arabic - speaking soldier assigned to Mr Abed Rabbo then asked him about the house next door .
He told them he thought there was no one in the property .
Then , he said , one of the soldiers brought a sledgehammer with which Mr Abed Rabbo was told to smash a hole in the wall between the two roofs , each opening to the apartments below .
An officer arrived and ordered a search of the house next door .
The officer went first , stepping cautiously sideways down the stairs with his M16 rifle pointing downwards , then Mr Abed Rabbo with the soldiers and their guns pointed at his back .
Suddenly , the officer turned and started screaming at his men .
" We went back upstairs .
The soldiers were pulling me and I fell twice , " Mr Abed Rabbo said .
" We went back to the roof of my house . "
It became apparent what the officer had glimpsed when suddenly the soldiers , by now on high alert and outside the yard of Mr Abed Rabbo 's house , came under fire .
He was taken into a mosque , which was already full of soldiers , across the road , then handcuffed and told to sit .
After a 15 - minute silence , the Hamas militants opened fire again .
" The soldiers took position at the windows of the mosque and started shooting back .
I was screaming at the soldier who spoke Arabic , ' My wife and children are in danger ' . "
Mr Abed Rabbo said he was then told " shut up or I 'll shoot you " .
" I collapsed and started to cry , " he added .
" I felt my family was dead . "
He remained in custody for the next two days , sometimes handcuffed , staying with the Israeli unit as it moved through the area , often amid heavy exchanges of fire .
Once , he was told to open the doors of two cars at another house to check them , before summoning the female occupants of the house downstairs .
Then , in the afternoon , he was ordered to visit the damaged building where the armed Hamas men were .
" I said I will not go .
Maybe they will shoot me .
I have a wife .
I have kids , " he recalled .
But , he added , the Israeli officer told him he had " fired 10 rockets and killed them " .
He was then told to go into the house and bring out the weapons , after being hit with a rifle butt and given a kicking to reinforce the order .
" I went to my house and saw my family was not there .
I looked to see if there was any blood but there was nothing .
It was empty .
As I went down the stairs I was calling ' I 'm Majdi ' so they would not think I was Israeli and shoot me . "
Approaching the apartment door , he saw one gunman , his AK - 47 pointed out , standing guard in the hall with two others behind him .
Staying at the doorway , he told them the Israelis believed they had been killed .
" They asked me where the army was and I said , ' They 're everywhere ' , " he added .
" They asked me to leave . "
The soldiers , concealed behind the wall of a house 100 metres away , told him to strip naked to show he had not concealed any weapons as he left the house .
Later , he was asked to make a third trip – his second journey alone – to the gunmen 's redoubt .
Mr Abed Rabbo says the Israeli officer cursed and hit him when he heard his report .
Shortly afterwards , an Apache helicopter fired three missiles which he says " destroyed " the house containing the gunmen .
Night had fallen when he set out yet again under orders from the troops , but Mr Abed Rabbo persuaded them that the route through the rubble on his roof was impassable in the dark .
" I kept asking about my family and they kept saying ' they 're OK , they 're OK ' . "
The gunmen , incredibly still alive , opened fire yet again .

Mr Abed Rabbo was then taken to another house and told to stay there , handcuffed , cold and " worried about my family , my house " .
The Israeli soldiers came to fetch him again at about 6.30 am , assuring him " we killed them last night " and telling him to go and see .
" I said , ' How can I go ?
My rooftop is destroyed .
It is very dangerous ' , " Mr Abed Rabbo explained .
But given no choice , he managed to reach the stairs and descending cautiously , calling out as he had done twice before .
" I saw everything was destroyed .
They were all injured but the one who had been bleeding was worst .
He was holding his finger up and saying , ' There is no God but Allah ' .
One of them was lying under rubble but still alive .
The one in better condition said there was no way they would surrender , they would become martyrs .
One gave me his name and told me to give a message to his family . "
Mr Abed Rabbo said the Israelis started shooting while he was there and he ran away .
" I went back to the Army .
I lied to them .
I said , ' They said if I went back they would kill me ' . "
The Israeli troops now used a megaphone to tell the gunmen in Arabic : " You have families .
Come out and we will take you to hospital and take care of you .
[ The ] district is full of special forces .
All the Hamas leaders are hiding underground . "
According to Mr Abed Rabbo : " While they were talking like this the [ Hamas men ] opened fire again , the officer pushed me against a wall and said , ' You 've been lying to me .
There are more than three in there ' . "
The soldiers then ordered two other residents to take cameras into the house to photograph it and the Hamas fighters .
Next , the army sent in a dog which returned injured and died soon afterwards .
The gunmen were then told : " You have 15 minutes to come out with no clothes on and with your hands up .
If you do n't , we will bring the house down on you . "
After 15 minutes , Mr Abed Rabbo said , a bulldozer moved into the area between the houses and the mosque , destroying large parts of his house before systematically demolishing the one the gunmen were hiding in .
It was now Tuesday afternoon .
Before he was taken away , Mr Abed Rabbo had a clear view of his wrecked house , the pulverised property next door , and the bodies of the three Hamas gunmen lying in the rubble .

It sounds like the kind of thing that precedes " elections " under dictatorships :
Riot police being readied for " civil unrest " during a presidential vote .
But the location is in the United States .
According to an internal memo acquired by the local NBC News affiliate , Toledo , Ohio police officers have been ordered to " have their riot equipment with them Tuesday and Wednesday . "
Police chief Mike Navarre told the network officers will carry equipment similar to the gear they used during 2005 race riots .
" They have been asked to have their helmets and their gas masks available tomorrow and Wednesday , " Navarre said , " That 's the equipment they would not normally carry with them on a normal day . "
Police chief Navarre added that officers would n't be station at individual polling places -- but the memo says otherwise .
According to NBC , it reads , " On Tuesday , units shall be directed to patrol the polling locations " .

We all have a problem keeping up with friends and family that have moved away .
The problem is simple : we , as humans , can only have so many relationships as priorities in our lives , and we naturally move the people we can see and interact with to the top of our lists .
To put it more strongly , people who have moved away become concepts , or abstracted representations of real people .
When we think about them we remember what they used to be like , and we consider re-pinging them to see if they ’re still “ alive ” .
This represents an invisible obstacle , one that sadly keeps many from contacting each other for years or decades .
It literally becomes a “ big deal ” to track down and reach out to someone who ’s lost their tangible status in your mind .
Twitter works because it proves to our subconscious , even if only temporarily , that your extremely close friend that moved away four years ago is in fact still real and tangible .
It removes the contact barrier and makes them approachable .
Of course , this is what all social applications strive for .
The difference is that most social apps struggle with two things : they require users to be at a computer or to use a mobile email client .
They have barriers to contact , in other words .
Twitter , on the other hand , by having the deepest personal penetration ( mobile phone ) combined with the most ease of use ( text message ) , has an effort rating that falls below most people ’s natural resistance to participate , and its positive reward ratio is much higher because people are far more likely to respond to a text message than almost anything else .
That ’s why Twitter works : it has a low enough friction to overcome the resistance to use it , and has far more chance of achieving interactive success because it penetrates all the way to the recipient ’s mobile phone via text message .
Once these two things are achieved you ’ve done what all social technology is meant to do : it strengthens the connections between people . ::
Get out of your bubble and out of your feelings .
Being anti-racist is not for punks .
Be comfortable with being uncomfortable .
We ’ve figured out how to live in this world with everything against us .

Abuse of prescription drugs continues to be a major problem among teenagers although fewer of them are smoking cigarettes , according to the 2008 Monitoring the Future survey released today .
The survey , which has been conducted for 33 years , found that nearly 10 % of high school seniors reported nonmedical use of Vicodin and 4.7 % reported abusing OxyContin .
Both are strong opioid pain pills .
Seven of the top 10 drugs abused by high school seniors were prescription or over - the - counter medications .
The high rates of abuse of prescription drugs is a reminder to parents to keep medications out of the reach of minors .
" While the long - term general decline ( in drug abuse ) is encouraging , especially for cigarettes and alcohol , some of the other findings this year amplify our concerns for potential problems in the future -- especially the nonmedical use of prescription drugs , " said Dr. Nora D. Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funds the study .
Monitoring the Future is conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan .
The survey also found that marijuana use has leveled off after a decade - long decline .
About 11 % of eighth - graders , 24 % of 10th - graders and 32 % of 12th - graders reported using marijuana in the last year .
Cigarette smoking , however , is at its lowest point since the survey began .
Still , more than 1 in 10 high school seniors say they smoke daily and 5.4 % smoke more than a half a pack a day .
Alcohol use continues to decline in all grades .
This year 's survey showed a significant drop among 10th - graders for all categories of alcohol use , such as lifetime use , use in the last month and binge drinking .
The nationwide survey , which can be found on the Monitoring the Future website , included more than 46,000 students from public and private high schools .

The plants worked their terrible will
finding jerks who would feed them until
the plants proceeded to grow and grow
and began what they came here to do
which was essentially to
eat Cleveland
and Des Moines
and Peoria
and New York
and where you live .
a rare alternate ending to a 1986 musical about a monstrous , blood - sucking plant
The spectacular 24 - minute sequence shows an army of giant plants rampaging past city skyscrapers , overturning cars , swallowing railroads , and demolishing New York City , Godzilla - style .
The U.S. army discovers the plants are bulletproof , and as helicopters flee , the plants swarm over the statue of Liberty .
It cost $ 5 million , took 11 months to produce , and has never been released .
Well , almost never .
Ten years ago , " Little Shop of Horrors " was available on a DVD including the toothier alternate ending — for exactly five days .
But Warner Brothers failed to secure the proper copyrights for the alternate ending — and the DVD was recalled .
For the next decade , producer David Geffen and Warner Brothers wrangled and promised to restore the original ending , until Warner Brothers finally discovered in 2007 that it had already been burned in a studio fire .
But while Hollywood argued , the coveted footage quietly slipped onto YouTube .
Fans of the 1986 musical version will recognize the ending 's opening scene , which starts with the same shocks as the original off - Broadway theatrical production in 1982 .
( Blonde flower shop worker Audrey tries to water the enormous plant — which decides that it'd rather eat Audrey . )
But the film makes explicit what was only implied in the stage musical 's darker final number .
Standing in front of an American flag , the three chorus singers ( dressed in ominous robes ) explain that " subsequent to the events you have just witnessed ...
" Ironically , the additional footage contained a prophetic scene with an agent haggling over the rights to the plant .
He shouts " We do n't have to deal with you .
A god - damn vegetable is public domain !
You ask our lawyers !
" There 's something cathartic about the forbidden mayhem — and ironically , the raw cut returns the movie to its black - and - white roots .
The legendary B - movie producer Roger Corman filmed the movie 's original version in just two days — using sets that he'd borrowed from another film .
But his movie , released in 1960 , marks a very real milestone in Hollywood history .
" There was a big rush to finish before New Year 's Eve , " recalled Jackie Joseph .
As the film 's lead , she was interviewed for a 1988 book about the film , and remembered that " starting in 1960 you 'd have to pay residuals . "
In fact , the site DVD Talk argues that when budget - conscious Corman finished his movie , something died in Hollywood forever .
When the clock struck midnight on New Year 's Eve , 1960 , " drive - in films were stopped cold by the advent of residuals ...
Anyone who has studied Corman knows that this must have struck him like the bubonic plague .
" But then again , the movie 's weird idea had only sprang to life after " Roger and I went bar - hopping again on the Strip , " according to Charles Griffith , the film 's scriptwriter .
( In Roger Corman 's autobiography , Griffith remembers that while the two men were brainstorming , " I got drunk and ended up in a fight at Chez Paulette . " )
Somehow that inspired the idea of a cannibalistic restaurant chef — which became a man-eating plant for Little Shop of Horrors .
23 - year - old Jack Nicholson appears briefly in the film as a dentist 's masochistic patient , but it would 've languished in obscurity if it had n't been for two 11 - year - old boys .
They saw the film when it was released , and 20 years later , Martin Robinson and Howard Ashman turned it into a wildly successful off - Broadway musical .
The scriptwriter 's other credits had included Attack of the Crab Monsters Death Race 2000 , and part of Barbarella : Queen of the Galaxy , so I want to believe he'd have some affection for the horror movie fans who finally uploaded the " lost ending " for the movie 's musical version .
And the movie seems to have haunted other lives as well .
Mel Welles — the character actor who played Mr. Mushnick in the 1960 original — launched a web site 38 years later to share his memories about his work in Hollywood .
At MelWelles.com , he held court for seven years , until he died in 2005 at age 81 .
( At the time of his death , he was reportedly working on a screenplay called " House of a Hundred Horrors . " )
The strange magic continued through another generation , since the musical movie — released 26 years after the original — intersected still more nascent careers .
The movie was directed by Yoda puppet - master Frank Oz , and featured Steve Martin as a sadistic dentist .
John Candy did a memorable cameo , and the film also featured Jim Belushi and Bill Murray .
And the voice of the blood - sucking plant came from Levi Stubbs , the baritone singer from the Four Tops who died just two weeks ago at the age of 72 .
Maybe it's fitting that the story lives on for another generation — and on Halloween night , Stubbs 's voice haunts the web one last time .
An unnamed source within NASA intimately familiar with the mothballed Deep Space Climate Observatory ( DSCOVR ) mission spoke to Desmog Blog on the condition of anonymity .
The story is incredible .
The big question has always been : who would want to kill a $ 100 million fully completed climate satellite that has sat in a box since the 2000 presidential election - even though dozens of leading scientists have demanded it be launched ?
“ Apparently Cheney was the hatchet man ” , said the source .
“ Bush tried the keep his hands clean so he did n’t have direct involvement .
It almost reminds me of the way Nixon used to operate … He assigned Cheney to be the hatchet man job on DSCOVR …
Bush ’s fingerprints were n’t on it but Cheney ’s were …
That ’s what we heard through the grapevine . ”
Our source did not want their identity revealed due to the pervasive culture of fear that permeates NASA under the Bush Administration : “ People are somewhat intimidated – but it will all unravel .
People will talk .
It will come out .
These things always do . ”
So why would the Bush Administration want DSCOVR dead ?
Our source offered these thoughts :
“ The reputation in early days was that Al Gore thought of it , so when Bush was elected the mission basically just disappeared .
It never got launched .
And that had never happened at NASA before … That ’s what so weird about it .
The people at NASA Headquarters , the ones who wo n’t return your phone calls and wo n’t talk about it - their position is that this is just a normal course of events .
It ’s really strange .
They are obviously covering something up . ”
Beyond Gore , there was also the issue that DSCOVR would further our understanding of climate change - something the Bush Administration was never keen on .
According to our source :
“ The Whitehouse … felt threatened by [ DSCOVR ] .
They did n’t want to hear anything about the Earth changing because that meant climate change , and that means CO2 and then they would have to regulate CO2 and they just wanted to avoid anything to do with that …
Cheney was the chief hatch man on climate change in general .
That ’s the rumor that went around . ”
Of course there is little chance of finding hard evidence of Whitehouse interference in this mission .
I have filed numerous freedom of information requests with NASA , NOAA and the Whitehouse but came up with almost nothing .
The Whitehouse is not even subject to FOIA anymore .
Virtually all internal documents related to the DSCOVR mission have been kept secret .
Our source is not surprised : “ That ’s going to be really hard to nail because Cheney is deleting all his emails . ”
It turns out that the mission was always a weird one .
The NASA leadership insisted from the start that this spacecraft fly into orbit aboard the space shuttle .
Those close to the mission were incredulous .
“ There was the stupidity of putting it one the shuttle .
That was just absolutely silly .
You do n’t launch satellites to that high of an orbit on the shuttle .
The normal NASA tradition is to launch a satellite like that on a rocket . ”
Because DSCOVR had to go far beyond the low Earth orbit accessible by the shuttle , a large rocket motor would need to fly aboard the shuttle to boost DSCOVR to L1 one million miles distant .
Not a good idea .
“ A big rocket motor with its fuel tanks filled is basically a bomb .
Using the shuttle as a carrier for what is basically a bomb is not smart .
It was absolutely stupid from the get - go . ”
So why was the mission forced onto the shuttle ?
“ There ’s no good reason .
NASA will give you reasons but there ’s actually no good reason .
It was a very strange decision .
It was a decision that the science team tried to fight but were never able to even get to first base on , ” said our source .
They were told by NASA brass ‘ we ’re going to launch it on the shuttle and that ’s that and do n’t talk to us about it and stop complaining ’ ” .
Our source also provides a chilling insider account of how the spacecraft was on track to be launched by another agency as late as last year , but was abruptly cancelled .
“ It seemed that everything was on track to give the satellite to NOAA and they would be refurbish and launch it and then - boom .
It just disappeared off the radar screen and no one would talk about it .
It was very weird .
It gave me the creeps actually .
I ’ve never seen that happen at NASA before , where things would disappear and no one would talk about them .
It was like the way people would disappear in a dictatorship regime . ”
Our source made no bones about the importance of this novel experiment to provide continuous monitoring of the daytime and nighttime profiles of our planet .
While DSCOVR ’s destination L1 is one million miles towards the sun , there is another gravitational parking spot called L2 away from the Sun .
If a similar spacecraft were also placed there , scientists would have simultaneous views of the both the daytime and nighttime profiles of our warming planet .
“ Those two points would have been revolutionary for doing remote sensing of the Earth .
All our satellites are in Sun- synchronous orbit meaning that they pass over the same time every day .
So you have no way of getting information about the so - called diurnal cycle .
DCSOVR and another satellite at L2 would mean the whole Earth would be covered . ”
This combination of DSCOVR at L1 and similar spacecraft at L2 would also allow scientists to resolve glaring gaps in our understanding of the Earth ’s energy budget and our understanding of global warming .
“ Low Earth orbit satellites are not able to close the Earth ’s outgoing radiation budget .
It ’s pretty far off - it ’s quite an embarrassment …
They ca n’t close the Earth ’s radiation budget better than six watts per square meter .
We have every reason to believe to that the Earth is out of balance by only one watt for square meter , which accounts the global warming .
It was so embarrassing they kept it quiet for a while ”
DSCOVR would not only solve that important problem but also provide a completely new perspective for NASA to carry out their important mandate of monitoring our changing planet .
“ It would have been significant because it would mean that NASA was finally getting out of low Earth orbit , where they ’re stuck .
NASA does n’t have any high Earth orbit satellites , not geostationary , not L1 , not L2 .
It ’s very weird . “
You would think that resolving the Earth ’s energy budget at this point in history would be a priority for NASA , especially given they have a perfectly good $ 100 million instrument sitting in a box that would help them do that .
But I digress …
NASA leadership have also frequently relied on the so - called Decadal Survey as a rationale for killing DSCOVR .
This study was an effort to prioritize potential NASA missions for the next ten years .
DSCOVR was not prominently featured in this assessment , but our source is not surprised .
“ All the people involved in the Decadal Survey knew what NASA ’s attitude toward DCSOVR was .
They were n’t going to take on a political hot potato , why should they ?
It was n’t that they thought it was a bad idea , it ’s that they were politically sensitive …
So they ignored it .
So for NASA now to use their ignoring it as an argument against it is really hypocritical frankly . ”
For some reason DSCOVR was also included in this assessment even though it was already built at a cost $ 100 million , something our source feels is incredible .
“ It ’s putting DSCOVR in the same hopper as un - built missions .
And that ’s kind of silly …
It did n’t really need to be ranked by the decadal survey .
Suppose every mission that NASA built was then subjected of to a panel of scientists to decide whether to launch it or not ?
That would be kind of silly would n’t it ?
The whole thing is just sheer hypocrisy .
What about the peculiar notion of the Air Force launching DSCOVR without the earth observing instruments as a way to save money ?
Our source it at a loss as to why NASA would ever consider doing that .
“ That ’s just bizarre …
The instruments would have to be refurbished but NASA gave some ridiculously outsized estimate of what it would cost to do that .
It was like ten times too high , in order to kill the idea of having Earth viewing instruments .
There have been a lot of shenanigans around this mission .
It ’s embarrassing for me personally because I used to have huge respect for NASA and I ’ve lost some .
I ’ve seen people do stuff that I would never thought I would see people do . ”
Our contact was cautiously hopeful that things at NASA may change in the future .
“ The Whitehouse created a climate of fear within government and that was intentional .
But the administration is changing …
Once Bush is truly out , things will start to unravel .
Eventually the whole crowd at NASA headquarters will change and then there might be a new a spirit of openness .
Or they might want to just bury the past and move on … ”
And what about DSCOVR ?
“ It ’s sad for NASA that they are stuck trying the trash DSCOVR when it ’s actually a great idea … They hate it so much at this point that they are determined to put it in a box and keep it there forever …
They ’re just trying the figure out how to bury it . ”
We at Desmog Blog will of course continue digging on DSCOVR to make sure that does n’t happen .
The cone of silence around this fascinating story is starting to crumble but the clock is ticking bring out the truth before the spacecraft is destroyed .
If anyone else close to this mission has information to share , Please contact me here in confidence .
It will be our little secret …
Shortly after Google ’s new Webkit - based browser , called Chrome , hit the streets , we took a look at how many people were using it .
Our first look at the early stats found that an impressive 4 - 5 % of users were using Chrome a couple of days after launch .
Perhaps not surprisingly .
given that Chrome was aimed initially at a more technical , early adopter crowd , it was Firefox that took a hit at the start rather than Internet Explorer , even though most pundits agree that Google is taking aim at Microsoft with their browser initiative , not Mozilla .
After the initial euphoria of a new browser product wore off , we noted earlier this month that Chrome usage has stabilized at SitePoint to a little over 3 % , which is still ahead of the worldwide average of about a quarter of a percent to 1 % .
It ’s still way to early to tell what impact Chrome will have on the browser race long term , but three months is a much better sample than a single week , so it ’s not a bad idea to take a look at the numbers again and see what they look like .
This latest round of browser share comparison was kicked off by Stephan Shankland at CNET , who himself has switched to Chrome because of its superior JavaScript speed .
Shankland found that from September to October , visitors to CNET latched onto Chrome in larger than expected numbers .
Event though just 3.6 % of visitors used Chrome in October , that ’s still a huge jump from 1 % the month before .
Firefox also jumped and IE and Safari took a hit ( perhaps that ’s Windows Safari users , since Chrome for Mac does n’t yet officially exist — or perhaps that ’s the work of Firefox ) .
At SitePoint we actually saw an opposite trend .
Between September and November ( this month is n’t over yet , but we think it has enough data to be included in the chart with that caveat in mind ) , Internet Explorer actually saw a mammoth jump in usage on our site , while every other browser dropped significantly month - over - month .
The reason could be that starting in late October we ’ve had an influx of traffic from Digg , StumbleUpon , and Delicious due to a handful of blog posts that have done well on those social media sites .
So traffic over the past 6 weeks has been atypical for SitePoint , and thus could be skewing our numbers .
That , however , still gives us data from which we can draw some conclusions .
If Chrome usage — and indeed Firefox , Safari , and Opera usage — declined when our traffic started coming from more mainstream sources , it indicates that the mainstream is still very much hooked on IE .
Firefox , and Safari on Mac , may have made a dent in IE ’s stranglehold on the browser market , but Chrome has n’t even touched the mainstream .
The latest data from Net Applications affirms that theory .
According to their browser share report , Chrome is used by just 3/4th of a percent of all net users — about the same as Opera .
Firefox hovers around 20 % and Internet Explorer maintains a commanding lead with over 70 % of all use .
The bit of browser share real estate that Chrome has managed to snag in just about 3 months is not insignificant , however , it is a long way from crossing the chasm .
What browsers are your visitors using this month ?
Has Chrome made any sort of impression ?
Let us know in the comments .
New Year 's Tradition Behind the Russia - Ukraine Gas Conflict
Economics and politics drove Gazprom 's decision to shut off gas to its neighbor .
Von Miriam Elder
Police have been advised to use the anti-terrorism powers sparingly Metropolitan Police officers are stopping and searching too many innocent people using powers designed for fighting terrorism , it is claimed .
There were more than 157,290 stop and searches in London under anti-terror laws in the year to September 2008 , leading to 1,200 arrests .
That is nearly triple the 54,693 searches the previous year .
Critics said the force should curb its use of the power , but the Met Police said they were using the tool properly .
Use sparingly Section 44 of the Anti-Terrorism
Act gives police the power to stop and search people in specific areas without the reasonable need to suspect them of being involved in terrorism .
Currently it is being applied across the whole of London but officers have been advised to use the power sparingly .
Amateur photographer Nicholas Ling said he was stopped and searched by officers outside West Ruislip station in November last year .
There 's a lot of anger - it's not just railway enthusiasts , it 's people in the street , it 's tourists being hassled , it 's students who are doing photography and architecture courses
Chris Milner , Railway magazine
He said : " I thought it was totally unnecessary - it was n't as if I was vandalising anything .
" All I was doing was standing here with my camera . "
Chris Milner , deputy editor of Railway magazine , said he had received many similar complaints from readers who have been stopped and searched .
He said : " There 's a lot of anger - it 's not just railway enthusiasts , it 's people in the street , it 's tourists being hassled , it 's students who are doing photography and architecture courses .
" It 's people just walking up and down the street who just want to take a picture of anything . "
In 2004 , a report from the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) said the power to stop and search " trampled on the basic human rights of too many Londoners " .
The feedback , the very limited complaints and the public reaction to the way we go about using this power shows that we 're not misusing it overall or in specific cases
Commander Simon Bray Barrister Sebastian Gardiner , chairman of the Society of Labour Lawyers ' crime group , said little had changed .
" If you look at the occasions when it 's been used , for example the arms fair protests and the Heathrow runway protests , people were stopped and searched under Section 44 when neither could be said to be likely to involve terrorist activity , " he said .
However , the police insisted that the powers were being used appropriately .
" The feedback , the very limited complaints and the public reaction to the way we go about using this power shows that we 're not misusing it overall or in specific cases , " said Commander Simon Bray .
" We recognise the sensitivities but remember it is a really important method of deterring and preventing terrorism . "
