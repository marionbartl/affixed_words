A new study concluded that the most commonly used method for extracting leg veins for grafts in coronary bypass surgery was more dangerous than the traditional method , and resulted in more deaths among patients .
Companies making vein- extraction devices , and some doctors , cast doubt on the study ’s conclusions , saying that it was n’t scientifically rigorous enough .
But the finding is likely to raise concerns in the cardiology field and among patients undergoing cardiac bypass , an operation done about 300,000 ...
IRANIAN President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday sought to put the turmoil over the disputed presidential elections behind him and declared on national television that the contests were clean , fair and marked the start of a new era .
His speech came as the country 's top three reformist leaders sought to rekindle their opposition movement , demanding that ruling clerics end the heavy " security atmosphere " imposed after the elections and free those detained in the unrest , according to an opposition website .
It was Mr Ahmadinejad 's first national speech since the Supreme Leader declared the election results valid despite an outcry from the other candidates and weeks of street protests claiming that the results were fraudulent .
" This is a new beginning for Iran ... we have entered a new era , " the President said , explaining that the 85 per cent turnout and overwhelming win had given his government a new legitimacy .
" It was the most clean and free election in the world , " he said , adding that during the re-count " no fault was discovered .
The whole nation understood this .
" This election has doubled the dignity of the Iranian nation . "
During the half - hour speech , Iranians in many parts of the capital Tehran could be heard shouting from their rooftops , " death to the dictator " and " God is great " - actions that have become a symbol of defiance since the elections .
Opposition Leader Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims to have won the June 12 election , is struggling for a way to channel the widespread discontent since the vote .
The discontent has since been shattered by the harsh crackdown by police , Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia .
Mr Mousavi hinted on Monday that he may move away from the tactic of protests and create a political party to work in what he called " a legal framework " .
Yesterday he met the other top stars of the reform movement - former president Mohammad Khatami and Mahdi Karroubi , another election candidate - in a show of unity .
The three warned Iran 's clerical leadership that if the security crackdown continued , it " will only lead to radicalisation of political activities " , Mr Mousavi 's website reported yesterday .
Meanwhile , hundreds of opposition supporters quietly flocked to mosques or retreated to their homes to begin an unusual form of three - day strike - boycotting workplaces , banks and the bazaar .
In a novel attempt to outflank government restrictions , opposition supporters alerted one another to take advantage of an Islamic tradition rarely practised in Iran called Etekaf .
It calls for a retreat from worldly activities during three days in the month of Rajab in the Islamic calendar .

The dangers arise from the possibility that these rises in commodity prices might continue .
If that were to happen , then the sharp falls in inflation which have occurred in several Western countries and which have looked set to go further , would go into reverse .
That would have two adverse effects .
First , it would threaten to increase bond yields , which are already under upward pressure .
Higher bond yields would themselves tend to weaken the economy .
But in today 's circumstances they would be worrisome because governments , including our own , have to raise enormous sums from the bond markets .
Higher bond yields increase the cost of government funding and thereby tighten the fiscal screw still further .

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Living happily ever after need n’t only be for fairy tales .
Australian researchers have identified what it takes to keep a couple together , and it ’s a lot more than just being in love .

A couple ’s age , previous relationships and even whether they smoke or not are factors that influence whether their marriage is going to last , according to a study by researchers from the Australian National University .
The study , entitled “ What ’s Love Got to Do With It , ” tracked nearly 2,500 couples -- married or living together -- from 2001 to 2007 to identify factors associated with those who remained together compared with those who divorced or separated .
It found that a husband who is nine or more years older than his wife is twice as likely to get divorced , as are husbands who get married before they turn 25 .
Children also influence the longevity of a marriage or relationship , with one - fifth of couples who have kids before marriage -- either from a previous relationship or in the same relationship -- having separated compared to just nine percent of couples without children born before marriage .
Women who want children much more than their partners are also more likely to get a divorce .
A couple ’s parents also have a role to play in their own relationship , with the study showing some 16 percent of men and women whose parents ever separated or divorced experienced marital separation themselves compared to 10 percent for those whose parents did not separate .
Also , partners who are on their second or third marriage are 90 percent more likely to separate than spouses who are both in their first marriage .
Not surprisingly , money also plays a role , with up to 16 percent of respondents who indicated they were poor or where the husband -- not the wife -- was unemployed saying they had separated , compared with only nine percent of couples with healthy finances .
And couples where one partner , and not the other , smokes are also more likely to have a relationship that ends in failure .
Factors found to not significantly affect separation risk included the number and age of children born to a married couple , the wife ’s employment status and the number of years the couple had been employed .
The study was jointly written by Dr Rebecca Kippen and Professor Bruce Chapman from The Australian National University , and Dr Peng Yu from the Department of Families , Housing , Community Services and Indigenous Affairs .
You need to be very , very comfortable in making that jump .
The American Revolution - independence from England - was a just cause .
Why should the colonists here be occupied by and oppressed by England ?
But therefore , did we have to go to the Revolutionary War ?
How many people died in the Revolutionary War ?
Nobody ever knows exactly how many people die in wars , but it 's likely that 25,000 to 50,000 people died in this one .
So let 's take the lower figure - 25,000 people died out of a population of three million .
That would be equivalent today to two and a half million people dying to get England off our backs .
You might consider that worth it , or you might not .
Canada is independent of England , is n't it ?
I think so .
Not a bad society .
Canadians have good health care .
They have a lot of things we do n't have .
They did n't fight a bloody revolutionary war .
Why do we assume that we had to fight a bloody revolutionary war to get rid of England ?
Who actually gained from that victory over England ?
It 's very important to ask about any policy , and especially about war :
Who gained what ?
And it 's very important to notice differences among the various parts of the population .
That 's one thing were not accustomed to in this country because we do n't think in class terms .
We think , " Oh , we all have the same interests . "
For instance , we think that we all had the same interests in independence from England .
We did not have all the same interests .
Do you think the Indians cared about independence from England ?
No , in fact , the Indians were unhappy that we won independence from England , because England had set a line - in the Proclamation of 1763 - that said you could n't go westward into Indian territory .
They did n't do it because they loved the Indians .
They did n't want trouble .
When Britain was defeated in the Revolutionary War , that line was eliminated , and now the way was open for the colonists to move westward across the continent , which they did for the next 100 years , committing massacres and making sure that they destroyed Indian civilization .
So when you look at the American Revolution , there 's a fact that you have to take into consideration .
Indians - no , they did n't benefit .
Did blacks benefit from the American Revolution ?
Slavery was there before .
Slavery was there after .
Not only that , we wrote slavery into the Constitution .
We legitimized it .
What about class divisions ?
Did ordinary white farmers have the same interest in the revolution as a John Hancock or Morris or Madison or Jefferson or the slaveholders or the bondholders ?
Not really .
It was not all the common people getting together to fight against England .
They had a very hard time assembling an army .
They took poor guys and promised them land .
They browbeat people and , oh yes , they inspired people with the Declaration of Independence .
It 's always good , if you want people to go to war , to give them a good document and have good words : life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Of course , when they wrote the Constitution , they were more concerned with property than life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
You should take notice of these little things .

Wings which redirect air to waggle sideways could cut airline fuel bills by 20 % according to research funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) and Airbus .
The new approach , which promises to dramatically reduce mid-flight drag , uses tiny air powered jets which redirect the air , making it flow sideways back and forth over the wing .
The jets work by the Helmholtz resonance principle - when air is forced into a cavity the pressure increases , which forces air out and sucks it back in again , causing an oscillation – the same phenomenon that happen when blowing over a bottle .
Dr Duncan Lockerby , from the University of Warwick , who is leading the project , said : “ This has come as a bit of a surprise to all of us in the aerodynamics community .
It was discovered , essentially , by waggling a piece of wing from side to side in a wind tunnel . ”
“ The truth is we ’re not exactly sure why this technology reduces drag but with the pressure of climate change we can’t afford to wait around to find out .
So we are pushing ahead with prototypes and have a separate three year project to look more carefully at the physics behind it . ”
The Daily Telegraph may have had a team of 25 journalists working on the MPs ' expenses - but within 10 minutes of the launch on Thursday afternoon of the Guardian 's crowdsourcing application to examine them there were 323 people , almost all outside the Guardian , doing the same task .
The application itself was developed at breakneck speed : coding began on Thursday 11 June , and was complete - aside from ongoing bug fixing as people began using it - by 3.30 pm Thursday 18 June .
In the application , at mps-expenses .
theguardian.com , each MP 's expenses and claims are presented as a set of images , and users can determine - and detail - what entries there are on a page , and decide whether the page is unimportant , interesting , " interesting but known " - such as a duck island - or worthy of investigation .
Within half an hour of the launch , more than 2,000 pages had been reviewed .
Future additions to the application may include a " top analysis " ranking for those who have contributed most to sifting the pages - a task which the Telegraph 's team , despite having a three - month lead , is not believed to have been able to achieve .
Simon Willison , the head developer for the application , says he had the idea of creating a " crowdsourced " approach to analysing the claims about six weeks ago .
That gained clearer focus after a number of MPs , including Frank Field and Charles Clarke , put redacted versions of their claims online .
Because the claims were released as PDFs , the contents could be examined , though PDFs are not as easily searched as a simple text file - and the addition of redaction , to cover up identifying data , means that to create a database from the claims would require someone to look at each page .
" The risk was that we did n't know how it would be released , but we assumed it would be like that , " said Willison .
" And it was . "
Parliament made it simultaneously difficult and easy to deal with the data , he said : " Easy , because the website with the expenses [ which went live at 6 am on Thursday morning ] was excellent , so we could suck all the data off it in about 15 minutes . "
But the difficulty was that the PDFs were not in the expected form , leading to a scramble to find appropriate software that would be able to present them as required by the application - which was written in Django and uses Amazon 's EC2 cloud computing service , both a first for a production - quality effort by the Guardian .
The unexpected PDF format and the need to feed the documents into extra processing led to a last - minute scramble as the entire quality assurance team for the Guardian 's systems were allocated to testing the application on Thursday morning and lunchtime to iron out any obvious bugs .
" It 's the first time we 've ever knocked out an application in five days , " said Matthew Wall , head of software architecture at Guardian News and Media .
Even as the app went live , 30 computers were still churning through the PDFs from the parliament website to turn them into a usable form , so that people can analyse them in forthcoming days .
The Guardian is not alone in attempting to " crowdsource " the analysis of the MPs ' expenses released by parliament .

BLUE ASH , Ohio --
One man is dead and two officers are injured after a chase and shooting .
Police said an officer tried to pull over a car on Cornell Road near Sycamore High School for driving without lights just before 12:30 a.m .
The officer told dispatchers that he thought the Monte Carlo might be one stolen from Clermont County last week .
Three fennec foxes were born May 17 at Tokyo's Sunshine International Aquarium .
They recently made their public debut and have become quite popular with the aquarium 's visitors .
Now , we know what you may be thinking : " Oh , they 'll grow into their ears . "
They wo n't , actually !
Fennec foxes -- the world 's smallest fox species -- usually measure from 9 to 16 inches long as adults ( not including their tails ) .
An adult 's ears usually measure about 6 inches long -- more than half the body length of an on - the - small - side fennec .
Fennecs are native to the North African desert , and they 're extremely well - adapted to life in a desert environment .
Those giant ears help to dissipate body heat , keeping the little guys cool .
Their tan coloration helps them to blend in with the desert sand .
Plus , they 're nocturnal , meaning they 're active when the heat is at its least searing .
More photos of the little foxes ( we 're talking animals here , not Bette Davis ) after the jump !

I ’ve recently seen or heard a lot of discussion about how to make Perl and CPAN even better , but I feel strongly that we need a more a formal definition of packages , modules and distributions so that there is common language and understanding for the current semantics .
Only then , do I think we can have meaningful discussions of potential changes .
With that in mind , here is my best understanding of the as - is state of Perl 5 .
A package is a Perl namespace as specified using the package keyword .
Packages may have ( but are not required to have ) a version number .
The version number of a package is the value in the package variable $ VERSION , which is set during runtime .
$ VERSION should not be altered once set .
I will refer to a well - formed package as one which provides a $ VERSION .
A module is a Perl file with a “ . pm ” extension .
A module ’s name is a Perl namespace that maps to a relative file - path to the module by replacing namespace separators ( :: and ‘) with path separators and appending “ .pm ” .
A module contains zero or more _package_s .
Compiling the module should return a true value .
The module must return a true value when loaded via use ( ) or require ( ) .
( ( [ Thank you , Ben ] ) ) __ A module ’s version number is that which is parsed and returned from the file by MM -> parse_version ( ) as provided by ExtUtils : : MakeMaker .
I will refer to a well - formed module as one which contains a well - formed package with the same name as the module name and the same version as the module version .
A distribution is an archive file containing zero or more modules .
A distribution file is uniquely identified by a file - path of the form AUTHOR / NAME - VERSION.
SUFFIX ( i.e. as exists on CPAN ) .
A distribution ’s name and version are parsed from the basename of the archive file .
( ( This requires substantial heuristics .
See CPAN :: DistnameInfo for a relatively canonical approach . ) )
I will refer to a well - formed distribution as one meeting the following criteria : ( a ) it contains a well - formed module , M ; ( b ) replacing the namespace separators in module M’s name with dashes gives the distribution name ; and ( c ) the distribution version is equal to module M’s version .
I plan to use these definitions going forward as I discuss the evolution of CPAN , so I would welcome any feedback on whether these definitions seem consistent with how Perl 5 and CPAN work today and whether the “ well - formed ” designations are clear and appropriate .
Wunderkammer Seeds : A Fantasia
Here 's what tomorrow 's bookcase will look like :
Within each of these objects will be a flash drive containing every possible electronic version of a book , including the page layout of every known edition for the purposes of on - demand printing .
These sculptures will be gateways to both print and electronic versions of literature .
They will be exquisitely crafted objects that remind us of the unquantifiable worth of the contents .
Each sculpture in this bookshelf will represent a different novel or set of novels .
These book sculptures will become the new iteration of the book cover .
To truly own a book , one will own a physical curio that represents all the contents and ancillary materials , conveyed in three discrete dimensions , dimensions that cannot be erased , deleted , or altered .
A talisman , disconnected from the net , that can be buried , stored , collected , hidden , and loved .
Like seeds .*** Knowledge is fragile and we human beings are weak guardians .
We do n't even know what we 've lost when it comes to the burned , misplaced , and forgotten works of our past .
We call the scanty tomes that we 've managed to preserve " classics " and we walk away whistling .
Are things changing ?
Do we now have the power to archive every piece of human writing for later analysis , entertainment , and edification ?
Perhaps .
But eventually there will come a time when a power rises up with the intent to alter , control , or destroy the knowledge to which we are heir , and electronic books that feed from the web could be hunted and purged with a single program designed to annihilate them .
Or even worse , the contents of these books could be changed without anyone noticing .
As books molder and rot in our blood - clotted libraries , the librarians of the future will be charged with instead protecting the discrete , physical digital forms of our heritage .
These tiny mundane objects will serve as repositories for absolute texts which can be used to fix or replace any lost or vandalized work .
" Save " files for literature , seed collections will be able to be broken apart , pocketed , and hidden .
And so , despite the best efforts of the power - hungry , it will remain impossible for our knowledge to be gathered in one place where it can then be destroyed in one cruel and cunning blow .*** And these seeds will be wonderful items to have .
Imagine , each sculpture will contain not only every possible version and every available electronic format for a given novel , but it will also contain an electronic version specific to the seed itself : an application crafted by programmers ( the new publishers ) that displays and showcases texts in a well - designed , beautiful frame that contains audio for the blind , animated illustrations , soundtracks , movie versions , critical reviews , and all manner of useful and related materials .
Someday , perhaps , the seeds will even have a projection device that will allow you to read the text along a wall like a laser pointer or to enjoy a holographic slideshow of the contents .
Oh sure , people will steal parts from each seed .
One person may steal the audio files , another may steal the text , a student may steal a critical essay for their homework assignment .
But publishers ( gardeners ) will still profit , despite all the rampant piracy .
When you buy a seed , you are buying the permanent object that can be GIVEN AS A GIFT .
You are buying the reminder of the story that changed your life .
One of Matthew Arnold 's literal " touchstones .
"
You are buying a permanent object that can be collected and cherished , yet can still be swept into a shoebox when it is time to move and carted from apartment to apartment without breaking your back .
You could print this book ten times in your life from the seed and read it in book form from an on - demand press at your local coffee shop .
You may never print it and always read it from your ebook reader or netbook , uploading each seed to a new device as computers become more and more powerful over the years .
Publishers will dutifully create new versions of books for new formats that will be available for download to these seeds ( for a fee , of course ) .
But if you need to make space on your reader for later , or if you fear that your computer will be stolen , lost , or broken , you will always have the book .
The object .*** The seedshelf of a science fiction and fantasy fan :
The seedshelf of a romantic :
The seedshelf of a scientist : Inside the seedbox of an avant garde poet :
A seedstore :*** Stories are not paper .
Stories are not anything at all .
So if they must be something , they should be the most beautiful thing they can be : a thing of value that exists for its own sake , an essential memento that can be held and cherished .
An object that will acquire value over time with each new edition .
An object that will last .
Cheap books will go inside of cheap sculptures .
Plastic .
Rubber .
Expensive books will be lodged inside precious stones .
Perhaps one day we will be able to fit every book ever written within an object you can hold in your hand .
But writers will still write new stories !
And they will need to sell them !
They will need to keep their stories discrete from the massive blob of the past and ensure that their work cannot be so easily assimilated into the canon .
These writers of the future will have to embed their texts in the future 's beautiful objects and peddle them .
Marbles that contain clockwork universes .
Provocative accessories for android sex slaves .
Inventive creators will play with the seed form as with every other medium .
You may finish your novel and want the seed of it to be the old coffee mug that you drank from every day while writing .
Molds will be cast .
Your reader will plug their computer into the same coffee mug that touched your lips every morning ( your only constant lover ) and read the story that the coffee mug contains .
You may want your whimsical romance to be lodged inside a hat that people can wear .
Or a beautiful ink pen .
Do you want permanence ?
Do you want to shock ?
Do you want to provoke disgust or evoke despair ?
Or do you simply wish to cause people to pick your book up and wonder about the story that lies within ?
Perhaps you want the seed of your book to be lodged inside a good old fashioned paper book .
If people want the electronic edition , they plug into your hearty , classic leather - bound volume and get it from there .
You old curmudgeon .*** Publishers will maintain databases of every electronic version complete with secondary materials in order to publish new seeds in new editions as demands and markets fluctuate .
Popular designs will remain iconic .
The Bible will always be sold as a cross ( or an apple ) .
The text editions of books will be stolen and will circulate for free .
People will be able to read what they want when they want it .
There 's no stopping them .
But the book will still be sold as a seed , because the need " to have " is as strong as the need " to experience . "
Without having , there is no giving .
The seeds will be purchased , traded , collected , gifted , and shared .
They will be loved .
We all need something to love .
And the object that contains a great story should be as beautiful and strong as a great story itself .
Seed artists of the future will ask themselves :
Is an object worthy of the story within it ?
And :
Is the story worthy of the object 's expense ?
As future readers lock up their wunderkammers before dreaming , they will smile in the darkness at the past when a book meant a square block of paper that slowly fell apart in your hands every time you enjoyed it .
We enlightened moderns have the fruits of literature at our everyday disposal , but readers of the future will have something better .
AMERICAN women did n’t shave their armpits en masse until the 1920s , after a perfect storm of sleeveless dresses and a barrage of advertisements by depilatory makers characterized underarm hair as ugly .
Next came the tarnishing of women ’s leg hair .
By the 1930s , beauty writers scolded women with forests under their silk stockings .
Decades later , what began as a fad had solidified into custom .
Girls coming of age no longer needed to be told their leg hair was unsightly .
They got rid of it .
Can the same thing happen with men ?
These days , the hair on men ’s chests , backs , armpits and even “ down there ” has become suspect  if you believe the marketing campaigns .
Several recent online videos created by brands like Gillette recast hair removal below the neck as the domain of average Joes .
Having a chest as smooth as Matthew McConaughey ’s is old hat for competitive swimmers , urbane insiders who became swept up in the metrosexual moment and some gay men who have long embraced hairlessness .
To play Brüno , a gay fashion reporter who favors hot pants , the formerly hirsute Sacha Baron Cohen endured repeated waxathons to get bare nearly everywhere .
But now evidence from market research and academia indicates that more men are removing hair from their chests , armpits and groins .
The phenomenon skews to mostly college - age guys or those in their 30s .
Reasons run the gamut from Because My Girlfriend Likes
It to a desire to flaunt a six - pack or be clean .
The Environmental Protection Agency declared a public health emergency on Wednesday in and near Libby , Mont. , where over the course of decades asbestos contamination in a vermiculite mine has left hundreds of people dead or sickened from lung diseases .
It was the first health emergency ever declared under the Superfund law , the 1980 statute that governs sites contaminated or threatened by hazardous substances .
The Libby site has been designated a Superfund priority since 2002 .
A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said that in anticipation of the declaration , the Department of Health and Human Services had agreed to make $ 6 million available to the Lincoln County Health Clinic , which provides care to residents of the area , to finance treatment of people with asbestos - related conditions .
She said the declaration also authorized the environmental agency to remove vermiculite , whose uses include insulating , from buildings there .
In addition , she said , the agency will begin an effort to inform Americans generally about the risks of insulation made from vermiculite , a natural silicate mineral that forms in flakes .
She said that it was not known how many homes nationally contained asbestos - contaminated vermiculite but that estimates ran into the tens of millions .
CALL it “ Extreme Makeover , ” jailhouse edition .
Janae Brown who , with her family , was featured on ABC ’s “ Extreme Makeover : Home Edition , ” has been arrested and charged with an alleged carjacking .
Brown appeared on the show in 2007 , when ABC built her family a new home on Hollister Avenue in Bridgeport , Conn . — just a few blocks from where the alleged crime took place .
According to cops , Brown , 16 , and two men approached a 38 - year - old Bridgeport man who was driving a Nissan Altima around 3:30 a.m. Thursday .
One of the men ordered the driver out of his car at gunpoint and the two men and Brown got into the car and drove off , according to The Connecticut Post .
After the car stopped a short distance away , Brown and the men got out and the car ’s owner began chasing Brown , who waved down a passing car and claimed that she was the carjacking victim .
Brown has been charged with first - degree robbery by carjacking and third - degree larceny and is being held in lieu of $ 20,000 bond , according to Bridgeport police .
A wide coalition of US trade unions and members of Congress is stepping up ­pressure on President Barack Obama to confront China over alleged illegal currency manipulation that could have cost millions of American jobs .
The push comes ahead of a visit by the US treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , to Beijing next month to discuss trade issues .
Against a background of rising job losses in the US , union leaders and members of Congress are backing a bill that threatens Beijing with punitive duties on its goods unless it changes its currency practices .
The low value of China 's currency , the yuan , has been a point of friction between the US and China for more than a decade .
Some economists , including Geithner , accuse China of deliberately keeping the value of the yuan low to make its export goods cheaper , undercutting US manufacturing and leading to US job losses .
Pressure on Obama is building in the US , partly because of the recession and partly because the president is viewed as more sympathetic to protectionist measures than his predecessor was .
One of the supporters of the new bill , Tim Ryan , a Democratic congressman , told the Guardian : " The bill is trying to bring some honesty into currency valuation .
We are competitors but we want a level playing field .
We need to have legal recourse . "
Bob Baugh , director of the 10 - million strong federation of unions AFL - CIO , who has been organising support of legislation , said : " It is time for China to seriously ­realign its currency . "
He estimated that the Chinese yuan was undervalued by about 40 % , which gave Chinese a huge export advantage , undercutting US products and jobs .
He said the mood in the US was changing and that many members of Congress had been elected in November on a platform of trade reform .
The Bush administration avoided confrontation with Beijing over the currency issue but the Obama administration has adopted a more ambiguous approach .
Obama , on the campaign trail , promised to take a harder line with China 's trade practices and Geithner , in January , accused Beijing of " manipulating " its currency and suggested a more aggressive approach by the US on the issue .
But , in the Treasury 's biannual report published last month , the Obama administration softened the rhetoric and avoided declaring China guilty of currency manipulation .
China denies the charge .
While Obama wants to fulfil his ­campaign promise , at the same time he recognises the need to maintain a good relationship with China , given its increasing economic strength .
The US is also looking to China to work alongside it on a series of thorny international issues , such as the Iran nuclear standoff .
The unions have won the backing of senators and members of the house in their attempt to introducing the bill .
Despite previous attempts over the last six years having failed , Baugh and other union leaders claim that bipartisan support is growing .
The Republican senator Jim Bunning said : " American workers and businesses have been competing with both hands tied behind their backs for too long . "
Debbie Stabenow , the Democratic senator from Michigan , added : " Our laws must provide mechanisms to cite countries for manipulating their currency and also provide remedies so US workers are not put at a competitive disadvantage . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal judge on Wednesday to throw out the corruption conviction of former Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens because prosecutors withheld helpful evidence from his lawyers .

Attorney General Eric Holder said he decided to abandon the case against Stevens , a Republican who narrowly lost his bid for re-election last year amid heavy publicity over the case , after a review showed prosecutors did not turn over to the defense information that might have helped Stevens ’ case .
In October , a federal jury found Stevens guilty of seven counts of lying on a Senate disclosure form to conceal $ 250,000 in gifts and home renovations from an oil executive and other friends .
“ I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial , ” Holder said as department prosecutors filed a motion in federal court to set aside the jury verdict and throw out the charges .
The decision to drop the high - profile case was a major embarrassment for the Justice Department .
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan immediately set an April 7 hearing on the department ’s request .
Stevens , 85 , -- who had been the longest - serving Republican in the U.S. Senate -- said he is grateful the department acknowledged that he did not receive a fair trial .
“ I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed .
That day has finally come .
It is unfortunate that an election was affected by proceedings now recognized as unfair , ” he said in a statement .
Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct had delayed the sentencing of Stevens , who was narrowly defeated in the November election by Mark Begich , a Democrat .
The case was cited as one reason for the loss .
Stevens had faced up to five years in prison on each count , but under federal guidelines was likely to get much less prison time or just probation if he had been sentenced .
CONCEALED EVIDENCE
Stevens ’ defense attorneys had sought to overturn the conviction , citing a whistleblower complaint by an FBI agent who said another agent and prosecutors improperly concealed evidence helpful to Stevens .
U.S. prosecutors are required to fully disclose evidence to defendants .
Earlier this year , Sullivan , the presiding judge in the case , ordered three Justice Department attorneys held in contempt for failing to turn over documents to Stevens ’ legal team .
The department said in court documents filed on Wednesday it failed to turn over to the defense for use at trial notes from an interview in April last year with Bill Allen , the former head of an Alaska oil - services firm and the prosecution ’s star witness .
It said Allen in the interview estimated the value of the renovation work at Stevens ’ home to be far less than what he testified at trial and said he did not remember talking to a mutual friend about a bill for Stevens for the work .
The Justice Department said the interview notes , which contradicted Allen ’s crucial testimony at trial , were discovered and turned over to the defense only last week .
Holder said the department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility , which probes allegations of prosecutorial misconduct , will conduct a thorough review of the case .
Brendan Sullivan and Robert Cary , the main defense lawyers , called for a full investigation .
“ Not only did the government fail to disclose evidence of innocence , but instead intentionally hid that evidence and created false evidence that they provided to the defense . ”
Stevens , who had a reputation for being hot - tempered during his career in Washington , was a ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee known for his ability to bring federal funding to his sparsely populated state .
“ It ’s time for Senator Stevens , his family and Alaskans to move on and put this behind us , ” Begich , his Democratic successor in the Senate , said .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said , “ It was disappointing to lose the seat , no question about it .
Also no question that if this decision had been made last year he ’d still be in the Senate . ”
Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski , also of Alaska , welcomed the Justice Department ’s decision , but said , “ I am deeply disturbed that the government can ruin a man ’s career and then say ‘ never mind . ’ ”
If Stevens had been re-elected , Democrats still would have controlled the 100 - member Senate .
But the number of Republicans would be 42 rather than 41 .

Everyone 's been talking about it : Google Wave .
Google 's super communication tool has been a top trend on Twitter , a focus of media speculation , and was even able to knock Microsoft 's Bing from the top of the news cycle .
But almost all the hype has been based on the demos - almost nobody 's actually got to try out Google Wave .
Well , thanks to a few of our friends , we had the opportunity today to try out the alpha version of this groundbreaking new service .
From creating waves to joining in on discussions , we put the newest Google sensation through the ringer .
Does Google
Wave stand up to the hype ?
Still got questions ?
We 're still testing Google Wave , and we 'll answer questions in the comments !
Interface
Overview :
The interface , at first glance , mirrors email .
It 's intuitive , quick to load , and boxed up into easy - to - divide sections .
As you 've probably seen from demos and screenshots , the left - hand column has not only navigation , but contacts , which is more important in Wave than it is in email .
Each box can be expanded or shrunk just like any browser window or folder , so you can really control the look and feel .
Central to Google
Wave 's interface is search - you create specific searches based on not only keywords , but activity , history , person , and more .
We 're sure that there will be a large library of search commands useful in organizing your waves .
Another bonus : each box can be collapsed to save you room .
You can also make it so that each appears as a small toolbar , saving you even more room .
The good and bad :
It 's not as complicated as some other screenshots have shown .
The huge selling point is that it 's customizable : you can add and remove different elements and gadgets to make it as complex or as simple as you want .
We 're still not sure about what some of the commands do , though .
Overall assessment : Slick and easy to navigate .
Communication
Overview : Communication within Google
Wave is more like an IM conversation than email , but with several twists .
In the example above , you can see the power of threaded conversations .
Users , instead of replying at the bottom of a wave , thread their conversation in - message .
This makes following lines of thought easier .
You can also see edits made by others via highlights with the person 's name to the right .
It 's also easy to add new waves .
You just type in a message and drag friends into the box .
It 's seriously as simple as that .
On the subject of organizing conversations : this is done just like email , via folders like archived , starred , inbox , and trash .
There 's a focus on adding searches and folders to organize different waves , wavelets , and blips .
Another big plus : it 's so easy to add files and images to all of your messages .
The good and bad : Replies are a bit funky .
They sometimes appear at the top instead of the bottom , although Google in its debug thread states they 're going to make it easier and more predictable to do .
Also , it 's still a bit slow loading , but probably will be solved in future iterations .
Overall assessment :
It 's definitely more intuitive than email in terms of having a conversation , but it still has too many bugs to provide a definitive conclusion here .
Extensions
Overview : Gadgets and Robots ( which we explain in our Google Wave Guide ) are the two key ways to extend Google Wave 's functionality .
Adding gadgets is as simple as going to the top menu ( currently called debug ) and picking the gadget you want to add .
Gadgets are added only within a wave .
We personally would like to be able to create a box or two for useful apps like Twitter or the Basecamp project management system .
Yet playing with gadgets within waves is not complex at all - after adding Magnetic poetry , we were immediately able to use the app to move the magnets around , no problems at all .
Robots are easy to add to your waves ... if you know the name of your robot .
There does n't seem to be an easy way to differentiate between people and robots .
There should a search function or a better menu for finding and adding robots to your waves .
The good and bad :
It 's just so easy to add gadgets and robots .
Some of them need debugging , but this is an alpha platform .
Organization for robots is lacking .
Overall assessment : Adding gadgets and robots is easy , but the organization still needs work .
Ca n't wait for more applications , though !
Conclusion
Overview : Our initial impression of Google Wave is a very positive one .
Despite being an early build , communication is intuitive and not cluttered at all .
User control is even more robust than we first expected .
You can already customize the look and feel of your Wave , and do n't think it will be long until themes and draggable boxes are in as well .
We also want to note that it works by far the best within the Chrome browser , which makes sense .
It really seems to focus on contacts - on people - which we feel is the direction communication is taking .
Email applications currently focus less on people and more on the content of the message .
We think tools like Facebook and Twitter better balance the need to know the person behind a message and the message itself .
Google Wave moves in that direction .
Finally , we would like to reiterate this point : it 's not as complicated as it seems at first look .
It 's only slightly more complicated than your standard email client .
The good and bad :
While still littered with bugs , Google Wave runs smoothly .
The navigation is great , organization ranges between decent to underdeveloped , and the communication style feels more intuitive than email .
Overall assessment :
It 's already got certain aspects , like navigation , absolutely right .
With some great 3rd party apps and greater customization , Google Wave could actually match its hype .
We 're still testing Google 's new application .
If you 've got a question you want us to answer , leave a comment and we might just update this post with the answer .

" New Hampshire legislators , " according to AP , " have approved a measure that would make the state the sixth to allow gay marriage . "
And Gov. John Lynch will , most likely , sign the legislation sometime this afternoon .
The Senate passed the civil rights triumph on Wednesday , with the House approving it later in the day .
( The House vote , by the way , was 198 - 176 . )
New Hampshire joins Massachusetts , Connecticut , Maine , Vermont , and Iowa as the only U.S. state that legally recognize and allow gay marriage .
Kudos to you , NH .
( An aside : Maine ?
Vermont ?
Connectichusetts ?
Technically , these are n't even real states , California State Supreme Court .
So , you know , something to think about . )
I love Mars pictures taken using the phenomenal HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , and I love 3D images , so I -- and therefore you -- get a twofer today : a totally cool 3D view of a mesa on Mars , looking straight down on it from orbit !
[ Click to embiggen . ]
Obviously , you need red / blue glasses to make this work .
If you do n't have any , I suggest you find some ( lots of places sell them online ) , and then search this blog for the word " anaglyph " , which will make you very happy .
How cool is this ?
You can see that the top of the mesa is substantially above the rest of the surface , and the shallow depressions in the top are obvious ... and , of course , provide us with a whimsical example of pareidolia .
The sand dunes rippling across even look a little bit like eyelashes .
Man , I love stuff like this .
You can find details about the picture on the HiRISE site as well as wider field of view pictures that put it into context .
HiRISE has an incredible gallery of 3D anaglyphs that 'll keep you occupied for quite some time , too .
I ’ve been wanting to get something off my chest for a while , so let ’s finally do it .
It ’s about Europe .
No , it ’s not about the Netherlands and how an extremist party got the second most votes here a few of days ago , nor is it a rant about the disgustingly stupid tv debate that night on Dutch public tv , which I thankfully have n’t seen .
Because no matter how frustrating and annoying it is , in the long run it matters little and I predict Mr Wilders will bite the dust sooner or later anyway .
It also is not about the BNP receiving two seats in the UK , or how “ the Left ” lost some seats .
I want to address a broader and more general issue about the European Elections , an issue that is also one of the reasons for the negative reaction and apathy from the public towards the elections .
And that is because there ’s something that makes not much sense at all .
How did they ever think that allowing people to only vote for national parties during European elections was a good idea ?
I believe it might hurt the EU actually more than it does good .
Because when you can only vote for national parties it automatically becomes some sort of second - grade national election , some sort of official poll for the upcoming elections , where people primarily vote on domestic issues and often use their vote to protest against the incumbent government .
The media also interpret it as such .
The best result from these elections is that it does start off a debate on Europe .
It does make people think about it and that ’s a good thing .
The problem however is that this debate is within country , which automatically limits the scope of the debate .
The more ‘ extreme ’ ( usually opposition ) parties hijack the debate with simplistic oneliners ( “ Oh no , Turkey ! ” , “ Oh no , Polish immigrants ” , “ Brussels is one big costly and corrupt bureaucracy ” etc ) that play into national sentiments against Brussels , while the more moderate parties that usually support European integration do not really respond to the EU - bashing for strategic reasons .
They usually go for a “ yeah , we are more - or - less for the EU , but not too much ” route and hope for enough of their traditional supporters to show up and vote .
It ’s not surprising that the EU is n’t all that popular to the masses when their elected leaders avoid explaining and promoting it .
What Europe needs debate among Europeans , not a debate between among Dutch people , not a debate between Welsh people and people from London , but a debate between Polish and Brittish people , between Italians and Lithunians etc etc .
How else can the public create an understanding of the common long - term interests we share , how else can those Polish workers that come here to take over jobs ( uhu ) defend themself , how else can you even have a sensible public debate of what role the EU should play as an actor towards USA , China and the Middle East ?
There has been a debate for decades about the lack of a common European identity , about the lack of a ‘ demos ’ that is necessary for a democracy , but how can an European identity progress when the European elections for the people themself is institutionally biased in favor of the nation - state , which impedes the international debate that is so much needed ?
( Or well , there are other ways of promoting European identity of course , but a shared democracy can be one of the biggest instigators in the process of creating an European identity )
Another problem in European politics that results from the lack of international debate is the psychological bias that everyone automatically feels towards their own national leaders when they are in conflict with other European leaders .
When Sarkozy and Balkenende are in disagreement on something , I also am more likely to automatically support Balkenende , despite me considering him to be a horrible Prime - Minister and despite me perhaps agreeing with Sarkozy in this hypothetical issue .
The problem is that national leaders are only accountable to their own population and that there is barely a debate between the people of different nations .
National parties and politicians have their own interests that often not completely coincides with the interests of Europeans .
These national politicians are however the main players with most power in the EU , but they are only indirectly accountable for their actions within the EU and often get away by playing the blame - game ( “ Constantly push EU policies , but when backfires “ Brussels did it , not me .
Oh , and did n’t I say I want less Brussels so vote for me in the next elections ” ” ) .
The obvious solution would be making the European elections truly European by allowing people to vote on European parties .
So why are there no pan-European parties to vote on you may wonder .
Well , there are and there are n’t .
Real European parties that you may vote on in every member state are prohibited .
National authorities are in charge of the elections , so a political party needs to register as a national party to reach the voting lists .
So the only way for a political group to become truly European is to register in several countries as a national party , which all have their own rules and barriers .
Then there are huge thresholds to access representation and the distribution of the seats to the European Parliament that is being done on a national level as well .
There are several pan-European parties that passed these barriers , but even the most well - funded one , Libertas , failed to get a single seat .
I personally voted for Newropeans , but they did not even receive one percent of the votes here in the Netherlands .
The only true European movement that is going to enter the Parliament is the Pirate Party that received a seat and 7.1 percent of the votes in Sweden .
And that ’s a good thing at least .
Still , the European Union needs a real democracy , it ’s too important and has a too big influence on people ’s lifes .
It ’s in desperate need for a reform .
Also , I really want to be able to vote for a German .
No really , just being able to do that should be a right for any European citizen .
Former FEMA director Michael Brown was called to testify before Congress for the botched relief operation in New Orleans .
Many blamed Brown , but was he a victim of the Peter Principle ?

After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans , millions of families were stranded or displaced , food and water was scarce , and public safety became an issue of grave concern .
The city was in a genuine humanitarian crisis , and many were calling for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
But following Hurricane Katrina , FEMA proved to be sluggish and unresponsive .
The agency had trouble coordinating efforts between subordinate agencies , like the Red Cross and state departments , and delivering supplies to families that needed them .

President George W. Bush complimented the head of FEMA , his friend and appointee Michael D. Brown , but to the people in need of help in New Orleans as well as the press , Brown bungled the relief operation .
In fact , the U.S. Congress held an investigation into the series of mishaps that made up FEMA 's operations in New Orleans .
It was later revealed why Brown experienced hardship as the head of FEMA : Brown was the victim of a poor promotion .
Put simply , he had risen to a job with responsibilities that he could n't fulfill .
Before his role as FEMA director , Brown served as the commissioner of judges for the International Arabian Horse Association .
He excelled in that position , and as such , was promoted by President Bush into a role with greater responsibilities : that of FEMA director .
Brown was widely perceived to have failed in this position .
To make matters worse , his incompetence was displayed as publicly as is possible , with the international media focusing their attention on his every misstep .
Brown eventually requested to be removed from his position as FEMA director , with his famous question , " Can I quit now ? " [ source : CNN ] .
Brown was vilified by the media , but it 's difficult not to commiserate with him .
He was good at his previous job , and -- as is dictated by the American Dream -- when offered a position with more prestige , salary and potential for growth , he took it .
The person who gave him the job had faith in his abilities , so why should n't he take the job ?
But Brown proves that a promotion is n't always a good thing .
While the stakes are n't usually as high , promotions like Brown 's happen frequently in business and government bureaucracies .
A person who excels at his position is often rewarded with a higher position , eventually one that exceeds the employee 's field of expertise .
This is called the Peter Principle , an observation put forth in the late 1960s by Dr. Laurence J. Peter , a psychologist and professor of education [ source : Business Open Learning Archive ] .
" In a hierarchically structured administration , people tend to be promoted up to their level of incompetence , " or , as Dr. Peter went on to explain in simpler terms , " The cream rises until it sours . "
The Peter Principle has even found its way into Masters of Business Administration ( MBA ) curriculum .
So what does the principle imply about the structure of the companies that supply our livelihood and the governments that rule us ?
In this article , we 'll learn about the Peter Principle and ways to combat it .

What is " Secret Sharing " ?
In cryptography , a secret sharing scheme is a method for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants , each of which is allocated a share of the secret .
The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together ; individual shares are of no use on their own .
More formally , in a secret sharing scheme there is one dealer and n players .
The dealer gives a secret to the players , but only when specific conditions are fulfilled .
The dealer accomplishes this by giving each player a share in such a way that any group of t ( for threshold ) or more players can together reconstruct the secret but no group of less than t players can .
Such a system is called a ( t ,n ) - threshold scheme .
Citing from the Wikipedia article about Secret Sharing
A popular technique to implement threshold schemes uses polynomial interpolation ( " Lagrange interpolation " ) .
This method was invented by Adi Shamir in 1979 .
You can play around with such a scheme on the demo page .
Note that Shamir 's scheme is provable secure , that means : in a ( t , n ) scheme one can prove that it makes no difference whether an attacker has t- 1 valid shares at his disposal or none at all ; as long as he has less than t shares , there is no better option than guessing to find out the secret .
Where is " Secret Sharing " used ?
Good passwords are hard to memorize .
A clever user could use a secret sharing scheme to generate a set of shares for a given password and store one share in his address book , one in his bank deposit safe , leave one share with a friend , etc .
If one day he forgets his password , he can reconstruct it easily .
Of course , writing passwords directly into the address book would pose a security risk , as it could be stolen by an " enemy " .
If a secret sharing scheme is used , the attacker has to steal many shares from different places .
A typical application of this scenario is the secure implementation of an encrypted backup system .
Assuming that data recoveries are needed rarely , backup data can be public key encrypted -- this can be done automatically and without user interaction -- while the private recovery key is protected via secret sharing .
" A dealer could send t shares , all of which are necessary to recover the original secret , to a single recipient , using t different channels .
An attacker would have to intercept all t shares to recover the secret , a task which may be more difficult than intercepting a single message " ( Wikipedia ) .
shares , all of which are necessary to recover the original secret , to a single recipient , using different channels .
An attacker would have to intercept all shares to recover the secret , a task which may be more difficult than intercepting a single message " ( Wikipedia ) .
The director of a bank could generate shares for the bank 's vault unlocking code and hand them out to his employees .
Even if the director is not available , the vault can be opened , but only , when a certain number of employees do it together .
Here secret sharing schemes allow the employment of not fully trusted people .
What is " ssss " ?
Where can I download " ssss " ?
Some popular examples are :
ssss is an implementation of Shamir 's secret sharing scheme for UNIX / linux machines .
It is free software , the code is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 .
ssss does both : the generation of shares for a known secret and the reconstruction of a secret using user provided shares .
The software was written in 2006 by B. Poettering , it links against the GNU libgmp multiprecision library ( version 4.1.4 works well ) and requires the / dev/random entropy source .
ssss-0.5.tar.gz ( SHA1 : 3f8f5046c2c5c3a2cf1a93f0a9446681852b190e )
ssss-0.4.tar.gz ( SHA1 : 462a4309 fabc02abf6f3470c5223f0aea44e2a05 )

ssss-0.1.tar.gz ( SHA1 : 66f8 fca5793034fc42032f70de7f9195e4bb4bcd )
Some people reported compilation probems with ssss - 0.5 .
This will be fixed in the upcoming release .
If the code is n't processed correctly on your machine , replace line 351 of ssss.c by
int restore_secret ( int n , void * A , mpz_t b[ ] )
A manpage is available as groff and html version .
Read the HISTORY file for the changes between the versions .
There exists a debian package for ssss .
New versions are announced via the freshmeat page .
Someone contributed a Windows port of ( an outdated version of ) ssss ( but with a lightly too sloppy random number generation , in my opinion ) .
How is ssss used ?
Is there an online demonstration ?
The generation of shares given a known secret is shown first .
A ( 3,5 ) - threshold scheme is used , that is : 5 shares are generated , the secret can be reconstructed by any subset of size 3 .
% ssss-split -t 3 -n 5 Generating shares using a ( 3,5 ) scheme with dynamic security level .
Enter the secret , at most 128 ASCII characters : my secret root password Using a 184 bit security level .

% ssss-combine -t 3 Enter 3 shares separated by newlines : Share [ 1/3 ] : 3- fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309 Share [ 2/3 ] : 5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0 Share [ 3/3 ] : 2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665
Resulting secret : my secret root password
These shares can be combined to recreate the secret :
You can try it out on the demo page
If larger secrets are to be shared a hybrid technique has to be applied : encrypt the secret with a block cipher ( using openssl , gpg , etc ) and apply secret sharing to just the key .
See the man page for more information about this topic .

Edalat Square is an opera based on the true story of two gays teens who were hung in Iran in 2005 for homosexuality .
The Opera Vista Festival at UH is featuring the piece this year , and organizers say they expected some controversy .
It 's arrived , in the form of a death threat .
Amy Hopper , founding director of the Nova Arts Project ( also involved in producing the festival ) , says she received a note in her mailbox saying this : " You are pigs to mix Islam with gays .
You must stop !
We will not let you do it . "
" I was alarmed enough when I received it at my home ( I have a young daughter ) to immediately call HPD , " Hopper tells Hair Balls .
The Project has also put out a prepared statement where Hopper says " We received this letter that was all about ignorance and hate .
It makes it even more important to tell the story . "
Hopper tells Hair Balls she does n't " think anyone 's life is in danger , " but would n't be surprised if more theats came .
" We have n't had any other threats , but our next email blast goes out this weekend , and we think the first letter was sent because of the first email blast , " she says .
The group has been performing some outreach with community organizations who might be offended by the piece , she says .
Edalat Square will open the Festival May 21 .

Eibhlin
My friend ordered her wedding invitations from you and I was very impressed with the quality .
She had nothing but praise for the company and how friendly and efficient the service was .
Pamela .
Right off , it 's the Fourth of July .
There 's a holiday loaded with traditional activities in direct conflict with any major protests , so there 's probably greater barriers to either getting the right to march / protest / whatever because of alternative events and a significant number of previous protesters are well , busy .
Also , public reaction outside of those who actually went to the tea parties was rather ... negative mixed with a good helping of disinterest .
That 's certainly not helping bring the protesters out in droves .
It 's poor timing and poor public relations biting them in the *** , more or less .

As if his face were n’t scary enough , check out those giant button nipples .
Carlos is just one of many many dolls we never want to sleep with on etsy .
Intestines Necklace
We can only imagine that the intestines necklace was created to confuse and disgust … because why exactly would anyone want a detailed model of intestines around their neck unless they were some kind of sociopath right ?
Oh well , at least it comes in bright colors !
That makes it cute and fun !
Jackalope Feltidermy
If you do n’t get the desire to kill and mount animals to your wall , you might not get the desire to stitch them out of felt and do the same either .
The Jackalope Feltidermy hand is made from turquoise and white felt and is mounted to a wood plaque and hangs proudly in your game room … which is used to play checkers and stuff , not store hunting trophies .
Ouija Board Lunch Box
If you thought it was creepy to keep a Ouija board in your attic , then you ’re really not going to be crazy about carrying one around with you at all times .
The Ouija Board Lunch
Box in theory could be used as a Ouija board , except instead of using it on a stormy night at the campground , you can use it on a sunny afternoon in the cafeteria .

Bacon and Egg Jellyfish
Etsy artists love to crochet monsters and food , so the next logical progression would be food monsters .
The Bacon and Egg Jellyfish looks as gross as it does appetizing .
On one hand we love anything involving bacon and on the other hand we loath the bitter sting of jellyfish .
We do wonder however if the tentacles of a Bacon and Egg Jellyfish would be crunchy and delicious or deadly .

One creative etsy artist repurposed her legs by attaching them to a beautiful vintage mahogany leaf tray .
Her legs still bend and move as well as they ever did when she was intact .

Many readers have expressed interest in creating their own organic garden in their own backyard .
As a result , I wanted to share a few tips for starting a backyard garden that is organic , sustainable , and earth - friendly .
There are numerous benefits to planting your own organic garden at home .
It allows you to eat the freshest fruits , herbs , and vegetables .
At the same time , you act to help reduce the amount of pesticides and toxins in the environment .
As organic produce can be costly in the supermarket , growing your own delicious organic produce at home can also save money .
Best Tips for Starting Your Organic Garden
1. Plan
Plan your garden before planting your crops , it 'll help you reap the best harvest possible .
Make a decision on what fruits , herbs , and vegetables grow best in your area and find local sources that sell organic seeds .
Decide how much space you can use for your garden and what the budget will be .
For smaller yards , a container garden works well .
You can also make a small herb garden with pots and boxes .
By planning you can coordinate what plants grow in the spring , fall , winter , and summer to create a year - long harvest .
2. Less is More
It may seem like a good idea to plant every edible plant that you love to eat ... but it may be better to start with a small , manageable garden in the beginning .
If you plant too many of one plant , you may find yourself giving away tomato sauce to all of your neighbors this summer .
Start small and expand each season .
Experiment with various plants and find what grows best .
City dwellers can easily create a small rooftop or balcony garden consisting of pots and raised beds .
You can also grow indoors or in a greenhouse during the winter months .
For indoor growing , I use the aero garden which works pretty well .
3. Choose Productive Plants
Choose plants that grow well in your climate and geography .
Think locally .
Nothing can be more frustrating than trying to plant avocados in Maine .
Also , some plants may grow well but have different economics .
Corn , for example , is cheap , but is labor - intensive .
Berries , on the other hand , are quite expensive in grocery stores , yet are labor free to grow .
They require little money or time to cultivate !
4. Share and Barter
If you buy a large packet of seeds and have extras , share with your friends and neighbors .
You can also do the same with gardening equipment .
By planning and sharing , you can reduce the costs of buying heavy equipment on your own , a process that helps keep overall costs down .
5. Go Organic With Your Supplies
Organic seeds can be bought locally or by mail order .
Do not use chemical pesticides , herbicides , or any other synthetic chemicals .
There are many natural products for treating weeds , diseases , pests , and soil issues .
These natural products are much safer and better for the environment .
Be sure your planting area will not be contaminated with lawn fertilizer or other chemicals .
Try to find organic soil and compost or make your own compost by recycling your food waste .
6. Complement Your Plants
Research traditional methods of natural gardening to grow plants that complement one another such as permaculture .
Beans and squash grow well together , as do potatoes and corn .
Complementary growing helps soil nutrients and overall plant success .
7. Have Fun !
Gardening can be an incredibly grounding family affair .
Remember , no garden is perfect .
Choose some of your favorite plants and enjoy watching their process of growth .

Advertisements embedded in the text of your favorite book ?
It 's enough to make a purist squirm .
But as Fast Company and others have noted , Amazon appears to be weighing the idea .
The evidence comes in a pair of applications recently filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office , including one for " providing fixed computer - displayable content in response to a consumer request for content . "
( Translation from the geek : Amazon wants to patent a way to embed content – or , in this case , adverts – onto a website or mobile device such as a Kindle DX . )
The applications , titled " On-Demand Generating E- Book Content with Advertising , " and " Incorporating Advertising in On - Demand Generated Content , " both list Hanning Zhou , the director of Amazon 's Print - on - Demand Group , as an inventor .
In May of this year , Cinthia Portugal , a spokeswoman for Amazon , told Bloomberg News that the Kindle DX would not initially carry ads .
But the patent applications show that the company seems to be edging closer to some sort of in - book advertising program .
Here , for example , is a passage picked out from the files by the folks over at Slashdot : " For instance , if a restaurant is described on page 12 , [ then the advertising page ] , either on page 11 or page 13 , may include advertisements about restaurants , wine , food , etc. , which are related to restaurants and dining . "
Clutter or convenience ?
The news has agitated many bibliophiles , who worry that their reading experience could become quickly contaminated by a flood of advertising copy .
Consider this scenario , for instance :
You 're reading " A Moveable Feast , " by Ernest Hemingway , which takes place in Paris .
When you get to a page describing an interaction between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway in a crowded Paris café , an ad pops up : " Would you like to see a café near you ? "
Still , there are plenty of bloggers urging calm .
On the website of Revolution magazine , Elizabeth Clifford - Marsh notes that , " According to the patent , ads will be served on an opt - in basis , but it is unclear whether Amazon interprets opt- in as a specific request or the simple act of downloading content . "
Others have pointed out that it 's unlikely Amazon would insert advertisements in their ebooks .
After all , a consumer has already paid for that content .
Why would he or she want to deal with additional in - book clutter ?
Over at CrunchGear , Devin Coldewey writes that in - book advertising could actually make things better for the reader .
It might lower the costs , for instance , of newspapers , magazine , and books :
An abundance of free or reduced - price content would widen the appeal of the [ Kindle ] —
I imagine many people are put [ off ] by the idea that they are not getting their money ’s worth .
As offensive as the idea of inserting ads into a book is to me ( and surely to the average reader ) , it ’s almost certainly part of a value proposition which increases the utility of these expensive little buggers .

Simulating Knitted Cloth at the Yarn Level
Jonathan Kaldor , Doug L. James , and Steve Marschner .
In Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2008 .
Held in Los Angeles , California , August 2008 .
Abstract
Knitted fabric is widely used in clothing because of its unique and stretchy behavior , which is fundamentally different from the behavior of woven cloth .
The properties of knits come from the nonlinear , three - dimensional kinematics of long , inter- looping yarns , and despite significant advances in cloth animation we still do not know how to simulate knitted fabric faithfully .
Existing cloth simulators mainly adopt elastic - sheet mechanical models inspired by woven materials , focusing less on the model itself than on important simulation challenges such as efficiency , stability , and robustness .
We define a new computational model for knits in terms of the motion of yarns , rather than the motion of a sheet .
Each yarn is modeled as an inextensible , yet otherwise flexible , B - spline tube .
To simulate complex knitted garments , we propose an implicit - explicit integrator , with yarn inextensibility constraints imposed using efficient projections .
Friction among yarns is approximated using rigid - body velocity filters , and key yarn - yarn interactions are mediated by stiff penalty forces .
Our results show that this simple model predicts the key mechanical properties of different knits , as demonstrated by qualitative comparisons to observed deformations of actual samples in the laboratory , and that the simulator can scale up to substantial animations with complex dynamic motion .

Unfortunately , this is n’t the start of a joke .
As many of you know President Obama has recently invited Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Officer Jim Crowley to the White House for a beer to resolve differences stemming from Professor Gates recent arrest .
This Punk has no intention of supplying any additional social commentary , but may have found the perfect beer for the occasion .
Let ’s start with something all of these men have in common , that ’s Boston ( or more accurately Cambridge ) .
President Obama is a graduate of Harvard Law , Gates is a Professor at Harvard , and Crowley is a Cambridge Police Officer .
Now we all know Boston has its fair share of great beers .
The beer which immediately comes to mind , and most people ’s obvious choice , would be Sam Adams , but despite my love for Sam this beer is n’t really brewed in Boston anymore .
The showpiece Boston brewery is only used as a research and development facility , with most of their brewing taking place in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
So we move on , the next choice would likely be Harpoon , another solid Boston brewery , but somehow this just does n’t seem to fit the bill .
This brings us to my nomination …
The Cambridge Brewing Company produces a beer not only aptly named for the occasion , but holds a complexity of flavors that merge together to make for a wonderful outcome .
This beer is Benevolence …
Benevolence : ( noun ) a desire to do good to others ; goodwill ; charitableness .
Is this not precisely the President ’s intention for the meeting ?
So there we have it .
A beer from Cambridge , complex in its flavor , with a fantastic finish .
For me a clear winner for the matters at hand .
HONG KONG —
In the seven years since China entered the World Trade Organization in November 2001 , a rising tide of exports , combined with a torrent of investment , has lifted the country ’s economy ever higher , while consumer spending has lagged .
But now , the Chinese economy relies increasingly on growth at home , as data released Thursday made clear .
A decline in exports has become a serious drag on economic growth , while government spending has led domestic investments higher at a remarkable pace and consumer spending appears to have been fairly strong as well .
Some economists worry that China is actually becoming too reliant on investment spending and that the government ’s economic stimulus program may be making this worse .
“ For China ’s nascent economic recovery to be sustainable beyond the short term , policy makers must take steps to ensure that consumption remains on a firm growth trajectory and that the investment boom does not exacerbate the economy ’s structural imbalances , ” the chairwoman of China equities at J.P. Morgan , Jing Ulrich , said in a research note .
WASHINGTON
How quaint .
The Republicans are concerned about checks and balances .
The specter of Specter helping the president have his way with Congress has actually made conservatives remember why they respected the Constitution in the first place .
Senator Mitch McConnell , the leader of the shrinking Republican minority , fretted that there was a “ threat to the country ” and wondered if people would want the majority to rule “ without a check or a balance . ”
Senator John
Thune worried that Democrats would run “ roughshod ” and argued that Americans wanted checks and balances .
Senator Judd Gregg mourned that “ there ’s no checks and balances on this massive expansion on the size of government . ”
Bill Kristol , the editor of The Weekly Standard , tried to put the best face on it , noting , “ This will make it easier for G.O.P. candidates in 2010 to ask to be elected to help restore some checks and balances in Washington . ”
This is quite touching , given that the start of the 21st century will be remembered as the harrowing era when an arrogant Republican administration did its best to undermine checks and balances .
( Maybe when your reign begins with Bush v. Gore , a Supreme heist that kissed off checks and balances , you feel no need to follow the founding fathers ’ lead . )
May 's Lowdown
When I lived in Washington , DC , in the 1970s , I got a call from a friend of mine who worked for the Congressional Research Service -- a legislative agency that digs up facts , prepares briefing papers , and otherwise does research on any topic requested by members of Congress .
" She 's a populist ! " -- KARL ROVE , after Sarah Palin 's speech at the Republican National Convention .
( Palin is popular , which makes her to populism what near beer is to beer , only not as close . )
My friend could barely speak , because he was hooting , howling , and guffawing over a research question he 'd just received .
It was from the office of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , the aloof and patrician Texas Democrat who was known on Capitol Hill primarily as a faithful emissary for Wall Street interests .
At the time , Bentsen was contemplating a run for the presidency , and apparently he was searching for a suitable political identity .
" What is a populist ? " read the research query .
" The senator thinks he might be one . "
Uh ... no sir , you are not .
Bentsen was closer to being " The Man in the Moon " than he was to being a populist .
Yet , he was hardly alone in trying to cloak himself as " The People 's Champion " while remaining faithful to the plutocratic powers .
These days , there 's a whole flock of politicos and pundits doing this -- from Sarah Palin to Rush Limbaugh , Newt Gingrich to Glenn Beck .
They are abetted by a media establishment that carelessly ( and lazily ) misapplies the populist label to anyone who claims to be a maverick and tends to bark a lot .
Although the targets they 're usually barking at are poor people , teachers , minorities , unions , liberals , protestors , environmentalists , gays , immigrants , or other demonized groups that generally reside far outside the center of the power structure -- the barkers are indiscriminately tagged as populist voices .
First of all , populism is not a style , nor is it a synonym for " popular outrage . "
It is a historically grounded political doctrine ( and movement ) that supports ordinary folks in their ongoing democratic fight against the moneyed elites .
The very essence of populism is its unrelenting focus on breaking the iron grip that big corporations have on our country -- including on our economy , government , media , and environment .
It is unabashedly a class movement .
Try to squeeze Lord Limbaugh into that philosophical suit of clothes !
He 's just another right - wing , corporate - hugging , silk - tie elitist -- an apologist for plutocracy , not a populist .
Fully embracing the egalitarian ideals and rebellious spirit of the American Revolution , populists have always been out to challenge the orthodoxy of the corporate order and to empower workaday Americans so they can control their own economic and political destinies .
This approach distinguishes the movement from classic liberalism , which seeks to live in harmony with concentrated corporate power by trying to regulate its excesses .
We 're seeing liberalism at work today in Washington 's Wall Street bailout .
Both parties tell us that AIG , Citigroup , Bank of America , and the rest are " too big to fail , " so taxpayers simply " must " rescue the management , stockholders , and bondholders of the financial giants in order to save the system .
Populists , on the other hand , note that it is this very system that has caused the failure - so structural reform is required .
Let 's reorganize the clumsy , inept , ungovernable , and corrupt financial system by ousting those who wrecked it , splitting up its component parts ( banking , investment , and insurance ) , and establishing decentralized , manageable - sized financial institutions operating on the locallycontrolled models of credit unions , co-ops , and community banks .
A movement
Not only is American populism a powerful and vibrant idea , but it also has a phenomenal history that has largely been hidden from our people .
The Powers That Be are not keen to promote the story of a mass movement that did -- and still could -- challenge the corporate structure .
Thus , the rich history of this grassroots force , which first arose in the late 1870s , tends to be ignored entirely or trivialized as a quirky pitchfork rebellion by rubes and racists who had some arcane quibble involving the free coinage of silver .
The true portrait of populism is rarely on public display .
History teachers usually hustle students right past this unique moment in the evolution of our democracy .
You never see a movie or a television presentation about the movement 's innovative thinkers , powerful orators , and dramatic events .
National museums offer no exhibits of its stunning inventions and accomplishments .
And there is no " populist trail of history " winding through the various states in which farmers and workers created the People 's Party ( also known as the Populist Party ) , reshaped the national political debate , forced progressive reforms , delivered a million votes ( and four states ) to the party 's 1892 presidential candidate , and elected 10 populist governors , six U.S. senators , and three dozen House members .
This was a serious , thoughtful , determined effort by hundreds of thousands of common folks to do something uncommon : organize themselves so -- collectively and cooperatively -- they could remake both commerce and government to serve the common good rather than the selfish interests of the barons of industry and finance .
While the big media of that day portrayed the movement as an incoherent bunch of conspiracy - minded bumpkins , the populists were in fact guided by a sophisticated network of big thinkers , organizers , and communicators who had a thorough grasp of exactly how the system worked and why .
Most significantly , they were problem solvers -- their aim was not protest , but to provide real mechanisms that could decentralize and democratize power in our country .
The movement was able to rally a huge following of hard - scrabble farmers and put -upon workers because it did not pussyfoot around .
Its leaders dared to go right at the core problem of an overreaching corporate state controlled by robber barons .
Populist organizers spoke bluntly about the need to restructure the corporate system that was undermining America 's democratic promise .
" Wall Street owns the country , " declared Mary Ellen Lease at an 1890 populist convention in Topeka , Kansas .
A powerhouse orator who took to the stump and wowed crowds at a time women were not even allowed to vote , Lease laid out a message her audiences knew to be true , for they were living what she was so colorfully describing .
" It 's no longer a government of the people , by the people , and for the people , but a government of Wall Street , by Wall Street , and for Wall Street , " she roared .
" Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags ....
The people are at bay , let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us beware . "
These populist voices tapped directly into people 's anger .
But , still , how could common farmers and laborers -- largely impoverished and powerless folks -- possibly take on Wall Street , the railroad cartels , corporate trusts , and lobbyists , as well as the politicians that these powers owned ?
Well , even the smallest dog can lift its leg on the tallest building , and -- after all sorts of starts - and - stops -- populists found five ways to organize the movement and make their mark .
ECONOMIC .
In 1877 , before populism even had a name , it had a mission , which was to do something -- anything - - about the spreading economic plight of farmers all over the country .
They faced not only the usual disasters of weather and bugs , but also the unnatural disasters of rampant gouging by bankers , crop-lien merchants , commodity combines , railroad monopolies , and others .
Government was worse than unresponsive ; it sided with the gougers .
An economic alternative was needed , and it came out of Texas .
Known as the Farmers Alliance , it created a network of cooperative enterprises that could both buy supplies for farmers in bulk and pool their crops to sell in bulk , bypassing the monopolists , getting better prices , and giving farmers a modicum of control over their destinies .
It was an idea that worked .
The first Texas Alliance quickly spawned 2,000 sub-alliances around the state with a total of 100,000 members .
Alliances were soon being formed throughout the South , in all of the Plains states , in the upper Midwest , and all across the West to California , bringing more than a million farmers into a common economy .
This was a vast , multi-sectional structure of radical economic reform , creating a new possibility that its leaders called a " cooperative commonwealth . "
CULTURAL .
The Alliance gave the movement a solid structure , as well as essential credibility , through its delivery of tangible benefits to members .
But it also created something much larger and more important : the means for ordinary people to learn what a democratic culture really is and to implement a vision of an alternative way to live .
These were working - class families of very modest means .
They had little formal education , lived in isolated communities , and were treated as nobodies by the influentials who ran things .
But -- whoa !-- now these outcasts were running something , and they mattered , both individually and as a group .
It was transformative for them .
Lawrence Goodwyn , author of Democratic Promise , the definitive book on the populist phenomenon , sees this cultural awakening as the key triumph of the Alliance : " [ The cooperative experience ] imparted a sense of self worth to individual people and provided them with the instruments of self - education about the world they lived in .
The movement gave them hope - - a shared hope -- that they were not impersonal victims of a gigantic industrial engine ruled by others but that they were , instead , people who could perform specific political acts of self - determination . "
It was not all about business , either .
Parades of farm wagons and colorful floats , day - long picnics , brass bands , song fests ( Mary Ellen Lease was a renowned singer , as well as an orator ) , dances , poetry , and other social / cultural events enlivened and deepened the Alliance community , creating what Goodwyn calls a " mass folk movement . "
In addition , the Alliance ran a massive grassroots education program throughout rural America , providing everything from literature networks to adult - ed classes .
MEDIA .
To stay connected and provide a steady flow of energy , the movement relied on a concerted program of education and communication -- not only to enlighten and invigorate its widely dispersed members , but also to bring in new recruits .
This required the Alliance to create its own media , for the establishment outlets offered only scorn and ridicule for the populist cause .
Books , over a thousand populist magazines , newspapers , and hundreds of popular songs and poems flowed from the movement .
The communication lynchpin , however , was the Alliance Lecture Bureau , a stable of trained , articulate speakers -- 40,000 strong !-- who regularly traversed the country from New York to California , bringing information , insight , and inspiration to all corners of Populist Nation .
Goodwyn notes that this amazing system of reliable messengers was " the most massive organizing drive by any citizen institution of nineteenth century America . "
COALITIONS .
Though it created serious tensions in various Alliance chapters , the movement kept trying to broaden its base by joining hands with other groups that were also confronting corporate power .
Early on , its leaders reached out to the emerging labor movement .
While there were Alliance leaders who thought of farmers as Jeffersonian , small - scale capitalists , many others ( and many more rank - and - file members ) viewed farmers essentially as working stiffs battling the same robber barons that labor was confronting .
In 1885 , the Knights of Labor were on strike against two companies in Texas , and several county alliances in that state voted to boycott the companies .
This stand was a defining moment for the Alliance , for it heralded the co-op movement 's shift into a more radical political phase .
By 1892 , the Alliance 's political arm , the Populist Party , fully embraced the relationship with industrial workers .
Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota electrified the national delegates to the party convention that year with a speech pointing directly to a shared cause with the union movement : " The urban workmen are denied the right of organization for self - protection ; imported pauperized labor beats down their wages ; a hireling standing army , unrecognized by our laws , is established to shoot them down ....
The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes ....
From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two great classes - paupers and millionaires . "
An even tougher match - up for the leadership was with black farmers , who had organized their own Colored Farmers National Alliance with about a million members .
Aside from the obvious barrier that entrenched racism presented to this possible coalition , there was another degree of separation : white Alliance members tended to be farm owners ( albeit heavily - mortgaged owners ) , and black Alliance members were mostly field hands , renters , or sharecroppers .
Yet , there was such a strong feeling of a shared fight that real and successful efforts were made to join together .
In A People 's History of the United States , author Howard Zinn writes , " When the Texas People 's Party was founded in Dallas in the summer of 1891 , it was interracial and radical . "
A white leader at that meeting demanded that each district in the state include a black delegate , pointing out that , " They are in the ditch just like we are . "
Two black Alliance members were then elected to the party 's executive committee .
Alliances in Arkansas , Georgia , and North Carolina also made notable advances in interracial actions , and eminent historian C. Vann Woodward has said flatly that , " Never before or since have the two races in the South come so close together as they did during the Populist struggles . "
The Alliance also included what was , at the time , a remarkable number of women activists .
They made up roughly one - quarter of the membership and held many key posts .
POLITICS .
By the mid-1880s , the Alliance reached a point where it had to abandon its original stance of non-partisanship and start flexing its political muscle .
The big commodity brokers and railroad barons were brutalizing the co-ops with predatory pricing and other monopoly tactics , and bankers were squeezing the Alliance 's marketing co-ops by refusing to provide loans .
The major political parties , which were in harness to these moneyed interests , offered no relief from the corporate assault , while also refusing to advance any of the Alliance 's broader reform agenda .
For about six years , Alliance members held countless local meetings , debates , and consultations on how to proceed politically .
Finally , Alliance delegates met in Omaha on July 4 , 1892 , for the founding convention of the People 's Party of America , proudly branding themselves " The Populists . "
Now , they could run their own people for offices up and down the ballot , campaigning on a broad platform to counter the " corporations , national banks , rings , trusts ... and the oppression of usurers " in order to advance the common interests of the " plain people . "
The Knights of Labor were a part of this founding , and the preamble to the party 's 1892 platform declared that " The interests of rural and civil labor are the same ; their enemies are identical . "
Yes , the Populists called for the " free and unlimited coinage of silver " to provide both debt relief and economic stimulus for small enterprise , but the snickering cynics who try to marginalize populism by defining it in terms of this narrow ( though important ) issue ignore the party 's broader and amazingly progressive agenda , including these provisions :
The first party to call for women 's suffrage .
An eight - hour day for labor , plus wage protections .
The abolition of the standing army of mercenaries , known as the " Pinkerton system , " which violently suppressed union organizers .
The direct election by the people of U.S. senators ( who were chosen by state legislatures at the time ) .
A graduated income tax .
Legislation by popular initiative and referendum .
Public ownership of railroads , telephones , and telegraphs .
No subsidy of private corporations for any purpose .
Prohibition of speculation on and foreign ownership of our public lands and natural resources .
A free ballot and fair count in all elections .
Civil - service laws to prevent the politicalization of government employees .
Pensions for veterans .
Measures to break the corrupting power of corporate lobbyists .
What happened ?
Ultimately , the Populists were undone , not by their boldness , but by leaders who urged them to compromise and to merge their aspirations into the Democratic Party .
In the presidential election of 1896 , they nominated the Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan , whose " cross of gold " campaign focused on the monetary issue , avoiding the much more appealing structural radicalism of Populism .
Outspent five to one , Bryan lost a close race to William McKinley , the Republican who was financed and owned by Wall Street .
The People 's Party , having surrendered its independence and soul at a time the Alliance was being gutted by the money interests and the press , lost favor with its own faithful -- and withered into a parody of itself .
Nonetheless , the Populists had successfully energized , organized , educated , and mobilized one of America 's few genuine mass movements , striking fear in the flinty hearts of such barons as J.P. Morgan , who railed against that " awful democracy . "
The party was killed off , but not the Populist spirit .
Persevering in separate political forms , the constituent components of populism -- including unionists , suffragists , anti-trusters , socialists , cooperativists , and rural organizers -- continued the struggle against America 's economic and political aristocracy .
Indeed , populists defined the content of national politics for the first third of the 20th century , forcing the Democratic Party to adopt populist positions , spawning the Progressive Party , elevating two Roosevelts to the presidency , and enacting major chunks of the agenda first drawn up by the People 's Party .
Though the Powers That Be do n't want us connecting with this stunning " Populist Moment " in our democratic history , a majority of folks today hold within them the live spark of populism -- which is an innate distrust of corporate tycoons and Wall Street titans and an instinct to rebel against them .
The moment can come again .
As Goodwyn tells us , " the triumph of Populism ... was the belief in possibility it injected into American political consciousness . "

Every Irish journalist remembers where they were the day that Veronica Guerin was shot dead in Dublin , 24 years ago today .
Editor 's Note : Veronica Guerin , who at the time was a crime journalist working for the Sunday Independent , was shot and killed on June 26 , 1996 while stopped at a traffic light on the outskirts of Dublin .
Guerin had become a target of Irish drug lords and courts later heard that her death was ordered by kingpin John Gilligan .
In July 1999 , Brian Meehan was convicted for his role in Guerin 's murder and is currently serving a life term in prison .
On June 26 , 1996 , I was at the " stone " ( look it up , young ' uns ) at the Irish Independent watching the printers finish up the late edition of the Evening Herald .
The front page was finished and sent down to the camera when then - editor Paul Drury hung up from a phone conversation and shouted : “ hold the front page . ”
Contrary to popular belief , you rarely hear “ hold the front page ” in a newsroom , and we knew whatever it was , it was going to be huge .
“ Veronica ’s been shot , ” he said , referring to the crime reporter at our sister newspaper , the Sunday Independent .
“ Is she all right ? ” I remember asking as his words began to settle .
“ No , ” he said , “ the guards think she ’s dead . ”
Dead ?
Veronica ?
She could n’t be .
It was a beautiful sunny June day , we were trying to get finished to go watch the European soccer finals , and Veronica could n’t be dead .
I ’d seen her only the previous week with her son Cathal outside the paper , running , as ever , late for something .
As the Evening Herald redid its front page , the Gardaí ( Irish police ) rang and asked the paper to hold off reporting the story until they could contact her husband Graham .
It was one of the longest hours ever in Independent House .
Phones went unanswered and copy went unfiled as stunned journalists sat there and waited for the all - clear from the police , so we could report that one of our colleagues had been shot dead .
It was inconceivable that a journalist had been killed in the Republic .
No one in Ireland seriously believed that any criminal would assassinate a journalist .
I had known Veronica since 1994 when I was working as a stand - in copy editor on the Sunday Independent .
She had written a complicated story about corruption , and the libel lawyers insisted I contact her as they wanted to change several paragraphs .
When I reached her at home , she was surprisingly friendly about making the corrections and we hammered out a different version .
I say “ surprisingly ” because some of the headline writers for the Sunday Independent would ( and did ! ) chew me up into pieces for having the temerity to suggest any changes .
Anyway , by the time we had finished reworking the piece , the lawyers said it was still too libelous and the story was spiked .
I chatted to Veronica for a while longer , apologized for bothering her at home on a Friday night and came off the phone with a completely different impression of her .
Some writers would rather stab the copy editor to death than change a word in the story , while others accept it as the necessary evil it is in Ireland .
Veronica , while unhappy that the story was being changed , was not taking it as a personal affront .
I spoke to her several times over the year over different stories , but did not actually meet her in person until August 23 , 1995 .
We had both been given tickets by our respective editors for Manchester United ’s second game of the season at Old Trafford against West Ham and we were supposed to meet at the airline ticket desk .
I ’d waited at the desk for a half - hour and then given up , assuming she had gone on to the gate before me .
When I could n’t find her at the gate , I began to get a little concerned .
With seconds to go before they closed the flight , Veronica came running into the departures lounge with a bemused security officer in her wake .
Turns out she had been delayed because she had been in the airport chapel praying .
Not the sort of place that you would expect to find a hardened crime reporter , but then again , she was n’t what you would expect a hardened crime reporter to be either .
The trip to Old Trafford was a gift from a corporate travel agent , and we were ferried to a swanky country club on the outskirts of Manchester for tea and sandwiches .
I have no idea what the travel agency expected from us , with Veronica a crime reporter and me a foreign editor , but we played along anyway , nodding and smiling when it seemed that nods and smiles were expected from us .
Then it was up to the corporate boxes where , once the tour leader ’s back was turned , we escaped from the tour and went out on to the streets around Old Trafford .
Wandering around the makeshift stalls which spring up on match day , curiosity got the better of me and I asked Veronica why she had been in the airport chapel .
She said she always went to the chapel before she got on a plane .
She was a regular Mass - goer and yes , she knew she was an oddity as far as Dublin journalists were concerned , given that most of them probably would n’t even be able to find their local church .
As we gathered up more t- shirts to take home as souvenirs , I asked her how she had continued to write for the Sunday Independent after being shot .
She said she was just doing her job , writing about crime and its associated effects .
Like all mothers , she worried about her child ’s future but she also worried that her son would grow up in a crime - infested city as the authorities appeared to be ignoring the drug epidemic .
Unlike many people in journalism and indeed Dublin , Veronica felt it was a foolish choice to avoid the problem by isolating yourself from it .
This was no self - obsessed celebrity journalist talking .
This was a mother talking .
She did n’t see herself as some social crusader recklessly ignoring threats to her family .
She felt she had dealt with the death threats and moved on .
We went back to Old Trafford , watched Manchester United beat West Ham 1 - 0 , and behaved like a pair of children when we realized Eric Cantona was seated a couple of rows behind us .
Veronica described how games in her house were fraught affairs as she would lock herself into a room with a pack of cigarettes and smoke her way through the game .
When the game was over we headed back to the hotel for a few drinks and met up the next morning for the trip back to Dublin .
The last time I saw her was the week before she died , outside the office with Cathal .
We had spoken on the phone a few times in between , but you always think there ’s going to be more time .
She rarely came into the office and when she did , she did n’t stop long .
She did her work the old - fashioned way , door - stepping and calling out to people .
She lived a mainly quiet life , preferring to spend time with family and friends than talking shop in the pub , and was unfairly judged as being aloof for this .
Veronica just did n’t want to be a celebrity journalist .
And besides , she did n’t hang out on the celebrity trail – which was probably the root of some of the ill - feeling towards her .
Veronica ’s passion for her work was driven by her disgust at what was happening to her city .
Pockets of Dublin had developed into complete no - go areas , and the gangs making the money from this seemed to be completely untouchable .
Dublin journalists , by and large , did not live in the kinds of areas that were being decimated by drugs , and subsequently , Veronica was one of the few reporters who kept after this issue .
Knowing now what we did n’t know then , I do n’t believe she would have continued writing such stories if she had thought the threat to her life was so grave .
She was n’t some reckless reporter out to make a name for herself as the great drug crusader .
She was a woman who could n’t understand why more people were n’t taking on the drug barons .
I often wonder how she would have felt to know that , in the end , it took her own death – not the deaths of the countless children which she reported on – to push the authorities into action .

There are all sorts of ways to reconstruct the history of life on Earth .
Pinning down when specific events occurred is often tricky , though .
For this , biologists depend mainly on dating the rocks in which fossils are found , and by looking at the “ molecular clocks ” in the DNA of living organisms .
There are problems with each of these methods .
The fossil record is like a movie with most of the frames cut out .
Because it is so incomplete , it can be difficult to establish exactly when particular evolutionary changes happened .
Modern genetics allows scientists to measure how different species are from each other at a molecular level , and thus to estimate how much time has passed since a single lineage split into different species .
Confounding factors rack up for species that are very distantly related , making the earlier dates more uncertain .
Advertisement
These difficulties mean that the dates in the timeline should be taken as approximate .
As a general rule , they become more uncertain the further back along the geological timescale we look .
Dates that are very uncertain are marked with a question mark .
3.8 billion years ago ?
This is our current “ best guess ” for the beginning of life on Earth .
It is distinctly possible that this date will change as more evidence comes to light .
The first life may have developed in undersea alkaline vents , and was probably based on RNA rather than DNA .
At some point far back in time , a common ancestor gave rise to two main groups of life : bacteria and archaea .
How this happened , when , and in what order the different groups split , is still uncertain .
3.5 billion years ago
The oldest fossils of single - celled organisms date from this time .
3.46 billion years ago
Some single - celled organisms may be feeding on methane by this time .
3.4 billion years ago
Rock formations in Western Australia , that some researchers claim are fossilised microbes , date from this period .
3 billion years ago
Viruses are present by this time , but they may be as old as life itself .
2.4 billion years ago
The “ great oxidation event ” .
Supposedly , the poisonous waste produced by photosynthetic cyanobacteria – oxygen – starts to build up in the atmosphere .
Dissolved oxygen makes the iron in the oceans “ rust ” and sink to the seafloor , forming striking banded iron formations .
Recently , though , some researchers have challenged this idea .
They think cyanobacteria only evolved later , and that other bacteria oxidised the iron in the absence of oxygen .
Yet others think that cyanobacteria began pumping out oxygen as early as 2.1 billion years ago , but that oxygen began to accumulate only due to some other factor , possibly a decline in methane - producing bacteria .
Methane reacts with oxygen , removing it from the atmosphere , so fewer methane - belching bacteria would allow oxygen to build up .

2.3 billion years ago
Earth freezes over in what may have been the first “ snowball Earth ” , possibly as a result of a lack of volcanic activity .
When the ice eventually melts , it indirectly leads to more oxygen being released into the atmosphere .
2.15 billion years ago
First undisputed fossil evidence of cyanobacteria , and of photosynthesis : the ability to take in sunlight and carbon dioxide , and obtain energy , releasing oxygen as a by - product .
There is some evidence for an earlier date for the beginning of photosynthesis , but it has been called into question .
2 billion years ago ?
Eukaryotic cells – cells with internal “ organs ” ( known as organelles ) – come into being .
One key organelle is the nucleus : the control centre of the cell , in which the genes are stored in the form of DNA .
Eukaryotic cells evolved when one simple cell engulfed another , and the two lived together , more or less amicably – an example of “ endosymbiosis ” .
The engulfed bacteria eventually become mitochondria , which provide eukaryotic cells with energy .
The last common ancestor of all eukaryotic cells had mitochondria – and had also developed sexual reproduction .
Later , eukaryotic cells engulfed photosynthetic bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with them .
The engulfed bacteria evolved into chloroplasts : the organelles that give green plants their colour and allow them to extract energy from sunlight .
Different lineages of eukaryotic cells acquired chloroplasts in this way on at least three separate occasions , and one of the resulting cell lines went on to evolve into all green algae and green plants .
1.5 billion years ago ?
The eukaryotes divide into three groups : the ancestors of modern plants , fungi and animals split into separate lineages , and evolve separately .
We do not know in what order the three groups broke with each other .
At this time they were probably all still single - celled organisms .
900 million years ago ?
The first multicellular life develops around this time .
It is unclear exactly how or why this happens , but one possibility is that single - celled organisms go through a stage similar to that of modern choanoflagellates : single - celled creatures that sometimes form colonies consisting of many individuals .
Of all the single - celled organisms known to exist , choanoflagellates are the most closely related to multicellular animals , lending support to this theory .
800 million years ago
The early multicellular animals undergo their first splits .
First they divide into , essentially , the sponges and everything else – the latter being more formally known as the Eumetazoa .
Around 20 million years later , a small group called the placozoa breaks away from the rest of the Eumetazoa .
Placozoa are thin plate - like creatures about 1 millimetre across , and consist of only three layers of cells .
It has been suggested that they may actually be the last common ancestor of all the animals .
770 million years ago
The planet freezes over again in another “ snowball Earth “ .
730 million years ago
The comb jellies ( ctenophores ) split from the other multicellular animals .
Like the cnidarians that will soon follow , they rely on water flowing through their body cavities to acquire oxygen and food .
680 million years ago
The ancestor of cnidarians ( jellyfish and their relatives ) breaks away from the other animals – though there is as yet no fossil evidence of what it looks like .
630 million years ago
Around this time , some animals evolve bilateral symmetry for the first time : that is , they now have a defined top and bottom , as well as a front and back .
Little is known about how this happened .
However , small worms called Acoela may be the closest surviving relatives of the first ever bilateral animal .
It seems likely that the first bilateral animal was a kind of worm .
Vernanimalcula guizhouena , which dates from around 600 million years ago , may be the earliest bilateral animal found in the fossil record .
590 million years ago
The Bilateria , those animals with bilateral symmetry , undergo a profound evolutionary split .
They divide into the protostomes and deuterostomes .
The deuterostomes eventually include all the vertebrates , plus an outlier group called the Ambulacraria .
The protostomes become all the arthropods ( insects , spiders , crabs , shrimp and so forth ) , various types of worm , and the microscopic rotifers .
Neither may seem like an obvious “ group ” , but in fact the two can be distinguished by the way their embryos develop .
The first hole that the embryo acquires , the blastopore , forms the anus in deuterostomes , but in protostomes it forms the mouth .

580 million years ago
The earliest known fossils of cnidarians , the group that includes jellyfish , sea anemones and corals , date to around this time – though the fossil evidence has been disputed .
575 million years ago
Strange life forms known as the Ediacarans appear around this time and persist for about 33 million years .
570 million years ago
A small group breaks away from the main group of deuterostomes , known as the Ambulacraria .
This group eventually becomes the echinoderms ( starfish , brittle stars and their relatives ) and two worm - like families called the hemichordates and Xenoturbellida .
Another echinoderm , the sea lily , is thought to be the “ missing link ” between vertebrates ( animals with backbones ) and invertebrates ( animals without backbones ) , a split that occurred around this time .
565 million years ago
Fossilised animal trails suggest that some animals are moving under their own power .
540 million years ago
As the first chordates – animals that have a backbone , or at least a primitive version of it – emerge among the deuterostomes , a surprising cousin branches off .
The sea squirts ( tunicates ) begin their history as tadpole - like chordates , but metamorphose partway through their lives into bottom - dwelling filter feeders that look rather like a bag of seawater anchored to a rock .
Their larvae still look like tadpoles today , revealing their close relationship to backboned animals .
535 million years ago
The Cambrian explosion begins , with many new body layouts appearing on the scene – though the seeming rapidity of the appearance of new life forms may simply be an illusion caused by a lack of older fossils .
530 million years ago
The first true vertebrate – an animal with a backbone – appears .
It probably evolves from a jawless fish that has a notochord , a stiff rod of cartilage , instead of a true backbone .
The first vertebrate is probably quite like a lamprey , hagfish or lancelet .
Around the same time , the first clear fossils of trilobites appear .
These invertebrates , which look like oversized woodlice and grow to 70 centimetres in length , proliferate in the oceans for the next 200 million years .
520 million years ago
Conodonts , another contender for the title of “ earliest vertebrate “ , appear .
They probably look like eels .
500 million years ago
Fossil evidence shows that animals were exploring the land at this time .
The first animals to do so were probably euthycarcinoids – thought to be the missing link between insects and crustaceans .
Nectocaris pteryx , thought to be the oldest known ancestor of the cephalopods – the group that includes squid – lives around this time .
489 million years ago
The Great Ordovician Biodiversification
Event begins , leading to a great increase in diversity .
Within each of the major groups of animals and plants , many new varieties appear .
465 million years ago
Plants begin colonising the land .
460 million years ago
Fish split into two major groups : the bony fish and cartilaginous fish .
The cartilaginous fish , as the name implies , have skeletons made of cartilage rather than the harder bone .
They eventually include all the sharks , skates and rays .
440 million years ago
The bony fish split into their two major groups : the lobe - finned fish with bones in their fleshy fins , and the ray - finned fish .
The lobe - finned fish eventually give rise to amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals .
The ray - finned fish thrive , and give rise to most fish species living today .
The common ancestor of lobe - finned and ray - finned fish probably has simple sacs that function as primitive lungs , allowing it to gulp air when oxygen levels in the water fall too low .
In ray - finned fish , these sacs evolve into the swim bladder , which is used for controlling buoyancy .
425 million years ago
The coelacanth , one of the most famous “ living fossils ” – species that have apparently not changed for millions of years – splits from the rest of the lobe - finned fish .
417 million years ago
Lungfish , another legendary living fossil , follow the coelacanth by splitting from the other lobe - finned fish .
Although they are unambiguously fish , complete with gills , lungfish have a pair of relatively sophisticated lungs , which are divided into numerous smaller air sacs to increase their surface area .
These allow them to breathe out of water and thus to survive when the ponds they live in dry out .
400 million years ago
The oldest known insect lives around this time .
Some plants evolve woody stems .
397 million years ago
The first four - legged animals , or tetrapods , evolve from intermediate species such as Tiktaalik , probably in shallow freshwater habitats .
The tetrapods go on to conquer the land , and give rise to all amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals .
385 million years ago
The oldest fossilised tree dates from this period .
375 million years ago
Tiktaalik , an intermediate between fish and four - legged land animals , lives around this time .
The fleshy fins of its lungfish ancestors are evolving into limbs .
340 million years ago
The first major split occurs in the tetrapods , with the amphibians branching off from the others .
310 million years ago
Within the remaining tetrapods , the sauropsids and synapsids split from one another .
The sauropsids include all the modern reptiles , plus the dinosaurs and birds .
The first synapsids are also reptiles , but have distinctive jaws .
They are sometimes called “ mammal - like reptiles ” , and eventually evolve into the mammals .
320 to 250 million years ago
The pelycosaurs , the first major group of synapsid animals , dominate the land .
The most famous example is Dimetrodon , a large predatory “ reptile ” with a sail on its back .
Despite appearances , Dimetrodon is not a dinosaur .
275 to 100 million years ago
The therapsids , close cousins of the pelycosaurs , evolve alongside them and eventually replace them .
The therapsids survive until the early Cretaceous , 100 million years ago .
Well before that , a group of them called the cynodonts develops dog - like teeth and eventually evolves into the first mammals .
250 million years ago
The Permian period ends with the greatest mass extinction in Earth ’s history , wiping out great swathes of species , including the last of the trilobites .
As the ecosystem recovers , it undergoes a fundamental shift .
Whereas before the synapsids ( first the pelycosaurs , then the therapsids ) dominated , the sauropsids now take over – most famously , in the form of dinosaurs .
The ancestors of mammals survive as small , nocturnal creatures .
In the oceans , the ammonites , cousins of the modern nautilus and octopus , evolve around this time .
Several groups of reptiles colonise the seas , developing into the great marine reptiles of the dinosaur era .
210 million years ago
Bird - like footprints and a badly - preserved fossil called Protoavis suggest that some early dinosaurs are already evolving into birds at this time .
This claim remains controversial .
200 million years ago
As the Triassic period comes to an end , another mass extinction strikes , paving the way for the dinosaurs to take over from their sauropsid cousins .
Around the same time , proto-mammals evolve warm - bloodedness – the ability to maintain their internal temperature , regardless of the external conditions .
180 million years ago
The first split occurs in the early mammal population .
The monotremes , a group of mammals that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young , break apart from the others .
Few monotremes survive today : they include the duck - billed platypus and the echidnas .
168 million years ago
A half - feathered , flightless dinosaur called Epidexipteryx , which may be an early step on the road to birds , lives in China .
150 million years ago
Archaeopteryx , the famous “ first bird ” , lives in Europe .
140 million years ago
Around this time , placental mammals split from their cousins the marsupials .
These mammals , like the modern kangaroo , that give birth when their young are still very small , but nourish them in a pouch for the first few weeks or months of their lives .
The majority of modern marsupials live in Australia , but they reach it by an extremely roundabout route .
Arising in south - east Asia , they spread into north America ( which was attached to Asia at the time ) , then to south America and Antarctica , before making the final journey to Australia about 50 million years ago .
131 million years ago
Eoconfuciusornis , a bird rather more advanced than Archaeopteryx , lives in China .
130 million years ago
The first flowering plants emerge , following a period of rapid evolution .
105 - 85 million years ago
The placental mammals split into their four major groups : the laurasiatheres ( a hugely diverse group including all the hoofed mammals , whales , bats , and dogs ) , euarchontoglires ( primates , rodents and others ) , Xenarthra ( including anteaters and armadillos ) and afrotheres ( elephants , aardvarks and others ) .
Quite how these splits occurred is unclear at present .
100 million years ago
The Cretaceous dinosaurs reach their peak in size .
The giant sauropod Argentinosaurus , believed to be the largest land animal in Earth ’s history , lives around this time .
93 million years ago
The oceans become starved of oxygen , possibly due to a huge underwater volcanic eruption .
Twenty - seven per cent of marine invertebrates are wiped out .
75 million years ago
The ancestors of modern primates split from the ancestors of modern rodents and lagomorphs ( rabbits , hares and pikas ) .
The rodents go on to be astonishingly successful , eventually making up around 40 per cent of modern mammal species .
70 million years ago
Grasses evolve – though it will be several million years before the vast open grasslands appear .
65 million years ago
The Cretaceous - Tertiary ( K/T ) extinction wipes out a swathe of species , including all the giant reptiles : the dinosaurs , pterosaurs , ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs .
The ammonites are also wiped out .
The extinction clears the way for the mammals , which go on to dominate the planet .
63 million years ago
The primates split into two groups , known as the haplorrhines ( dry - nosed primates ) and the strepsirrhines ( wet - nosed primates ) .
The strepsirrhines eventually become the modern lemurs and aye - ayes , while the haplorrhines develop into monkeys and apes – and humans .
58 million years ago
The tarsier , a primate with enormous eyes to help it see at night , splits from the rest of the haplorrhines : the first to do so .

It is the largest rodent known to have lived , displacing the previous record holder : a giant guinea pig .
An Islamic court in Malaysia has sentenced a Muslim woman to be flogged with a rattan cane for having a beer in a nightclub , a court official said today .

It is rare for a woman in Malaysia to be sentenced to caning - a punishment usually reserved for men in various crimes ranging from rape to bribery .
It is generally done by specially trained officials at prisons .
Part - time model Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno was sentenced on Monday to six lashes and a fine of 5,000 ringgit ( £ 850 ) for consuming alcohol , said a Shariah High Court official .
Shukarno , 32 , pleaded guilty in the court in eastern Pahang state to a charge of drinking beer when Islamic authorities raided a hotel nightclub in August 2008 .
Consuming alcohol is a religious offence in Malaysia only for Muslims , who make up nearly two - thirds of the population .
Offenders are prosecuted in Shariah courts , which handle cases mainly related to family and moral issues for Muslims .
Shukarno plans to appeal the sentence , the New Straits Times reported .
The punishment " is aimed at making the accused repent and serves as a lesson to Muslims , " the newspaper quoted Judge Abdul Rahman Yunus as saying .
Lynch said in a statement he " remains open " to tightly controlled medical marijuana , but he said the bill passed by the Legislature two weeks ago lacks adequate safeguards on the drug 's cultivation and distribution .
He said he fears the amount of marijuana allowed under the bill could prove addictive or damaging .
Lawmakers had tightened the bill after Lynch voiced concern about an earlier version that would have allowed patients to grow marijuana at home .
The final version would allow marijuana only in three nonprofit " compassion centers " throughout the state , where workers who had passed background checks would disperse limited amounts of the drug to registered patients .
But Lynch said he was not convinced the centers would keep marijuana in the right hands , arguing the bill did not require sufficient oversight of volunteers working at the centers .
" We can not set a lower bar for medical marijuana than we do for other controlled substances , and we cannot implement a law that has serious flaws , " he said in his statement .
Advocates said they were disappointed in the veto of a bill they said would have regulated the drug more tightly than in any of the 13 states where medical marijuana is allowed .
Rep. Evalyn Merrick , a cancer survivor who sponsored the bill , rejected Lynch 's arguments as politically motivated .
Merrick , a Democrat from Lancaster , said the governor denied a bill that would have given relief to the state 's most vulnerable citizens .
She said limiting marijuana cultivation to the compassion centers would ensure its quality and security , and she said the system of fees established in the bill contradicts Lynch 's concern that only the wealthiest residents could afford marijuana .
" This is clearly a politically directed decision , based on misinformation and lies , " she said in a statement .
" It appears the governor may not have thoroughly read the bill in its entirety . "
Rep. Cindy Rosenwald , who helped usher the bill through the Legislature , said lawmakers believed they had addressed the governor 's concerns .
She questioned his reference to marijuana as an addictive drug .
" There 's a difference maybe between habit - forming and addictive , " said Rosenwald , a Democrat from Nashua .
" If you want to talk about addictive , talk about opiates and narcotics .
Prescription drugs are addictive , marijuana is n't . "
She also questioned the governor 's reference to the illegality of marijuana under federal law , given that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in March that federal raids would target only marijuana users who broke state law .
Supporters at NH Coalition for Common Sense Marijuana Policy were angered but not surprised by the veto , said Matt Simon , executive director of that group .
He said Lynch had given little sign of supporting the legislation and did not meet personally with seriously ill patients lobbying for medical marijuana .
" It 's just clear he has n't adequately studied this issue , " Simon said .
" The wording of his statement : I have tremendous compassion for these patients I 've refused to meet with ? "
Lynch spokesman Colin Manning said people representing the governor 's office have met with many supporters of the bill .
Supporters have one last shot at passing the bill if they rally two - thirds of the lawmakers of each house to override the governor 's veto .
That will likely be a thornier matter in the Senate , where last month 's vote was 14 - 10 .
The House passed it 232-108 .
Rosenwald said she would not speculate about the chances of overriding the veto in the Senate , but Simon said he knew of a few senators who were on the fence when they decided to vote against the bill .
He would n't name names .
The House has not yet scheduled a session to address the vetoed bill .

It would certainly rank fairly low down my own list of Michael Jackson classics – give me something from Off the Wall anytime of the day - but it is often forgotten that his somewhat cloying environmental anthem Earth Song was actually his biggest selling single in the UK – over a million copies sold and six weeks at the top of the charts , including the 1995 Christmas number one .
The song is a very rare thing : a hit record with a powerful message about our impact on the environment .
How many others can you think of ?
Joni Mitchell 's Big Yellow Taxi ?
Marvin Gaye's Mercy Mercy Me? The Pixie 's Monkey Gone to Heaven ?
All great records , but none of them come close in terms of sales when compared to Earth Song .
Although never released in the US as a single , the song became the defining , closing song on Jacko's HIStory tour , especially when it climaxed with scores of children joining Jackson on stage to sing the song 's rousing finale .
It was a sight of such pomposity - which included Jackson striking a Christ on the crucifix - like pose - that it famously sent Jarvis Cocker over the edge at the Brits Awards in 1996 and led him to jump up on stage and start gesturing at Jackson before being bundled away by security guards .
And then there was the video – among the most expensive ever made - which starts with a long tracking shot through a lush rainforest that then cuts to a scene showing a sombre Jackson walking through a scorched , desolate landscape .
The environmental emoting then comes thick and fast : dead elephants , evil loggers , belching smoke stacks , snared dolphins , seal clubbing , and hurricane winds .
Here 's what Jackson himself said of the song :
I remember writing Earth Song when I was in Austria , in a hotel .
And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the Planet Earth .
And for me , this is Earth 's Song , because I think nature is trying so hard to compensate for man 's mismanagement of the Earth .
And with the ecological unbalance going on , and a lot of the problems in the environment , I think earth feels the pain , and she has wounds , and it 's about some of the joys of the planet as well .
But this is my chance to pretty much let people hear the voice of the planet .
And this is ' Earth Song ' .
And that 's what inspired it .
And it just suddenly dropped into my lap when I was on tour in Austria .
What struck me today watching the video was how it is very much the product of an age before climate change had become a mainstream concern .
The lyrics and imagery speak of over - fishing , deforestation , and smog .
All of them are still huge and legitimate concerns , of course , but they have all now become somewhat dwarfed by climate change , the most compelling and over - arching environmental issue of our age .
But that should n't distract us from the song 's impact on its fans .
Given its universal success and the repeated showing of its powerful video , it is highly likely that it was the spark that made many people - particularly young Michael Jackson fans , which , even in the mid-1990s , would have numbered many millions of people around the world - stop and think about environment for the first time .

Following on from this post , here is an attempt to render another twitter thread into a single post .
It 's 50 short but great books that can each be read in a day for someone in isolation / quarantine .
So here we go !
Leafy areas such as The Strip in Las Vegas could contain higher levels of ozone ( Image : Stewart Cook / Rex Features )
Tree - lined avenues and flower - filled central reservations are pretty , but they could be damaging your health .
A new study shows that some plants can increase the rate of ozone production by up to 50 times .
Certain plants , such as rosemary , juniper and pine trees , emit chemical compounds known as terpenes , thought to help deter insect predators , or protect the plant from other stresses like high temperatures .
However , when terpenes mix with pollutants ( particularly nitrogen oxides from industry and traffic ) they react to produce ozone – a key ingredient of photochemical smogs , and a health hazard that can cause breathing difficulties and may cause cancer .

Scientists have long known that terpenes from forests can cause a significant rise in ozone levels when they mix with air pollution .
But could smaller clusters of plants in urban environments be damaging too ?
Mark Potosnak , from DePaul University in Chicago , Illinois , and his colleagues measured terpene emissions from plants lining the sidewalks of Las Vegas .
They also studied air quality – including levels of nitrogen oxides and ozone – in a number of central and suburban regions .
Planted perils
In all cases , ozone levels exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency safe standard ( an average of 75 parts per billion over an eight - hour period ) and in the worst case reached 107 ppb .
Modelling the data revealed that the mix of terpenes and pollutants was responsible for a significant rise in ozone levels – boosting production rates by up to 50 times – particularly downwind of the plants , in suburban neighbourhoods .
“ It ’s surprising because Las Vegas has relatively little urban vegetation , ” says Potosnak .
All over the world hot cities are likely to have similar problems , Potosnak thinks .
But the situation can be easily remedied by choosing plants carefully .
“ Some plant species are very low emitters .
Shoestring acacia is a great plant : low water use and low terpene emissions , ” says Potosnak .

The garden is peaceful and serene , filled with edible fruits , lush flora and weird little party hat - wearing beasties that reproduce like crazy .
Life also seems pretty good for the bird - beaked man in the bowler hat ... until the water starts rising .
Unlike his strange protagonist , Swedish game developer Erik Svedäng is in a situation that 's far from dire .
Last month he took home the Seumus McNally Grand Prize at this year 's Independent Games Festival for Blueberry Garden - a whimsical and beautiful 2D platformer where you explore and interact with a delightful little world and attempt to keep from drowning in it .
Conceptually , Blueberry Garden has been years in the making .
Svedäng first began mulling over the idea of creating an exploratory game that experimented with interactive storytelling and a vibrant ecosystem long ago .
" The game that made me feel it was possible is probably , first and foremost , Shadow of the Colossus , " he says .
" I was also very inspired by some music I listened to at the time , especially Sagor & Swing and Detektivbyrån .
I tried to capture a lot of the feeling in their songs , which for me is about the Swedish outdoors . "
Three years ago , he came up with the current structure for Blueberry Garden and created extensive drawings of how it would work .
Actual production began in 2008 , and it was submitted in nearly - complete form for this year 's IGF competition .
The gameplay is pretty basic , notes Svedäng ; you walk around , pick stuff up , glide through the air and explore .
Eating different kinds of fruit produces various magical effects , and finding an odd assortment of objects is crucial to your survival .
Beyond that , it 's up to players themselves to figure out what there is to do and how to do it .
" The most important part is probably that I 'm trying to give the player a lot of room for thought , " he says .
" It 's not a game where you get clear instructions on what to do ; you have to think for yourself . "
As time passes , the game environment continually fluctuates .
The decisions you make and the consequences of those choices have an impact on the ever - changing garden realm and whether or not you 'll survive in it .
" The ecosystem is something that I wanted to try for a long time , since it 's such a compelling idea .
Most game worlds feel kind of fake in the sense that they reset when you move away from an area , " says Svedäng .
" Usually , there 's nothing wrong with that , but I wanted to see if I could create a world that felt alive in a more fulfilling way .
The ecosystem does n't really add a lot of gameplay ; it 's more about creating the feeling of a real place . "

Whether you discovered it along with your partner or she told you the news , your reaction was probably along the lines of “ OMG , we 're having a baby ! ”
And you probably are feeling , well , all the feels : thrilled beyond your wildest expectations , enormous pride and maybe a little freaked out , too .
It ’s okay .
Becoming a parent is an act of love and hope , and the two of you are on this ride together .
Just be sure to share your joy with her .
She ’s no doubt feeling the same mix of emotions .
After all , you made this magical moment together .
So , what to expect when your partner is pregnant ?
Read on for the most helpful ways to show her some love and support .
What to do when you first find out you ’re going to be a parent
Celebrate — her way .
Keep in mind that even though your partner does n’t look pregnant yet , she may be feeling it .
If she ’s tired or sick , or just not up for going out , cancel your plans and stay in .
Also prep for the unexpected :
Your favorite takeout place may be out of bounds when one whiff of pad Thai sends your pregnant partner rushing to the bathroom to puke .
Strengthen your bonds .
Get a little sappy , sentimental and nostalgic — or a lot .
Tell her what made you fall in love with her back then and what you love most about her now .
Swap stories about your first date , your first kiss , your first “ I love you . ”
Talk about what makes you a strong couple ( and how becoming parents will make you even stronger ) .
In the coming months , your relationship will undergo unique challenges .
It ’s wise to expend a little energy reinforcing the foundation now .
Figure out how you ’ll start spreading the news .
Maybe you ’re so anxious to spill the beans that you ’re about to burst , but you and your partner will need to decide how — and when — to tell loved ones your happy news .
Maybe close friends and family get a phone call , other relatives get texts and everyone else checks it out when you update your social media pages .
Some couples wait until after the first trimester to share pregnancy news , while others share right away — whatever you choose , it 's a deeply personal decision that you two should make together .

Scan the HR benefits .
Schedule an appointment with someone in HR to make sure you understand your company ’s policies on parental leave and time off — and whether it ’s paid or not .
Remind your partner to check her workplace ’s maternity leave policies , too .
How to support your partner during her pregnancy
Of course , you ’re already supportive .
But pregnancy — especially for first - time mamas and their partners — can bring a host of surprises .
There ’s her ever - changing body , for one , as well as those roller - coaster emotions , cravings and aversions .
There ’s pregnancy brain fog and endless trips to the bathroom .
In short , it ’s hard to know what to expect when your partner is pregnant .
But here ’s how to help her get through the next nine months .
Shoulder more than your share .
Your pregnant partner expends a lot of energy now that she ’s building a baby .
Which makes her a lot more tired than you ’ve ever known her to be .
So even with all you do , now ’s the time to go the extra mile in helping out around the house .
Start by choosing a task she always does ( preferably one that 's physically challenging : vacuuming , scrubbing toilets , cleaning up the kitchen ) and start doing it yourself without asking .
Once you get into the habit , pick another and do that , too — and so on until you are the one who ’s normally throwing in the loads of laundry , whipping up dinner ( well , at least a few nights a week ) and doing the dishes .
Lend an ear .
Some moms - to - be experience self - doubt or anxiety during pregnancy .
She may be stressing that she wo n’t be a good mom or that your relationship will change .
How to comfort her ?
Listen without being judgy or telling her to chill .
And if you have similar concerns , be honest about your feelings , too .
But here ’s some heartening news you both no doubt will find reassuring :
All these worries are completely normal .
And the very fact that you ’re already losing sleep over them means you 're on the right track .
Another plus ?
Getting in the habit of talking things out and really listening to each other will serve you well when the baby comes and the combination of sleep deprivation and zero time can exacerbate misunderstandings .
Get involved in the medical stuff , but ask how involved she wants you to be .
Does she want you to be at every prenatal visit ?
If so , do your best to go , but be honest about any schedule limitations you might have .
If you ca n’t get away for each appointment , show interest and concern by asking questions ( “ So , did the doctor give you any advice on how to keep those prenatal vitamins down ? ” ) .
Do your best to be at the milestone appointments ( when the heartbeat will be heard , for the ultrasounds , for screening tests ) .
Ride the wave .
You have to keep your sense of humor when you ’re going to be a parent .
You ’ll just be getting on the highway when she announces she really needs to pee — even though she went twice before you drove off .
Or she ’ll want you to go out for some pistachio ice cream just as you ’ve settled down to rest after mopping the kitchen floor .
Practice the art of compromise — obviously yes to the rest stop ( she needs to go more often than pre-pregnancy , and you ca n’t risk her getting a UTI ) and an IOU for the ice cream and a counter - offer to swap it for a smoothie right now .
You ’ll be building up these skills when you ’re confronted with similar scenarios as a parent .
Plus , you ’ll have funny memories to laugh over and regale your child ( ren ) with later .
Help her fit in her steps .
Your partner is probably finding it tough to fit in fitness when she ’s so worn out all the time .
So become her workout buddy : Step out for a brisk walk or hike on the weekends or a stroll around the neighborhood in the evenings after dinner .
Make it easier for her to fall asleep .
Get her a body pillow ( or show her some she might like ) so she can get comfy .
Turn on a fan when she gets too hot .
Cuddle before nodding off .
Become a shopper .
Even if hitting the stores or perusing baby gear online feels like torture , you ca n’t just let her choose nursery furniture and layette items ( baby 's set of essential clothes ) without you .
You ’re on a team , and the whole team ( both of you ) needs to know about the gear .
If looking at fabric swatches really would turn you to stone , participate in the other choices , like shopping for a high - tech stroller , which will seem as complicated as choosing your first car .
Make some future plans ( but stay flexible ) .
There ’s a lot to discuss about your baby ’s future .
You may not have to talk about college just yet , but you should set aside some time to research health insurance for your baby .
If both you and your partner have health insurance , you ’ll want to choose the plan that provides the best coverage for the price and whose network has the pediatrician you want to use .
Another thing to think about is child care .
Will one of you stay home after the baby is born ?
If you both are going to work , do you want to do day care or hire a nanny ?
You do n't have to make a final decision yet , but do some legwork now so you do n't get caught short later .
( Make a point of looking into your employer 's pre-tax child care program , too ; it could save you a bundle . )
Just remember that plans can change , so discuss the contingencies , too .
Shower her with compliments .
Even though you think she ’s got that pregnancy glow , your partner may not be feeling like her usual self .
Tell her she ’s beautiful , that her hair never looked this good and anything else that occurs to you .
Do n’t hold back the praise or the love .
Rub her back before she goes to sleep .
Give her massages .
Suggest exploring new positions that are both comfortable and exciting when her sex drive goes into overdrive .
Worried about “ hitting ” the baby , or the baby “ seeing ” what 's going on ?
Do n’t be .
He 's well secured in his uterine home , impervious to harm , completely unable to view the proceedings and perfectly oblivious to what ’s going on when you 're getting it on .
As far as hurting her — always ask what feels good and what does n't .

Since 1995 , Mark Koscielski has been co-owner of the one remaining gun shop in Minneapolis .
On May 19 , the city government would like to make that “ zero ” gun shops .
“ They say it ’s a matter of the public ’s health , safety , and welfare ” Mark Koscielski told me last week .
“ Past mayor Sharon Sayles Belton said , ‘ If there ’s no gun shops there wo n’t be any guns . ’ ”
That makes Ms. Belton -- now a senior fellow in race relations at the University of Minnesota ’s Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs -- wrong on two counts .
As the case of Washington , D.C. proves , once it becomes impossible to legally buy a gun within a certain jurisdiction , the police and the other drug - carrying gangs ( see Det. George Young ’s April 3 letter to the Review - Journal ) become increasingly well - armed ; it ’s only the law - abiding residents caught in the crossfire who have no recourse to self - defense .
Net result ?
As John Lott proved in his exhaustive study “ More Guns , Less Crime ” ( University of Chicago Press , 1998 ) .
the murder and armed robbery rates in “ gun- free ” jurisdictions skyrocket , or remain high while counties that “ allow ” citizens to carry weapons see their violent crime rates drop .
( The crime rate in Vermont , where anyone can carry a concealed weapon without a “ permit , ” is unusually low . )
And as he and others have since demonstrated , that ’s not just here in the United States , but in Britain and Australia as well .
But Ms. Belton ’s second and largest error lies in the notion that the “ public health and safety ” are improved when the government police have guns but the average citizen does not .
Ask the residents of Poland in the 1940s -- or Laos in the 1970s -- how that works out .
And to think we ’re talking about Minnesota , where -- in the town of Northfield -- the reign of terror of the post - Civil War James and Younger gangs was brought to a sudden end on Sept.
7 , 1876 , by townsfolk using loaded rifles handed out by the proprietor of the local hardware store ( without a background check . )
The Minneapolis city fathers moved to effectively outlaw gun stores in their city -- by making it illegal to site a store within 500 feet of a church , a school or day care center , a park , or a library , or within 250 feet of any residence -- in 1995 .
Mark Koscielski outsmarted them , managing to open his store at its original location just days before the law went into effect , which meant he was “ grandfathered in . ”
But the energy and deviousness of the hoplophobes are not to be underestimated .
Koscielski contends his previous landlord became the beneficiary of $ 1.2 million in “ Neighborhood Revitalization Program ” money “ to plant some trees and put in some new lights , but one of the council members of that ward wrote in a newsletter that one of the conditions was that he was not to renew the lease of the gun shop , so we have this in black and white . ”
In 2002 , Koscielski moved to his new location , which is not in compliance with the restrictive zoning law .
Earlier this month , the city sent Koscielski an order telling him to cease operating the gun shop on the 2900 block of Chicago Avenue South by April 18 , because it is out of compliance with the zoning codes .
Thursday ’s hearing is before the local Board of Adjustments , “ which is a couple of Council members and a bunch of so - called ordinary citizens , and you can plead your case with them , ” he explained to me .
“ If they can feel your pain then they will side with you and that will be it .
If they tell us we have to shut down , then we can appeal to the 13 - member City Council , all of whom are Democrats .
Then they will make a decision which will no doubt be that we have to get out of town .
Then we can go to court and begin the lengthy process . ”
The last time Koscielski went to court on the matter , “ They pulled this rabbit out of the hat on us and the judge ; they came up with this list of 183 places where supposedly we could have a gun shop .
One was the county jail .
They gave us this list a year prior to our move ; we went out and photographed these addresses , they were the county jail , a loading dock , the medical examiner ’s office , and so forth . ”
Koscielski says one of the addresses turned out to be the offices of the Minneapolis Star - Tribune .
The city has since given him three legitimate addresses to which he could relocate , Koscielski admits , “ but they did n’t come up with those until three or four months after we ’d moved . ”
And he ’s not relocating to one of those sites because ... it would be too financially prohibitive ?
“ Big time .
I think that ran me around 18 grand to move a mile - and - a - half to this location , just for signs and to beef up security and so forth .
...
“ They claim this is for the public ’s health , safety and welfare .
They seem to think if I was 499 feet from a library , people would come buy a gun and go shoot up the library .
But if I was 501 feet from a library , people are going to say , ‘ Oh , he ’s 501 feet from a library , now I ca n’t go shoot anyone there . ’
It ’s totally asinine .
...
“ At the old shop what happened is for about three years there they opened up a day care center with the city ’s blessing right next door to my gun shop .
They said , ‘ It ’s OK for a day care center to move in next to you , but you ca n’t move in next to a day care center . ’
So go figure . ”
Koscielski says when the controversy first erupted the sheriff told his men not to patronize Koscielski’s Guns and Ammo .
But over the years , many have come in “ because their duty gun , maybe the rear sight is out of adjustment , so instead of sending it in for repair and being without it for weeks , they know they can come here and probably 9 out of 10 times I can fix the gun in five minutes , and most of the time we do n’t charge for things like that . ”
But if he ’s not wanted , why not just cave in and move out to the suburbs , I asked .
“ Over my dead body .
Why should I leave my home town ?
Everything I do here is legal .
God knows the ATF is in here every year , checking me out .
I grew up here .
Where my shop is now , this is my old neighborhood .
I ’ve been here since 1954 .
Sears & Roebuck used to sell handguns here ; I can recall at least six other neighborhood gun shops on the South Side , when I was growing up as a kid .
It was only in the mid ’ 80s they began to be harassed out of business . ”

An American was the hero of the match , but unfortunately for the Major League Soccer All - Stars , he was playing for Everton .
SANDY , Utah -- Everton managed a dramatic 4 - 3 shootout win over the host Major League Soccer All - Star squad in a match that was n’t a fluid one , but created much interest among the sellout crowd at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy , Utah .
First Half
The play on both sides was initially sloppy .
Everton clearly came to play , as they put in solid effort across the pitch , but their ability to connect with each other was choppy , an obvious result of their pre-season status .
On the MLS side , it was clear that the players were not entirely comfortable working together with their new teammates after just a couple of practices together .
They lacked the precision and cohesiveness that you ’d expect from players in mid-season form .
Everton made the host team pay for their lack of quality in the 12th minute .
Stuart Holden had the ball out on the right side of the pitch and made the strangely incomprehensible play of attempting a pass into the center of the area , which was easily intercepted by striker Louis Saha .
He easily slotted it past the helpless MLS keeper , Kasey Keller , giving the English visitors a 1 - 0 lead .
The MLS All - Stars seemed determined to get that one back , and make up for the gaffe .
In the 21st minute , Freddie Ljungberg made a pass inside the box to Blanco who played the ball to Kyle Beckerman , who took a low , hard shot from 25 - yards plus .
The shot was easily deflected , but the MLS attack seemed to step up over the next seven minutes as Everton absorbed a mini- barrage from their rivals .
The payoff for the home team came in the 26th minute , with a goal by Brad Davis .
The buildup came on the right side of the area as Casey fought for a loose ball , and won it in the box .
He attempted to hit an oncoming Holden who attempted a shot , but was stumbling on the play .
The ball squirted to the left off of his foot , and found Davis wide open .
Davis easily put the ball away .
Holden would chalk up with his second unintended assist for the match .
The rest of the half played out without another score , but the MLS side had the bulk of the opportunities , finishing with eleven shots , to the visiting team ’s five .
Second Half
The second half saw liberal substitutions as the MLS All - Stars brought all of their substitutes into the match .
Oddly enough , Kasey Keller subbed out and then back in as Thornton appeared to pick up an injury .
However , the game seemed to lack the sizzle expected from these high - caliber players .
In the 67th minute it appeared that the All - Stars may break the deadlock , when Donovan hit what appeared to be a half - shot , half - cross .
It nearly went in , but Howard was able to push it up over the bar .
In the 75th minute Saha nearly gave back the gift that he received in the first half as he got the ball caught in his feet , and lost it to Casey , who passed it to Ljungberg .
His delivery to Donovan in front of the goal was perfect , but Donovan ’s shot hit the upright .
Everton then had two consecutive chances in the area with the striker Jo getting good looks , but unable to connect .
Yet the final chances came for the All - Stars during the last two minutes of stoppage .
On one attempt Brad Davis swung in a nice ball to Arnaud who got a solid , driving header on target , but Howard was able to punch the ball away .
Casey was able to bring a ball down in the box , but his second touch got away from him , ruining an easy shot on the keeper .
With the format of the All - Star game , the game went directly to penalty kicks .
The All - Stars jumped out to an early lead as Donovan snuck his attempt in past his national teammate after James Vaughan missed his first attempt for Everton badly .
Jo also missed .
Howard then saved Davis ' attempt by blocking the shot with his knee .
Leighton Baines then stepped up and made an easy one for the Everton side .
Davey Arnaud was next , but denied by a stunning Howard save .
Then Will Johnson and Phil Neville each made their attempts , setting up the final drama .
Joleon Lescott stepped up and made the fifth penalty for Everton , putting the pressure on Conor Casey .
However , Casey calmly took his shot , and just managed to sneak it under the arm of the diving Howard , who had guessed correctly on the play .
The additional round was high drama .
Jack Rodwell went first and hit a low shot to the left that froze Keller .
Ljungberg stepped up for the tie , to force another round .
He hesitated on his approach and then chipped the ball down the center .
The shot appeared at first to beat Howard , who dove to his right , but he managed to get back just enough to stop it .
The final result was thus a 1 - 1 draw in regulation with a 4 - 3 win for Everton on penalties .

After doing some research , I have come up with what I feel is a list of the five most superstitious athletes of all - time .
I am sure there are many more , and I welcome you to add them to this list by commenting .
The five athletes I have chosen particularly fascinated me through the years by being repetitive to a fault .
Turk Wendell – Perhaps the dictionary definition of a superstitious athlete .
Wendell , as seen above , would never step on a baseline going to or coming from the mound .
He would n’t just step over the line , as many do , he hopped like a fourth grader propelling himself to maximum heights .
Maybe his vertical distance meant he was far from the baseline as well .
This was n’t it .
After he set records for hopping baselines , he would head to the dugout to brush his teeth EVERY INNING .
I looked at almost two hundred websites , but none that mention the dental hygiene obsession mention whether or not Wendell did this on days he did n’t pitch .
Wade Boggs – Boggs would eat chicken every day before a game .
I ’m not sure if he retreated and ate steak on off days , and perhaps the “ other white meat ” all Winter , but on a summer day when the Red Sox were playing , Boggs was doing the poultry ritual .
Boggs also wrote the word “ Chai ” in the dirt before every at - bat .
Chai is a Hebrew word meaning “ living ” .
Peyton Manning – Manning has a ritual that is less perplexing .
Before every game , both home and away , Manning has to read a program from cover - to - cover .
Brian Urlacher – Urlacher eats exactly two chocolate chip cookies before every game .
Not one or three cookies depending on hunger levels , but exactly two cookies .
Must have gotten bamboozled by The Count and Cookie Monster as a kid , but only as a tandem .
Michael Jordan – Wore his North Carolina shorts under his Bulls uniform shorts every game .
Bonus : Curtis Martin – Dating back to his days at Pittsburgh and through his entire NFL career , Martin always read Psalm 91 .
I know we , as humans , develop rituals which can sometimes defy logic .
However , the above listed athletes have not tried to function without the routines they adapted as “ their own ” .
Publicity stunt or obsessive - compulsive ?
In all of the above listed instances , I would call it obsessive - compulsive behavior .
Linus Van
Pelt always had his blanket and got lightheaded and dizzy when seperated from it .
The above listed blankets fascinate me .
PARIS -- Roger Federer beat Robin Soderling , tied Pete Sampras and won the French Open at last .
Undeterred by an on -court intruder , Federer defeated surprise finalist Soderling 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 1 ) , 6 - 4 on Sunday to complete a career Grand Slam and win his 14th major title , matching Sampras ' record .
" It 's maybe my greatest victory , or certainly the one that removes the most pressure off my shoulders , " Federer said .
" I think that now and until the end of my career , I can really play with my mind at peace , and no longer hear that I 've never won Roland Garros . "
On his fourth try in a Paris final , Federer became the sixth man to win all four Grand Slam championships .
" Now the question is : Am I the greatest of all time ? " Federer said .
" We do n't know , but I definitely have many things going for me because I 've finally won all four Grand Slams , and I 'm particularly happy reaching Pete 's 14 . "
Sampras said Federer deserves to be at the top of the all - time list .
" I 'm obviously happy for Roger , " Sampras told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Los Angeles , where he lives .
" Now that he has won in Paris , I think it just more solidifies his place in history as the greatest player that played the game , in my opinion . "
Midway through the match , a spectator ran onto the court and tried to put a hat on Federer .
That only briefly delayed Federer 's march to the title .
When the stylish Swiss hit a service winner on championship point , he fell on his knees to the clay that had vexed him for so long , screamed and briefly buried his face in his hands .
He was teary by the time he met Soderling at the net , and fans gave Federer a standing ovation as he raised his arms in triumph .
The supportive crowd included Andre Agassi , the most recent man to complete a career Grand Slam when he won at Roland Garros 10 years ago .
Agassi presented Federer with the trophy .

" I 'm so happy for you , man , " Agassi said .
" You 're the last man to win all four Grand Slams , " Federer said .
" Now I can relate to what it really feels like .
...
It feels good to be for once on the podium as the winner .
It 's a magical moment . "
Tears ran down Federer 's cheeks as the Swiss national anthem played .
" Roger , really , congrats to you , " Soderling said .
" You really gave me a lesson in how to play tennis today .
And to me you 're the greatest player in history .
So you really deserved to win this title . "
Federer owed Soderling a thank - you for easing his path by upsetting four - time defending champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round .
" I kind of was relieved , because he was going to be the hardest one to beat , " Federer said .
Nadal defeated Federer at Roland Garros the past four years , including three consecutive times in the final .
A matchup against the No. 23 - seeded Soderling was much more inviting .
The Swede had never previously been beyond the third round at a Grand Slam tournament , and he fell to 0 - 10 against Federer .
" Yesterday , me and my coach were joking , " Soderling told Federer during the trophy ceremony .
" You 've beaten me nine times in a row , and we were joking nobody can beat me 10 times in a row .
But we were wrong . "
Facebookで写真配信のために使われているストレージシステム「Haystack」に関する情報が公開されました。（Needle in a haystack : efficient storage of billions of photos ）
Facebookは最初はNFSを使っていたようです。しかし写真の1枚1枚をファイルとして保存していたため、ディレクトリエントリなどのinodeメタデータの総量がキャッシュに収まらないサイズになってしまい、一つの写真を保存したり取り出したりするのにHDDのシークが複数回発生していたのがボトルネックになっていたそうです。
（もしかした ら「 NetAppは高すぎた」のがもっと重要だったかも知れません：Facebook、独自の写真配信ネットワーク、Haystackを完成―収益性の改善に寄与か？）
シークの問題を軽減するために、profile用などの小さな写真はキャッシュしたり、NFSのfile handleをキャッシュするキャッシュする階層を挟んだりもしたようです。
… などなどの問題を踏まえて、Haystackはできる限りHDDを1回シークするだけで写真を保存したり取り出したりできるように設計されています。
と、詳しい設計については本家の情報を読んでいただくとして、私もHaystackに似た追記型のオブジェクトストレージ
Kastor を実装してみたので紹介します。
※2009-06-27 追記：ソースコードをgithubに置いてみました：http://github.com/frsyuki/kastor/tree/master
概要 Kastorは写真などの少し大きめのデータで、一度保存したらほとんど更新も削除もしないデータを大量に扱うのに適したkey-valueストレージです。HTTP
の GET と PUT を使って読み書きができます。 なお品質はα版以前で、使い物にはならないので注意してください ^^ ; ) レプリケーションやcompactionなどの超重要な機能も実装されていません。
主に現在開発中のクラスタアプリケーションを書くためのフレームワーク（ccf ; Cluster Communication Framework）の使い勝手を評価するために開発しました。
Kastorのアーキテクチャ Kastorは実際にデータを保存していくベクタストレージと、ベクタストレージの中のどこにデータが保存されているかを示すインデックスの2つでストレージを構成します。
インデックスはできるだけ小さくし、すべてメモリに載るようにします。
データを保存するときは、まずベクタストレージにデータ本体を「追記」し、その書き込んだオフセットとサイズをインデックスに書き込みます。
読み込むときはインデックスを参照してオフセットとサイズを取得します。
削除はできません ^^ ; )
I/O戦略にはWavyアーキテクチャを採用しています。
Kastorの特徴 Kastorの実装はできるだけコピーをしないようになっている点と、ロック･フリーで並列性が高い点が特徴です。 Kastorのストレージには次の4つのAPIがあります： block* balloc( size ) ; void bfree ( block * ) ; void update ( key , block * ) ; block * search ( key ) ; block にはオフセットとサイズ（とファイルディスクリプタ）が入っています。
データを書き込む手順は次のようになります： ベクタストレージの末尾にデータを領域を確保する（balloc） 確保した領域をmmap ( 2 ) する mmapした領域に向かってクライアントからデータを受け取る インデックスを書き換える（update） balloc() の操作はほとんどの場合「ここまで使用済みだよ」という変数を（アトミックに）増やすだけなので、瞬時に終わります。
こうして確保した領域に、クライアントから受け取ったデータを直接書き込んでいきます。これでブロックができあがったので、最後にupdate()操作でインデックスを書き換えて、keyが指す先を（アトミックに）張り替えるというわけです。
一方、データを読み込む手順はこうなります： 要求されたkey に対応するブロックを得る（search） クライアントにsendfile ( 2 ) する search ( ) の操作はインデックスからkey を探し出すだけで、実際にデータを読み込んだりはしません（事実blockにバッファは入っていません）
クライアントにデータを送るときはsendfile(2)システムコールを使って、カーネル空間から直接ソケットにデータを送信します。
普通にread(2) してwrite(2)する方法と比べると↓このような違いがあります。
mmap(2 ) やsendfile(2)を使う方法は、read(2)してwrite(2)する方法よりもコピーの回数が減っていることが分かります。
ベンチマークテストしていないので全然ダメなのですが、たぶんおそらく速いハズです ^^ ;)
After all the recent bad news , the Republicans must be feeling a bit defensive and embattled .
Because they are trying really hard to create a scandal for Obama , which they are even helpfully calling “ Carbongate “ .
The story started with a report authored by EPA analyst Alan Carlin that questioned the impact of carbon dioxide on global warming .
The “ scandal ” is that the EPA did not incorporate his report into the official EPA finding , and suggested Carlin stop working on climate change .
Senator James Inhofe ( R - Okla ) ordered an investigation , saying “ We ’re going to expose it . ”
Not waiting for the investigation , Inhofe announced his own results : “ He came out with the truth .
They do n’t want the truth at the EPA . ”
And Representative Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) proclaims “ just as Nixon had Watergate , Obama now has Carbongate to deal with . ”
However , conservatives are again showing that they do n’t really understand irony ( either that , or they just figure if they repeat something often enough , that the media will pick it up and people might start to believe it ) .
The problem ?
Well , there are multiple problems :
First , the report itself is bad .
Seriously , citing - astrologers - to - support - their - claims bad .
Never mind that Carlin is not a climate scientist ( he ’s an economist ) .
And he collaborated with the leader of the “ Friends of Science ” — an astroturf anti-climate - science lobbying group .
Second , the government has been trying to ignore Carlin ’s reports since long before Obama took office .
According to Carlin , “ To the best of my knowledge , the Bush administration never followed up on my ideas . ”
So how could this possibly be a scandal for Obama ?
And how bad does your report have to be if even the Bush administration — who desperately wanted to discredit climate change — ignored you ?
Carbongate ?
What is it with Republicans using the “ gate ” suffix for political scandals ?
Are they purposely reminding us of Watergate ?
I did n’t see any Democrats talking about “ Argentina - gate ” .
This is worse than the Republicans recently bringing up Katrina as an example of how government is incompetent .
And what kind of chutzpah does it take for Republicans to accuse Obama of ignoring science ?
During the Bush administration , 60 % of the EPA staff scientists who responded to a survey reported they had experienced incidents of political interference with their work .
These are the same wing - nuts who do n’t believe in evolution .
If the Republicans are trying to be ironic by pointing out an example of Obama ignoring science , then they picked a very bad example , since it only points out their own hypocrisy .
The lawsuit by Rosetta Stone was the ninth keyword trademark suit brought against Google .
It seems that suing Google has become new pastime for Google 's critics and competitors .
There has been lot heard about Anti-trust cases against Google across the globe which include strict observation by the U.S. Government , Chinese Govt .'s red eyes on Google over porn search results and many other such cases .
The most recent is one from Rosetta Stone .
Rosetta
Stone is a language - learning firm which has recently filed a lawsuit in the U.S. federal court against Google , claiming that the company is infringing on its trademarks .
Rosetta Stone has put allegations that Google allows third parties including individuals involved in software piracy to purchase the right to use Rosetta Stone trademarks or other terms confusingly similar in Google 's Adwords advertising program .
In June 2009 , Google changed its policy stating that " advertisers will be allowed to use trademark terms in their ad text even if they do not own that trademark or have explicit approval from the trademark owner to use it .
" " Google 's search engine is helping third parties mislead consumers and misappropriate Rosetta Stone trademarks by using them astriggers for paid advertisements and by using them within the text or title of paid advertisements , " said Michael Wu , general counsel , Rosetta Stone .
The mystery project that John Carmack has hinted at over the last few months is expected to hit the iPhone app store later this month : Doom Resurrection , a 3 - D re-imagining of the original Doom .
In fact , the monsters in the new iPhone game ( no price set ) may look a bit familiar to Doom 3 , which refashioned the Doom story on PCs and the Xbox in 2004 and 2005 .
" We have actually been able to re-purpose a lot of the Doom 3 media , " says John Carmack , technical director and co-founder of id Software .
" That has sort of been our contribution to all this , taking all of what was a $ 10 - to - $ 15 million game development not too long ago and be able to ( bring the ) art assets , all the textures , the models and the audio and bring it onto the iPhone with really fairly minimal conversion . "
Carmack and the co-developers at Dallas - based Escalation Studios reserved the right to " can " the new game if its twists on the first - person shooter for iPhones did not work out to their satisfaction .
" It almost did n’t .
Our original design on how you would be tapping on the monsters to shoot at them turned out to be not much fun .
We were close to pulling the plug on it , " Carmack says .
" At that point , Escalation did a new interface for aiming the gun .
Instead of tapping on the screen where you wanted to shoot , you tilt around like you are kind of moving ... the reticule around to shoot at the monsters .
It 's interesting how just a change like that makes all the difference in the world and that it actually turns it into a fun game . "
Escalation managing director Tom Mustaine added that " obviously , we wanted this to look really good and that was achieved early on .
We wanted to capture that visceral feel that you get from a traditional Doom experience .
We modified the shooting mechanic to be something that no one else has done on the platform yet .
We are treading a path for people , I think , on the platform to build other games that have this kind of control dynamic . "
Players use " a contextually aware on - screen display button , " he says , that pop up , for instance , " when a fireball is coming at you , it flashes a ' Dodge ' mechanic and you tap ' Dodge ' and with the right timing it will move you out of the way .
So it still feels like you are getting that moment - to - moment experience .
And when guys come and shoot machine guns at you and you have to dodge behind a box and take cover , you tap on ' Cover ' and you move in and out of cover .
So we have got really a distilled experience of a full - on , PC - console gaming experience put onto the iPhone . "
Also due to be released soon is Wolfenstein RPG for EA Mobile and Doom Classic , perhaps next month .
" There may be some confusion with Doom Resurrection , which is brand - new , modern - crafted experience stuff and Doom Classic , which is all the old Doom stuff running in this great new environment ( the iPhone and iPod Touch ) , " Carmack says .
" I do worry about some confusion , but well , that ’s just the way things work out . "

Banks are quietly changing the terms of millions of credit card accounts as they brace for a tough new law that will limit rate hikes .
The law would restrict interest rate increases unless a credit card has a variable rate .
So at least two major lenders are switching their cards with fixed rates to -- you guessed it -- variable rates .
“ It ’s completely unfair , ” said Linda Sherry , a spokeswoman for Consumer Action .
“ It ’s an end run around the intent of the new law . ”
That law is the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , which President Obama affixed with his signature in May .
Its various provisions will be phased in between next month and February .

Congress passed the law to curb what politicians called abuses of cardholders by lenders , including runaway interest rates and constantly changing terms .
In response , banks have scrambled in recent weeks to make changes to their card offerings before the new rules take effect .
I wrote last week about how JPMorgan Chase is increasing its monthly minimum payment to 5 % from 2 % of the balance for about 1 million cardholders .
Now comes the looming demise of fixed - rate accounts .
Los Angeles resident Victoria Afonina received a letter from Bank of America the other day informing her that “ as a result of a change in our business practices , your annual percentage rate will use a variable rate formula based on the U.S. prime rate . ”
Advertisement
“ If the prime rate changes , ” it said , “ your APR will vary accordingly . ”
Afonina , 44 , told me she had to read the letter several times to understand what BofA was saying .
She said she ’d been a cardholder with the bank for about five years and had enjoyed a relatively low fixed rate of 9.9 % any time she carried a balance .
“ When I finally understood what they were saying , and that my rate could change every month , I was shocked , ” Afonina said .
“ I ’m a good customer .
Why are they treating me like that ? ”
Advertisement
Good question .
“ The change from fixed to variable rates allows us to better manage our business as market conditions change , ” said Betty Riess , a BofA spokeswoman .
And those new federal rules .
. . ?
“ Legislative and regulatory changes that limit our ability to re-price for risk were a factor in our decision , ” Riess acknowledged .

Under the new variable - rate formula , BofA cardholders wo n’t experience a rate increase when the change is made next month .
In Afonina ’s case , her current 9.9 % rate means the bank will initially charge a variable rate of 6.65 percentage points above the current prime rate of 3.25 % , keeping her at 9.9 % at least for August .
After that , watch out .
Chase is also swapping variable rates for cardholders ’ fixed rates .

Stephanie Jacobson , a Chase spokeswoman , confirmed that many cardholders were recently notified about the switch , but she declined to provide any details .
“ Changing costs are requiring Chase to more closely examine the rates and terms we offer our customers , ” she said .
“ Variable rates reflect Chase ’s changing costs for funding credit card loans . ”
Jacobson noted that “ customers may benefit from lower rates when the costs to Chase are decreased . ”
The problem with that notion is that those costs can only go up .

Short - term interest rates are at historically low levels .
The Federal Reserve ’s Federal Funds Target Rate , which is used by most banks as the benchmark for the prime rate , is now around 0.25 % .
Banks typically tack 3 percentage points to the Fed ’s target rate , which is how we get the current prime rate of 3.25 % .
As recently as August 2007 , however , the Fed Funds Target Rate was 5.25 % , which placed the prime rate above 8 % .
Under BofA ’s new formula , that would give cardholders like Afonina an interest rate of at least 15 % for purchase balances and a hefty 30 % for cash advances .
Representatives of Wells Fargo , Citibank and American Express said each company had no plans at the moment to change fixed - rate accounts to variable accounts .
But they did n’t rule it out down the road .

“ At present we ’re not doing it , ” said Marina Hoffmann , an AmEx spokeswoman .
“ We do n’t talk about changes we may or may not do in the future . ”
Banking industry insiders say the days of fixed - rate accounts are numbered because of the new requirements imposed by Congress .
For decades , banks have enjoyed being able to change rates and other conditions at any time for any reason .
Now they ’ll have to work within strict guidelines and give 45 days ’ notice of any changes .
Among other rules , the new law requires that banks leave interest rates alone for the first year after a card is issued .
The exception is if the card comes with a variable rate .

The law also prevents banks from raising rates on existing balances .
That rule wo n’t apply if you ’re already under a variable rate before the law takes effect .
Riess said BofA is n’t entirely doing away with fixed rates .
They will still be offered for many new accounts .
Of course , such teaser rates can and typically do disappear when the promotional period ends .
Do n’t be surprised if you , like Afonina , then receive a letter saying your fixed - rate account will now fall under a variable rate .
Can you say bait and switch ?

The Freedom of Being Your Own Boss
Looking at being self employed from the standard point of view it can be interpreted as : “ work yourself and do it steadily ” .
This is an idea which does n’t appeal to lots of people .
It is the general idea , that being self employed means that unless you work all the time your income will not be there and what ’s even worse you have the option of 24 hours per day or of having employees with all the resulting liabilities .
Especially in societies with a high level of social security , where unemployment benefits are a standard , the idea of being employed spreads security some way or other .
People think that even if out of work they will have at least some money to keep them going .
In contrast self employed people are considered to be working without a safety grid .
As we are what we think it is small wonder that people have somewhat lost their dreams in the process or they have become so remote that they only reside in some far away fairy tale .
The habit to adjust to what ever income they have has become a plague – and we all know , plagues are destructive .
They are destructive to the inflicted person as well as to the society where the plague strikes .
Now let us discuss the freedom of being your own boss .
In a solid MLM business , where all the required features are top notch you all of a sudden have the chance to actually build a business .
This means you stop exchanging your time for money , the key factor which keeps you in the rat race in conventional business .
In MLM it is the top requirement that first of all you build yourself and only then you build a team , you support your team , you build your customer base and provide service to them and you learn step by step how to become proficient in this new environment .
What does it mean to build yourself .
As stated at the beginning of this contribution , it is inherent in our society that people tend to loose their dreams .
So building yourself means recapturing your dreams , learning to create a vision and ultimately a goal which will become the fuel for your activities .
When acting from a burning desire to achieve your goal , all your activities of building your team by building the people you work with are fruitful .
It is wonderful to watch people evolve , give them the support they require and to have great life time friendships develop .
What do you think ?
A residual income will be the bye product of building your business , which will give you the freedom to live the life of your dreams .
Come and join the ride !

Roxana Saberi has been studying and working in Iran for six years
An Iranian - American journalist branded a US spy has been jailed for eight years by Iran after a brief trial held behind closed doors .
Roxana Saberi , 31 , who was arrested in January and went on trial this week , denies the charge and plans to go on hunger strike , her father said .
Ms Saberi has reported for a number of foreign news organisations including the BBC , NPR radio and Fox News .
A spokesman said the US president was " deeply disappointed " at the outcome .
The journalist originally faced the less serious accusation of buying alcohol , and later of working as a journalist without a valid press card .
Then , in a period of fewer than two weeks , the charge of spying was introduced , and she was tried by the Revolutionary Court and sentenced .
No evidence of espionage was made public .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
An unnamed judiciary official told the Iranian news agency Isna : " Branch 28 of the Revolutionary Court sentenced Roxana Saberi to eight years for espionage .
She can appeal the sentence . "
Ms Saberi 's lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi and her father confirmed that an appeal would be made .
The case is bound to have serious implications for relations between Iran and the US at a time when President Barack Obama has been reaching out to the Islamic Republic , the BBC's Jon Leyne reports from Tehran .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was " deeply disappointed " by the verdict .
Washington , which has no diplomatic ties with Iran , was working with Swiss diplomats in Tehran to obtain details about the court 's decision and ensure Ms Saberi 's well - being , she said .
" We will continue to vigorously raise our concerns to the Iranian government , " she added .
' Coerced and deceived ' Reza Saberi told NPR radio that his daughter was " weak and frail " , and that interrogators had used undue pressure against his daughter to procure statements that were later used against her in court .
Ms Saberi 's father ( left ) and lawyer say they are appealing Her later repudiation of these statements was not considered by the court , he said .
His daughter was , he said , " not only coerced but deceived " .
" They told her that if she says [ something ] like this , they will free her , and then they did n't free her .
Later she found out that it was a trick . "
Mr Saberi said his daughter was " quite depressed " and wanted to go on hunger strike but he was trying to persuade her against doing so .
Roxana was tried in secret and no evidence of espionage has been made public
BBC Press Office
Profile : Roxana Saberi Case tests Obama 's Iran agenda Mr Saberi , who was not allowed to attend the trial , said his daughter 's lawyer had not been allowed to argue the case for the defence properly .
Expressing his dismay at the verdict , he added that he had been hoping for a sentence of six months and clemency .
" We are extremely concerned at the severe sentence passed on Roxana Saberi , " the BBC Press Office said .
" Roxana was tried in secret and no evidence of espionage has been made public .
Roxana 's many friends in the BBC are saddened by the decision and are thinking of Roxana and her family at this difficult time . "
NPR 's chief executive , Vivian Schiller , said : " We are deeply distressed by this harsh and unwarranted sentence . "
This is a very tough sentence , even for the serious charge of spying , our correspondent says .
Iran 's authorities have not even given details of the charges against her , he notes .
US unease
The conviction was criticised by the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists , which said her trial had " lacked transparency " .
" We call on the Iranian authorities to release her on bail pending her appeal , " said Mohamed Abdel Dayem , the group 's Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator .
Public awareness of Ms Saberi 's situation is low in Iran , where local media do not seem to have reported her arrest or trial in any way , our correspondent says .
A US - Iranian national , Ms Saberi has spent six years in Iran studying and writing a book .
The daughter of an Iranian father and a Japanese mother , she was once crowned Miss North Dakota and was among the top 10 finalists in Miss America 1998 .
She holds two master 's degrees , from Northwestern University in the US and from Cambridge University in the UK .

Stephon Marbury has received a lot of criticism from the press during his career .
Over the weekend , Marbury took to the internet for a 24 - hour live video session to set the record straight .
In what can only be described as a level - headed display of sanity and poise , Marbury took questions from fans and calmly reminisced on his career .
Just kidding .
In reality , Marbury 's Internet streaming session was anything but sane .
Rather , it resembled something out of Dostoyevsky -- a fragmented interior monologue of a basketball player teetering on the edge of insanity .
And it all had very little to do with basketball .
" Do I believe in aliens ? " Marbury responded to viewers at one point .
" I do n't know , because I 've never seen one .
But I believe in Jesus because I saw him in the shower the other day . "
Marbury 's streaming stream of consciousness covered just about everything , from music to current events .
" Michael Jackson ?
I wanted to meet him .
I still want to meet him .
One day I will meet Michael Jackson , " said a wild - eyed Marbury .
At times , Marbury appeared manic , dancing around his house listening to Lupe Fiasco and singing along with Keri Hilson .
At other times , Marbury appeared more stoic .
He burst into tears while playing Kirk Franklin 's " Lean On Me " .
Late - night viewers of the Marbury show were rewarded with a secret family remedy for sore throats .
" My little brother ... he told me that his grandmother , who 's almost 100 years old , told him that when you can't get your voice back , take some Vaseline and swallow it and it will help you , " advised Marbury , before providing fans with a demonstration .
Marbury 's career as a basketball player may be waning , but his television career is only beginning .

Welcome to the world of physicist , molecular biologist , and “ scientist of conscience ” Leo Szilard ( 1898 - 1964 ) .
Szilard conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933 , and spent the rest of his life trying to protect the world from nuclear weapons .
Szilard ’s other inventions included the linear accelerator , cyclotron , and electron microscope .
In his 1929 paper on Maxwell ’s Demon , Szilard identified the unit or “ bit ” of information .
The rise of the Information Age shows the importance of his long - unappreciated idea .
Szilard ’s name can be pronounced in different ways .
In Hungary , it is pronounced SEE - lahrd .
English speakers usually pronounce it as ZIL - ahrd or zuh - LAHRD .
His name is pronounced by several people who knew him in the videos below .
January 26 , 2015 .
I ’m pleased to announce the publication of an article that I think may be remembered as long as the story of the nuclear age is told ...

Free Troy Davis !
Stop the execution !
Worldwide actions protest frame - up
( lead article )
Amnesty International USA Southern Regional Director Jared Feuer reported that actions took place in 28 countries .
Davis , who is Black , was arrested in 1989 and convicted in 1991 for the killing of Mark MacPhail , a white police officer in Savannah , Georgia .
Rallies , protests , and an international campaign on his behalf have resulted in Daviss three previous execution dates being postponed .
On April 16 the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals denied his appeal for a new trial .
Daviss attorneys are asking Chatham Countys district attorney to hold off issuing a death warrant in order to allow Davis to exhaust an appeal to the Supreme Court .
Martina Correia , a sister of Davis and a leader of the defense campaign , urged his supporters to continue the fight .
 The Troy Davis case opens a window into the old 
South ,  she said in thanking those in attendance .
 We re not weak , we re not silent !
Keep standing , talking , fighting !
Troy Davis called in by phone to thank his supporters and to urge them to keep up the fight .
The size and prominent participants in the rally reflected the growing support for Daviss fight .
The rally was chaired by Lorraine Jacques White , a popular local radio host .
Rev. Charles
White , national field director of the NAACP , and Edward Dubose , Georgia State NAACP Conference president , were among the speakers .
Rev. Raphael Warnock , senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church , spoke , demanding that Georgia governor Sonny Perdue use his influence to stop the injustice against Davis .
Sara Totonchi , chair of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty , pointed out that of the 100 people on death row in Georgia , 7 have been exonerated based on faulty eyewitness testimony .
Seven of the nine prosecution witnesses who claimed to have seen Davis shoot MacPhail have since recanted or contradicted their stories , with several saying they were pressured by the cops to finger Davis .
No weapon was found nor any physical evidence produced connecting Davis to the shooting .
Juan Melendez , originally from Puerto Rico , spent 18 years on Floridas death row before being exonerated .
 An innocent man can never be released from the grave ,  Melendez said , speaking at the rally .
He urged that Troy Davis be given the opportunity to prove his innocence .
People of all ages participated in the rally .
GSU sophomore Bethany Wright said she was appalled by the appeals court denial of Daviss right to fight for his life . 
Kimberly Hicks said she joined in the rally to support Davis because of  the inept representation at his trial and new information that might exonerate him .
I think that the state has an obligation to hear new evidence .
If they re not willing to do that , whos next ? 
Others participating in the rally program included Georgia state senators Vincent Fort and Nan Orrock .
Rachele Fruit contributed to this article .
*****
Lawrence Hayes , a former death row prisoner who was paroled in 1991 , demanded that Davis be granted clemency or given a pardon . 
There were also speakers from the NAACP , National Conference of Black Lawyers , National Lawyers Guild , and National Action Network .
Yusef Salaam , falsely convicted of rape in the 1989 Central Park jogger case when he was a teenager , spoke , demanding Davis be freed .
The convictions of Salaam and four others were overturned in 2002 .
Eunice Kim , a 16 - year - old high school student from Long Island , came to the rally with a classmate .
 This case is not just about Troy Davis , its about human rights ,  she said .
 Our own rights are only guaranteed when everyones rights are guaranteed . 
 There s a lot of e-mail campaigns for Troy going on and that s OK ,  she said .
 But what s really important is to come out and protest with other people . 
Zack Moh , 18 , a student at LaGuardia College , learned about Troy Davis for the first time at the rally .
 Ive never been a big fan of the police ,  Moh said , and then to hear how the witnesses were pressured by the cops to testify against Troy Davis , that s crazy .
His case deserves to be heard by the Supreme Court . 
*****
 Today , a young man faces the same situation , and there are others on death row like him .
Thats why we must commit to the fight to end the death penalty ,  Shelton said .
Students from area campuses , political activists , and others filled the meeting room at the All Souls Unitarian Church .
Other speakers included exonerated death row prisoner Shujaa Graham , U.S. representative Hank Johnson of Georgia , and Amnesty International executive director Larry Cox .

Another day , another new search engine makes the rounds .
This time , it 's an image - based search engine called TinEye , which has recently been opened up to the public in beta form .
TinEye claims to do for images what Google does for text , which is to find web pages containing a specific image that you supply .
This may not seem very useful for the average person upon first blush — after all , you have to already have a copy of the image in order to search for it — but could prove helpful to photographers and those who want to monitor the use of their work across the Internet .
According to the TinEye FAQ , the search engine uses " sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms " to analyze an image pixel - by - pixel , and creates a fingerprint from it .
From there , it searches across the web for other images that are similar to your image 's fingerprint , and can even identify images that have been cropped , watermarked , or altered ( to some degree ) .
In order to search , you must either upload an image or point the engine to a URL of one .
You can also use a browser bookmarklet or extension , which will let you hit a button any time you want to use TinEye to search for other images like the ones on the page you 're looking at .
We took TinEye for a spin to see exactly how it worked and whether it was accurate in searching for the images we chose .
Our first complaint is that TinEye requires you to register an account before using the site .
No other search engines require this , which makes that step particularly obnoxious — but then again , TinEye is n't like other search engines .
Indeed , we tried to upload random personal photos of things that were n't likely to be duplicated anywhere else across the web , just to see what would happen : a chinchilla , cats , shoes , an old iPod , sea lions in San Francisco , homemade paella ... not a single one turned up any results , and that 's not surprising .
You 're not supposed to use TinEye to casually search for things like you would on Google .
When it comes to matching up images that could be posted on other parts of the web , however , TinEye excels .
I tried uploading the full , uncropped image of myself used in my author profile here on Ars , and it was able to find the correct author page in a fraction of a second .
( Unfortunately , that photo was not posted anywhere else — the world will never know about my awesome glasses ! )
However , there 's one photo of mine that I have seen gratuitously ripped off across the web for years now : a scratched - up first - gen iPod nano that we had destroyed for the original iPod nano review .
I uploaded that puppy into TinEye , which spit out seven results .
Here are just a couple ( sorry , could n't fit them all on one page for a screenshot ) :
Hey Pink Insurance , feel like paying for that photo you jacked ?
Through TinEye , we have already found at least one new site that is using one of our images for commercial purposes without permission !
However , these seven websites are n't the only ones that have reposted our image — trust us , we know .
TinEye defends itself by saying that the number of pages and images it has indexed is still relatively small at 702 million pages .
TinEye CEO Leila Boujnane points out that the site is n't just limited to hunting out copyright violators ; it can help find the origin of an image too .
" It 's being used by researchers who need to find where an image came from to provide attribution , even people who are trying to find out who people are in old photos , " Boujnane told PC Pro .
" We had somebody who had a photograph of a soldier who'd arrived on the beach at Normandy and they could n't find their name .
They did a whole bunch of searches on TinEye and found a tiny little photo on an American website that listed everybody who'd gone to Normandy with a photograph .
That 's exactly when TinEye is useful , when you have an image but no words . "
Overall , we liked TinEye .
Our opinion of the site transformed from skeptical to impressed as we used it more and more .
It 's obviously not meant for casual web browsing or finding out what that crazy animal you saw on the side of the road is .
However , if you are trying to keep track of how your creations are used across the web , or you saw an image and want to find out where it came from , TinEye is incredibly useful .
As it continues to index more pages — the company claims it 's already indexing hundreds of millions more per month — TinEye could eventually turn into a popular tool .
COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( CNN ) --
After nearly four hours of deliberation and multiple rounds of balloting , the South Carolina Republican Party voted Monday night to censure Mark Sanford for traveling overseas to visit his mistress -- but stopped short of calling on the governor to resign .
The South Carolina Republican Party voted Monday night to censure Gov. Mark Sanford .
Members of the South Carolina GOP 's executive committee approved a resolution censuring Sanford for conduct that demonstrated " repeated failures to act in accordance " with the party 's core principles and beliefs , according to GOP sources on the teleconference .
The resolution also reprimands the governor for " falling below the standards expected of Republican elected officials . "
Sanford issued a short response to the censure through his spokesman late Monday .
" The governor fully appreciates the party 's position , and he intends to work diligently to earn back its trust , " said spokesman Joel Sawyer .
Although the resolution says Sanford " breached the public 's trust and confidence in his ability to effectively perform the duties of his office , " it does not explicitly ask him to step down .
No sitting governor had previously been censured by the South Carolina Republican Party .
" We must hold true to our core beliefs and recommit to being Republican now more than ever before , " party Chairwoman Karen Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the vote .
" And now is the time for healing for our great state . "
The decision was made on a lengthy conference call that was organized for party members to discuss how to respond to the Sanford saga , which has consumed the South Carolina political world for two weeks .
The call at times featured heated debate among party activists on all sides of the Sanford issue .
Some wanted the party to demand Sanford 's resignation , while others supported the lesser penalty of censure .
There also were party members who opposed taking any action against the governor .
It took four ballots before the resolution was approved by majority vote .
Despite the differences of opinion , the party voted to " speak with one voice " about Sanford 's behavior .
" We had a good healthy discussion about what our role is as a party is , versus our personal feelings , versus what the party platform says , " said Kristin Maguire , executive committee member from Pickens County .
" Not easy stuff . "
It 's difficult to tell whether the resolution will influence the governor , who continues to resist calls for him to step aside , including those from members of his party .
One Republican official who spoke to Sanford on Monday told CNN that the governor dismissed resigning , calling it " the easy way out . "

There are nearly 30,000 city blocks in Los Angeles , and over the last several weeks , my colleague Maloy Moore and I have examined them all .
We ’ve considered each one ’s size and population density , its racial and ethnic makeup , its proximity to landmarks , its topography and history .
Then we listened to what readers told us about the deeply rooted perceptions that make them see a block as belonging in one community instead of another .
All this was in service of a project that The Times began months ago to map the city of Los Angeles and make it possible for us to give people neighborhood - by - neighborhood news and information .
Advertisement
In February , we posted a first draft of the map on latimes.com , inviting users to send us comments .
We received more than 1,500 .
Today , we ’re posting an updated map , revised in nearly 100 ways .
When we unveiled our first map , we were prepared for criticism , and it came .
But we were astonished by the variety and eloquence of the responses .
Our correspondents poured out feelings about where they lived , recalled historical tidbits that may otherwise have been forever lost and presented us the challenge of compelling , often contradictory and always passionate arguments .
From the idyllic ( “ Nice people , close to the mountains , lots of stars at night ” ) to the noir ( “ My neighborhood is a filth strewn pit of garbage no matter what its name . . . ” ) their comments showed that Angelenos care intensely about their own corners of the city and wield a rich and often sardonic language of place identity : “ It sucks when a friend moves south of Wilshire and you can no longer joke about that area , for fear of hurting their feelings .
I am a snob . ”
The comments reinforced what we knew from years of living in and reporting about Los Angeles : Complicated issues of race , class and social status -- not to mention the always popular matter of real estate prices -- often are bound up with the names that people use for their communities .
Advertisement
In some cases , the first public draft of our map contained obvious mistakes .
Many were brought to our attention by livid readers .
“ Who knew that Eagle Rock High School is in Highland Park . . . ?
Yeah , right ! ” wrote one .
I certainly knew better .
Back in the 1960s , I ran track for Franklin High School in Highland Park and knew that the ridgeline separated our territory from rival Eagle Rock ’s .
The fix :
We moved 32 blocks on the map from a Highland Park census tract to Eagle Rock .
In many cases , readers strongly disagreed with each other .
Some thought a boundary was too far to the east , others said it was too far west .
Some of those disputes could be resolved with census data .
So , when readers debated whether Koreatown should end at Western Avenue or Wilton Place , our block - by - block map of the percentage of Asian residents convinced us that Wilton was where to draw the line .
Advertisement
But not even block - by - block data could make the map meet everyone ’s criteria .
My late father , Jack Smith , had an occasional correspondent named Julian P. Donohue , a lepidopterist .
I knew enough to pay attention when Donohue questioned the line we drew between Mount Washington and Highland Park .
“ The northeast boundary of Mount Washington is not Avenue 50 , but the base of the hill more or less at the 600 - foot contour , ” he wrote .
Alas , although we agreed , we could n’t oblige :
The blocks fronting Avenue 50 extend halfway up the hill to Moon Drive and Crane Avenue , and for purposes of analyzing data , a census block is indivisible .
Advertisement
Our toughest decisions came from the powerful and often irreconcilable associations people make with names and places .
Among the bitter rifts we encountered were the competing claims to the name West Adams .
One of the less fraught comments on the subject went like this : “ Over here by Adams and Fairfax we like to think of ourselves as West ‘ West Adams . ’ how about West ( squared ) Adams ?
OK then , the ‘ real ’ West Adams ?
Never mind , just trying to lighten the conversation . ”
Historical purists would reserve the designation West Adams for the once - upper - crust district of Victorian mansions now falling in the shadow of USC .
But residents farther west have appropriated the name for that hard - to - define area between the 10 Freeway and Baldwin Hills .
To bolster their case , the area ’s Neighborhood Empowerment Zone bears that name .
The discussion has taken on powerful emotional content in recent years as part of a larger debate over gentrification and changing demographics in that part of the city .
We resolved the argument as best we could , using the West Adams label for the region west of Crenshaw Boulevard and including the old mansions east of Vermont Avenue as part of University Park .
The city government , itself , is seldom eager to dive into such debates .
The blue signs that the city posts somewhat indiscriminately on thoroughfares give neighborhood labels , but not boundaries .
Advertisement
The Thomas Guide puts names in the midst of communities but does not try to make clear where neighborhood boundaries are .
The city ’s neighborhood councils sometimes reflect narrow political considerations and have a propensity for names such as People Involved in Community Organizing that do n’t do much to define a community .
Many areas of the city are left out entirely while prized turf , such as Occidental College , is occasionally claimed by more than one council .
The same problems apply with even greater force to homeowner associations .
ZIP Codes provide many people with a community identity , but are designed only to speed the mail .
That ’s a nice fit in some places but unworkable in others , such as the part of Los Angeles that falls in Beverly Hills 90210 .
There are four ZIP Codes each for Van Nuys and North Hollywood , making both too expansive .
Unlike most other attempts at Mapping L.A. , this one follows a set of principles intended to make it visually and statistically coherent :
It gathers every block of the city into reasonably compact areas leaving no enclaves , gaps , overlaps or ambiguities .
Except when there was a compelling reason not to , we kept landmarks such as schools in the communities bearing their names .
Advertisement
We ’ll be the first to acknowledge that our map is n’t perfect .
No lines can capture the geographic diversity and demographic energy of Los Angeles .
We ’re not planning to revise our map again until the 2010 census .
But our comment line is still open .
If you have a better idea , let us know .

The woman , Huang Cuilian , told the state news media that she screamed and ran off when the men stamped their feet in a threatening manner .
When Ms. Huang , accompanied by factory guards , returned to confront the men , the standoff quickly escalated .

The Uighur workers have since been sequestered at an industrial park not far from the toy factory .
Officials refused to allow a reporter access to the workers , and a large contingent of police officers blocked the hospital rooms where two dozen others were recovering from their wounds .
“ They want to lead a peaceful life and not be bothered by the media , ” said Mr. Chen , the Shaoguan official .
He said the government of Guangdong Province , where Shaoguan is located , and the factory would provide them employment at a separate plant .
Officials at Early Light , a Hong Kong company that is the largest toy maker in the world , declined to comment .
In the city of Kashgar , the ancient heart of Uighur civilization , the Shaoguan killings have inflamed longstanding anger over the way China manages daily life in Xinjiang .
Many Uighurs complain about policies that encourage Han migration to the region and say the government suppresses Uighurs ’ language and religion .
When it comes to employment , they say coveted state jobs go to the Han ; a 2008 report by a United States Congressional commission noted that government job Web sites in Xinjiang set aside most teaching and civil service positions for non-Uighurs .
“ If we were n’t so poor , our children would n’t have to take work so far from home , ” said Akhdar , a 67 - year - old man who , like many others interviewed , refused to give his full name for fear of reprisals from the authorities .
The Uighurs who work at the Shaoguan toy factory , all of them from Shufu County outside Kashgar , are part of a growing wave of 1.5 million people who have migrated from Xinjiang to more prosperous cities of coastal China .
This year , more than 6,700 young men and women left Shufu County , according to government figures , part of an ambitious jobs export program intended to relieve high youth unemployment and provide low - cost workers to factories .

ITALIAN car maker Fiat has unveiled plans to take over Vaxuhall , insisting the British - made cars are still not quite rusty and unreliable enough .
Fiat wants to buy General Motors ' UK and German brands to a create a new pan-European third - rate car giant to compete with the likes of Volkswagen in its dreams .
A Fiat spokesman said : " If you kick a Vauxhall Astra only the rear bumper falls off , while the Corsa does not have the same all - over , reddish - brown hue of a typical Italian hatchback .
" On the other hand , if you so much as cough near the new Fiat Punto , both the bumpers literally fly off in opposite directions , the doors drop off their hinges and the headlights fall out like some kind of clown car .
And then it explodes . "
He added : " Under our plans Vauxhall will produce a range of exciting , eco-friendly cars that may not get you to the end of the street but will provide a useful storage space for people who do n't have attics . "
British brands have an impressive history when it comes to foreign takeovers .
In 1994 BMW bought Rover , before offloading it six years later as if it was emptying a chamber pot into a gutter .
Fiat pointed to its strong track record in rescuing troubled manufacturers .
Alfa Romeo now makes stylish cars that are bought by discerning drivers who appreciate good design but have no desire to go anywhere , while Lancia has not sold a new car since 1977 .
Meanwhile
Fiat is also hoping to acquire the US giant Chrysler with a view to integrating its staggeringly unsuccessful technology and useless design know - how into its inexplicable strategy .
Katrina Burgess , 17 , was told by doctors she may never walk again after surviving a 70 mph car crash with a broken neck and back , and a catalogue of other injuries .
But after being put back together with 11 metal rods and enough pins and screws to send an airport security detector into overdrive , Katrina was signed up by a modeling agency .
Surgeons saved her life after her car left the M5 and crashed into a ditch as she travelled towards her home town of Weymouth , Dorset .
She snapped her back , punctured both lungs and broke her neck , her pelvis , her left leg and several ribs .
Surgeons at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton , Somerset , said that without surgery to help the bones to fuse , her spinal injuries in particular could deteriorate , risking death .
Doctors inserted a rod from her hip to her knee in her left leg the day after she was admitted to hospital .
It was secured inside with four titanium pins .
The most risky operation came a week later .
They sliced open her back and inserted six more horizontal rods up the length of her back to support her spine .
A week after that , they inserted a titanium screw to the top of her spine to support the break in her fragile neck .
Only a day after the last operation she was able to take her first steps .
Astonishingly , five months on from the crash , the teenager has recovered to the point where she no longer even needs painkillers .
The Air France accident is tragic and its disturbing that they know so little of what happened .
We ’re in 2009 and they ca n’t do better than this to recover data – tragic .
I was a bit curious of why they suddenly started to chance airspeed indicators or Pitot Tubes as they call them so I searched a bit .
Then I found this ; AirBus recommended last year to change the tubes .
Is Air France trying to cover up the lack of actions ?
Give it up already Giz .
We all see you found a few unfavorable things about the phone .
Good god , I 've read the WSJ , Engadget , and Boy Genius reviews and no one else brings this " sharp edge " up .
They do bring up plenty of other very cool things about the phone you failed to mention .
Is it because the Pre is better than your " holy " iPhone that you must pick at its very few and minor flaws ?
( CNN ) -- Eleven members of Greenpeace pleaded not guilty to federal charges after they were arrested for hanging a banner on South Dakota 's Mount Rushmore Wednesday to protest global warming as the G - 8 summit in Italy begins .
Greenpeace says it does not think its 2,275 - square - foot sign will damage Mount Rushmore 's structure .
" America honors leaders not politicians : stop global warming , " reads the 2,275 - square - foot sign .
Twelve protesters were arrested , but one was released after questioning .
The others appeared before a federal magistrate Wednesday afternoon and received citations for illegal climbing and trespassing , according to federal prosecutors .
Each person faces a maximum of six months in prison and possibly up to a $ 5,000 fine .
The charged protesters came from eight states , including California and New York .
The banner was up for an hour before it was seized .
The National Park Service is holding it as evidence , authorities said .
Watch tourists react to the protest »
Some of the demonstrators breached a controlled area and got to the top of the monument , Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Patty Rooney told CNN .
Greenpeace , a nonprofit organization that supports environmental causes , said the sign is part of a global day of action to urge world leaders at the G - 8 summit to make global warming a priority and to take the actions necessary to stop climate change .
" We are at a key moment in history when we must challenge our president to take real leadership , " said Carroll Muffet , deputy campaign director for Greenpeace .
" The steps taken so far have been frankly inadequate .
If President Obama wants to take his place among the great leaders of history , he must take aggressive measures to combat climate change and prioritize a strong deal in Copenhagen , " Muffet said in a statement .
" We 're here at Mount Rushmore to inspire Americans to take action , and remind the world that heroism and leadership are part of our nation 's history -- and must be a part of our future , " Muffet said .
Watch how sense of urgency over climate change has dissipated at the G - 8 summit »
The G - 8 meeting , which includes leaders from the world 's most industrialized nations , is taking place in L'Aquila , Italy .
Rooney said the monument will be assessed for any structural damage .
She said a security system alerted park staff to the protest at midday .
Greenpeace acknowledged the protest is illegal and dangerous , but said it does not believe the sign damaged the solid granite structure .
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial features a carving of former U.S. presidents George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln .
Nearly 3 million people visit the site every year .

There is no guarantee the vehicle will be built - even just an unmanned version
Europe has taken the first step towards building its own manned spaceship .
The European Space Agency has asked industry to work out the requirements of the craft and its likely cost .
Known as the Advanced Re-Entry Vehicle , it would be developed in phases - first as an unmanned vessel to carry cargo , and then as an astronaut crew ship .
At the moment , Europe has no independent capability to transport humans into space and must hitch rides on American or Russian systems .
Tuesday 's announcement is just the start of a very long process , and there is no guarantee either ARV variant will be built .
ARV BASIC REQUIREMENTS
Takes the best from Esa's ATV Incorporates a conical capsule Diameter will be about 4.4 m
Able to return science samples Crewed version to have 4 seats Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Esa member states will want to see industry 's report before approving any development on the spaceship .
Even then , it is possible only the robotic version will make it off the drawing board .
Assuming progress is smooth , a first flight of the unmanned spacecraft could come as soon as 2016 ; the astronaut version could fly in perhaps 2025 .
The ARV " phase A " study was launched here in Bremen , a major centre for EADS Astrium .
Europe 's largest space company will lead a consortium working on the project .
A 21 m - euro contract agreeing the scope of the research was signed by Esa 's director of human spaceflight , Simonetta Di Pippo , and Dr Michael Menking , Astrium 's head of orbital systems and space exploration .
The ARV would essentially be an upgraded version of Europe 's highly successful unmanned space freighter , known by another acronym - ATV ( Automated Transfer Vehicle ) .
This 20 - tonne vessel flew a maiden voyage to the International Space Station ( ISS ) last year .
The robotic truck has sophisticated automatic rendezvous and docking technology - it can find its own way to the ISS and attach itself without any human intervention .
What it cannot do , however , is return to Earth at high speed through the atmosphere .
At present , it simply burns to destruction .
An ARV would have that survivability .
This would be a significant asset for the space station which , when the US space shuttle retires next year , will have no means of getting heavy cargo - including science experiments - back to Earth .
Esa believes the unmanned ARV upgrade to its ATV could cost something in the order of 1.5 bn euros .
ADVANCED RE-ENTRY VEHICLE - MISSION PROFILE
The ARV would launch on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou , French Guiana The Mk I would only carry cargo , and qualify systems for human flight Four European astronauts could travel safely inside the Mk II ARV
The new vehicle would incorporate a conical capsule .
Its structure would be much stronger than the current cargo module on the ATV , and , significantly , it would have special protection to get it through the intense heat of re-entry , and a parachute system to slow the final descent .
Even though an unmanned cargo ARV is the initial target , designers would always be mindful of the potential to carry astronauts , said Cristian Bank , the head of crew transport at Astrium .
EUROPE'S RE- ENTRY HERITAGE
Human transport studied before Hermes shuttle ( T ) never flew Esa - Nasa X - 38 ( B ) was cancelled Know - how will now pass to ARV Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The loads which are imposed on the vehicle [ must ] not exceed the loads which are acceptable to astronauts , even if in the first instance we transport only cargo and we could exceed those loads , " he explained .
" We should n't [ do that ] in order to ensure that whatever the mission looks like afterwards , it still allows astronauts to survive the flight . "
Putting the necessary systems inside the unmanned ARV capsule so it can carry astronauts would cost many hundreds of millions of euros more .
" There 're a lot of discussions on that , and I would n't like to give a figure ; but it's one of the objectives of the Phase A that any decision taken by the member states can be based on a solid estimate , " said Marco Caporicci , Esa 's head of transportation and re-entry systems division .
Attention would also need to be paid to the safety systems on its launch rocket , an Ariane 5 ; and to establishing the ground infrastructure to support the vehicle in flight and retrieve it from a splashdown in the Atlantic , probably near the Azores .
But by designing the cargo ARV with the human version in mind , Esa believes substantial economies can be found .
" If we go ahead with a configuration which is also taking into account the manned version , this will allow us to reduce drastically the overall cost of the capsules , " Mrs Di Pippo told BBC News .
The next major Esa ministerial council will take place in 2011 .
The member states will have received the results of the new study by then and should be in a position to decide a future course .

At the contract signing ceremony , a call was made to the ISS to speak to Esa astronaut Frank De Winne .
The Belgian is set to become the first European commander of the platform after a crew rotation in a few weeks ' time .
Asked about the ARV , he said : " If you want to bring humans back to Earth , you first need to do a number demonstration flights and a cargo vehicle can very well serve for these demonstration flights .
" I hope that in the near future , Esa and the member states will make the decision to go into a full development of the ARV . "
The manned ARV would require modifications to the Ariane 5 rocket

The active ingredient THC in marijuana appears to reduce tumor growth , according to research from the University in Madrid .
The researchers showed giving THC to mice with cancer decreased tumor growth and killed cells off in a process called autophagy .
" Our findings support that safe , therapeutically efficacious doses of THC may be reached in cancer patients , " Guillermo Velasco of Complutense University in Madrid and colleagues reported in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
Other research has shown benefits , such as staving off Alzheimer 's , and many doctors view THC as a valuable way to treat weight loss associated with AIDS , and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients .
Velasco and his team 's study included an analysis of two tumors from two people with highly aggressive brain cancer .
Both patients experienced a decrease in tumor size after receiving THC .
The researchers said the findings could pave the way for cannabinoid - based drugs to treat cancer , although that approach has so proved unsuccessful when it comes to obesity .

Unemployment benefits and falling tax incomes have widened the deficit
The US budget deficit has moved above $ 1 trillion ( £ 616 bn ) for the first time - with three months of the financial year remaining , official data show .
The government stepped up spending to counter the recession , and the bailout of financial institutions has taken a huge chunk out of government finances .
Falling tax revenues and unemployment benefit spending have also contributed .
The figure compares with $ 455bn for the whole 2007 / 8 financial year , but the 2008/9 deficit was expected to soar .
A budget deficit can impede spending on programmes such as health and education .
Increased anxiety Congress has already approved a $ 700 bn financial bailout and a $ 787bn economic stimulus package to try and jump - start a recovery .
WHY DEFICITS MATTER
Increased debt costs for government Increased risk of inflation Long - term pressure on dollar Could lead to higher taxes and spending cuts later
And last week a senior US Democrat said legislators must be willing to consider the possibility of a second economic stimulus package .
But even before the global economic slowdown , the US had moved into deficit - driven largely by tax cuts and the cost of the Iraq war .
The Treasury figures showed that the budget deficit so far in the financial year , which runs to 30 September , was $ 1.086 trillion - a widening of $ 94.316bn from the month before .
And the situation has led to increasing anxiety among the foreign buyers of US debt , including China .
It may force the Treasury to pay higher interest rates to those who buy its debt , to make it a more attractive long - term prospect , observers say .
" These are mind boggling numbers , " said Sung Won Sohn , an economist at the Smith School of Business at California State University .
" Our foreign investors from China and elsewhere are starting to have concerns about not only the value of the dollar but how safe their investments will be in the long run . "

New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees has ordered all State Government departments and agencies to stop buying bottled water , following swiftly on plans for a small - town ban .
The measure comes hot on today 's news that the NSW Southern Highlands town of Bundanoon is set to become the first community in Australia to ban the sale of bottled water .
Mr Rees already ordered all ministerial offices in Sydney 's CBD to make do with tap water when he took on the top job last year .
He has today extended that instruction , saying the State Government should lead by example .
" We 're asking government departments to phase it out unless there is obvious and practical commonsense reasons not to in the event someone does n't have cool water in a hot environment , " he said .
The Premier says the move will save taxpayer money and help reduce the impact on the environment of producing and throwing away plastic bottles .
Mr Rees is also planning a public campaign to discourage the use of bottled water by the wider community .
Residents in Bundanoon are meanwhile preparing to vote on their town 's plan to ban local shops from selling plastic bottles of water at a community meeting tonight .
Local businesses in the town of 2,500 people are proposing to replace the bottles with reusables and then offer directions to filtered water fountains that will be installed on the main street .
The ' Bundy on tap ' campaign was suggested by Bundanoon businessman , Huw Kingston , after a company applied to pump water out of a local aquifer to supply the bottled market .
" I put a little article , ' Does Bundanoon have the bottle to go bottled - water - free ? ' in our local newsletter , " he told ABC Radio's AM program this morning .
" I guess we have gone on from there . "
Mr Kingston believes there will be widespread support for the plan .
" I think there is an overwhelming opposition to the marketing scam that is stilled bottled water , " he said .
Other cities around the world have taxed bottled water and have put in place measures similar to the ones Nathan Rees has announced today .
Environmentalist Jon Dee from activist group Do Something believes Bundanoon could be the first town in the world to ban bottled water entirely .
" Huge amounts of resources are used to extract , bottle and transport that bottled water , and much of the package ends up as litter or landfill , " he said .
" Environmentally , it makes no sense and ... what we are trying to do in Bundanoon is show that a community can live without single - use bottled water . "
Mr Dee , who was behind the campaign that saw plastic bags banned in the Tasmanian town of Coles Bay , says other towns around the country would not find it hard to follow Bundanoon 's lead .
" If Bundanoon can ban bottled water , many other towns and communities around Australia will also consider their usage of bottled water , " he said .
" At the very least , if they do n't ban it , then at least they will reduce their usage of it and in doing so , reduce the half - a- billion dollars a year that Australians are spending on bottled water . "
Mr Kingston says visitors to Bundanoon will not be set upon if they are seen sipping water from a plastic bottle .
" We are fairly civilised people down here .
Nobody is going to get lynched for carrying a bottle of prepackaged water down the main street of Bundanoon , " he said .
But he hopes the ban will make them think twice about how they quench their thirst .

5. Null Pointers
5.1 What is this infamous null pointer , anyway ?
5.2 How do I get a null pointer in my programs ?
5.3 Is the abbreviated pointer comparison `` if ( p ) '' to test for non-null pointers valid ?
What if the internal representation for null pointers is nonzero ?
5.4
What is NULL and how is it defined ?
5.5 How should NULL be defined on a machine which uses a nonzero bit pattern as the internal representation of a null pointer ?
5.6 If NULL were defined as follows :
# define NULL ( ( char *)0 )
NULL
5.7
My vendor provides header files that #define NULL as 0L .
Why ?
5.8 Is NULL valid for pointers to functions ?
5.9 If NULL and 0 are equivalent as null pointer constants , which should I use ?
5.10 But would n't it be better to use NULL ( rather than 0 ) , in case the value of NULL changes , perhaps on a machine with nonzero internal null pointers ?
5.11 I once used a compiler that would n't work unless NULL was used .
5.12 I use the preprocessor macro
# define Nullptr ( type ) ( type *)
0
5.13 This is strange .
NULL is guaranteed to be 0 , but the null pointer is not ?
5.14 Why is there so much confusion surrounding null pointers ?
Why do these questions come up so often ?
5.15 I 'm confused .
I just can't understand all this null pointer stuff .
5.16 Given all the confusion surrounding null pointers , would n't it be easier simply to require them to be represented internally by zeroes ?
5.17 Seriously , have any actual machines really used nonzero null pointers , or different representations for pointers to different types ?
5.18 Is a run-time integral value of 0 , cast to a pointer , guaranteed to be a null pointer ?
5.19 How can I access an interrupt vector located at the machine 's location 0 ?
If I set a pointer to 0 , the compiler might translate it to some nonzero internal null pointer value .
5.20 What does a run-time ``null pointer assignment '' error mean ?
How can I track it down ?

10 lessons on empire
As I mentioned awhile back , I devoted a good chunk of my vacation out west reading Piers Brendon ’s The Decline and Fall of the British Empire , 1781 - 1997 .
As you might imagine , I spent a lot of time thinking about possible parallels and lessons for America ’s current global position , just as English imperialists spent a lot of time pondering the Roman experience ( ably documented by Edward Gibbon ) .
In a tapestry this rich and varied , it is easy to read into it just about any “ lesson ” one wants to draw .
With that caveat in mind , here are the top ten lessons on empire that I drew from Brendon ’s book .
Even if you do n’t agree with them , you should still read the book .
1 . There is no such thing as a “ benevolent ” Empire .
In his classic history of ancient Rome , Gibbon had noted that “ There is nothing more adverse to nature and reason than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations , in opposition to their inclination and interest . ”
Britons thought of the empire as a positive force for themselves and their subjects , even though they had to slaughter thousands of their imperial subjects in order to maintain their control .
Americans should be under no illusions either : if you maintain garrisons all over the world and repeatedly interfere in the internal politics of other countries , you are inevitably going to end up breaking a lot of heads .
2. All Empires depend on self - justifying ideology and rhetoric that is often at odds with reality .
British imperialists repeatedly portrayed their role as the “ white man ’s burden ” and maintained that imperial control brought considerable benefits to their subjects .
( This is an old story : France proclaimed its mission civilizatrice , and the Soviet empire claimed it was spreading the benefits of communism .
Today , Americans say we are spreading freedom and liberty ) .
Brendon ’s account describes the various benefits of imperial rule , but also emphasizes the profound social disruptions that imperial rule caused in India , Africa , and elsewhere .
Moreover , because British control often depended on strategies of “ divide - and - conquer , ” its rule often left its colonies deeply divided and ill - prepared for independence .
But that ’s not what English citizens were told at the time .
3. Successful empires require ample “ hard power . ”
Although the British did worry a lot about their reputation and prestige ( what one might now term their “ soft power ” ) what really killed the Empire was its eroding economic position .
Once Britain ceased to be the world ’s major economic and industrial power , its days as an imperial power were numbered .
It simply could n’t maintain the ships , the men , the aircraft , and the economic leverage needed to rule millions of foreigners , especially in a world where other rapacious great powers preyed .
The moral for Americans ?
It is far more important to maintain a robust and productive economy here at home than it is to squander billions of dollars trying to determine the political fate of some remote country thousands of miles away .
External conditions may impinge on U.S. power , but it is internal conditions that generate it .
4 . As Empires decline , they become more opulent , and they obsess about their own glory .
Brendon ’s description of the British Empire Exposition at Wembley in 1924 - 1925 is both slightly comical and bittersweet ; with cracks increasingly evident in the imperial façade , Britain put on a lavish show designed to bind the colonies together and highlight its continuing glory .
Moral : when you hear U.S. politicians glorifying America ’s historical world role , get worried .
5. Great Empires are heterogeneous .
The British empire was not a uniform enterprise ; the various bits and piece were acquired at different times and in different ways , and the relationship between London and the different components was far from uniform .
One could say the same thing for America ’s less formal global “ empire ” : its relationship with NATO is different than the alliance with Japan , or the client states in the Middle East , or the bases at Diego Garcia or Guantanamo .
An empire is not one thing .
6 . When building an empire , it ’s hard to know where to stop .
The expansion of the British empire after 1781 shows how difficult it is to engage in a rational assessment of strategic costs and benefits .
Once committed to India , for example , it was easy for Britain to get drawn into additional commitments in Egypt , Yemen , Kenya , South Africa , Afghanistan , Burma , and Singapore .
This was partly because ambitious empire builders like Cecil Rhodes were constantly promoting new imperial schemes , but also because each additional step could be justified by the need to protect the last .
History has been described as “ just one damn thing after another , ” and so is the process of imperial expansion .
7 . It takes a lot of incompetent people to run an empire .
A recurring theme in Brendon ’s account is the remarkable level of ignorance and incompetence with which the British empire was administered .
Although there were obviously some very able individuals involved , Britain ’s colonial endeavors seem to have attracted an equal or greater number of arrogant , corrupt , and racist buffoons .
The bungling that accompanied the U.S. occupation of Iraq looks rather typical by comparison .
8. Great Powers defend perceived interests with any means at their disposal .
Great powers like to portray themselves as “ civilized ” societies with superior moral and ethical standards , but realists know better .
Like other empires , Britain used its technological superiority without restraint , whether in the form of naval power , the Maxim gun , airplanes , high explosive , or poison gas. , and the British showed scant regard for the effects of this superior technology on their “ uncivilized ” targets .
Today , the United States uses Predators and Reapers and smart bombs .
Plus ca change …
9 . Nationalism and other forms of local identity remain a potent obstacle to long - term imperial control .
Britain ’s supposedly “ liberal ” empire contained a deep contradiction : a society that emphasized individual liberties could not hold in bondage whole societies and deny the inhabitants independence .
Once nationalism took root in the colonies ( intermingled with other tribal and / or religious identities ) , resistance to imperial rule increased apace .
As the United States is now discovering in Iraq and Central Asia , most peoples do n’t like taking orders from well - armed foreigners , even when the foreigners keep telling them that their aims are benevolent .
10 . “ Imperial Prestige ” is both an asset and a trap .
Britain ’s leaders fretted constantly about any erosion in their image of superiority , fearing that one or two setbacks might lead their subjects to rise up or encourage other great powers to poach on Britain ’s holdings .
As a result , Britons found themselves fighting to defend marginal possessions in order to preserve their position in the places they believed mattered .
Ironically , the refusal to liquidate far - flung commitments early so as to focus resources on more vital interests may have hastened Britain ’s imperial decline .
There are undoubtedly other morals one can draw from Brendon ’s account , and other historical treatments would undoubtedly suggest a somewhat different set of lessons .
I would n’t want to overplay the parallels between Britain and the United States , if only because the U.S. empire is mostly ad hoc and informal rather than a network of formal colonies .
But there is one final moral one could also draw from Brendan ’s fine work : there is life after Empire .
Britain may be past the glory of its imperial heyday , but life expectancy , health care , educational levels , GDP / capita , etc. are all higher now than they were in Victoria ’s time .
Defenders of the Empire foresaw doom - and - gloom if it ever dissolved — and sent many men to their deaths to prevent that from happening — but its eventual demise did not produce the disasters back home that many had feared .
Great Britain remains in influential force in world affairs , if anything batting slightly above its weight , and is more secure now than at any time in its modern history .
For those of us who think the United States should stay out of the empire business , that ’s a reassuring thought .

It ’s amusing when Anarchists are accused of being too ideological or outright Utopian , it is especially so when such an accusation comes from liberals or state socialists ( i.e. mainstream Marxists ) .
Why is it amusing ?
Because of all political perspectives , Anarchism ( i.e. Libertarian Socialism ) is the only one whose theories have not been refuted by history itself !
This “ Utopian ” accusation generally comes from two general sources .
First there are those who support the current Capitalist system as is ( in the 1st world countries of course ) and only propose mild changes , such as more or less regulation of the economy .
These would generally be the Social Democrats ( or “ Liberals ” in US politics ) or Conservatives in most political systems .
They would argue from the perspective that the Capitalist / State combination is not only “ the way things are ” but also the only way things can be .
They would then raise such arguments as the common appeal to human nature , that Capitalism is the “ end of history ” – in that its superiority has been proven from an societal evolutionary perspective , that the state is necessary to ensure control from the people ( i.e. representative democracy ) , that Capitalism provides the best benefit for all etc .
But one has to ask : who is really the ideologue here ?
Who is assuming an expertise of human nature in order to have some kind of unshakable base ?
Who is ignoring the historical forms of human societies ( hint : communal ) and the considerable amount of coercion required by the state in order to jump - start Capitalism ?
Who is absolutely oblivious the true role of the state and the real impotence of elections and government to change life for the better through normal channels , even when there is considerable popular request for social reform ?
Worst of all , it ’s the more than ironic result of this superior system , Capitalism , that the vast majority of people live in worse situations than they lived in pre-capitalist societies .
One only has to look at the situation in the lost continent , Africa , and compare it with the pre-capitalist tribal societies , which while not great by any measure of the word , were never as bad as today .
One only has to look at the current environmental obliteration , the sheer scale of unending conflict and even the relative worsening conditions of people in all nations to ask :
Who is really the ideologue here ?
The other great accuser of utopianism is none other than the mainstream Marxist movements of Leninism , Trotskyism , Stalinism , Maoism and the like .
The younger ( who somehow think itself more mature ) and patronizing cousin of Anarchism .
As revolutionary anti-capitalist movements , they at least share some of the correct critical perspective on the current Capitalist system but they lose the ball when they turn around and accuse libertarian socialists of being naive for not promoting centralization , hierarchy structures and movements from above , that is , leadership from a minority of enlightened few .
The saddest thing is not that they have to misrepresent the arguments of Anarchism in order to attack their favorite straw - men ( “ Anarchists will not defend the revolution ” being a crowd favorite ) , nor that they ignore what some of their own have written that basically parrots the libertarian perspective , but that they dare claim historical proof , when empirical facts have shown that their theories put in practice failed in exactly the manner that Anarchists had predicted !
Is the federalist libertarian perspective Utopian , or is the centralized authoritarian one when it fails both in theory ( power corrupts , requires inhuman knowledge , leads to bureaucracy etc ) and in practice ?
Is a bottom - up democratic society Utopian or the top - down hierarchical one who expects leaders to be practically flawless and that “ real power ” will somehow still remain at the hands of the people ?
Is the “ similar means as the ends ” anarchist position Utopian or is the Leninist “ ends justify the means ” which expects a revolution where people just passively followed orders from the enlightened few can somehow lead to a society or politically active and empowered individuals ?
In the end , who is the ideologue ?
The one who looks at how humans currently and historically acted and interacted and makes a revolutionary theory to describe and lead to something better , or one who makes a theory which proves to be a failure in practice and then refuse to discard it ?
Oh , the authoritarian socialists will say that “ Of course we will learn from the mistakes our historical leaders made , we of course do n’t want to repeat them .
Terrible tragedy ” and all that , but that is no more different than the Liberals who after every Capitalist crisis declared that they will learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure a future with no Crises and depressions .
And when the next disaster comes , they are always oh so surprised .
This convinces few for it ’s the theory ’s core of hierarchy and authority that is flawed and by refusing to review that they only doom themselves to similar results and suffering of scale .
And finally , there ’s also the right - “ libertarian ” , pro-capitalist , free market “ anarchist ” camp .
But those do n’t generally accuse others of utopianism for they ’ve probably learned that those living in glass houses do n’t throw ideological stone around .

No doubt the hearts of net activists around the country went aflutter when Minnesota Senator Al Franken made his very first question to Supreme Court nominee Sonya Sotomayor about net neutrality .
Franken asked for her opinion on the 2005 “ Brand X ” decision , which net activists argue allows companies with both ISP and content interests to give their traffic precedence over other Internet traffic .
Essentially , Brand X affirmed the FCC ’s decision that the Internet was an information service , and thus free of any requirements that would require it to be “ open . ”
Franken seemed to try to prod Sotomayor for her position on net neutrality , and she for all intents and purposes demurred , placing the work back in Congress ’ hands .
Sotomayor did say that as a citizen she realized the value and importance of the Internet .
Gleaning somebody ’s stance on an issue from two or three minutes of questioning on the subject is not easy , but I ’m not so sure that Sotomayor may be inclined to side with net neutrality as she seems to think it is a legislative issue .
This may come down to how she ’ll decide cases — and she seems to lean towards deciding from already settled law , of which Brand X is already there .
That could mean net activists might not have Sotomayor to count on if any future net neutrality cases make it to the high court .
In any case , I do applaud Senator Franken for bringing the issue up front and center .
Equal access regardless of the content provider or ISP is important , and is an issue that should concern Internet users regardless of our political beliefs .

Advertisement Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will back a Palestinian state - but only if it is completely demilitarised .
He said a Palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
In a landmark speech , weeks after the US president urged him to agree a two - state plan , he said the Palestinians must accept Israel as a Jewish state .
Palestinian leaders reacted angrily , accusing him of sabotaging peace plans .
Settlers ' not enemies '
The White House said President Barack Obama welcomed Mr Netanyahu's " endorsement " of a two - state solution as an " important step forward " .
The BBC's Paul Wood says Mr Netanyahu broke ground by accepting the principle of a demilitarised Palestinian state , albeit with conditions .
Any demand to resettle refugees within Israel undermines Israel as a state for the Jewish people
Benjamin Netanyahu
Speech : Key excerpts
Your views
But our correspondent says the question is whether the White House regards this as sufficient to make up for the lack of movement on the issue of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank .
In his keynote Mid-East speech in Cairo on 4 June Mr Obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
But in his speech at Bar - Ilan university Mr Netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
Thorny issues
The Israeli leader offered to talk to the Palestinians immediately and with " no preconditions " .
Tim Franks , BBC News , Jerusalem
Benjamin Netanyahu has shifted .
He has used the word " state " , when it comes to Palestinian self - rule .
In another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
Mr Netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over - arching pre-conditions : a public Palestinian acceptance of Israel as the nation - state of the Jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future Palestinian entity .
And Mr Netanyahu tersely dismissed the US call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
He described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
This is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right - wing coalition .
It is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the Americans .
It will be fascinating to see when and how the Americans return the ball .
" We want to live with you in peace as good neighbours , " he said .
Mr Netanyahu also said he was willing to go to Damascus , Riyadh and Beirut in pursuit of a Middle East peace deal .
He went on to tackle the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with Palestinians over the years .
Not least was the issue of Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel in 1948 and 1949 .
The Palestinians say they and their millions of descendants have the right to return to Israel - which would mean an end to its Jewish majority - but Israel has consistently rebuffed that demand .
Mr Netanyahu stuck to a similar line , saying : " The Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside the borders of the state of Israel .
" Any demand to resettle refugees within Israel undermines Israel as a state for the Jewish people . "
Another key issue the two sides have failed to agree on is the status of Jerusalem .
Mr Netanyahu insisted the city must be the " united capital of Israel " , although Palestinians want it divided to allow them to locate the capital of a future state there .
' Racist and extremist '
Agreeing the principle of a Palestinian state , he said Israel would " be prepared for a true peace agreement [ and ] to reach a solution of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state " .
But only if " we receive this guarantee for demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by Israel , and if the Palestinians recognise Israel as the nation of the Jewish people " .
Correspondents say even with the provisos Mr Netanyahu has added , his comments on a Palestinian state are sure to anger many in his own coalition .
Nabil Abu Rdainah , a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , said the Israeli leader 's speech " torpedoes all peace initiatives in the region " .
Another Abbas aide , Yasser Abed Rabbo , told the AFP news agency that recognition of Israel 's Jewish character was a demand for Palestinians " to become part of the global Zionist movement " .
The militant Hamas movement , which controls the Gaza Strip , said the speech reflected Mr Netanyahu 's " racist and extremist ideology " .

Conventional wisdom has it that the first animals evolved in the ocean .
Now researchers studying ancient rock samples in South China have found that the first animal fossils are preserved in ancient lake deposits , not in marine sediments as commonly assumed .
These new findings not only raise questions as to where the earliest animals were living , but what factors drove animals to evolve in the first place .
For some 3 billion years , single - celled life forms such as bacteria dominated the planet .
Then , roughly 600 million years ago , the first multi-cellular animals appeared on the scene , diversifying rapidly .
The oldest known animal fossils in the world are preserved in South China 's Doushantuo Formation .
These fossil beds have no adult specimens — instead , many of the fossils appear to be microscopic embryos .
" Our first unusual finding in this region was the abundance of a clay mineral called smectite , " said researcher Tom Bristow , now at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
" In rocks of this age , smectite is normally transformed into other types of clay .
The smectite in these South China rocks , however , underwent no such transformation and have a special chemistry that , for the smectite to form , requires specific conditions in the water — conditions commonly found in salty , alkaline lakes . "
The researchers collected hundreds of rock samples from several locations in South China .
All their analyses suggest these rocks were not marine sediments .
" Moreover , we found smectite in only some locations in South China , and not uniformly as one would expect for marine deposits , " Bristow said .
" Taken together , several lines of evidence indicated to us that these early animals lived in a lake environment . "
This discovery raises questions as to how and why animals appeared when they did .
" It is most unexpected that these first fossils do not come from marine sediments , " said researcher Martin Kennedy , a geologist at the University of California at Riverside .
" Lakes are typically short - lived features on the Earth 's surface , and they are not nearly as consistent environments as oceans are , " he explained .
" So it 's surprising that the first evidence of animals we find is associated with lakes , which are far more variable environments than the ocean .
You 'd expect the first appearance of animals to be in the most conservative , stable environments we could imagine . "
It remains possible , Kennedy noted , that animal fossils of similar or older age exist that remain to be found that are marine in origin .
However , at the very least , this work suggests " that animals had already taken on the ability to deal with the environmental fluctuations one sees in lake environments , " he said .
" That suggests that their evolutionary response is much more rapid that I would have supposed , and that the earliest animals were far more diverse than imagined . "
If animals did first develop in lakes , one aspect of lake environments that could have spurred on their evolution is how much easier it is for air to percolate through them , given how much shallower they typically are than the ocean .
" The most popular explanation for the evolution of animals has to do with the increase in oxygen in Earth 's atmosphere at that time , " Kennedy told LiveScience .
" It 's possible that lakes were the first to benefit from that increase in oxygen . "
The scientists detailed their findings online July 27 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Greatest Mysteries : How Did Life Arise on Earth ?

T rying to figure out how much maintenance is too much maintenance is one of the hardest questions that someone who 's looking for a TV girlfriend will ever have to answer .
Seriously , it practically requires an algebraic equation .
She 's hot , but is she hot enough for you to put up with all of the baggage she 's toting along with her ?
Rather than assign numeric values to her pros and cons , we 're going to simplify the mathematical process for you by offering you 10 high - maintenance hotties that are , at least by our estimation , worth your time and trouble .
As you 'll see from our nominees , not every woman is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside .
Elaine Benes , for example , is pretty darned cute , but she 's also as petty as they come ; similarly , Rachel Green , Summer Roberts and Cordelia Chase are all drop - dead gorgeous , but they unfortunately score high marks in shallowness as well .
Sometimes , though , the problems are n't on the inside .
Occasionally , you 'll find a woman who looks sexy but has something about her that 's lurking quietly and will suddenly surface and bite you in the ass … like , say , a tendency to write about every aspect of her relationships in a widely - read newspaper column , or a father that 's pretty high up in the " family , " if you know what we mean .
You 've got to look very , very carefully at your potential girlfriends , y'know ?
Good thing we 're here to help .
As ever , we invite you to investigate both the good and bad traits of our 10 " High Maintenance Hotties . "
Check out our TV Girlfriends home page to see all the other categories we had in this feature , and then check out who won each category and which character our readers chose as the ultimate TV Girlfriend .
Elaine Benes
Julia Louis - Dreyfus , " Seinfeld "
The cute and curly - haired Ms. Benes is shallow , selfish and far from easygoing , but consider the company she keeps and she starts to look pretty good .
And there 's plenty that 's kind of endearing about her other less attractive qualities , like her dancing , described by her frenemy George Costanza as " a full body dry heave set to music . "
We like her because of , not despite , the fact that after hearing about a boyfriend 's serious accident , she stops to buy Jujubes , or that she believes Jerry when he tells her that the original title of Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace was War , What is it Good For ? , or that a chance encounter with the handsome John F. Kennedy , Jr. ( " John John " ) causes her to lose the most famous self - denial contest in TV history .
Sure , Elaine is dishonest , petty and , when it comes to her dwindling supply of contraceptive sponges , exceptionally choosy – despite having a history of dating that includes the brainless David Puddy and the ultra-pretentious " Maestro . "
Still , we think the man who is deemed truly sponge - worthy is among the luckiest of men , and it's not just Elaine 's shiksa - appeal that 's making us say it .
Carrie Bradshaw
Sarah Jessica Parker , " Sex and the City "
Her rumored resemblance to a foot not withstanding , it 's easy to see why Carrie Bradshaw is rarely without male companionship : she 's successful , has a bright personality , loves her friends and – as evidenced by the fact that she 's built an entire career out of writing about her time between the sheets – the girl 's got a healthy libido .
Of course , all that fabulousness comes with a heavy price tag : Anyone with Carrie 's devotion to the latest fashions has no use for a man without a ridiculously high - paying job , that tight - knit group of friend is bound to get fairly annoying at some point , and knowing your every false move is fodder for a column read by thousands of people has got to put a damper on those ostensibly private moments in the boudoir .
Oh , and she 's also off the market , having tied the knot with on - again , off - again longtime beau John " Mr. Big " Preston a couple of years ago .
Still , if you 're willing to wait – and you 've got the requisite bankroll , thick skin and Cosmopolitan ingredients – Carrie just might be worth the effort .
Cordelia Chase
Charisma Carpenter , " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " & " Angel "
To call Cordelia Chase high - maintenance is to grossly understate the point .
She 's not just high - maintenance – she 's unfathomable .
She has the looks of a goddess , so it made sense that she would literally become a goddess – and , true to Cordy tradition , she found it dreadfully boring – but while her head may be saying " gimme cash , " her heart has always had more noble intentions , causing her to fall for a geek , a demon and a vampire .
So which version of Cordelia is the real Cordelia ?
Is she the status - obsessed social climber , or the thoughtful , vulnerable soul that reveals itself in the odd unguarded moment ?
Does her real affection for you come when she 's being sweet , or when she 's putting you down ?
You may never find out the answers to those questions , but when dealing with someone so stunningly beautiful , you wo n't think twice about spending the rest of your life trying to figure them out .
Rachel Green
Jennifer Aniston , " Friends "
When we met Rachel Green , she was a demonstrably shallow and ambition - deficient twenty something with a nose job and a dentist she 'd left at the altar – your basic stereotypical Jewish American princess rewritten for the ‘ 90s , in other words – and , yet , from the moment we discovered that Ross Gellar had carried a torch for Rachel since their teenage years , we understood why .
It helped , of course , that she was utterly smoking ' hot ( and enough of a ditz that she was prone to grabbing a loosely crocheted blanket to cover up her freshly showered torso if you burst in unannounced ) , but beneath all that pampered entitlement lurked a heart sensitive enough to melt at the sight of a gawky Ross pining for her on prom night – and deep enough to juggle a burgeoning career with unexpected single motherhood .
Rachel was frequently foolish , often exasperating , and she did have a troubling mean streak , but just like Ross , we always knew , deep down , that she was totally worth it .
Get our latest content on Jennifer Aniston on our blog here and see her profile page here .
Meadow Soprano
Jamie - Lynn Sigler , " The Sopranos "
She may be spoiled and neurotic , but Meadow Soprano is certainly no stereotypically vapid - but - ultra - hot Mafia princess .
For one thing , she 's a thoughtful and hard working student .
That helps with her rather complex rationalizations of her father 's career choice as some sort of response to historic oppression , transforming him from ruthless murderer to ex-proletariat antihero in one gigantically wrongheaded step .
Even if she 's lost more than one decent boyfriend to her family 's thuggishness , and may even suspect the truth behind the unfortunate demise of her not - so - decent onetime love , Jackie Aprile , Jr. , it 's impossible not to sympathize with her problem and her dishonest way of dealing with it .
Part of the problem is that she really is the apple of her father 's eye ; her loyalty to him may be completely misplaced , but it is also entirely natural and , confusingly enough , kind of admirable .
Also , doing the " right thing " could easily cause her , and / or everyone she loves , to wind up dead .
Who can blame young Mead for being a little touchy ?
The first five nominees in the " High Maintenance Hotties " category are all worthy objects of our affection , but they certainly are n't the only baggage - toting hotties to win our hearts .
Below you 'll find five more lovely ladies to consider before placing your vote .
Grace Adler
Debra Messing , " Will & Grace "
It 's hard to argue against the red- headed hotness of Grace Adler .
It 's what 's inside the package that causes the problems .
It 's a rarity for Grace to be able to maintain a long - term relationship with a straight man , and due to an unfortunate history of dating guys who 've gone on to realize their homosexuality or bisexuality , she 's a little paranoid that she could well change the sexual persuasion of her Mr. Right .
She 's also notoriously selfish , more than a little bit vain and as neurotic as they come .
Actually , now that we think about it , the outside of the package has some problems too .
Have you seen the size of the woman 's feet ?
Oh , but we 're just nitpicking now .
When you get right down to it , she might be crazy , but she 's still hot .
Diane Chambers
Shelley Long , " Cheers "
The blonder , female half of TV comedy 's ultimate on - again - off - again couple is a perpetual grad student with enough pretentious intellectual snobbery and over - the - top political correctness to drive nearly anyone to distraction , especially a shallowly womanizing " man 's man " like bartender / ex - baseball star Sam Malone .
Still , even as she eventually finds – and dumps – a man who actually loves her more for her posturing in Dr. Frasier Crane , it 's hard not to sympathize a little with the author of the perpetually unfinished Jocasta 's Conundrum .
Diane may be insufferable , but she 's also an adorable slave to her emotions ; we'd have a hard time getting her out of our hair , too .
Lorelei Gilmore
Lauren Graham , " Gilmore Girls "
It 's tough being a free spirit when your parents are as staid and stuffy as they come , and it 's even tougher when your teenage rebellion leads you down the road to teenage pregnancy .
The biggest problem with dating Lorelei Gilmore is that you will , at some point or other , find yourself in direct competition with the father of her child : Christopher Hayden .
Their relationship is n't always the closest , but as a result of having both contributed to the genetic makeup of their daughter , Rory , they 've got a connection .
Worse , though , is the fact that they still have a spark .
Still , others have managed to earn a spot in Lorelei 's life , and if you 're one of those , feel privileged : she 's gorgeous , intelligent and incredibly creative .
Beware , though : she 's also very flighty , and she has a fear of commitment that you have to experience personally to believe .
It 's not that Lorelei 's heart is unwinnable ; it 's a matter of whether or not you can hold on to your trophy .
Ally McBeal
Calista Flockhart , " Ally McBeal "
She would n't be your first choice if you 're a boob man – or an ass man , for that matter .
Actually , if you 're the kind of guy who prefers that his women look like they 're capable of withstanding a stiff breeze , Ally McBeal probably is n't for you .
If , on the other hand , you have a thing for career - driven , adorably neurotic singletons with great taste in miniskirts , Ally might be your girl .
You 'll have to get in line , though – with her ever - expanding legal caseload , long list of tumultuous relationships , and the occasional extra unplanned wrinkle ( such as the daughter she did n't know she had ) getting in the way , Miss McBeal is pretty much the textbook definition of a high maintenance hottie .
Summer Roberts
Rachel Bilson , " The O.C . "
Even among the slew of superficial teenagers that inhabit Orange County , California , Summer Roberts stands as the highest maintenance of them all .
This brunette beauty is not above putting social status above all else – even her own personal feelings – and is known for throwing fits when things did n't go her way , but while her gorgeous looks and innocent smile let her get away with it , she 's grown out of her bratty nature somewhat .
She 's got a lot more going on upstairs than she lets on ( she was accepted to Brown University ) , and her time dating certified nerd Seth Cohen proves she has overcome her reliance on popularity .
That 's not a bad quality for a two - time prom queen to have , and more than enough reason for us to want to date her .
Now that you 've seen our 10 nominees in the " High Maintenance Hotties " category , it 's time to make your voice heard by voting for your favorite .
If you need to refresh your memory before casting your ballot , click the thumbnails below to revisit each nominee 's writeup .
Then , come back on Friday , July 31 for the unveiling of the next TV Girlfriends list , " Mean Girls , " and to see which character prevailed in the " High Maintenance Hotties " voting .

By today 's standards , the IT Nasa used in the Apollo manned lunar programme is pretty basic .
But while they were no more powerful than a pocket calculator , these ingenious computer systems were able to guide astronauts across 356,000 km of space from the Earth to the Moon and return them safely .
The lunar programme led to the development of safety - critical systems and the practice of software engineering to program those systems .
Much of this knowledge gleaned from the Apollo programme forms the basis of modern computing .
Apollo Guidance Computer
The lunar mission used a command module computer designed at MIT and built by Raytheon , which paved the way to " fly by wire " aircraft .
The so - called Apollo Guidance Computer ( AGC ) used a real time operating system , which enabled astronauts to enter simple commands by typing in pairs of nouns and verbs , to control the spacecraft .
It was more basic than the electronics in modern toasters that have computer controlled stop / start / defrost buttons .
It had approximately 64 K byte of memory and operated at 0.043MHz .
The instruction manual for the AGC shows the computer had a small set of machine code instructions , which were used to program the hardware to run various tasks the astronauts needed .
The AGC program , called Luminary , was coded in a language called Mac , ( MIT Algebraic Compiler ) , which was then converted by hand into assembler language that the computer could understand .
The assembler code was fed into the AGC using punch cards .
Amazingly , the code listing for the AGC program can be downloaded as a PDF file .
There is also an equivalent program for the lunar lander .
The AGC was designed to be fault - tolerant and was able to run several sub programs in priority order .
Each of these sub programs was given a time slot to use the computer 's sparse resources .
During the mission the AGC became overloaded and issued a " 1202 " alarm code .
Neil Armstrong asked Mission Control for clarification on the 1202 error .
Jack Garman , a computer engineer at Nasa ( pictured below , left ) , who worked on the Apollo Guidance Program Section , told mission control that the error could be ignored in this instance , which meant the mission could continue .
Apollo 11 landed a few seconds later .
Experts cite the AGC as fundamental to the evolution of the integrated circuit .
It is regarded as the first embedded computer .
The importance of this computer was highlighted in a lecture by astronaut David Scott who said : " If you have a basket ball and a baseball 14 feet apart , where the baseball represents the moon and the basketball represents the Earth , and you take a piece of paper sideways , the thinness of the paper would be the corridor you have to hit when you come back . "
While the astronauts would probably have preferred to fly the spacecraft manually , only the AGC could provide the accuracy in navigation and control required to send them to the Moon and return them safely home again , independent of any Earth - based navigation system .
IBM computers on Apollo 11
Along with the APG , mainframes were also heavily used in the Apollo programme .
Over 3,500 IBM employees were involved , ( pictured below ) .
The Goddard Space Flight Center used IBM System / 360 Model 75s for communications across Nasa and the spacecraft .
IBM Huntsville designed and programmed the Saturn rocket instrument unit , while the Saturn launch computer at the Kennedy Space Center was operated by IBM .
An IBM System / 360 Model 75 was also used at Nasa 's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston .
This computer was used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to calculate lift - off data required to launch the Lunar Module off the Moon 's surface and enable it to rendezvous with Command Module pilot Michael Collins for the flight back to Earth .
At the time , IBM described the 6 M byte programs it developed , to monitor the spacecrafts ' environmental and astronauts ' biomedical data , as the most complex software ever written .
Even the simplest software today would far exceed the technical constraints the Apollo team worked under .
The Apollo programme was pre-Moores 's Law : in 1965 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore wrote his vision of how the performance of computer hardware would double every 18 months for the same price .
That a USB memory stick today is more powerful than the computers that put man on the moon is testimony to the relentless pace of technological development encompassed in Moore 's Law .
However , the Apollo programme proved that computers could be entrusted with human lives .
Man and machine worked in unison to achieve something that 40 years on , has yet to be surpassed .
The new website reveals which medieval soldiers rode the furthest
The detailed service records of 250,000 medieval soldiers - including archers who served with Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt - have gone online .
The database of those who fought in the Hundred Years War reveals salaries , sickness records and who was knighted .
The full profiles of soldiers from 1369 to 1453 will allow researchers to piece together details of their lives .
Thomas , Lord Despenser is the youngest soldier on the database , whose career began when he was aged just 12 in 1385 .
Elsewhere , the career of Thomas Gloucestre , who fought at Agincourt , can be traced over 43 years and includes campaigns in Prussia and Jerusalem .
' Remarkable survival '
The website is the product of a research project by Professor Anne Curry of the University of Southampton and Dr Adrian Bell of the University of Reading .
Dr Bell said : " The service records survive because the English exchequer had a very modern obsession with wanting to be sure that the government 's money was being spent as intended .
" Therefore we have the remarkable survival of indentures for service detailing the forces to be raised , muster rolls showing this service and naming every soldier from duke to archer . "
He said accounts from captains showing how funds were spent and entries detailing when the exchequer requested the payments can be found .
The free - to - use website , funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council , also shows which soldiers rode the furthest .
The MORE Act recently got approval from the House Judiciary Committee which allows it to go to the House of Representatives for a vote .
We believe the MORE Act is more crucial than the SAFE Banking act because the MORE
Act deschedules marijuana which would in turn open up banking anyway .
The bill would also expunge any prior marijuana convictions and retry anyone currently incarcerated for marijuana .
Becoming a Fried Chicken Whisperer
I have been frying chicken since I was 8 years old .
My Kentucky born and raised Dad taught me his recipe for basic southern - style fried chicken , which I assume he learned from his mother , my Grandma Maisie .
The chicken pieces were treated to plenty of salt and pepper and then dredged in flour that included more salt and pepper , paprika , thyme , onion powder , and garlic powder .
I was taught to shallow - fry the dredged chicken in sputtering hot shortening in a heavy , cast iron skillet , putting the lid partially on the pan during the last half of cooking .
The only thing that was wrong with that recipe was that , in those days , everyone seemed to be obsessed with overcooking meat and vegetables alike .
Grandma
Mary cooked corn on the cob for 40 minutes , for instance .
Dad instructed me to cook the chicken for an hour .
You can imagine how difficult it was to keep the chicken from overbrowning while frying it for that long .
It was a laborious process of turning and turning the chicken parts for 60 long minutes , which seemed a lifetime to this young cook .
And this resulted in , of course , rather dry chicken .
Now , fast - forward many years .
When I deep - fry chicken parts ( occasional madness does occur ) , it rarely requires more than 20 minutes to reach an internal temperature of 175° at the meatiest part of the thigh .
When I shallow - fry chicken , as in the below recommended method , it never takes more than 15 minutes to fully brown the chicken and then between 20 - 30 minutes in a 350° oven to reach a safe internal temperature .
In addition , I now know the magic of the dry salt cure and wet salt brine .
Either will work here , but the wet salt brine seems to carry the spicy heat into the meat a tad better , so we will use it for this recipe .
As far as buttermilk brining goes , it sounds delicious , but the results I ’ve had with it have been unimpressive .
The Art & Science of Dredging
When it comes to coatings for the chicken , there are many schools of thought : flour alone ; cornmeal alone ; rice flour alone ; flour and cornstarch ; flour and cornmeal ; egg wash alone ; flour , then egg wash , then flour ; flour , then egg wash , then bread crumbs ; or flour , then egg , liquid , and flour batter , then flour .
And probably a dozen more possible combinations .
I ’ve tried most of them .
If you want a light and crisp coating that stays crisp only until the chicken cools , then go with the Simple Dredge below .
For a crunchy coating that stays crisp longer , go with the Extra Crunch Dredge .
For a coating that stays crunchy even after refrigeration ( amazing ! ) , go with the Extra - Extra Crunch Dredge .
This said , I prefer the look and taste of my Dad ’s southern fried chicken , with herbs and spices in full view on the browned skin and only the barest of crispy coating .
Thus , the photos here show the Simple Dredge .
But in the recipe below , you will find directions for all three .
As far as deep frying versus shallow frying goes , I cannot in good conscience recommend deep frying for the home kitchen , unless you happen to have a deep fryer .
It is a dangerous and exacting proposition .
Get distracted for a few seconds and you could have ruined chicken or a kitchen fire on your hands .
I would never try this technique with children in the kitchen .
Why take a risk ?
It ’s so much easier , and just as delicious , to shallow fry your chicken .
I take it a step further even and finish the cooking in the oven .
That gives me time to set the table , whip the potatoes , and make a pan gravy .
Just like Dad taught me .
Now , for a few tips that will ensure that YOUR fried chicken is the best in the world .
LunaCafe ’s Fried Chicken Tips & Tricks
Purchase the freshest , local chicken possible and use it right away .
For the best fried chicken , do not use frozen , thawed chicken .
Cut the chicken into serving size pieces , i.e. 2 legs , 2 thighs , 2 wings , 4 half breast sections .
Do not overcook the chicken .
When an instant - read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the thigh reads 175° , the chicken is done .
( The temperature will continue to rise a few degrees after taking the chicken from the oven . )
Chicken breasts generally cook faster than dark meat .
Be sure to account for this and remove the chicken breasts from the oven in advance of the rest of the chicken .
To get beautifully browned and crispy chicken , you need either a cast iron skillet or a heavy aluminum sauté pan ( such as Calphalon ) .
Even heat distribution and temperature control are keys to perfectly fried chicken .
Do not attempt to make fried chicken in a stainless steel lined pan .
It will stick like crazy .
For deep - fried chicken , the oil should be about 1 - inch deep in the pan .
For a 12 - inch diameter , Calphalon sauté pan , that means 6 cups of oil .
For shallow - fried chicken , the oil should be about ¼- inch deep in the pan .
For a 12 - inch diameter , Calphalon sauté pan , that means 2 cups of oil .
Dredge all of your chicken and set on a wire rack before you begin to heat the oil .
Redredge each piece if needed , just before sliding it into the hot oil .
In a heavy , 12 - inch sauté pan or skillet , heat the oil to between 350° and 365° .
For deep - frying , use an instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature of the oil .
Or , insert a wooden skewer into the oil .
At 350° , a mass of tiny bubbles will collect around the skewer .
For shallow - frying , put a 2 ″ cube of bread into the hot oil .
It should brown nicely in about 60 seconds .
When you begin to smell the oil as it is heating in the pan , it is nearing its smoke point .
Monitor closely .
Carefully lower chicken pieces into the oil , skin - side down .
Turn the chicken pieces with tongs as they brown .
Fry in batches .
Overcrowding the pan lowers the temperature of the oil , causing more oil to be absorbed and resulting in greasy chicken .
Soggy , greasy chicken is the result of too low oil temperature .
You must maintain an oil temperature of at least 350° while frying the chicken .
For shallow - frying , when the chicken pieces are fried to a deep golden brown ( should not take longer than 15 minutes ) , remove pieces from the pan with tongs and place on a wire rack set over an edged baking sheet .
Finish cooking in a 350° oven for between 20 - 30 minutes , until internal temperature at the meatiest portion of the thigh registers 175° on an instant - read thermometer .
The USDA ’s Food Safety & Inspection Service recommends cooking chicken to a minimum internal temperature of 165° .
Fry chicken in fat that has a high smoke point .
The smoke point is the point at which heated fat begins to emit smoke and acrid odors .
At this stage , it also begins to impart an unpleasant flavor to the chicken .
Reusing fat and exposing it to air reduces its smoke point .
Thus , it must be discarded at least after every three uses .
In practice , I discard the oil after only one use .
The smoke points for some common fats are as follows : butter ( 350° ) , vegetable shortenings ( 356°-370° ) , lard ( 361° - 401° ) , olive oil ( 375° ) , and vegetable oils ( 441° -450° ) .
LunaCafe ’s Best Ever Spicy Fried Chicken
You have a choice here of three dredges for the chicken .
I prefer the simplest of the three , but the others are good too .
Chicken
2 pounds fresh chicken legs and thighs , trimmed of excess fat and skin , and rinsed
LunaCafe Spice Blend
1 tablespoon dried thyme , crumbled
1 tablespoon dried oregano , crumbled
1 tablespoon sweet or hot Spanish paprika ( I use smoked , hot Spanish paprika )
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons ground cayenne ( perhaps half this amount if you plan to serve to kids )
Brine
2 quarts very cold water
¼ cup LunaCafe Spice Blend
¼ cup fine sea salt
Simple Dredge
¾ cup all - purpose flour
¾ cup white rice flour
1 tablespoon LunaCafe Spice Blend
To make LunaCafe Spice Blend , in a small bowl , combine the thyme , oregano , paprika , mustard , garlic powder , onion powder , pepper , and cayenne .
Mix well and reserve .
To brine the chicken , one or more days before frying , combine water , ¼ cup spice blend , and ¼ cup salt .
Stir to dissolve the salt .
In a glass bowl or plastic container , put the chicken and cover with the brine .
Make sure that the chicken is fully submerged in the brine .
Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days .
When you are ready to fry the chicken , remove it from the brine and lightly pat with paper towels .
Arrange on an edged baking sheet .
For the Simple Dredge , combine flour , rice flour , and LunaCafe Spice Blend .
Grind black pepper over all surfaces of each chicken piece .
Dip each piece of chicken into the flour and coat well , tapping off any excess that does not stick to the chicken .
Repeat .
Arrange on a wire rack set over an edged baking sheet .
For the Extra Crunch Dredge , prepare the Simple Dredge and then in a mixing bowl , whisk together the egg and milk .
After dipping each piece of chicken in the Simple Dredge , dip in the egg wash , and then again into the Simple Dredge .
Arrange on a wire rack set over an edged baking sheet .
For the Extra -Extra Crunch Dredge , prepare the Simple Dredge and then in a mixing bowl , whisk together the flour , milk , and eggs .
The batter should not be too thick .
Thin with more liquid if necessary .
After dipping each piece of chicken in the Simple Dredge , dip in the batter , and then again into the Simple Dredge .
Arrange on a wire rack set over an edged baking sheet .
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350° .
Set a wire rack over an edged baking sheet and reserve .
Heat about ¼- inch of oil in a heavy skillet or sauté pan to 350° .
Fry the chicken in batches , skin side down , until golden brown , turning every couple of minutes to evenly brown all sides , about 15 minutes total .
Remove with tongs and place on the wire rack .
When all pieces are browned and on the wire rack , put the baking sheet into the oven to complete the cooking .
Bake for 20 - 30 minutes , until the internal temperature of the meatiest part of the thigh registers 175° .
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and with tongs , place chicken pieces on a large serving platter .
Serve hot or warm .
Refrigerate any leftovers and eat cold later .
Serves 4 - 6

As part of its 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo presence , Microsoft announced that it would be introducing a games - on - demand download service through Xbox Live .
The initiative , which replaces the publisher 's current Xbox Originals program , will let Xbox 360 owners download full current - generation titles when it launches with a library of some 30 titles , including Mass Effect , BioShock , and Assassin 's Creed .
Warhawk is already flying the digital distribution skies .
For its part , Sony Computer Entertainment does not plan on countering its archrival 's on - demand game service .
Speaking with IndustryGamers , PlayStation Network Operations director Eric Lempel said that the size of PlayStation 3 games is a primary factor as to why full , current - generation software downloads wo n't be coming to the service he heads up anytime soon .
" It 's not something we have planned , just because the size of the games is massive , " Lempel said .
" With Blu-ray we can put up to 50 gigs on a dual - layer disc , while [ Xbox 360 ] is still on a 9 - gig media .
So technically it 's possible , but I think the issue would be , ' Do you want to download 40 gigs and keep that on your hard drive ? '
I think there 's great opportunity there in the future , and it 's something we 'll always look at , but for the time being it 's not a direction we 're going in . "
Though no dedicated games - on - demand service is planned , Sony is already involved with offering full games through the PSN .
In 2007 , Sony released its multiplayer - only action title Warhawk through the PSN as well as at retail .
Similarly , Slant Six 's online - only competitive shooter SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation was offered as a digital download and boxed product in 2008 .
Third - party publishers have also lent their wares to the PSN , with EA releasing Burnout Paradise through the service in September .
The PSN also offers numerous full PSP and original PlayStation games for download .

" Look at that idiot wearing his helmet on the back of his head , " my friend said .
Someone yelled " HOLY SHIT THAT'S 50 CENT !! "
He smiled and waved .
One person ran over and gave him a high five .
Then he drove off into the sunset , hopefully not cracking his skull open in the process .
O’Connor was a fervent Roman Catholic — a “ thirteenth century ” Catholic , as she described herself .
She read deeply into theology , with a special interest in Teilhard de Chardin .
She went to Mass every day she could , invariably accompanied by her mother .
Flannery and Regina ’s claustrophobic , mutually dependent relationship was inevitably vexing for both women — and mortifying for the daughter when the mother revealed to visitors her own less than edified social attitudes .
These domestic circumstances , in combination with Flannery ’s religiosity and visibly worsening health , hardly form a propitious setup for a gentleman caller .
But one did materialize .
In 1953 , she began to receive visits from Erik Langkjaer , a handsome , thoughtful Dane whose work as a college - textbook salesman regularly brought him to the Milledgeville area .
The friendship became , Gooch writes , “ at least tinged with romance . ”
On a drive together , they shared a fateful kiss .
Langkjaer , in one of the biography ’s most powerful passages , remembers this :
She had no real muscle tension in her mouth , a result being that my own lips touched her teeth rather than lips , and this gave me an unhappy feeling of a sort of memento mori , and so the kissing stopped … I had a feeling of kissing a skeleton , and in that sense it was a shocking experience .
It is very hard , reading this kind of thing , not to feel great sympathy for O’Connor and mix the feeling into one ’s evaluation of her work .
She herself would have rejected such a mixture .
“ My lupus has no business in literary considerations , ” she maintained .
This was true not only for critics but for the writer herself .
O’Connor ’s fiction gives few signs of her disease .
Wise Blood was more or less completed before the diagnosis , and her subsequent writing obviously was cut from the same pre-lupine bolt of obsessions .
Flannery O’Connor ’s preoccupations are so insistent that it is probably not ideal to read her work from beginning to end in one go , as I did .
Again and again , the same dynamic impresses itself : A and B and — why not ?
—C reveal their more or less cretinous moral natures and slide toward a bizarre , often violent crisis , the whole production unfolding under the auspices of a solar or lunar drama ( “ A fat yellow moon appeared in the branches of the fig tree as if it were going to roost there with the chickens ” ) .
Her settings are agrarian , static , unscientific , largely insulated from modern modes of information and movement .
We are given a tragicomic world of dirt roads , pigs , girls who are “ practically morons , ” “ trashy ” whites , idiotic “ niggers , ” and every stripe of schemer and nitwitted chatterer .
The dramatic premises are almost premodern , very easily concerned with religious visionaries or with the arrival , into an unchanging locale , of a stranger .
Grassroots evangelical Protestantism and its defective adherents are objects of fascination , though the appearance of an urbane secular party is generally a cue for a particularly grievous display of stupidity and pride .
The characters are not “ likeable , ” but my God they are alive .
The writing is almost unfairly good :
She lay her head back and as he watched , gradually her eyes closed and her mouth fell open to show a few long scattered teeth , some gold and some darker than her face ; she began to whistle and blow like a musical skeleton .
Or ( upon the arrival of refugee Poles at a farm ) :
She began to imagine a war of words , to see the Polish words and the English words coming at each other , stalking forward , not sentences , just words , gabble gabble gabble , flung out high and shrill and stalking forward and then grappling with each other .
She saw the Polish words , dirty and all - knowing and unreformed , flinging mud on the clean English words until everything was equally dirty .
She saw them all piled up in a room , all the dead dirty words , theirs and hers too , piled up like the naked bodies in the newsreel .
God save me , she cried silently , from the stinking power of Satan !
The narrating third person hovers in an almost miraculous fusion of proximity and comic distance .
With O’Connor , there never seems to be space between the words and their creator ’s sensibility .
You almost never catch a whiff of authorial self - consciousness .
About how many writers can this be said ?
Romani Rose , Vorsitzender des Zentralrats Deutscher Sinti und Roma , hat sich für eine Blockade auch von Hassseiten mithilfe der geplanten staatlichen Filterliste ausgesprochen .
Natürlich müssten entsprechende rechtsextremistische Inhalte im Web in die inzwischen gesetzlich verankerten Sperrbemühungen des Bundeskriminalamts ( BKA ) gegen Kinderpornographie mit aufgenommen werden , erklärte Rose am Rand einer Konferenz gegen die Verbreitung von Hass im Internet am heutigen Donnerstag gegenüber heise online .
Die Sperrung von Hass - Seiten könne nicht in einem
Wort genannt werden mit Filtertätigkeiten von Diktaturen , politische Meinungen aus dem Netz zu nehmen .
Prinzipiell trete seine Vereinigung gegen Zensur ein , hatte Rose zuvor auf dem Podium betont .
Die Freiheit der Information im Internet diene schließlich auch dem Schutz von Minderheiten .
Sinti und Roma würden aber in immer schlimmeren
Maße bedroht und mit rassistischer Propaganda diffamiert .
Dies stelle eine Gefahr für den Rechtsstaat dar .
Viele Internetseiten erinnerten an den " Stürmer " in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus .
Musik der Gruppe " Landser " etwa werde tausendfach über Videoportale wie YouTube verbreitet , obwohl diese hierzulande als kriminelle Vereinigung verurteilt worden sei .
Nach dem Herunternehmen entsprechender Clips , würden diese teils nur wieder eingestellt unter der Bezeichnung : " Netzwerk gegen Zensur " .
Ein strafrechtliches Vorgehen gegen dieses Treiben sei kaum möglich .
Es sei daher unbedingt nötig , " neue Mittel und Wege " zur Bekämpfung von Hassseiten zu finden .
Neben einer Vereinbarung zu Sperren mit der Internetindustrie machte sich Rose für die Einrichtung einer europäischer Aufsichtsstelle im Stile der von den Bundesländern getragenen Organisation jugendschutz.net oder des 18 Länder umfassenden International Network Against CyberHate ( INACH ) stark .
Diese sollte das Internet laufend überwachen und auf eine Sperrung ausgemachter Seiten hinwirken .
Die bei der Vorläuferkonferenz 2000 beschlossene Erklärung gegen Hass im Netz bezeichnete der Zentralratsvorsitzende als " Signal an Politik , Wirtschaft und Zivilgesellschaft für ein globales Bündnis " .
Dazu sollten jetzt wirksame Schritte eingeleitet werden .
Er sei " entsetzt " , dass die Kontrolle durch den Staat kaum greife und die Strafverfolgung beim Bekanntwerden einschlägiger Webseiten of eingestellt werde mit der Begründung , dass der Server sich im Ausland befinde .
Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries , die zu der Tagung geladen hatte , setzte ihre Hoffnung vor allem auf internationale " Netzwerke " zur Koordination des gemeinsamen Vorgehens gegen extremistische Internet - Propaganda .
Diese könnten helfen , dass entsprechende Inhalte auf freiwilliger Basis über die Ansprache der Host - Anbieter aus dem Netz verschwänden .
" Nur mit dem Strafrecht kommen wir nicht weiter " , betonte die SPD - Politikerin .
Wichtig sei es auch , das " Engagement im Netz mit den Mitteln des Netzes " zu erhöhen .
Sie verwies in diesem Zusammenhang auf viele Initiativen wie " Mut gegen rechte Gewalt " , " Blick nach rechts " , " Gesicht zeigen " , das NPD - Blog oder die vom Justizministerium finanziell unterstützten " Störungsmelder " .
Als weitere Felder des nötigen Engagements nannte Zypries die Förderung der Medienkompetenz und die Aufklärung über Strategien der Rechten , digitale Gegendemonstrationen und Mitmachaktionen über " witzig gemachte " Videos oder das " Füllen von Gästebüchern " auf rechtsextremen Webseiten .
Letztlich handele es sich um eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe , den Hass aus dem Netz und aus den Köpfen der Menschen zu bekommen , die bis hin zur Integrationspolitik reichen müsse .
Generell forderte die Ministerin mehr Kooperationsbereitschaft : " Online wie Offline wird es entscheidend darauf ankommen , dass Staat und Zivilgesellschaft gemeinsam handeln . "
Inwieweit die Zusammenarbeit bereits funktioniert , führte Stefan Glaser von jugendschutz.net aus .
Demnach bestehen " in 80 Prozent der unzulässigen Angebote im In- und Ausland Handlungsmöglichkeiten . "
Während in Deutschland Provider " zu 100 Prozent " reagieren und entsprechende Inhalte herunternehmen würden , gebe es in den USA etwa zwar keine entsprechenden rechtlichen Möglichkeiten .
Jugendschutz.net agiere dort aber auf Basis der Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen der Provider .
Diese würden oft Klauseln gegen " Hate Speech " enthalten .
" Sehr gute Kooperationsansätze " lobte Glaser auch bei YouTube : " Nahezu 100 Prozent der weitergeleiteten Videos werden zeitnah entfernt . "
Das Problem des erneuten Uploads werde damit aber nicht gelöst .
Es bestehe so weiterer Handlungsbedarf , " damit diese Inhalte nachhaltig verschwinden " .
Gefunden werde müsse etwa ein länderübergreifende Konsens zur Ächtung von Hass im Netz .
Der Präsident des Bundesamts für Verfassungsschutz , Heinz Fromm , sprach von der großen Gefahr , dass Jugendliche und Erwachsene im Cyberspace " unvermittelt Hetze ausgesetzt sind " .
Er warf sein Augenmerk vor allem auf die Möglichkeiten durch das Internet , Propaganda für Terrorismus und den Dschihad zu betreiben .
Eine " Cyber - Mobilisierung " finde statt , die von der schnellen Bildung netzwerkartiger Strukturen über geographische Grenzen hinweg bis hin zur Entwicklung handlungsfähiger radikaler Gruppierungen reiche .
Extremisten könnten mit dem Internet eine Breitenwirkung erhalten , die sie auf herkömmlichen
Wege niemals zu erreichen wäre .
Deutsche Nachrichtendienste und Strafverfolger hätten daher ein Gemeinsames Internetzentrum gegründet und ihre Ressourcen gegen den Aufbau einer solchen Drohkulisse gebündelt .
" Wir haben nicht die Illusion , dass wir diese Dinge unmittelbar aus dem Netz entfernen können " , machte Fromm klar .
Die rechtlichen Schwierigkeiten seien zu groß .
Es sei daher wichtig , " die gesellschaftlichen Kräfte zu mobilisieren , um dem Hass entgegenzutreten " .

( CNN ) --
An Arkansas man was arrested Monday in connection with a shooting at a Little Rock military recruiting center that killed one soldier and wounded another , authorities said .
Police identified the suspect as Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad , formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe .
Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad -- a 24 - year - old Little Rock resident formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe -- faces a first - degree murder charge and 15 counts of engaging in a terrorist act , Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas said .
The terrorist counts stem from the shots fired at an occupied building .
While authorities continued to investigate a motive , Thomas said Muhammad is a Muslim convert and , based on preliminary interviews with him , investigators believe there were " political and religious motives " in the shooting .
Military officials initially believed the shooting was a random act , but Thomas said police believe the shooter acted alone " with the specific purpose of targeting military personnel . "
The soldier who was killed was identified as Pvt. William Long , 24 , of Conway , and the wounded soldier is Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula , 18 , of Jacksonville , Thomas said .
Ezeagwula is in stable condition and expected to recover , the police chief said .
" I 'm relieved there 's a suspect in custody , " said Capt .
Matthew Feehan , commander of the center .
Feehan said seven other recruiters were in the building , but nobody else was injured .
Thomas said police recovered three guns from Muhammad 's black Ford SUV : an SKS semi-automatic rifle , a . 22 - caliber rifle and a pistol .
The victims were just out of basic training and had not been deployed , said Lt. Col .
Thomas F. Artis , commander of the Oklahoma recruiting battalion that oversees the Little Rock recruiting center .
Melvin Bledsoe of Memphis , Tennesee , who was listed on the police report as Muhammad 's father , declined to comment , referring questions to Little Rock Police .
The soldiers were part of a recruiting program called " hometown recruiting assistance , " Artis said .
Under the program , recruiters have the soldiers tell their stories to potential recruits .
It 's a volunteer position taken while soldiers are visiting or based back in their home region , Artis said .
The FBI has opened an investigation into the incident , said Steven Frazier , spokesman for the agency 's Little Rock office .
" Based on what we find , we will determine whether there is any federal jurisdiction to prosecute , " he said .
CNN 's Mike Phelan , Mike Mount and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .

Crisis pregnancy centers are fake clinics that provide deceptive and erroneous information to both pregnant and non-pregnant women on pregnancy , abortion , and contraception .
And they often brazenly violate the separation of church and state .
So why has the Congress been funneling so much money to these centers ?
And will the powerful Congressman David Obey continue to do so despite the evidence ?
This special report on Crisis Pregnancy Centers is a joint project of Rewire , the Feminist Majority Foundation and Stuart Productions .
A must - watch video accompanies this story , and can be viewed below .
These three organizations will be joined by Advocates for Youth and the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States ( SIECUS ) for an audio press conference on crisis pregnancy centers on Wednesday , July 8th 2009 .
This week and next , the powerful House Appropriations Labor Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Committee is conducting hearings on its FY 2010 spending bill .
President Obama has made his intentions clear .
The President ’s FY 2010 budget calls for a return to science - based initiatives and an end to federal funding for abstinence - only education programs .
The question is will Congress follow his lead ?

As women ’s and comprehensive sexual health care advocates , we hope so .
Hunter Stuart takes a close look at “ crisis pregnancy centers , ” some of which are federally funded , that often give out inaccurate medical information , prosthelytize and use shame and scare tactics when counseling women .
For eight years the Bush Administration and Congress funneled $ 1 billion - plus to failed abstinence - only - until - marriage programs .
Even after the Democrats assumed control of the House , Appropriations Committee Chair David Obey ( D - WI - 7 ) managed to direct more and more fistfuls of cash to the abstinence - only education industry .
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service ’s own commissioned report on federally funded abstinence - only education programs concluded they do not delay the onset of sexual activity .
In other words , they do n’t work .
The report found that young people educated under abstinence - only curricula are more likely than their peers to think condoms do n’t help prevent sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) including HIV , Chlamydia , gonorrhea , herpes and HPV .
The National Abstinence Education Association ( NAEA ) recently published a letter on its website for its supporters to send to Representative Obey beseeching him to continue funding abstinence - only education .
The letter states :
“ … the President ’s ( budget ) request would remove an important primary prevention skill - building message to 2.5 million students each year .
With 1 in 4 teen girls having at least 1 STD and the teen birth rate beginning to inch upward , it is vital that teens receive skills that will equip them to make the healthiest choice for their sexual health .
Only abstinence education provides these skills . ”
A whopper of a conclusion – given the evidence , given the facts , given the truth .
This is the definition of Non Sequitur .
Their concern about rising teen pregnancy rates and STI ’s strikes us as disingenuous given where the money ’s been going .
So - called crisis pregnancy centers ( CPCs ) or fake clinics have received a substantial portion of abstinence - only federal appropriations .
In fact , the number of these bogus clinics has dramatically increased because of it .
Among the most cynical of medical charades , CPCs simulate the appearance of comprehensive women ’s health care facilities .
While advertising under “ abortion services , ” CPCs routinely lure young women – especially targeting women college students and low - income women — into their facilities with offers of free pregnancy tests and “ options counseling . ”
In reality , a vast number of CPCs promote scientific and medical fallacies about the consequences of abortion and birth control to intimidate women out of seeking these services .
These lies range from the most outrageous — that abortion causes breast cancer and suicide — to the most irresponsible – that condoms will not protect you from HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections .
These claims are blatantly false .
The National Cancer Institute and World Health Organization definitively state there is no link between abortion and breast cancer .
As noted on the NCI website , for example :
[ O ]ver several decades a considerable amount of research has been and continues to be conducted to determine whether having an induced abortion , or a miscarriage ( also known as spontaneous abortion ) , influences a woman ’s chances of developing breast cancer later in life .
In February 2003 , the National Cancer Institute
( NCI ) convened a workshop of over 100 of the world ’s leading experts
who study pregnancy and breast cancer risk .
Workshop participants
reviewed existing population - based , clinical ,
and animal studies on the relationship between pregnancy and breast
cancer risk , including studies of induced and spontaneous abortions .
They concluded that having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase
a woman ’s subsequent risk of developing breast cancer .
A summary of
their findings , titled Summary Report : Early Reproductive Events and Breast Cancer Workshop , can be found at http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/ere-workshop-report.
Multiple studies , including one released last summer by the American Psychological Association , confirm there is no credible evidence between an elective abortion and mental health problems .
And , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the consistent use of condoms is a highly effective method of preventing HIV / AIDS in addition to helping reduce the risk of transmission for many sexually transmitted infections .
The flagrant deceit documented in the video accompanying this article will shock most people – regardless of their political persuasion .
A review of the websites of some of the largest CPC recipients of federal funding reveals these centers perpetuate these offensive , ideologically - driven misrepresentations and scare tactics thanks to the public dole .
One federally funded CPC feigns to offer “ … accurate and factual information about your pregnancy options ” online .
But listed under Risk # 1 - Breast Cancer , the first of the ‘ documented medical risks ’ of abortion , the website falsely claims “ … there is credible evidence to link abortion to ( breast ) cancer , ” and “ Abortion interrupts the natural process of breast development , leaving the breast with more cells that can become cancerous . ”
Under Risk # 4 – Suicide , the website misleadingly states , “ Research shows there is an increased risk of self - harm , suicide attempts and suicide ( twice as likely ) for women who have had an abortion . ”
Finally , under the heading “ Spiritual / Moral Consequences , ” the website ominously declares , “ Having an abortion may affect more than just your body and your mind – it may have an impact on your relationship with God . ”
So what is it going to be ?
Will Congress continue to place the health and lives of young women ( and men ) on the line by pumping millions of dollars into failed abstinence - only education programs while almost half of the 19 million new sexually transmitted infections occurring each year are among young people ages 15 - 24 ?
Will more taxpayer dollars go to fake women ’s health clinics while scientifically and medically - proven family planning programs continue to be grossly under - funded ?
Will we continue to subsidize facilities that may frighten women with misinformation and lies ?
The time is now to stop this crisis of deception .
Take action today and tell House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. David
Obey we can’t afford to continue funding for abstinence - only education programs–including fake clinics –that are harming our young women and men .
Take action today and tell House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. David
Obey we can’t afford to continue funding for abstinence - only education programs , including fake clinics , that are harming our young women and men .
Or call Representative Obey ’s office directly at 202-225-3365 and urge him to end abstinence - only education funding in the Labor HHS FY 2010 budget .
There is no time to waste .
Making a regular OLED display is , like , hard .
So you can imagine making a flexible one just totally sucks .
Arizona State 's Flexible Display Center and Universal Display Corporation have a new way to make bendy OLED screens that might make mass production possible in just a few years .

It 's simpler than the crazy ion blaster technique Samsung used to produce their flexible OLED display , adapting the " traditional " process of manufacturing OLED displays ( UDC uses vacuum thermal evaporation ) in a more " benign " way so that it can be implemented directly on a soft piece of plastic , hence the potential for mass production .
Essentially , the plastic substrate is glued to a piece of glass while they process it , and then it 's carefully peeled off .
What you end up with is an OLED implemented directly on plastic .
That said , while FDC believes " most of the key manufacturing roadblocks have been addressed and it's time to start thinking seriously about commercial production , " commercial gadgets with flexible OLED displays are still a few years away .
And we 're talking like 4 - 6 inches , not even 8 - 10 for a bendy tablet thing .
On the upside , they think they can get the price premiums down to " no more than 10 percent " above existing display prices within the first 5 years of commercial production .
We 'll see .
FDC and Universal Display Corporation Make Breakthrough in Flexible Display Manufacturing Process ; Advance Flexible OLEDs Closer to Mass Market TEMPE , Ariz .
– June 1 , 2009 - The Flexible Display Center ( FDC ) at Arizona State University and Universal Display Corporation ( NASDAQ : PANL ) , today introduced the first a - Si: H active matrix flexible organic light - emitting diode ( OLED ) display to be manufactured directly on DuPont Teijin 's polyethylene naphthalate ( PEN ) substrate .
Implementing Universal Display Corporation 's phosphorescent organic light - emitting diode ( PHOLED ) technology and materials and the FDC 's proprietary bond - debond manufacturing technology , the 4.1 - inch monochrome quarter video graphics array ( QVGA ) display represents a significant milestone towards achieving a manufacturable solution for flexible OLEDs .
Flexible OLEDs are designed to target a number of military and commercial applications that require more rugged displays .
With Universal Display 's PHOLED technology and materials , the new display achieves the same brightness as traditional displays with extremely low power consumption .
Additional advantages of the technology include lower operating temperature due to less heat being generated , easier to drive , longer battery life , and more stable transistors .
" Being a founding member of the Flexible Display Center , Universal Display is pleased to see the significant progress enabled by our cooperation , " said Mike Hack , Vice President of Strategic Product Development at Universal Display .
" Together , the FDC and Universal Display have demonstrated technology paths which will accelerate the introduction of exciting new flexible OLED displays on plastic substrates . "
" This development of flexible AMOLED technology gives the industry a solid starting point towards manufacturing , mass production and commercialization of flexible OLEDs , " said Shawn O'Rourke , director of engineering for the FDC .
" The fact that we have achieved a functional flexible OLED manufactured directly on plastic using the Center 's manufacturing process represents a significant achievement , and continued developments over the next few years will lead to full color , full motion video flexible displays . "
The flexible backplane display was manufactured at the Flexible Display Center utilizing a 180 °C thin film transistor process .
The FDC 's facility implements traditional flat panel and semiconductor tools and processes to achieve flexible displays , enabled by its proprietary bond - debond technology to secure the plastic substrate to a rigid carrier during manufacture .
The integration of Universal Display 's PHOLED frontplane delivers a key enabling technology for the flexible OLED .
The PHOLED materials allow the OLED to convert up to 100 percent of the electrical energy into light , as opposed to traditional fluorescent OLEDs which convert only 25 percent , providing up to four times more energy efficiency .
Universal Display integrated the FDC backplane designed for its PHOLED frontplane to produce the display .
The FDC and Universal Display will present a paper discussing the active matrix flexible OLED on Friday June 5th in session 65.4 at SID 2009 .
Additionally , the FDC will demonstrate this device and other flexible display technologies in booth # 523 at the show .
Universal Display , located at booth # 676 at the show , and DuPont Teijin are members of the Flexible Display Center .

We are 1.17 billion and continuing , where are we heading ?
We are heading to outscore China by 2050 says UN .
For all Indians ’ kind notice China is 3 times larger than India in total area .
Finally our health minister Gulab Nabi Azad had at least a statement to make on Population control couple days back .
He suggested couples to watch TV instead of having sex .
I ’m not sure whether he was making a point or sarcastic .
30 years have gone by when we first started efforts on population control , though the India had commendable vision on population , our government carried out the task very infamously .
All discredit and credit goes to one man late Sanjay Gandhi .
For this sole reason no political parties want to raise this issue again and are reluctant to have their say categorically .
Immediately after Azad Saheb made his statements , media started to conduct the debates .
The leftist has view that “ Development is the best contraceptive “ and rightist had their view as development can not be reached to the bottom of the pyramid in immediate effect .
So need some stringent actions .
Now that they have put their views , as common man let us talk some sense now .
Let us understand what the factors are causing population explosion .
We have both good and bad news to talk .
If we try to understand demography of India , socio economic classes , we could see some light why is that India growing its human species and depleting in other species .
In spite India showed record growth of 10 % the status of Indian poor remains same .
Good news is that educated middle class of India understood population theory very well , and studies shows that Kerala being highly literate state records low fertility growth .
So the inference can be drawn that except from educated middle class and above ( of course not the literate fundamentalists ) , bad news is with rest of the people , the rest of socio economic classes had never understood the equation rather they lacked the awareness on the impacts of population growth .
They failed to cognize it as major issue of the country .
Only people benefited from free condom kiosks were sex workers .
The fact why poor in India go on and on is very logical for them .
Poor mother in India counts her breads by number of children she has , more the children , more is the bread .
It ’s logical for her to think like that as her family has no economic or social stability .
Next is the category of small farmers .
Nowadays agriculture is difficult affair for farmers who have little land .
Increased labor costs , decreasing labors as many are moving to urban , increased fertilizers and chemicals costs .
So they do n’t hesitate to give birth to third child as they want more people to work in fields .
Next class is religious class ; I need not to talk about this .
So all these people together make huge pie in the population circle .
So , how can we overcome ?
Commissions after commissions are formed , they came , they studied , they reported .
Reports of commissions will start loosing their relevance to current conditions before government has some concrete action plans , and fresh start by fresh government will take full five fresh years for just commission to get to the report .
So saga of inaction and apathy by Indian government continues , and pushes the problem towards deadlock .
If it all government is interested in taking some serious actions ( not like they did in 70s ) ,
It can neither go in left nor in right it need to go straight and very straight about the problem .
Government has to fragment the problem and solutions based on demographics , and strart addressing them in parallel rather relying on age old sequential , time consuming methods .

In this article , I ’m hoping to give you some tips and insight into HTML5 to help ease the inevitable pain that comes with transitioning to a slightly different syntax .
Welcome to HTML5 .
What are the basics ?
The DOCTYPE
When I first started researching HTML5 a few months ago , one of the main things I struggled to find was the doctype .
A simple thing , you ’d think it would be everywhere , but after much frustration , I finally found it buried within w3.org and here it is :
<! DOCTYPE html >
I was also curious why they chose to “ html ” rather than “ html5 ” , it seemed like the logical way to tell a browser that the current document was written in HTML5 , and offered a good template for the future .
But I found that <! DOCTYPE html5 > triggers Quirks Mode in IE6 , and when taking backwards compatibility into consideration <! DOCTYPE html > is a pretty good choice ( in my opinion ) .
Overall , I really like the new DOCTYPE ; it ’s small , meaningful , and maybe we ’ll actually be able to remember this one by heart and not have to paste it from site to site .
New Elements you should know
At first glance , with HTML5 , the new elements immediately jump out and command attention .
The W3C really listened to the community and planned for the future when architecting the abundance of new elements available .
We have everything from basic structural elements like < header > and < footer > to others like < canvas > and < audio > that tap into , what seems to be , a very powerful API which allows us the freedom to create more user - friendly applications while further distancing ourselves from reliance on Flash for saving data and intense animation .
The new structural elements
< header >
The header element contains introductory information to a section or page .
This can involve anything from our normal documents headers ( branding information ) to an entire table of contents .
The header element contains introductory information to a section or page .
This can involve anything from our normal documents headers ( branding information ) to an entire . < nav >
The nav element is reserved for a section of a document that contains links to other pages or links to sections of the same page .
Not all link groups need to be contained within the element , just primary navigation .
The nav element is reserved for a section of a document that contains links to other pages or links to sections of the same page .
Not all link groups need to be contained within the < section >
The section element represents a generic document or application section .
It acts much the same way a < div > does by separating off a portion of the document .

< article >
The article element represents a portion of a page which can stand alone such as : a blog post , a forum entry , user submitted comments or any independent item of content .
The article element represents a portion of a page which can stand alone such as : a blog post , a forum entry , user submitted comments or any . < aside >
Aside , represents content related to the main area of the document .
This is usually expressed in sidebars that contain elements like related posts , tag clouds , etc .
They can also be used for pull quotes .

This is usually expressed in sidebars that contain elements like related posts , tag clouds , etc .
They can also be used for . < footer >
The footer element is for marking up the footer of , not only the current page , but each section contained in the page .
So , it ’s very likely that you ’ll be using the element multiple times within one page .
When you take a look at these new elements , it looks like they ’re just replacing our common DIV IDs ; and in a way , it ’s true .
But , the diagram below shows that elements like < header > and < footer > can be used more than once on a single page where they behave more like classes and normal HTML elements that you can use over and over again to retain a semantic structure .
Elements like < header > and < footer > are not just meant to represent the top and bottom of the current document , but they also represent the < header > and < footer > of each document section , much the way we use < thead > and < tfoot > in data tables .
The benefits of using these structural elements is mainly due to the fact that they are extremely well defined and provide a great way to semantically structure your document .
However , these elements do need to be used with some careful thought because they can , very easily be overused .

Easing the transition from XHTML
Even though HTML 4.01 , XHTML 1.0 , & HTML5 are all very similar there are some small syntax differences that can , very easily , slip past anyone and invalidate code .
Keeping this in mind , HTML5 has some built - in “ slack ” to make the transition a little easier .
For example , when marking up a form in HTML5 , this is the proper syntax for an input text element :
< input type =" text " id =" name " >
But this is also accepted as valid code in an attempt to ease the pain for avid XHTML coders ( like myself ) who are used to self - closing elements :
< input type =" text " id =" name " / >
The same rules apply to < meta > and other self closing elements .
Legacy elements like < b > and < i > were also left in to help those coming over from HTML 4.01.l
What are the benefits ?
With any new technology there has to be benefit ; why else would you use it ?
If your old code works just as well and efficient as the new code there ’s no reason to upgrade .
No reason at all , trust me , I checked .
Luckily HTML5 is packed with cool new features , code slimming techniques and a lot of stuff I would call very large benefits .
Most of which circle around the new APIs and the DOM tree .
Extending the API
The most obvious benefit built into HTML5 is the numerous APIs and the opportunities it opens up for the future of web apps with Holy Grail of application cache and offline capabilities .
Google Gears gave us offline data storage and Flash introduced us to the power of application cache ( Pandora uses it to save your log in information ) .
With HTML5 , these capabilities are now available to use right in the language and can easily be expanded with JavaScript .
HTML5 relies on light scripting to flex its muscles on the Web ; this is very possibly the first time , other than jQuery , that one ( front - end ) technology has fully acknowledged another .
Sure , we connect them with classes and IDs but up until now , they have been perceived as separate layers by the principles of progressive enhancement .
But as the Web grows we need unity like this across the Web .
Offline Data Storage
The coolest part about HTML5 is definitely its offline capabilities .
Programs like Thunderbird and Outlook ( and now GMail to an extent ) let you browse through your old data while staying offline .
With HTML5 , you ’ll have this same functionality , but in the browser .
This is the first serious step towards bridging the gap between the desktop and the Web , and opens all sorts of doors for the future of Web apps .
The W3C has taken the best parts from the various Web technologies and rolled them into , what is being dubbed the most powerful markup language to date .
Some other of the HTML5 APIs
Drag & Drop
The drag and drop API defines an event - based drag and drop system .
However , it never defines what “ drag and drop ” is .
This API requires JavaScript to fully work as normal think drag and drop functionality .
Video & Audio
The audio & video APIs are massive upgrades in media embedding .
Although support is limited right now , something like video embedding has never been easier : < video width = " 400 " height = " 360 " src=" vid.mp4 " >
Geolocation Geolocation is a very cool API available within HTML5 .
Its object can be used to programmatically determine location information through a device ’s user agent ( hint hint : mobile devices ) .

Where can I use it ?
Even with the very limited support for HTML5 , the Web is far too progressive to not create a testing environment for us to play around .
Currently , Safari is our best testing platform , as it supports most of the new elements and APIs .
Of course , that may change at anytime so keep and eye on Opera , Chrome and Firefox as well .
Normally you might think since Safari is a Webkit browser , by default , all Webkit browsers would support the same elements , unfortunately , this is n’t the case .
While many of the HTML5 features are supported across the board in Webkit browsers , there are some , like < video > , that are not .
Mobile devices
To effectively use HTML5 right now , we need to be able to control the environment in which it is used .
Since support is not as widespread as we ’d like it does n’t make real sense for it to be heavily used unless , of course , we can lock down the usage to certain platforms which have HTML5 support .
With Webkit leading the way for HTML5 , we can safely focus on devices powered by Webkit .
The 3 hottest mobile devices right now : The Palm Pre , iPhone 3Gs and the new Google Android phone all have browsers that are based off the Webkit rendering engine .
Safari is even leading the way on the mobile HTML5 front ;
The iPhone ( with the latest software upgrade ) is the only device I could get to properly render the < audio > element .
Because these devices are so young and all use the same rendering engine , the likelihood of them pushing a rapid software upgrade is pretty high .
Right now , you can confidently use many of the HTML5 features in iPhone Web app development and mostly likely expect Pre and Android to follow in suit .

How can we move forward ?
Even with all the recent hype surrounding HTML5 and how we all want to use it , it is still going to be a very slow transition away from HTML4.01 & XHTML1.0 .
It will take time to get developers up to speed , test all the features , waiting for all the : ahem : browsers to catch up , and it will take an especially long time for users to transition out of those old browsers .
With all that in mind , we know who we are , we ’re all reading this article ( I ’ve read it about 30 times so far ) and we know we have to find a legitimate way to move forward without damaging the past .
We ca n’t make the full switch yet and there ’s no use at this point pointing out who is holding up the show .
We all know that any responsible developer would not drop support for a browser that is still heavily used .
So rather than yell at a brick wall , here are some things I ’ve found that might help us move forward in a positive way :
Semantic DIV naming
Semantically aligning your DIV names with that of the new HTML5 elements will help you get used to the names themselves and also the new functionality and nesting that they want you to do with the < header > and < footer > elements .
These are akin to learning the intro to Enter Sandman ( for the guitarist out there ) ; it ’s not very difficult , but it takes a little practice to get it to feel natural .
Before jumping in full - force to HTML5 production sites , I recommend trying the soft transition with changing your DIV names slightly .
There ’s no downside that I ’ve found to doing this , you can even use the new DOCTYPE with very little consequence .
Faking it with JavaScript
First off , I ’d like to say : Please do n’t do this in production .
If the client side scripting fails , it will completely collapse the site in browsers that wo n’t take CSS applied to the new elements .
This is simply not a good option .
It is , however , an option and I ’m all about knowing your options no matter what they are .
Creating the new elements with JavaScript
Working in jQuery is cool and all , but as it turns out , there is a built in function to JavaScript to deal with creating new elements :
document.createElement (‘ header ’ ) ; document.createElement(‘ footer ’ ) ; document.createElement(‘ section ’ ) ; document.createElement(‘aside ’ ) ; document.createElement(‘nav’ ) ; document.createElement(‘ article’ ) ; document.createElement(‘ figure ’ ) ; document.createElement(‘ time ’ ) ;
… and so on in that fashion .
This will allow you to style these elements in Internet Explorer .
Again , the downside of using this technique is that , without the all - important JavaScript , the site will not only be unstyled , all the unrecognized elements will default to inline .
So your site will literally collapse on itself .
Client side JavaScript is not the answer for using HTML5 .
Server side javascript , now that ’s a completely different story …
Building browser - specific apps
I ’ve always promoted building sites for your audience , so depending on your audience , building browser - specific applications may be a real option .
As I mentioned above , it ’s all about controlling the environment , if we can control the environment we can control features delivered to the user much better .
Google is currently attempting to do this with Google Wave .
The idea behind Google ’s new monster product is to revolutionize communication , and do so with the newest technology .
Google
Wave is built in HTML5 and is n’t usable in all browsers yet .
But that ’s alright since they ’re controlling the audience by only releasing it to select developers for testing .
With Wave , Google is pushing HTML5 as far as it will go ( and even a little further ) .
They are taking blogs , wikis , instant messaging , e-mail and synchronous communication to the next level by combining them into place .
Here is what the Wave inbox looks like .
Below is a sort of wiki / chat area with all sorts of real - time communication treats for you to check out ( once they release it ) .
Google
Wave being powered by HTML5 is definitely the biggest step forward we have seen in this area .
They have done a phenomenal job putting together a creative and innovative product .
Focusing on the mobile
Just like Google is currently doing with Wave by selectively releasing it to developers , we can control the viewing environment when working with mobile devices .
By grabbing the user agent , we can design specific applications that use HTML5 for supported devices .
Targeting the user agent of a device is not an ideal method in designing for the general mobile web , but when we need to specifically target a device , like the iPhone , Pre or Google ’s Android it ’s a pretty solid option .
Right now , the best mobile testing platform we have is the iPhone .
With the recent software upgrade , it is very close to having full support .
But , if you just want to use the new elements , most any of the big 3 mobile platforms will work fine .
If you ’re looking for API support I suggest testing on the iPhone with the new upgraded software .
Conclusion
With the strong foundations set up by previous versions of ( X ) HTML and large community activity surrounding Web standards , we ’re coming into a new age with a wealth of knowledge and the ability to learn from our past mistakes ( and make some new ones ) .
HTML5 is being set up with the expectations of a very powerful markup language and it ’s up to us to utilize it in a way that can benefit us all .
There are so many great features to look forward to from new elements to tons of killer APIs .
We can make data available offline , easily combine technologies and create very intricate animations all within a familiar landscape .
If you have the time , I encourage you to browse through the entire spec and familiarize yourself even further with all the bells and whistles ( there are a lot ) so we can use HTML5 to build stronger , richer Web applications for years to come .
Here ’s to HTML5 , let ’s hope it lives up to the hype .

Wealthy first - time convicts are turning to a novel cottage industry : prison coaches with advice on what it 's like inside the big house .
Feeding off of notorious financial scandals , consultants school anxious inmates for fees of up to $ 20,000 .
White - collar convicts such as Martha Stewart and Bernard Madoff sought their help to learn about inmate life .
" After all , it 's not like planning your vacation , " Ira Sorkin , Madoff 's lawyer , says of the service that the Wall Street swindler used to prepare for his 150 - year prison term .
Madoff and Stewart got their penitentiary insight from the Baltimore - based National Center for Institutions and Alternatives .
Herbert Hoelter , its co-founder , says the firm waived its fee for Madoff because his assets were frozen .
At least a half - dozen similar firms have emerged across the country .
Steven Oberfest , for instance , touts himself as an " inmate adaptation specialist " and offers a course in close - quarters combat .
" I can prepare you to go into hell , " says Oberfest , an ex-convict who opened his firm after the 2002 Enron collapse .
Oberfest and his competitors are unapologetic about their business models , which play on the fears of first - time offenders sometimes going from lavish penthouses and estates to dank cellblocks and prison yards .
Larry Levine , a Los Angeles - area consultant , this year changed his company name from American Prison Consultants to Wall Street Prison Consultants .
Levine , who served 10 years for drug trafficking , securities violations and distribution of machine guns , says his " Fedtime101 " course covers it all .
He says he helps offenders avoid assault , cope with the " daily grind , " decode prison lingo and even avoid " bad prison jobs . "
His website has photos depicting the harsh transition " from the exchange floor to the prison yard . "
Last week , the New York Stock Exchange Group demanded that Levine drop the references , arguing that they tarnish the exchange 's image .

Eating is one of life 's most important activities , and the same applies in space .
Every astronaut eats three times a day , and yesterday for lunch , Adam and I had space food .
It was awesome .

So how did everything taste ?
On the whole , surprisingly good !
But before we delve into our detailed taste test , a word about what we were eating .
I spoke to Vickie Kloeris , the Subsystem Manager for Shuttle and ISS Food Systems — NASA 's head chef — and she walked me through exactly what goes into the vittles consumed in orbit by our astronauts .
Essentially , NASA does exactly what the army does with its MREs ( Meals Ready to Eat ) , with a few exceptions : MREs are designed to keep an 18 - to 22 - year - old , extremely active soldier fueled and ready , whereas space food must be nutritionally tailored to older and less - active adults , so in general , space food is lower in fat , calories and salt .

For space food , the main criteria are spoilage resistance , easy preparation and consumption in microgravity ( ie no potato chips ) , plus storage - space considerations .
There are five classifications of space foods : rehydrateable ( just add water ) , thermostabilized ( already wet , heat in its metallic / plastic pouch and eat ) , irradiated ( cooked irradiated meats ready to eat ) , intermediate moisture ( meaning dried fruits , jerky , and such ) and natural form ( better known as junk food — ready to eat without any prep or storage concerns ) .
On the Space Station , there is a food prep area in the Russian half that has a fold - down dining table along with food package heaters .
But soon , as the station is expanded to accommodate a crew of six later this month , a second , smaller food prep area will be added — this time equipped with a chiller , which is a first for the station — refrigeration specifically for food products .
Cold drinks in space !
Vickie was kind enough to ship out a batch of goodies that did n't make it into orbit from the last ISS mission , and we dined on them for lunch .
We did n't have a specialized thermostabilized pouch heater — and you can't microwave these puppies — so we just dunked them in boiling water for a while until they heated through .
We made it through six courses including dessert :

Here , our menu in detail :

First Course : Southwestern Corn , Potato Medley
While it may have looked a little rough in the thermostabilized packet , corn was actually pretty tasty , and had the correct consistency .
The Southwest was apparently represented by flecks of red and green pepper and a mild spiciness .
But the potato medley — oh the potato medley .
Do n't know what to say — there was a really strange chemical bitterness , from where it came I do not know .
But not good .
Rating : Two Stars

Second Course : Breakfast Sausage Links , Curry Sauce w/ Vegetables
Awesome .
Fingering pork sausage links inside a packet is not super pleasant , let me tell you , but out of the packet they were perfectly edible — fairly salty and a little stringy and dry , but with good taste .
And dipped in the curry sauce ?
Yes .
Sausages and curry go incredibly well together here on earth , and in space it 's no different .

Third Course : Beef Enchiladas , Baked Beans , Tortillas
Wow .
Delicious .
As the busted enchiladas slid out of the packet , we were scared .
But the flavor was right on — equal to if not better than any frozen enchilada you can get at the store .
And the baked beans — oh my — Adam had three helpings .
Taste was great , consistency perfect — and wrapped in a tortilla , which Kloeris says is one of the most versatile space foods ( understandable ) , the combination was fantastic .
I could fuel my spacewalks with this combo for months .

Fourth Course : Chicken Teriyaki , Creamed Spinach
Yikes .
As you saw in the video , the chicken teriyaki was nasty .
I do n't know if we got a bad pouch or what , but the chicken was mushy to the point of being hardly recognizable as chicken .
And the smell .
Oh the smell .
Not sure what went wrong here , but this was more akin to dog food than teriyaki .
AVOID !

As for the creamed spinach , that was our only freeze - dried food item .
In space , you would use the small tube opening to inject hot water with a syringe and smush it around in the package until it was done , but we reconstituted it in a bowl , and it came out alright .
Kind of bland , but edible .
We did n't spend long on it though because we wanted that chicken teriyaki out of our sight as soon as possible .

Fifth Course : Chicken w/ Peanut Sauce , Green Beans w/ Potatoes
Definitely an improvement .
The chicken here was in more recognizable texture and shape , and the peanut sauce , while not particularly delicious , was certainly more edible than the teriyaki sauce .
And the green beans and potatoes were pretty much the same as your typical canned fare , so not bad at all .

Dessert : Brownies , Cocoa , Kona Coffee
The brownies were basically Little Debbie brownies — in fact , they may have been exactly that , as NASA does purchase off - the - shelf snacks to send up after they 're evaluated and repackaged .
And the drinks were essentially the same as their earthly equivalents — only in space , you rehydrate with the same syringe - in - bag technique .
Both were tasty .
Rating : Four Stars
You may be surprised to see no freeze - dried ice cream here for dessert — the item most commonly associated with " space food . "
Well , that 's because actual freeze - dried ice cream was only eaten on one Apollo mission — its flavor is just too unlike ice cream to be enjoyed , and its excessive crumbliness made it especially difficult to eat and clean up in microgravity .
Thus , its relegation to museum gift shops and novelty stores everywhere .

So in conclusion , I 'd say our lunch was highly enjoyable .
We went through what every astronaut does before their missions — a sampling of the available foods to see what they like .
If Adam and I were going up , you can guess our containers would be full of beef enchiladas , baked beans , sausages and curry sauce , and there would n't be any chicken teriyaki in sight .

Banning flimsy plastic bags has been dismissed as a drop in the ocean when it comes to dealing with the world 's environment problems , but multiplied on a China scale , it appears to have made a big difference .
A new report suggests restrictions on bag usage in the world 's most populous nation have saved the equivalent of 1.6 million tonnes of oil , in the year since it was introduced .
Just ahead of the first anniversary of the ban , the China Chain Store and Franchise Association estimated it had saved the country 40 billion plastic bags .
According to their survey , plastic bag use has fallen by two thirds as consumers grow accustomed to bringing their own reusable bags .
The ban was introduced on 1 June 2008 to reduce " white pollution " – the popular term for plastic bags and styrofoam packaging .
Under the new rules , the state forbade production of ultra - thin bags under 0.025 mm thick and ordered supermarkets to stop giving away free carriers .
That surprise move – which went further than anything done by the US , the UK and many other developed nations – was hailed by Greenpeace , Earthwatch and other green groups as a sign of growing environmental awareness in China .
It also lead to the closure of the state 's biggest plastic bag manufacturer .
Although the ban is often flouted , particularly at street stalls and small shops , it is widely praised for helping to change attitudes .
" It has made an impression , " said recent graduate Xuyang Jingjing .
" I see more people carrying ' green bags ' to supermarkets these days .
But I think if the government really wants people to stop using plastic bags , it should have the shops giving out green bags for free . "
But there is a long way to go .
China produces a million tonnes of rubbish a day with the volume looks set to rise .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , was urged tonight to explain how four Chinese detainees from Guantánamo Bay came to be released to a UK territory without the knowledge of Whitehall .
An urgent security assessment is under way after Bermuda accepted the Uighurs without consulting the Foreign Office .
" We have underlined to the Bermuda government that it should have consulted the UK on whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue for which the Bermuda government do not have delegated responsibility , " said a spokesman for the Foreign Office .
" We have made clear to the Bermuda government the need for a security assessment , which we are now helping them to carry out , " he added , saying that the four former detainees did not have papers , so could not leave Bermuda at present .
Bermuda 's premier , Ewart Brown , agreed to accept the four Uighurs , who the US government ruled were not enemy combatants , to help President Barack Obama meet his pledge to close the camp .
But William
Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , demanded an explanation from Miliband and said the government appeared to have " lost grip of running the country " amid internal Labour party rows over Gordon Brown 's future .
" It is astonishing that an agreement of such significance … could have taken place without a ripple reaching Whitehall , " Hague said .
" The UK is responsible for Bermuda 's external relations , defence and security and for appointing its governor .
Yet the FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] appears to have had no idea that these discussions were taking place .
" Even before this there were serious questions about whether the government has paid sufficient attention to UK overseas territories .
These questions have reached a new level . "
Dear EarthTalk :
How is the fur industry doing these days ?
Has it been impacted by activism from PETA and similar groups ?
-- Clara Andrews , Edmonds , WA
An accurate source of up - to - date numbers is hard to come by , but it ’s safe to say that the fur industry has been hurt by the ongoing and very visible anti-fur campaign — sometimes featuring top supermodels — by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) and other animal rights groups .
Whether or not activist efforts are the cause , the governments of the United Kingdom and Austria have banned fur farming in their countries altogether , while The Netherlands has phased out fox and chinchilla farming .
The U.S. has not taken any action against the industry , but the number of mink farms in the U.S. has plummeted from 1,027 in 1988 to less than 300 today , according to Weekly International Fur News .
But while the fur industry ’s sales numbers may have trailed off through the 1990s , resurgence in the popularity of fur — especially among newly affluent high - fliers in Russia and China — has meant that business is booming for those furriers serving such far - flung markets .
By 2004 the industry was reporting banner sales — some $ 11.7 billion worldwide — despite the slumping post - 9/11 economy .
“ Fur remains big with international designers and is set to continue as an integral part of fashion , ” International Fur Trade Federation ( IFTF ) chairman , Andreas Lenhart , told reporters .
According to IFTF data , the vast majority of the fur industry 's pelts — upwards of 85 percent — now come from farm - raised animals .
( This does mean , though , that 15 percent are still caught in the wild , often by trapping methods that are painful as well as indiscriminate , catching unintended quarry , including endangered species and domestic pets . )
The most farmed such animal is the mink , followed by the fox .
Chinchilla , lynx , muskrats and coyotes are also farmed for their fur .
PETA reports that 73 percent of the world ’s remaining fur farms are in Europe , while about 12 percent are in North America .
IFTF argues that fur farming has environmental benefits , such as providing good use for 647,000 tons of animal by - products each year from Europe ’s fish and meat industries alone ( they are fed to the captive animals ) , and generating a lot of manure , sold as organic fertilizer .
Mink farming also provides fat for soaps and hair products , says IFTF .
Of course , anti-fur activists do n’t see it this way .
“ The amount of energy needed to produce a real fur coat from ranch - raised animal skins is approximately 15 times that needed to produce a fake fur garment , ” says PETA .
“ Nor is fur biodegradable , thanks to the chemical treatment applied to stop the fur from rotting . ”
PETA adds that these same chemicals contaminate groundwater near fur farms if not handled responsibly .
Activists are also concerned , of course , about the conditions animals endure on fur farms .
“ The animals — who are housed in unbearably small cages — live with fear , stress , disease , parasites and other physical and psychological hardships ... ” reports PETA .
The group adds that the animals are killed in very inhumane ways — such as by electrocution , gassing or poisoning — to preserve the quality of the pelts above all else .

A forest of steel pillars was unveiled in London 's Hyde Park on Tuesday , honouring the victims of the July 7 , 2005 , attacks on the city 's transit system .
The memorial is for the 52 victims of the bombings of three of London 's Underground trains and a bus during the peak of the capital 's rush hour .
Fifty - six people , including the four bombers , were killed in the attacks , and more than 700 people were injured .
The columns are grouped to represent the attack sites and the various transit stops where the bombings occurred .
Each of the 52 columns is 3.5 metres tall and uniquely designed to represent the uniqueness of each victim .
A nearby plaque displays the names of the victims .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , London Mayor Boris Johnson and Prince Charles attended the fourth anniversary memorial service in Hyde Park , along with families of the victims .
" I believe the date of the London bombings is etched vividly on all our minds as a brutal intrusion into the lives of thousands of people , " Prince Charles said .
Place to mourn
" I do pray that all those touched by the violence everywhere will eventually find peace again , " the Prince of Wales told the attendees .
" Above all , I pray they will gain comfort and strength from coming together to honour the memories of those taken from us . "
The memorial will provide a place for victims ' families and all Britons to gather to reflect on the attacks and those who died , said British Humanitarian Minister Tessa Jowell .
The family of the victims and those injured in the attacks were involved in determining the design and location of the memorial .
Ken Livingstone , who was London 's mayor at the time of the attack , praised the design of the statues .
" I think it 's just exactly right .
Often , it 's very difficult to do something like this and get it right , " he said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Tuesday nominated federal appellate Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court .
President Obama on Tuesday introduces Judge Sonia Sotomayor as his choice for the U.S. Supreme Court .
If confirmed , Sotomayor , 54 , would be the first Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court justice and the third woman to serve on the high court .
Sotomayor " is an inspiring woman who I believe will make a great justice , " Obama said at a White House announcement .
She " has worked at almost every level of our judicial system , providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice , " he added .
Obama said Sotomayor would bring more experience on the bench than anyone currently serving on the Supreme Court when appointed .
" Thank you , Mr. President , for the most humbling honor of my life , " Sotomayor said .
She thanked family members and mentors who helped her throughout her life and career .
" My heart is bursting with gratitude , " she said .
She gave special recognition to her mother , who was sitting in the audience .
Watch Sotomayor 's emotional tribute to her mother »
" I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences , " Sotomayor said .
Sotomayor , a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , was named a U.S. District Court judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 , and was elevated to her current seat by President Bill Clinton .
She has minimal personal assets compared with many of her judicial colleagues ; a 2007 financial disclosure form showed her with a checking and savings account valued between $ 50,000 and $ 115,000 .
Sotomayor , who is of Puerto Rican descent , rose from humble beginnings at a housing project in the South Bronx and went on to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School .
Watch more about Sotomayor 's personal history »
The president met with Sotomayor at the White House for an hour last Thursday , according to a senior administration official , and came away impressed with her personal story and professional qualifications .
Solicitor General Elana Kagan , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and federal appeals court Judge Diane Wood were among the candidates who also received serious consideration , the official said .
Watch CNN's Jim Acosta break the news of Sotomayor 's nomination »
The president made his final decision after the weekend and called Sotomayor around 9 p.m. ET Monday , a senior administration official added .
Obama " was looking for someone with a balance of skills : very , very smart ; independent thinker ; highly regarded for integrity and commitment to the law , " another senior administration official said .
" He found all of those things with her , including his goal of selecting someone with the empathy factor -- real - world , practical experience and understanding of how the law affects real people . "
Watch as Obama cites Sotomayor 's three decades of experience »
Supporters say her appointment history , along with what they call her moderate - liberal views , would give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate .
However , Sotomayor has endured recent criticism in the media and blogs from both the left and right over perceived -- some defenders say invented -- concerns about her temperament and intellect .
" Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important that the law as written , " said Wendy Long , counsel to the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network .
" She thinks that judges should dictate policy , and that one 's sex , race , and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench . "
As she has risen through the judicial ranks , Sotomayor increasingly has drawn the ire and opposition of conservatives .
A majority of Republican senators opposed her elevation to the appellate court in 1998 .
Read about Sotomayor 's record »
Conservatives point to , among other things , her authoring of a 2008 opinion supporting a decision by the city of New Haven , Connecticut , to throw out the results of a firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions .
The Supreme Court heard an appeal of the case in April ; a final opinion is pending .
Her critics also highlight comments she made during a panel discussion at Duke University in 2005 , where she told students that the federal Court of Appeals is where " policy is made . "
" I know that this is on tape , " she then immediately said .
" I should never say that .
Because we do n't ' make law '...
I 'm not promoting it , and I 'm not advocating it .
Having said that , the Court of Appeals is where ... the law is percolating . "
Watch how conservatives are gearing up for a fight »
However , an official with the Republican National Committee promised that the GOP will be equitable toward Sotomayor .
" The Republicans are going to strike a tone that 's fair , that allows the vetting process to happen like it should , and that 's in stark contrast to how the Democrats dealt with Judge [ John ]
Roberts when you look back a couple years ago , " the official said .
Senate Republicans " will thoroughly examine [ Sotomayor 's ] record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even - handedly , despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
The hot - button social issue of abortion also promises to play a contentious role in Sotomayor 's confirmation process .
Learn about the other Supreme Court justices »
Charmaine Yoest , head of Americans United for Life , ripped Obama 's choice of Sotomayor , calling it " a radical pick that divides America . "
Sotomayor 's appointment " would provide a pedestal for an avowed judicial activist ... at a time when the Courts are at a crossroads and critical abortion regulations -- supported by the vast majority of Americans -- like partial - birth abortion and informed consent laws lie in the balance , " Yoest said .
Sotomayor " will serve the nation with distinction , " countered Kim Gandy , head of the National Organization for Women .
" She brings a lifelong commitment to equality , justice and opportunity , as well as the respect of her peers , unassailable integrity , and a keen intellect informed by experience . "
Obama 's nominee will replace retiring Justice David Souter , who announced this month he would step down when the court 's current session ends this summer .
Watch why Democrats want the process to go quickly »
Sotomayor 's nomination will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate .
The president said he hopes to have hearings in July , with the confirmation completed before Congress leaves for the summer .
Obama 's Democratic party controls the Senate , so Sotomayor is not expected to have difficulty being confirmed in time to start the new court session in October .
There had been widespread speculation that Obama would name a woman to the court , which has only one female justice , Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Obama was also under pressure to nominate a Hispanic justice to the court .
" Republicans have to be very careful and not oppose this nomination just for the sake of it , " warned Brent Wilkes , executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens .
The Latino community 's " hopes and aspirations are all tied up in this nominee , " he said .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he did n't think any particular gender or ethnic group was " entitled to representation " on the court , but acknowledged that Sotomayor 's appointment would send a " powerful message " to the Latino community and Americans .
" It says a lot about opportunities in our country , " Gonzales told CNN 's Wolf Blizter .
" This is a powerful message , a powerful message of hope and opportunity through this appointment , just like there 's a powerful message sent when an African - American is elected president . "
CNN 's Peter Hamby , Ed Henry , Suzanne Malveaux and Bill Mears contributed to this report .

I finally got around to finishing my fix for Divmod bug # 2718 — Warn about unused variables in methods in pyflakes .
Last night , the magnificent Jean - Paul Calderone reviewed and landed my patch .
This means that if you are using pyflakes trunk ( either from Subversion trunk or from the Launchpad Bazaar import ) , pyflakes will spot code like :
def foo ( bar ) : baz = bar + 2return 12
and generate a warning like :
example .
py : 2 : local variable ' baz ' is assigned to but never used
I use pyflakes hooked up to flymake , so it ’s always running all the time on every Python file I ’m working on .
Relying on it has become as second - nature as relying on syntax highlighting .
There ’s a whole class of mistakes I do n’t make any more , simply because it ’s on .
However , the main way it helps me is when I ’m refactoring code .
When extracting a function or changing a variable name , pyflakes acts like a sort of todo list for me .
Now that it shows unused local variables , it ’s getting dangerously close to perfect .
To get pyflakes quickly , bzr branch lp : pyflakes .

Vatican official : Gaza is now a ' concentration camp '
Agence France - Presse
Published : Wednesday January 7 , 2009
Print This Email This THE Gaza Strip has been turned into a " concentration camp " by two weeks of Israeli bombardments , said a senior Vatican official .
Cardinal Renato Martino , the Vatican 's justice and peace minister , was quoted by the online Italian daily Il Sussidiario .
" Let 's look at the conditions in Gaza : these increasingly resemble a big concentration camp , " said Cardinal Martino .
Cardinal Martino said it was in neither parties interest to carry on fighting and urged both to show more willingness to hold peace talks .
" If they can't come to an agreement , then someone else should do it ( for them ) .
The world cannot sit back and watch without doing anything .
" We Christians are not the only ones to call this land ' holy ' , Jews and Muslims do so too .
The fact that this land is the scene of bloodshed seems a great tragedy , " he added .
Israel 's offensive on Gaza has killed almost 700 Palestinians , including 220 children , and injured 3000 since December 27 , according to Gaza medics .
Aid agencies have declared a total humanitarian crisis in Gaza , owing to the ailing stocks of basic food , water and medical supplies .
In response Israel said the comments were " based on Hamas propaganda " .
" Making remarks that seem to be based on Hamas propaganda while ignoring its numerous crimes ... does not bring the people closer to truth and peace , " foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told AFP .
“ In much wisdom is much grief , ” counsels the book of Ecclesiastes , and in Christopher R. Beha ’s tender intellectual memoir , we find plenty of both .
By the time he set out to read all 51 volumes of the Harvard Classics — known as the Five - Foot Shelf — Beha had already survived blood cancer and seen his identical twin brother nearly die after a car accident .
And in a year that would take Beha from ancient Greece to the 20th century , illness and death returned once more , reminding him that no amount of learning can efface what Pascal called the “ eternal silence of these infinite spaces . ”
First published in 1909 , the Five - Foot Shelf was conceived by the Harvard president Charles W. Eliot as “ a good substitute for a liberal education ” for a growing middle class eager for knowledge .
All the big names and important ideas were here : Sophocles , Chaucer , the Constitution , three treatises on smallpox for good measure .
Ordinary men and women who had never set foot in Harvard Yard could now stake a claim to the peaks of Western civilization .
A product of Manhattan private schools and Princeton , Beha seems an unlikely candidate for such earnest self - ­improvement .
But like the working masses who were Eliot ’s intended audience , he was desperately seeking a retreat from the mundane .
At 27 he was the picture of aimless youth : a struggling writer , marginally employed and grievously in debt .
Searching for salvation , or at least something to do , he pledged on a lonely New Year ’s Eve to spend the next 12 months reading the Harvard Classics , which had long been gathering dust in his parents ’ library .
Image Christopher R. Beha Credit ...
Josephine Sittenfeld
A wealthy young man shacked up with Plato and Goethe sounds like a gimmick , and a tired one at that .
But life intruded rudely on Beha ’s sabbatical , and he rose to the occasion by writing an unexpected narrative that deftly reconciles lofty thoughts with earthly pain .
In doing so , he makes an elegant case for literature as an everyday companion no less valuable than the iPod .
Who does n't love that scene in " A Few Good Men " in which Jack Nicholson 's character tells Tom Cruise 's character , " You ca n't handle the truth .
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide , and then questions the manner in which I provide it .
I would rather you just said ' Thank you ' and went on your way . "
I often feel like I 'm acting out that scenario when speaking to CIOs and senior security leaders .
They want me to tell them how to stop hackers and malware from invading their environments .
Usually I 'm consulting on some multitiered firewall / proxy / security solution aimed at protecting back - end databases .
We talk about packet - inspecting firewalls , intrusion detection , two - factor authentication , and all sorts of high - tech defensive solutions that add several layers to their defense - in - depth protection .
[ The shortest distance between professional malware and your company 's data is an unpatched Web browser .
See the InfoWorld Test Center guide to browser security . ]
Then I say something like , " That 's all great , but it wo n't work . "
I usually have their attention by then .
Next , I throw out the inconvenient truths :
Most of today 's security risk in the average computing environment comes from " drive - by downloads " -- that is , trusted insiders get infected by Trojan software that they were tricked into installing .
If you allow your end - users to install any software they want , then your risk of security exploitation is high .
Even if you are fully patched and the software you run contains zero bugs ( this is never true ) , it barely decreases the risk from drive - by downloads .
Most malware and malicious hackers are criminally motivated and seek monetary gain .
End -user education is highly overrated and will fail .
Your firewall , your anti-malware software , and your IDS will fail .
How to handle the truth
This is not to say that defense - in - depth and all that other good stuff should n't be done .
But the risk from reckless end - users unwittingly executing Trojans and installing their own software is so high that all the other intrusion methods and their resulting mitigations are but a small percentage of the overall attacks in the wild .
The intruder does n't have to worry about all your perimeter defenses and fancy log - on techniques because the trusted end - user escorts him through .
Most of the big online heists you read about do n't occur because the attacker compromised some Web server or database from the Internet .
No , the attacker simply uses an insider 's legitimate access to explore the network , find juicy targets , download data , and implant other malware .
If you want the best computer defense your precious dollar can buy , focus on fixing that one problem .
The best solution is to prevent end -users from installing random software ( which is often secretly malicious ) .
Many administrators tell me they can't do that -- their employees would revolt and the company would become unproductive .
I understand ; that 's the reality in many environments .
But not fixing that one problem means you have to do all the other things , which will probably ultimately fail you .
Does your senior management understand that ?
Do they know that essential truth ?
Would they be as reluctant to lock down end - user PCs if they knew that the money spent on all the other defenses addressed just a tiny part of the overall security risk ?
If you have the green light to solve that one problem , how can you do it ?
First , do n't let your users have access to elevated Administrator or root accounts that allow software installs .
That means you 'll need to install all necessary software with the base image and manage updates using controlled software install technology .
Second , use whitelisting software to control which applications users are allowed to run .
Whitelisting is available in Windows 7 ( AppLocker ) and from vendors such as Bit9 , SignaCert , and McAfee .
InfoWorld 's Test Center will be publishing a comparison of whitelisting products later this month .
[ Is your network in danger of a password - cracking attack ?
Test the strength of your password policy . ]
Of course , it does n't hurt to implement all those other defenses if you do them correctly and thoroughly .
When you patch , make sure you patch everything , and in a timely manner .
By " everything , " I mean every OS patch , every app , every browser add - on , every network device , every security appliance .
I 've yet to pen-test a network that had up - to - date code on its Cisco routers .
And I 'm not surprised that security appliances often go unpatched .
An appliance is nothing but a computer running software , but it 's software that is usually harder to patch .
The learning gap
I would love to believe that end - user education could work against the new line of Trojan threats .
But after trying and failing to beat malware with end - user education for the last 20 years , I 'm not particularly hopeful .
I 've gone from telling end - users not to boot from floppies , to do n't run that macro , to do n't open that file attachment , to do n't run that fake anti-virus software , and no , Microsoft does n't send patches or updates via e-mail .
It takes us three to five years to educate our end - user population against a particular type of threat , and the attackers only three to five weeks to make up a new social engineering vector .
Time and human nature are working against us .
But what the heck , if you can't block random software installs , your next best hope is probably end - user education .
But if your company is like most of the places I 've been involved with over the last few years , you last updated your computer security education material about five years ago .
Employees are generally lucky if they get a few pages of material , and almost none contain information about the latest , most common threats .
We need to change that .
Educate your employees about the latest evolving threats .
There are plenty of graphical guides out there .
Or make an example compilation of the various Trojan threats that are popular today and send them to your users for review .

PARIS : A sketchbook of drawings by Spanish master Pablo Picasso valued at eight million euros ( 11 million dollars ) has been stolen from a Paris museum , police said Tuesday .
Thieves seized the sketchbook from the Picasso Museum in central Paris where officials discovered it missing on Tuesday morning , a police official told AFP .
Works by Picasso , one of the most important artists of the 20th century , fetch record prices at auctions .
The Picasso Museum houses more than 250 paintings , 160 sculptures and 1,500 drawings by the Spanish artist in a former mansion of the fashionable Marais district of Paris .
The museum was closed on Tuesday when the theft was discovered .
Two Picasso paintings worth an estimated 50 million euros were taken from the Paris home of Diana Widmaier - Picasso , the artist 's granddaughter , in February 2007 .
Four Picasso works stolen from a musem in Sao Paulo , Brazil in June 2008 were recovered undamaged a few weeks later .

Colours Advice
Most important is – whatever colour schemes you choose , be sure to get testers first to try out as the colours will appear to change in different rooms or even on different walls due to the incident lighting …….
North facing light can sometimes make pure whites and pale blues , pale greens & greys look cool & clinical – in a north - facing room , creams , off - whites & neutral stone - like colours are a better choice as they are inherently " warming " – unless your preference is for a cooling colour scheme .
Paint directly onto your walls or onto A4 paper & move around the room to be absolutely sure of your choices before committing to buy in bulk .
Bold colours – are fine even in large areas but a couple of things to remember – dark colours " advance " & lighter colours tend to recede , so a dark ceiling will seem to be much lower - and a lighter one will float away upwards – these effects can be used to manipulate your living spaces – for example , to foreshorten a corridor by painting the door at the end in a darker colour or to lift a low ceiling by painting it a paler shade than the walls .
If you want to be adventurous with colour , remember than you can always go extreme in bathrooms , utilities and ( to a lesser extent ) kitchens , as these spaces are not a " lived in " environment but rather serve a specific shorter time function .
Neutrals , creams , off - whites & stone - like colours are perennially popular for very good reason – they are easy to live with & team up superbly with natural furnishings , wood , stone & carpets – if you feel that you need a flourish in your living room , a feature wall done out in a bold paint colour or wallpaper will energize the whole room , whereas a whole room in a bold floral or geometric print can easily become overwhelming very quickly .

JACK BAUER famously does whatever it takes to save America from disaster , be that disaster nuclear , biological or computer attack .
Week after week , the hero of “ 24 ” acts brutally , and endures brutality , for the greater good .
It is a sign of the times that this year 's season opened with Bauer being hauled before a congressional committee to face the charge of committing torture .
He was unrepentant .
This television character , who first appeared in 2001 , has been oddly at the heart of the arguments over the conduct of America 's “ war on terrorism ” .
Critics in the American army have complained that he encourages young soldiers to abuse prisoners .
Supporters , such as Antonin Scalia , a Supreme Court justice , praised him for the episode in which he saved Los Angeles from nuclear attack , even though it meant staging the mock execution of a family to get a Middle Eastern villain to talk .
“ Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer ?
I do n't think so , ” said the judge .
In contrast with Europeans , who strongly reject the use of torture , the American public is pretty evenly divided about its use to extract information from terrorists ( see charts ) .
But President Barack Obama , for one , is clear .
No sooner had he been sworn into office than he banned torture , rescinded legal opinions allowing simulated drowning and other harsh methods , ordered all American agencies to comply with the army 's field manual on interrogation , announced he would close the prison at Guantánamo Bay within a year and ordered a series of policy reviews on detention and interrogation .
“ From Europe to the Pacific ” , Mr Obama said in May , “ we 've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law . ”
Dick Cheney , George Bush 's vice - president , sneered at such talk as “ recklessness cloaked in righteousness ” .
Many people thought that Mr Obama 's election would finally settle the controversies about counter - terrorism 's “ dark side ” ( as Mr Cheney once put it ) ; a darkness that concealed secret prisons , abusive interrogation and “ rendition ” to countries that practise torture .
The distorted DIY legal framework that treated suspected terrorists as neither criminals nor prisoners - of - war , leaving them in an unprotected grey zone between civil and military law , would , many liberals hoped , be put right .
In April , against the wishes of current and former CIA directors , Mr Obama released four secret memos from the Department of Justice , written in 2002 and updated in 2005 , that made legal the CIA 's use of “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques such as the use of the “ waterboard ” ( simulated drowning ) , sleep deprivation , “ walling ” ( hurling a prisoner against a partition wall ) , “ stress positions ” and strange practices like placing a “ high - value prisoner ” in a cramped box with an insect to exploit his phobia about bugs .
It revealed that one prisoner , Khaled Sheikh Mohammed , the operational head of the September 11th 2001 attacks on America , was waterboarded 183 times .
Mr Obama said that he did not want to prosecute those who operated within these rules .
He knows that if he takes action against interrogators he could be accused of seeking scapegoats ; if he goes after the CIA chiefs he would be charged with undermining America 's security ; and if he investigates leaders of the Bush administration he would look as if he were conducting a witch - hunt against his political rivals .
“ Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past , ” he argued .
Yet the past casts a long shadow .
Some of Mr Obama 's supporters want a “ truth commission ” to establish what happened and , perhaps , recommend prosecutions .
Congress is incensed that the CIA did not tell it of a secret programme ( which may have had to do with the assassination of terrorists ) , apparently under orders from Mr Cheney , bringing the former vice - president a step closer to formal investigation .
The attorney - general , Eric Holder , is thought to be about to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate those interrogators who exceeded the already lax limits set by the so - called “ torture memos ” .
Even before this , CIA officials had been hiring lawyers in anticipation of trouble .
Some of Mr Obama 's favourite spooks have been unable to take up senior appointments because of their association , sometimes only peripheral , with the interrogation programme .
John Brennan , a veteran CIA figure , was withdrawn from consideration as the agency 's director and was given a job in the White House instead .
Philip Mudd , a respected intelligence man currently on secondment to the FBI , pulled out of his nomination to the senior intelligence post in the Department of Homeland Security .
The Obama administration may have chosen these men but it put little effort into backing its choices .
The big chill
How will all this affect future intelligence operations ?
There is a distinct chill .
Some reckon that the CIA and other agencies face their worst crisis since the post - Watergate inquiries in the 1970s uncovered evidence of spying on Americans and plots to assassinate foreign leaders .
“ There is undoubtedly some nervousness , ” says one senior source .
“ It does not stop you taking action , but it makes you think twice and talk to your lawyer . ”
Britain's close relations with America are causing it similar problems .
Its intelligence agencies are being dragged into the legal limelight , not for torturing suspects but for allegedly colluding in their maltreatment by others — whether they are Americans , Pakistanis or Moroccans .
One member of MI5 , Britain 's domestic intelligence agency , is under police investigation .
Increasingly lawyers are being brought in to scrutinise British intelligence before it can be passed on .
Will handing over the name of a suspect to America lead to him being killed by an unmanned aircraft in Pakistan ?
Will sharing a telephone number with , say , Egypt 's spies , lead to the arrest and torture of somebody who should instead be merely watched ?
Will submitting questions to be asked of a man held in a foreign prison mean that British agents will be held responsible for his treatment ?
Agents have become warier of questioning detainees abroad for fear that they will be blamed for any abuse they may have suffered .
The number of requests by officials in MI6 ( Britain 's foreign intelligence service ) for the legal cover known as “ Article 7 ” , in which the foreign secretary approves actions that are illegal in Britain , has shot up .
Many of the woes of British agencies are embodied in the case of Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian asylum - seeker in Britain , who gave up his drugs habit after rediscovering Islam .
He went to Taliban - ruled Afghanistan to see an Islamic state at work .
There he underwent some form of military training — to help the resistance in Chechnya , he says , not to fight the Americans .
He was arrested trying to leave Pakistan in 2002 on a forged passport .
He was beaten in prison , where he was seen by members of the FBI and MI5 .
He was then taken by the Americans to Morocco , where he says he was tortured by a questioner called Marwan , who took a sharp blade to his chest and penis while asking questions that had plainly been fed to him by MI5 .
The British authorities say that once Mr Mohamed had left Pakistan , they did not know his whereabouts or conditions of detention ; all questions were submitted through the Americans .
Much of America 's programme of secret detention and interrogation was formally hidden from allies .
The top - secret “ torture memos ” were classified “ NOFORN ” ( no foreign nationals ) .
But stories of prisoners being abused by the Americans were already circulating in 2002 .
Indeed some British officials had expressed concern at what they saw .
It was under torture , Mr Mohamed says , that he admitted to meeting Osama bin Laden and to taking part in plots including the detonation of a dirty bomb .
This is what he would be accused of when he got to Guantánamo Bay in 2004 , via a secret prison in Afghanistan .
But , like many others , Mr Mohamed was released in February this year without charge .
By then Mr Mohamed 's lawyers , among them Clive Stafford Smith , founder of a legal charity called Reprieve , had been in full swing on both sides of the Atlantic .
They sued the British government to release documents that might prove Mr Mohamed 's innocence , obtaining a High Court judgment that was critical of MI5 and led to the police investigation of one of its officials , known only as “ Witness B ” .
In a parallel case in America , Mr Mohamed and other Guantánamo inmates are suing Jeppensen DataPlan , a subsidiary of Boeing , which allegedly provided aircraft for the CIA 's rendition programme .
Mr Mohamed 's release has not stopped the litigation in either America or Britain .
Both governments argue that the lawsuits should be thrown out because state secrets cannot be divulged .
Indeed , the Obama administration has warned Britain that intelligence - sharing would be jeopardised if secret information provided by the CIA were to be revealed in British courts .
Similarly , officials in Britain are alarmed by what may be disclosed in America .
Waterboarding the agencies
These days it is the intelligence agencies that find themselves under interrogation .
Each snippet they provide produces requests for more information .
And the courts , suspicious of what the agencies may be hiding , are demanding ever more disclosure .
One source of information has been the succession of freedom - of - information requests for official documents , including the “ torture memos ” , by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Legal campaigners are waging an information - gathering effort that earns the grudging respect of intelligence operatives .
“ They are chasing the paper trail and winning , ” says one .
“ They are chipping away at state - secret privilege [ the doctrine that courts can dismiss lawsuits if classified information will be released ] .
They could disclose an awful lot of information — names of interrogators and medical personnel .
If secrets start seeping out , countries that have been sharing information may be disinclined to do so . ”
The controversies show the extent to which torture and other forms of harsh interrogation — even though they may have been abandoned — cloud the legitimate work of counter - terrorism .
American sources say that in the latter years of the Bush administration , European agencies , worried that they might be caught up in America 's abusive practices , became reticent about sharing intelligence .
Today , America 's partners may hold back out of fear that America will not be able to protect their information .
Officials lament that the machinery of Western intelligence - sharing is becoming “ gritted up ” — though information about “ life - threatening ” plots is still swapped briskly .
Intelligence - sharing is vital .
America , with its vast resources , has become the main repository of information on global terrorism .
Though Britain has well - regarded intelligence services , it obtains more than half its reports on terrorism from other agencies , principally American .
And about half of America 's intelligence reports on al - Qaeda until 2006 , says a former senior official , came from detainees .
The Justice Department 's memos were prompted by the arrest in 2002 of Abu Zubaydah , a man with close links to al - Qaeda .
The CIA wanted clearance to exert greater pressure on the first of its “ high - value detainees ” — even though FBI investigators would later claim that Mr Zubaydah was already talking freely .
Degrees of pain
The memos gave the CIA licence to use “ enhanced ” techniques derived from American training advice to pilots and other personnel on how to withstand torture if they should fall into enemy hands .
They are shocking for their bureaucratic punctiliousness .
They parse the degrees of pain that would constitute forbidden torture ( “ an intensity akin to the pain accompanying serious physical injury ” ) .
They set out in incongruous detail the limits of abuse .
A prisoner could be deprived of sleep , but for no more than 180 hours before being allowed to rest for eight .
He could be stripped naked but only if the room was warmer than 68 °F ( 20 °C ) .
He could be doused in water but it had to be potable .
He could be waterboarded with cold ( saline ) water poured onto his face but each application should not last more than 40 seconds , there should be no more than six applications per session , no session could last more than two hours and there could be only two sessions in 24 hours .
The ACLU 's next target is a comprehensive and still largely secret internal CIA report written in 2004 by John Helgerson , then the agency 's inspector - general .
This is believed to be particularly damning , providing evidence of abuse that went well beyond the permitted guidelines .
Compared with the antiseptic legal memos , writes Jane Mayer , the author of a book called “ The Dark Side ” , the Helgerson report is a “ Technicolor horror show ” , including accounts of people who died in custody .
A version of the report , so heavily redacted with black deletion marks as to be barely comprehensible , was released in 2008 .
A more complete version is expected in the coming weeks , although the Obama administration has asked for delays .
Illustration by Gary Neill
Crucially , the report is critical of the value of the information obtained through harsh interrogation .
It apparently concludes that there is no evidence that such intelligence prevented any imminent attacks .
But this argument was strongly contested by the Bush administration .
Michael Hayden , the CIA 's director from 2006 until earlier this year , wrote in April that enhanced interrogation had led the agency from one big fish to another .
Abu Zubaydah , he says , was forced to give information that led to the capture of Ramzi bin al - Shibh ( one of the planners of the September 11th attacks ) ; he , in turn , helped lead to the capture of Khaled Sheikh Mohammed ( which , the memos claimed , foiled a “ second wave ” plot to crash an aircraft into Los Angeles ) .
Mr Hayden said that of the thousands of people captured as “ unlawful combatants ” , fewer than 100 were held under the CIA 's interrogation programme and fewer than one - third of those were subjected to the “ enhanced ” techniques set out in the memos .
Just three people were waterboarded .
This , however , ignores all manner of abuses committed in military prisons .
That there was no follow - on attack on America after September 11th was thanks in large measure , argues Mr Cheney , to the Bush administration 's policies , including the enhanced techniques .
Though he denounced the release of the memos that allowed these methods , he now wants further documents to be published that would , he says , demonstrate their success .
People familiar with the inner workings of intelligence suggest a more ambiguous story .
Intelligence , they argue , is about piecing together fragments of information and building up spider diagrams of connections between suspects .
“ Intelligence is grains of sand ; you do n't usually get the whole beach , ” says one veteran .
It is true that in 2001 , a time when the CIA and other agencies were woefully ignorant of al - Qaeda 's methods , the prisoners captured after the overthrow of the Taliban were the first rich source of information to help “ map the enemy ” , as one intelligence source puts it .
But , says a former counter - terrorism official , the most valuable information from Mr Zubaydah 's capture came not from his interrogation but from his address book .
With Mr Mohammed , says another analyst , the most important factor in stopping further attacks on America was not what the terrorist said under duress , but that he had been captured in the first place .
Intelligence officials maintain that detainees under interrogation provided as many , perhaps more , specks of information as other sources of intelligence on terrorism , including signals and agents .
The question that nobody can answer is how much of this could have been obtained without torture .
Bleak choices
The danger for Mr Obama , as he seeks to overhaul the intelligence system , is that a fresh attack on the American mainland would immediately expose him to the accusation of being soft on terrorism .
In May Congress revolted against any attempt to move detainees from Guantánamo to American soil before a plan for the disposal of its 229 prisoners had been drawn up .
Yet three task - forces examining the matter , including future policy on detainees , have delayed issuing their reports because of the complexity of the problem .
Mr Obama has decided to keep the reviled military commissions , albeit with reforms .
And he may yet seek a form of indefinite detention for some prisoners , with judicial and congressional oversight .
Lurking in the background are the lesser - known problems of America 's prison at Bagram , its main base in Afghanistan , where detainees are being held with much less scrutiny than those at Guantánamo .
Holding terrorism suspects has become a huge headache for America .
One fear is that if , in future , it tracks down important al - Qaeda figures , it may prefer one of two bleak options : either turn them over to countries with far fewer qualms — or just drop a bomb on them .
Jack Bauer would be delighted .
It would be laughable anywhere else .
But , so everyone says , the Waxman - Markey bill which is likely to be passed in Congress today or tomorrow , is the best we can expect – from America .
The cuts it proposes are much lower than those being pursued in the UK or in most other developed nations .
Like the UK 's climate change act ( pdf ) the US bill calls for an 80 % cut by 2050 , but in this case the baseline is 2005 , not 1990 .
Between 1990 and 2005 , US carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels rose from 5.8 to 7bn tonnes .
The cut proposed by 2020 is just 17 % , which means that most of the reduction will take place towards the end of the period .
What this means is much greater cumulative emissions , which is the only measure that counts .
Worse still , it is riddled with so many loopholes and concessions that the bill 's measures might not offset the emissions from the paper it 's printed on .
You can judge the effectiveness of a US bill by its length : the shorter it is , the more potent it will be .
This one is some 1,200 pages long , which is what happens when lobbyists have been at work .
There are mind - boggling concessions to the biofuels industry , including a promise not to investigate its wider environmental impacts .
There 's a provision to allow industry to use 2bn tonnes of carbon offsets a year , which include highly unstable carbon sinks like crop residues left in the soil ( another concession won by the powerful farm lobby ) .
These offsets are so generous that if all of them are used , US industry will have to make no carbon cuts at all until 2026 .
Like the EU emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) , Waxman - Markey would oblige companies to buy only a small proportion ( 15 % ) of their carbon permits .
The rest will be given away .
This means that a resource belonging to everyone ( the right to pollute ) is captured by industrial interests without public compensation .
The more pollution companies have produced , the greater their free allocation will be – the polluter gets paid .
It also means , if the ETS is anything to go by , that the big polluters will be able to make windfall profits by passing on the price of the permits they have n't bought to their consumers .
In one respect the bill actually waters down current legislation , by preventing the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating coal - burning power stations .
If the new coal plants planned in the US are built , it 's hard to see how even the feeble targets in this bill can be met , let alone any targets proposed by the science .
Even so , I would like to see the bill passed , as it at least provides a framework for future improvements .
But why do we expect so little from the US ?
Why do we treat the world 's most powerful and innovative nation as if it were a failed state , rejoicing at even the faintest suggestion of common sense ?
You have only to read the comments that follow this article to find out .
Thanks to the lobbying work of the coal and oil companies , and the vast army of thinktanks , PR consultants and astroturfers they have sponsored , thanks too to the domination of the airwaves by loony right shock jocks , the debate over issues like this has become so mad that any progress at all is little short of a miracle .
The ranking Republican on the House energy and commerce committee is Joe Barton , the man who in 2005 launched a congressional investigation of three US scientists whose work reveals the historical pattern of climate change .
Like those of many of his peers , his political career is kept on life support by the fossil fuel and electricity companies .
He returns the favour by vociferously denying that manmade climate change exists .
A combination of corporate money and an unregulated corporate media keeps America in the dark ages .
This bill is the best we 're going to get for now because the corruption of public life in the United States has not been addressed .
Whether he is seeking environmental reforms , health reforms or any other improvement in the life of the American people , this is Obama 's real challenge .

It comes as detectives searched the Las Vegas home and office of his doctor , Conrad Murray .
Detectives are reportedly also chasing other doctors who they say handed out drugs or prescriptions to the late singer .
Spring Break is around the corner but your non-existent budget is blown .
As a college instructor , I see this every semester : panic stricken faces looking up at me .
And it is n’t about the paper they have n’t turned in yet , it ’s about not having budgeted their semester well .
I was a student for seven long years .
Here are a few tricks of the trade I learned .
Take notes my students , and swallow your pride .
How will you survive the next few weeks until you go home to Mom and Dad with a car full of laundry and a scheme to get them to help you out until the end of the semester ?
Getting a job or second job will take too much time and effort away from your studies — you do n’t want your grades to go south .
Odds are your rent or dorm is paid for but you do need to eat …
Eating seems to be a major expense for college students not on some sort of meal plan .
And even students that are on meal plans , often find they underestimated .
There are other ways to eat .
• Make friends with your professors and get invited over for dinner .
My friend Jennifer and I survived countless poor Friday nights by getting invited over for dinner .
We stuck together and would make sure we could bring a friend --- since there are lecherous professors out there , bringing a friend helps keep everything on the up and up and you get a free meal and possibly wine or beer too .
• Art openings .
You are in a college town !
There are bound to be a few art openings .
Find out when they are and attend .
Many times galleries in an area will team up and have a bunch of openings on the same night .
This way you can walk a few blocks and hit wine , bottled water , cheese , fruit , and veggies dipped in dressing at a few places so you wo n’t look like you are hovering over the food necessarily .
• Collect recycling .
Honestly .
One of my college apartments was next to a grocery store and I saved all my family ’s recycling to put in the machine out front which would spit out coupons to use in the grocery store .
Even today when my husband and I take in recycling we sometimes collect about $ 9 - 11 dollars worth of free groceries for our troubles .
• Work that bakesale for that cause you kind of care about .
There will be leftovers and if you sample before hand you can make recommendations .
• Check out conferences and meetings on campus .
9 times out of 10 your college will put out a little catered spread at various functions on campus for people who are attending to have a snack .
Dress a little nicer than usual .
Odds are they are n’t going to know that you are n’t one of the attendees and they ’re just going to dump that make your own sandwich tray or take it home to their family anyway .
• Open houses .
Hungry on Saturday and campus options all closed ?
Head into the community .
Granted the food will be similar to the art openings but beggars ca n’t be choosers and it ’ll at least be fresh .
Dress nicely , talk about being pre-law or pre-med and how that house will make a great starter home .
• Date someone in culinary school .
My sister was the queen of dating culinary academy students .
In the first four years she lived in San Francisco I do n’t think she ever paid for a meal .
Ever .
In every kitchen in town she seemed to know someone who would at least get her and her date a complimentary appetizer .
Later as a bartender , she received comp drinks from other bartenders .
Even if you are n’t going to date the culinary student , by all means flirt .
They work in some pretty nice kitchens and that ’ll be a great switch from eating wine , cheese and grapes from the open houses and art shows .
• Speaking of flirting and desperate eating in college situations .
You can always scrounge up a few pennies for coffee at a coffeeshop .
Go in late at night .
Be kind to the waiter or waitress .
Smile .
You might see a free piece of pie .
I am forever grateful to the guys at the Apple Pan in Westwood down the road a piece from UCLA .
Thanks for feeding me !!!!!!!
Plan for the future :
• Think about getting a part - time café job when you get back from spring break .
You can survive well on just about day old anything .
Your café wo n’t be able to sell those day old bagels or quiche but there is n’t anything wrong with them .
• Tell your grandparents to buy you gift cards to grocery stores that are near your school or to put money on your meal card for the next semester .
They do n’t know what to buy you for your birthday anymore — this is a great solution for them to help with college and for you not to have to wear that ugly sweater they were going to buy you .
So look at all those solutions and you did n’t have to even dumpster dive !
Mom and Dad would be so proud of you .

Labour has suffered its worst ever poll result , being beaten into third place by UKIP in the European Parliament elections .
Labour 's share of the vote was just 15.3 % , but it was a good night for the BNP which won two seats in Brussels , its first representatives in Europe .
Jeremy Vine examines the results from around the UK .
It is n't easy being green .
Or red .
Or purple .
Or whatever color Cleveland 's mascot Slider is supposed to be .
You think your job is tough ?
Try filling the size 18 shoes of a baseball mascot .
Those dedicated birds , dinosaurs , swinging friars , moose and assorted other creatures brave suffocating 90 - plus heat that leaves your feathers , fur and scales coated with sweat that is almost toxic within five minutes of walking onto the concourse .
Then you have to maneuver around the narrow ballpark concourses even though you 're 8 feet tall with a 76 - inch waist , kids and adults alike are swarming you , and ( despite your 10 - inch - high eyeballs ) your vision is restricted to what you can see through a bugle - shaped mouth .
Which helps explain why Slider dislocated his knee after falling off the fence during the 1995 playoffs .
" You 're constantly climbing up chairs .
Climbing up on dugouts , jumping up , jumping down , " says Dan Kilday , who has been Slider 's head trainer for 19 years .
" You 'll be running in the stands , and all of a sudden a seat will be down when all the others are up , and you take that right in the knee or wherever .
The worst case is pulled ligaments .
People hurt themselves shoveling the driveway , so you can imagine what can happen when your vision is impaired and you run into different obstacles that you 're not prepared for .
People think you 're protected and padded , but you 're just as liable to any injury . "
I had the pleasure of hanging with several mascots at the All - Star Game festivities this week .
Now , Ted Giannoulas is happy to talk about his career as the famous Chicken , but for some strange reason that no one has ever adequately explained to me , teams are reluctant to acknowledge that their mascots might actually be people wearing costumes .
And since I would no more imply that sports mascots are humans wearing costumes than tell a 4 - year - old that there is no Santa Claus , the people quoted in this story are not the actual mascots but merely ( wink , wink ) their agents , close friends , trainers , handlers and major domos who somehow know the job like the back of their green , webbed hands .
According to Tanner Leggett , the mascot coordinator for the Texas Rangers , big league mascots can earn anywhere from roughly a teacher 's salary to six - figure incomes for the most popular ( especially in the NBA ) .
That may sound like a fair wage for waddling around and posing for photos , but it can take years of working your way up the evolutionary ladder from minor league grasshopper to big league elephant .
Plus , it is n't cheap for a horse mascot to stay clean while performing daily in the 100 - degree heat of a Texas summer .
" You can wash it , but you really want to deodorize it , " Leggett says of mascot hygiene .
" One mascot was talking about using lemon - scented or orange - scented ammonia .
I 'll use bleach .
The head is its own thing .
I 'll use shaving cream on the outside and a Listerine - wash on the inside with a spray bottle , about 6 - to - 1 Listerine to water for the smell and the bacteria .
Some people have it dry - cleaned . "
Mustard stains , after all , can be tough to get out of a lion 's mane .
The heat is also a major problem .
Imagine walking across the Sahara in wool snow pants , several layers of heavy fleece and a deep - sea diving helmet , and you can get a slight idea of what it 's like for a mascot .
Only it 's much worse .
Chris Bergstrom , the agent for Wally the Green Monster , says mascots need to limit themselves to an hour or less between breaks on hot days .
Kilday says the key is hydration .
" Drink as much water as you can before you perform because that 's going to come out as sweat when you perform , " Kilday says .
" And take breaks .
You have to recondition your body to be able to take the heat , but then you get smug about it and it can creep up on you .
The legs will be the first to go .
There are a lot of people who pass out .
They go beyond what their body can do .
That 's really a rookie mistake . "
And passing out is n't even the worst part .
No , the worst part is giving mouth - to - mouth resuscitation to a horse or a bull or a moose .
" It 's tricky , " Kilday says .
" You have to have a very large mouth . "
But the hazards are n't restricted to the mascots .
Fans and breakable objects are also at risk thanks to the largest rear ends in baseball since Rich Garces retired .
" This back here is a mascot wrecking ball .
It will take out everything in its path , " Kilday says while pointing to Slider 's rear end .
" You bend over to say , ' Hi , little Jimmy , ' and you have just dragged mustard and hot dogs over five laps and knocked over 10 beers .
Seriously , you 're shaking hands here and down the row people are going , ' Hey , what 's the deal ? '
You 've started a tidal wave of beer coming towards them . "
One final challenge for mascots : Finding a cap that fits the head of Mr. Met or Mr. Red Legs .
BOX - SCORE LINE OF THE WEEK
Since our last award , San Francisco reliever Bob Howry produced this head - scratching line : 0 IP , 1 H , 1R , 0 ER , 0 BB , 0 K , 1 HR .
How does a pitcher face only one batter and allow a game - ending home run without it being earned ?
It is n't easy , but Howry did so because San Francisco 's Pablo Sandoval dropped a foul popup , allowing Colby Rasmus another chance to swing , and the St. Louis outfielder then homered to end the game .
But this week 's winner goes to his teammate , Jonathan Sanchez .
The Giants have Tim Lincecum , Randy Johnson , Matt Cain and Barry Zito in their rotation , which would make Sanchez about the least likely Giant to throw a no-hitter .
And yet he did just that after spending the previous three weeks in the bullpen .
The only reason he was starting is because Johnson went on the disabled list .
And he came within one error of pitching a perfect game .
His line :
9 IP , 0 H , 0 R , 0 ER , 0 BB , 11 K
The no-hitter improved Sanchez 's career record to 16 - 26 with a 5.07 ERA and one complete game .
TELL YOUR STATISTICS TO SHUT UP
• No further proof that the closer role is the most overrated in sports than the presence of Ryan Franklin in this year 's All - Star Game .
Franklin was a failed starter with a 51 - 67 career record and an ERA before becoming a " closer ' ' this season , but now he's an All - Star because he has 21 saves ?
Please .
It just goes to show you how easy it is to find someone to fill the role .
• Now that baseball is successfully cutting down the length of the games ( this year 's All - Star Game lasted just 2:31 , the shortest in two decades ) , can we also please have a moratorium on overblown All - Star game pre-game tributes ?
Honoring regular folks who do good work was a nice gesture but the pre-game show lasted an excruciating 50 minutes .
• Anaheim 's Chone Figgins made his first All - Star team Tuesday .
Barely .
When Evan Longoria was knocked out due to an infection Tuesday morning , the American League wanted to replace him with Figgins but could n't reach the Angels infielder .
" [ Angels PR director ]
Tim Mead called me , but I was asleep and did n't get the call , " Figgins said .
" So they got ahold of Garret Anderson and Garret called my uncle , who called my mom .
Then my mom called my uncle and he knew that one of my good buddies , Keith Johnson , who coaches the A - ball team for the Angels , was staying with me because his team had an off day .
So the Angels got ahold of him because he had to have his phone as a coach , and he ran in banging on my door , and I woke up in a panic that something happened . "
That was about 9:30 a.m.
Figgins left the Los Angeles area at 12:30 , and his flight landed in St. Louis just in time for him to arrive at the clubhouse about 10 minutes before the player introductions .
He dressed quickly and made it to the foul line to hear his name called as an All - Star .
He did not play in the game but said it was a great day anyway .
• Among the players on the World Team at Sunday 's Futures Game was Mariners third - base prospect Alex Liddi , who grew up in San Remo , Italy .
Liddi , 21 , is hitting .355 with 20 home runs and 73 RBIs at Seattle 's Class A High Desert affiliate .
His father lived in America for awhile and passed a love of the game on to Alex .
Liddi says there was a baseball league where he grew up , and he also played in the European academy that Major League Baseball runs .
He hopes to reach the majors and spark a surge in baseball interest in Italy .
" That would make baseball more popular in Italy and maybe get more people playing baseball , " he said .
• While the new Busch Stadium has some nice qualities , it 's somewhat disappointing .
The biggest drawback is the inability to see the field from the concourse other than in the outfield .
Being able to walk around the ballpark and see the field from almost every spot is pretty much a prerequisite for new ballparks .

There is hope for Ubuntu users with Intel graphics .
As it appears , the current 2D drivers solve most of the recent graphics problems with Intel chips , according to Ubuntu developer Bryce Harrington in a developer mailing list .
Jaunty users should profit it from them as well .
A nuisance to owners of Ubuntu 9.04 and Intel graphics chips has been the problems with the graphics drivers .
Even though Intel manages its drivers in an exemplary open source way , 2D and 3D acceleration has fairly much dragged so far .
The reason is an unhappy pairing of the current Kernel 2.6.28 's Kernel Mode Setting ( KMS ) with Intel 's new UXA acceleration architecture that replaces EXA and the newly added Graphics Execution Manager ( GEM ) in the Kernel .
The solution should come in the form of the Intel 2.7.99.1 driver , as Canonical 's Bryce Harrington describes on the Ubuntu developer mailing list .
The still somewhat unstable 2D driver should fix most of the Intel chip problems , with the stable version to appear later in Ubuntu 9.10 .
Harrington mentions that Jaunty users have the advantage of the Kernel 2.6.30 installation to resolve the issue .
Ubuntu source packets are on the kernel.ubuntu.com webpage .
Harrington suggests activating the UXA module in the xorg .
conf file , but not KMS , which is deactivated by default .
To activate UXA , use Option AccelMethod " UXA " in the Section " Device " in /etc/x11/xorg.conf .
Installing the actualized 2D driver should , however , be accompanied by the stable Intel 2.7.1 driver that you can get from an external Personal Package Archive ( PPA ) .
The source package is xserver - xorg - video - intel .
Careful , though : playing with Xorg can have adverse side effects , so backing up the original files might be a good idea .

In celebrity culture we destroy what we worship .
The commercial exploitation of Michael Jackson ’s death was orchestrated by the corporate forces that rendered Jackson insane .
Jackson , robbed of his childhood and surrounded by vultures that preyed on his fears and weaknesses , was so consumed by self - loathing he carved his African - American face into an ever - changing Caucasian death mask and hid his apparent pedophilia behind a Peter Pan illusion of eternal childhood .
He could not disentangle his public and his private self .
He became a commodity , a product , one to be sold , used and manipulated .
He was infected by the moral nihilism and personal disintegration that are at the core of our corporate culture .
And his fantasies of eternal youth , delusions of majesty , and desperate , disfiguring quests for physical transformation were expressions of our own yearning .
He was a reflection of us in the extreme .
His memorial service — a variety show with a coffin — had an estimated 31.1 million television viewers .
The ceremony , which featured performances or tributes from Stevie Wonder , Brooke Shields and other celebrities , was carried live on 19 networks , including the major broadcast and cable news outlets .
It was the final episode of the long - running Michael Jackson series .
And it concluded with Jackson ’s daughter , Paris , being prodded to stand in front of a microphone to speak about her father .
Janet Jackson , before the girl could get a few words out , told Paris to “ speak up . ”
As the child broke down , the adults around her adjusted the microphone so we could hear the sobs .
The crowd clapped .
It was a haunting echo of what destroyed her father .
The stories we like best are “ real life ” stories — early fame , wild success and then a long , bizarre and macabre emotional train wreck .
O.J Simpson offered a tamer version of the same plot .
So does Britney Spears .
Jackson , by the end , was heavily in debt and had weathered a $ 22 million out - of - court settlement payment to Jordy Chandler , as well as seven counts of child sexual abuse and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to commit a felony .
We fed on his physical and psychological disintegration , especially since many Americans are struggling with their own descent into overwhelming debt , loss of status and personal disintegration .
The lurid drama of Jackson ’s personal life meshed perfectly with the ongoing dramas on television , in movies and in the news .
News thrives on “ real life ” stories , especially those involving celebrities .
News reports on television are mini - dramas complete with a star , a villain , a supporting cast , a good - looking host and a dramatic , if often unexpected , ending .
The public greedily consumed “ news ” about Jackson , especially in his exile and decline , which often outdid most works of fiction .
In “ Fahrenheit 451 , ” Ray Bradbury ’s novel about a future dystopia , people spend most of the day watching giant television screens that show endless scenes of police chases and criminal apprehensions .
Life , Bradbury understood , once it was packaged , scripted , given a narrative and filmed , became the most compelling form of entertainment .
And Jackson was a great show .
He deserved a great finale .
Those who created Jackson ’s public persona and turned him into a piece of property , first as a child and finally as a corpse encased in a $ 15,000 gold - plated casket , are the agents , publicists , marketing people , promoters , script writers , television and movie producers , advertisers , video technicians , photographers , bodyguards , recording executives , wardrobe consultants , fitness trainers , pollsters , public announcers and television news personalities who create the vast stage of celebrity for profit .
They are the puppet masters .
No one achieves celebrity status , no cultural illusion is swallowed as reality , without these armies of cultural enablers and intermediaries .
The producers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles made sure the 18,000 attendees and the television audience ( even the BBC devoted three hours to the tribute ) watched a funeral that was turned into another maudlin form of uplifting popular entertainment .
The memorial service for Jackson was a celebration of celebrity .
There was the queasy sight of groups of children , including his own , singing over the coffin .
Magic Johnson put in a plug for Kentucky Fried Chicken .
Shields , fighting back tears , recalled how she and a 33 - year - old Jackson — who always maintained that he was straight — broke into Elizabeth Taylor ’s room the night before her last wedding to “ get the first peek of the [ wedding ] dress . ”
Shields and Jackson , at Taylor ’s wedding , then joked that they were “ the mother and father of the bride . ”
“ Yes , it may have seemed very odd to the outside , ” Shields said , “ but we made it fun and we made it real . ”
There were photo montages in which a shot of Jackson shaking hands with Nelson Mandela was immediately followed by one of him with Kermit the Frog .
Fame reduces all of the famous to the same level .
Fame is its own denominator .
And every anecdote seemed to confirm that when you spend your life as a celebrity , you have no idea who you are .
We measure our lives by these celebrities .
We seek to be like them .
We emulate their look and behavior .
We escape the messiness of real life through the fantasy of their stardom .
We , too , long to attract admiring audiences for our grand , ongoing life movie .
We try to see ourselves moving through our lives as a camera would see us , mindful of how we hold ourselves , how we dress , what we say .
We invent movies that play inside our heads with us as stars .
We wonder how an audience would react .
Celebrity culture has taught us , almost unconsciously , to generate interior personal screenplays .
We have learned ways of speaking and thinking that grossly disfigure the way we relate to the world and those around us .
Neal Gabler , who has written wisely about this , argues that celebrity culture is not a convergence of consumer culture and religion so much as a hostile takeover of religion by consumer culture .
Jackson desperately feared growing old .
He believed he could control race and gender .
He transformed himself through surgery and perhaps female hormones from a brown - skinned African - American male to a chalk - faced androgynous ghoul with no clear sexual identity .
And while he pushed these boundaries to the extreme , he did only what many Americans do .
There were 12 million cosmetic plastic surgery procedures performed last year in the United States .
They were performed because , in America , most human beings , rich and poor , famous and obscure , have been conditioned to view themselves as marketable commodities .
They are objects , like consumer products .
They have no intrinsic value .
They must look fabulous and live on fabulous sets .
They must remain young .
They must achieve notoriety and money , or the illusion of it , to be a success .
And it does not matter how they get there .
The moral nihilism of our culture licenses a dark voyeurism into other people ’s humiliation , pain , weakness and betrayal .
Education , building community , honesty , transparency and sharing are qualities that will see you , in a gross perversion of democracy and morality , ridiculed and voted off any reality show .
Fellow competitors for prize money and a chance for fleeting fame elect to “ disappear ” the unwanted .
In the final credits of the reality show “ America ’s Next Top Model , ” a picture of the woman expelled during the episode vanishes from the group portrait on the screen .
Those cast aside become , at least to the television audience , nonpersons .
Celebrities who can no longer generate publicity , good or bad , vanish .
Life , these shows teach , is a brutal world of unadulterated competition and constant quest for notoriety and attention .
And life is about the personal humiliation of those who oppose us .
Those who win are the best .
Those who lose deserve to be erased .
Those who fail , those who are ugly or poor , are belittled and mocked .
Human beings are used , betrayed and discarded in a commodity culture , which is pretty much the story of Jackson ’s life , although he experienced the equivalent of celebrity resurrection .
This has been very good for his music sales and perhaps for his father ’s new recording company , which Joe Jackson made sure to plug at public events after his son ’s death .
Compassion , competence , intelligence and solidarity are useless assets when human beings are commodities .
Those who do not achieve celebrity status , who do not win the prize money or make millions in Wall Street firms , deserve their fate .
The cult of self , which Jackson embodied , dominates our culture .
This cult shares within it the classic traits of psychopaths : superficial charm , grandiosity and self - importance ; a need for constant stimulation , a penchant for lying , deception and manipulation ; and the incapacity for remorse or guilt .
Jackson , from his phony marriages to his questionable relationships with young boys , had all these qualities .
This is also the ethic promoted by corporations .
It is the ethic of unfettered capitalism .
It is the misguided belief that personal style and personal advancement , mistaken for individualism , are the same as democratic equality .
It is the celebration of image over substance .
We have a right , in the cult of the self , to get whatever we desire .
We can do anything , even belittle and destroy those around us , including our friends , to make money , to be happy and to become famous .
Once fame and wealth are achieved , they become their own justification , their own morality .
How one gets there is irrelevant .
It is this perverted ethic that gave us Wall Street banks and investment houses that willfully trashed the nation ’s economy , stole money from tens of millions of small shareholders who had bought stocks to finance their retirement or the college expenses of their children .
The heads of these corporations , like the winners on a reality television program who lied and manipulated others to succeed , walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation and bonuses .
The ethic of Wall Street is the ethic of celebrity .
The saturation coverage of Jackson ’s death is an example of our collective flight into illusion .
The obsession with the trivia of his life conceals the despair , meaninglessness and emptiness of our own lives .
It deflects the moral questions arising from mounting social injustice , growing inequalities , costly imperial wars , economic collapse and political corruption .
The wild pursuit of status , wealth and fame has destroyed our souls , as it destroyed Jackson , and it has destroyed our economy .
The fame of celebrities masks the identities of those who possess true power — corporations and the oligarchic elite .
And as we sink into an economic and political morass , as we barrel toward a crisis that will create more misery than the Great Depression , we are controlled , manipulated and distracted by the celluloid shadows on the wall of Plato ’s cave .
The fantasy of celebrity culture is not designed simply to entertain .
It is designed to drain us emotionally , confuse us about our identity , make us blame ourselves for our predicament , condition us to chase illusions of fame and happiness and keep us from fighting back .
And in the end , that is all the Jackson coverage was really about , another tawdry and tasteless spectacle to divert a dying culture from the howling wolf at the gate .
excerpt from
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
* * *
The idea of followers of Jesus getting to join him in heaven upon dying probably did n’t take shape until about a half - century after Jesus died .
To be sure , Jesus ’s followers believed from early on that the faithful would be admitted to the “ Kingdom of Heaven , ” as the New Testament calls it .
But “ Kingdom of Heaven ” is just Matthew ’s synonym for what an earlier Gospel , Mark , had called the “ Kingdom of God . ”
And this kingdom was going to exist on Earth , when God righted history ’s many wrongs by establishing an enduringly just rule .
The Gospel of Luke , written around 80 or 90 CE , half a century after the crucifixion , offers the New Testament ’s earliest clear expectation of a rewarding afterlife upon death .
Luke says that the godfearing criminal hanging on the cross next to Christ will find himself in “ paradise ” alongside Christ that very day .
Luke also tells a story about the afterlives of a rich man and a poor man .
The rich man , who died without repenting his sins , goes to a part of the underworld where , he observes , “ I am in agony in these flames . ”
The poor man has better luck .
He finds himself in the company of Abraham — perhaps , as some have argued , in heaven , but , at the very least , in a more hospitable part of the underworld : someplace where “ he is comforted . ”
Some scholars contend that this idea of immediate reward for the Christian dead goes back to Christ himself — who , after all , is the one who in Luke makes these two references to the afterlife .
Yet neither reference is found in the earliest gospel , Mark , or in the earlier - than - Luke “ Q source ” ( the hypothesized source of stories shared by Luke and Matthew ) .
What caused this shift in expectations by the time Luke was written ?
For one thing , as the decades rolled by and the supposedly imminent Kingdom of God failed to materialize , there was growing concern among Jesus ’s followers over the state of the not - yet - resurrected dead .
The Apostle Paul , writing around two decades after Jesus ’s death , had reassured followers that recently departed family and friends of believers would join “ the rest of us ” in the Kingdom once the Kingdom came .
But by the time of Luke , more than a decade after Paul ’s death , hopes for the Kingdom ’s near - term arrival had dimmed .
Now the attentive Christian was concerned not just about whether dead friends and relatives would eventually be resurrected but about what death would feel like until resurrection — since it increasingly looked as if the Christian in question would join his or her friends and relatives in that state before Judgment Day .
Had Christian doctrine not evolved in response to this challenge , it would have lost credibility as the Kingdom of God failed to show up on Earth — as generations and generations of Christians were seen to have died without getting their reward .
So the Kingdom of God had to be relocated from Earth to heaven , where generations of Christians had presumably gotten their reward — and you could , too , if you accepted Christ as your savior .
Why is it Luke , not the roughly contemporary Matthew , who makes this pivot ?
Maybe because Luke is a more “ gentile ” gospel .
Whereas Matthew often seems to be trying to convert devout Jews to the Jesus movement , stressing its compatibility with traditional Judaism , Luke is focused on winning “ pagan ” converts .
And if he is going to compete with pagan religions , he ’d better make sure that Christianity can match their most popular features .
And one of those features was a blissful afterlife .
Though the official gods of the Roman state offered no such thing , the empire had been besieged by foreign cults that , by filling this void , had won followings .
These religions of salvation came under a variety of brands .
Persian cults talked of souls migrating through the planetary spheres to paradise , and Greek cults offered bliss in Hades , the Greek underworld that had once offered only a humdrum existence for the average soul but now featured lush subdivisions .
Many rivals of Christianity seem to have been thriving in part by offering eternal bliss .
Am I saying that Luke stole his afterlife scenario from a competing religion ?
Not with great confidence , no .
But if you wanted to indict him on this charge , you would not be wholly lacking in evidence .
The evidence would focus on the Egyptian god Osiris .
Osiris bears a certain resemblance to Jesus as Christians would later come to conceive him ; Osiris inhabited the afterworld and judged the recently deceased , granting eternal life to those who believed in him and lived by his code .
But Osiris was doing this a long time before Jesus was born , and meanwhile he had migrated to the Roman Empire , where he had developed a following .
Certainly that story in Luke about the rich man and the poor man in Hades has Osirian overtones .
At the time Luke was writing , a written copy of an Egyptian story about the afterlife was circulating in the Roman Empire .
It was about a rich man and a poor man who die and go to the underworld .
Both are judged at the court of Osiris .
The rich man ’s bad deeds outweighed his good , and so he was consigned to one of the less desirable stations .
( Specifically , the story explains : the “ pivot of the door ” to the underworld is “ planted in his right eye and rotating on this eye whenever the door is closed or opened . ”
Understandably , his “ mouth was open in great lamentation . ” )
In contrast , the poor man , whose good deeds outweighed his bad , got to spend eternity in the company of the “ venerable souls , ” near the seat of Osiris .
Plus , he got the rich man ’s clothes : “ raiment of royal linen . ”
( The rich man in Luke ’s story wore “ purple and fine linen . ” )
The moral of the story , “ He who is good upon earth they are good to him in Amenti ( the underworld ) , while he that is evil they are evil to him . ”
Luke ’s story about the rich man and the poor man seems to have no precedent in earlier Jewish or Christian tradition .
So there is indeed a chance that Luke heard or read the Egyptian story and adapted it for Christian use .
But we ’ll probably never know , and anyway , that is n’t the point .
The point is that , whether or not Luke borrowed this particular story from Egypt ’s heritage , this theme — immediate reward in the afterlife — must have come from somewhere , and the likely source is one of the religions with which Christianity competed in the Roman Empire .

Some are dominant .
Some are submissive .
Some are both .
This is my experience although it tends to create some controversy .
People who switch back and forth between dominant and submissive seem to be looked down upon by many in the lifestyle .
This is a sad fact which I fail to understand .
I met many who like to " play both sides " .
I would guess the most common switch is a bisexual woman who prefers to submit to men while dominating women .
This seems to fulfill both inner desires while dealing with different types of people .
However , I have also met those who can fluctuate back and forth with the same sex .
They truly are switches .
I presume they follow their inclinations based upon their present moment desires .
It must be like choosing fish or steak depending upon your mood .
Please bear in mind that I am only speaking based upon those I met .
I am not a switch in any manner .
My leanings are towards domination .
Also , I would surmise that most lean heavily towards one extreme or another .
My estimation is that people who switch are in the minority .
It is a relatively low number statistically speaking .
There is no reason to believe that people who switch are any less worthy of this lifestyle .
I am astounded at the belligerence many show , especially when online .
It is as if their form of BDSM is the only proper avenue .
What a crock of crap .
BDSM is a personal experience where each is free to develop a method which works for them .
Those who feel there is only one way for people to live are as obtuse as those in the traditional world who degrade our choices .
The important factor to me is that people follow their inner desires .
As William Shakespeare said , " to thy own self be true " .
This one sure took awhile to go from rumor to real , but at long last , authentic TomTom navigation has arrived on the iPhone .
' Course , we would 've personally preferred the Garmin touch , but at this point , we can't really find it in our hearts to kvetch .
The app shown at WWDC today was surprisingly slick , and while the robot voice did n't exactly get our juices flowing , the currently unpriced TomTom car kit is definitely a boon for those looking to avoid standalone PNDs .
Apple has informed us that the application will surface " this summer , " though it did n't mention a price ; in other words , we can't imagine this being cheap .
You think TomTom wants a $ 19 app undercutting its $ 300 navigation systems ?
Doubtful .

If a file system discussion goes on long enough , someone will bring up soft updates eventually , usually in the form of , " Duhhh , why are you Linux people so stupid ?
Just use soft updates , like BSD ! "
Generally , there will be no direct reply to this comment and the conversation will flow silently around it , like a stream around an inky black boulder .
Why is this ?
Is it pure NIH ( Not Invented Here ) on the part of Linux developers ( and Solaris and OS X and AIX and ... ) or is there something deeper going on ?
Why are soft updates so famous and yet so seldom implemented ?
In this article , I will argue that soft updates are , simply put , too hard to understand , implement , and maintain to be part of the mainstream of file system development - while simultaneously attempting to explain how soft updates work .
Oh , the irony !
Soft updates :
The view from 50,000 feet
Soft updates is one of a family of techniques for maintaining on - disk file system consistency .
The basic problem is that a file system does n't always get shut down cleanly - think power outage or operating system crash - and if this happens in the middle of an update to the file system ( say , deleting a file ) , the on - disk state of the file system may be inconsistent ( corrupt ) .
The original solution to this problem was to run fsck on the entire file system to find and correct inconsistencies ; ext2 is an example of a file system that uses this approach .
( Note that this use of fsck - to recover from an unclean shutdown - is different from the use of fsck to check and repair a file system that has suffered corruption through some other cause . )
The fsck approach has obvious drawbacks ( excessive time , possible lost data ) , so file system developers have invented new techniques .
The most popular and well - known is that of logging or journaling : before we begin writing out the changes to the file system , we write a short description of the changes we are about to make ( a journal entry ) to a separate area of the disk ( the journal ) .
If the system crashes in the middle of writing out the changes , we simply finish up the changes by replaying the journal entry at the next file system mount .
Soft updates , instead , takes a two - step approach to crash recovery .
First , we carefully order writes to disk so that , at the time of a crash ( or any other time ) , the only inconsistencies are ones in which a file system structure is marked as allocated when it is actually unused .
Second , at the next boot after the crash , fsck is run in the background on a file system snapshot ( more on that later ) to find and free file system structures that are wrongly marked as allocated .
Basically , soft updates orders writes to the disk so that only relatively harmless inconsistencies are possible , and then fixes them in the background by checking and repairing the entire file system .
The benchmark results are fairly stunning : in common workloads , performance is often within 5 % of that of BSD 's memory - only file system .
The older version of FFS , which used synchronous writes and foreground fsck to provide similar reliability , often runs 20 - 30 % slower than the in -memory file system .
Step 1 : Update dependencies
The first part of implementing soft updates is figuring out how to order the writes to the disk so that after a crash , the only possible errors are inodes and blocks erroneously marked as allocated ( when they are actually free ) .
First , the authors lay out some rules to follow when writing changes to disk in order to accomplish this goal .
From the paper :
Never point to a structure before it has been initialized ( e.g. , an inode must be initialized before a directory entry references it ) .
Never re-use a resource before nullifying all previous pointers to it ( e.g. , an inode 's pointer to a data block must be nullified before that disk block may be re-allocated for a new inode ) .
Never reset the old pointer to a live resource before the new pointer has been set ( e.g. , when renaming a file , do not remove the old name for an inode until after the new name has been written ) .
Pairs of changes in which one change must to be written to disk before the next change can be written , according to the above rules , are called update dependencies .
For some more examples of update dependencies , take the case of writing to the first block in a file for the first time .
The first update dependency is that the block bitmap , which records which blocks are in -use , must be written to show that the block is in use before the block pointer in the inode is set .
If a crash were to occur at this point , the only inconsistency would be one bit in the block bitmap showing a block is allocated when it is n't actually .
This is a resource leak , and must be fixed eventually , but the file system can operate correctly with this error as long as it does n't run out of blocks .
The second update dependency is that the data in the block itself must be written before the block pointer in the inode can be set ( along with the increase in the inode size and the associated timestamp updates ) .
If it were n't , a crash at this point would result in garbage appearing in the file - a potential security hole , as well , if that garbage came from a previously written file .
Instead , a crash would result in a leaked block ( marked as allocated when it is n't ) that happens to contain the data from the attempted write .
As a result , the write to the bitmap and the write of the data to the block must complete ( in any order ) before the write that updates the inode 's block pointer , size , and timestamps .
These rules about ordering of writes are n't new for soft updates ; they were originally created for writes to a " normal " FFS file system .
In the original FFS code , ordering of writes is enforced with synchronous writes - that is , the ongoing file system operation ( create , unlink , etc. ) waits for each ordered write to hit disk before going on to the next step .
While the write is in progress , the operating system buffer containing the disk block in question is locked .
Any other operation needing to change that buffer has to wait its turn .
As a result , many metadata operations progress at disk speed ( i.e. , murderously slowly ) .
Step 2 : Efficiently satisfying update dependencies
So far , we have determined that synchronous writes on locked buffers are a slow , painful way of enforcing the ordering of writes to the file system .
But synchronous writes are overkill for most file system operations ; other than fsync ( ) , we generally do n't want a guarantee that the result has been written to stable storage before the system call returns , and as we 've seen , the file system code itself usually only cares about the order of writes , not when they complete .
What we want is a way to record changes to metadata , along with the associated ordering constraints , and then schedule the actual writes at our leisure .
No problem , right ?
We 'll just add a couple of pointers to each in - memory buffer containing metadata , linking it to the blocks it has come before and after .
Turns out there is a problem : cyclical dependencies .
We have to write to the disk in block - size units , and each block can potentially contain metadata affected by more than one metadata operation .
If two different operations affect the same blocks , it can easily result in conflicting requirements : operation A requires that block 1 be written before block 2 , and operation B requires that block 2 be written before block 1 .
Now you can't write out any changes without violating the ordering constraints .
What to do ?
Most people , at this point , decide to use journaling or copy - on - write to deal with this problem .
Both techniques group related changes into transactions - a set of writes that must take effect all at once - and write them out to disk in such a manner that they take effect atomically .
But if you are Greg Ganger and Yale Patt , you come up with a scheme to record individual modifications to blocks ( such as the update to a single bit in a bitmap block ) and their relationships to other individual changes ( that change requires this other change to be written out first ) .
Then , when you write out a block , you lock it and iterate through the records of individual changes to this block .
For each individual change whose dependencies have n't yet been satisfied , you undo that change to the block , and then write out the resulting block .
When the write is done , you re-apply the changes ( roll forward ) , unlock , and continue on your way until the next write .
The write you just completed may have satisfied the update dependencies of other blocks , so now you can go through the same process ( lock , roll back , write , roll forward , unlock ) for those blocks .
Eventually , all the dependencies will be satisfied and everything will be written to disk , all without running into any circular dependencies .
This , in a nutshell , is what makes soft updates unique .
Recording changes and dependencies
So what does a record of a metadata change , and its corresponding update dependencies , actually look like at the data structure level ?
First , there are twelve ( as of the 1999 paper ) distinct structures to record the different types of dependencies :
Structure Dependency tracked bmsafemap block / inode bitmaps inodedep inode allocdirect blocks referenced by direct block pointers indirdep indirect block allocindir blocks referenced by indirect block pointers pagedep directory entry add / remove mkdir new directory creation dirrem directory removal freefrag fragment to be freed freeblks block to be freed freefile inode to be freed
Each kind of dependency - tracking structure includes pointers that allow it to be linked into lists attached to the buffers containing the relevant on - disk structures .
These lists are what the soft updates code traverses during the roll - back and roll - forward operations on a block being written to disk .
Each dependency structure has a set of state flags describing the current status of the dependency .
The flags indicate whether the dependency is currently applied to the associated buffer , whether all of the writes it depends on have completed , and whether the update described by the dependency tracking structure itself has been written to disk .
When all three of these flags are set ( the update is applied to the in - memory buffer , all its dependent writes are completed , and the update is written to disk ) , the dependency structure can be thrown away .
Page 7 of the 1999 soft updates paper [ PDF ] begins the descriptions of specific kinds of update dependency structures and their relationships to each other .
I 've read this paper at least 15 times , and each time I when get to page 7 , I 'm feeling pretty good and thinking , " Yeah , okay , I must be smarter now than the last time I read this because I 'm getting it this time , " - and then I turn to page 8 and my head explodes .
Here 's the first figure on that page :
And that 's only the figure from the left - hand column .
An only slightly less complex spaghetti - gram occupies the right - hand column .
This goes on for six pages , describing each specific kind of update dependency and its progression through various lists associated with buffers and file system structures and , most importantly , other update dependency structures .
You find yourself struggling through paragraphs like :
Figure 10 shows the structures involved in renaming a file .
[ Figure 10 looks much like the figure above . ]
The dependencies follow the same series of steps as those for adding a new file entry , with two variations .
First , when a roll - back of an entry is needed because its inode has not yet been written to disk , the entry must be set back to the previous inode number rather than zero .
The previous inode number is stored in a dirrem structure .
The DIRCHG flag is set in the diradd structure so that the roll - back code knows to use the old inode number stored in the dirrem structure .
The second variation is that , after the modified directory entry is written to disk , the dirrem structure is added to the work daemon 's tasklist list so that the link count of the old inode will be decremented as described in Section 3.9 .
Say that three times fast !
The point is not that the details of soft updates are too complex for mere humans to understand ( although I personally would n't bet against Greg Ganger being superhuman ) .
The point is that this complexity reflects a lack of generality and abstraction in the design of soft updates as a whole .
In soft updates , every file system operation must be individually analyzed for write dependencies , every on - disk structure must have a custom - designed dependency tracking structure , and every update operation must allocate one of these structures and hook itself into the web of other custom - designed dependency tracking structures .
If you add a new file system feature , like extended attributes , or change the on - disk format , you have to start from scratch and reason out the relevant dependencies , design a new structure , and write the roll - forward / roll - back routines .
It 's fiddly , tedious work , and the difficulty of doing it correctly does n't make it any better a use of programmer staff - hours .
Contrast the highly operation - specific design of soft updates to the transaction - style interface used by most journaling and copy - on - write file systems .
When you begin a logical operation ( such as a file create ) , you create a transaction handle .
Then , for each on - disk structure you have to modify , you add that buffer to the list of buffers modified by this transaction .
When you are done , you close out the transaction and hand it off to the journaling ( or COW ) subsystem , which figures out how to merge it with other transactions and write them out to disk properly .
The user of the transaction interface only has to know how to open , close , and add blocks to a transaction , while the transaction code only has to know which blocks are part of the same transaction .
Adding a new write operation requires no special knowledge or analysis beyond remembering to add changed blocks to the transaction .
The lack of generalization and abstraction shows up again when the combination of update dependency ordering and the underlying disk format poke out and cause strange user - visible behavior .
The most prominent example shows up when removing a directory ; following the rules governing update dependencies means that a directory 's " .. " entry can't be removed until the directory itself is recorded as unlinked on the disk .
Chains of update dependencies sometimes resulted in up to two minutes of delay between the return of rmdir ( ) , and the corresponding decrement of the parent directory 's link count .
This can break , among other things , a simple recursive " rm - rf " .
The fix was to fake up a second link count that is reported to userspace , but the real problem was a too - tight coupling between on - disk structures , the system to maintain on - disk consistency , and the user - visible structures .
Long chains of update dependencies cause problems elsewhere , during unmount and fsync ( ) in particular .
Fsck and the snapshot
But wait , there 's more !
The second stage of recovery for soft updates is to run fsck after the next boot , in the background using a snapshot of the file system metadata .
File system snapshots in FFS are implemented by creating a sparse file the same size as the file system - the snapshot file .
Whenever a block of metadata is altered , the original data is first copied to the corresponding block in the snapshot file .
Reads of unaltered blocks in the snapshot redirect to the originals .
Online fsck runs on the snapshot of the file system metadata , finding leaked blocks and inodes .
Once it completes , fsck uses a special system call to mark these blocks and inodes as free again .
Online fsck implemented in this manner has severe limitations .
First , recovery from a crash still requires reading and processing the metadata for the entire file system - in the background , certainly , but that 's still a lot of I /O .
( Freeblock scheduling piggybacks low - priority I/O , like that of a background fsck , on high - priority foreground I/ O so that it interferes as little as possible with " real " work , but that 's cold comfort . )
Second , it 's not actually a full file system check and repair , it 's just a scan for leaked blocks and inodes - expected inconsistencies .
The whole concept of running fsck on a snapshot file whose blocks are allocated from the same file system assumes that the file system is not corrupted in a way that leaves blocks marked as free when they are actually allocated .
Conclusion
Conceptually , soft updates can be explained concisely - order writes according to some simple rules , track updates to metadata blocks , roll - back updates with unsatisfied dependencies before writing the block to disk , then roll - forward the updates again .
But when it come to implementation , only programmers with deep , encyclopedic knowledge of the file system 's on - disk format can derive the correct ordering rules and construct the associated data structures and web of dependencies .
The close coupling of on - disk data structures and their updates and the user - visible data structures and their updates results in weird , counter - intuitive behavior that must be covered up with additional code .
Overall , soft updates is a sophisticated , insightful , clever idea - and an evolutionary dead end .
Journaling and copy - on - write systems are easier to implement , require less special - purpose code , and demand far less of the programmer writing to the interface .
Pizza the Hut
With a significant decline in sales , Pizza
Hut is responding to the tough economic times by launching a new branding strategy .
Will ‘ The Hut ’ make you want to eat out again ?
It 's no secret , more consumers are choosing to dine at home and avoid ' junk ' foods to save money .
The largest player in the pizza industry is trying to win back pizza fans with a new image and menu items like all - natural multigrain pizza , lasagna , and wings .
There 's a big trend in general around having confidence in the foods that you eat .
People over the age of 35 , whose frequency with pizza is declining , said one of the big things that would reignite their passion with the category is to have a pizza made with multigrain crust and an all natural tomato sauce ...
Design is a great way to create an emotional expression for your brand .
But the pizza category has been a real laggard in doing that .
Our red box is a game changer in packaging and design .
And yes , we 're also introducing another vocabulary word with Pizza Hut , which is ' The Hut . '
That ties in nicely with ( today's ) texting generation .
We wanted to make sure that Pizza Hut and ' The Hut ' become common vernacular for our brand .
Red is our mark and when you see that red roof , people will refer to it as ' The Hut ' or ' Pizza Hut . '
As we expand our online and mobile businesses , ' The Hut ' is the perfect icon for our mobile generation .
- Brian Niccol , Pizza Hut CMO on BrandWeek
While ' The Hut ' branded pizza boxes are already in use and several restaurants have already been converted , it has not been decided whether Pizza Hut will be rebranding all of its restaurants .
We think that ' The Hut ' is to Pizza Hut as Coke is to Coca - Cola .
We have begun using the term in conjunction with Pizza Hut in our advertising , pizza boxes and some restaurants .
- Christopher Fuller , Pizza Hut spokesman on WalletPop
Newly converted ' The Hut ' restaurants have been seen popping up across the United States , including this one spotted in Florida by Paxton Holley :
Close up of an alternate logo , featured on the side of the new restaurant :
If Pizza
Hut does decide to change its logo , I hope they go more in this direction over ' The Hut ' ( which reminds me a little too much of this character ) .
UPDATE : Pizza
Hut spokesman Chris Fuller has replied in our comments ensuring that ' The Hut ' is just a marketing effort and not a permanent name change .
MSN reports : " The boxes and some store signs will say ' The Hut . '
Others will retain the Pizza Hut name . "
In related news , Pizza Hut is launching Hut TV , an in - store video network which will allow customers to watch TV shows ( like Wheel of Fortune and Entertainment Tonight ) while dining at the new ' Hut ' locations .

Maybe I took a few too many bocce balls to the Noggin at the Dogifh Head Intergalactic Bocce Tournament a few weeks ago , but I 've had the stuff on my mind ever since .
Specifically the Aprihop which Dogfish Head describes as " a serious India Pale Ale brewed with real apricots . "
I quickly learned what they meant by serious when I watched my fellow tasters try it out .
Everyone was surprised .
For some the first sip seemed to be a revelation .
Is beer allowed to taste this flavorful ?
Yes , my friends , it is .
But is this brew a fruity success or rotten to its core ?
Tastes : like golden raisins .
The very notion of fruit in a beer seems to dream up notions of lambics .
Sorry , dainty beer drinkers , you wo n't find any of that juicy sweetness here .
Aprihop combines the flavors of apricots with the hoppy sourness of an IPA to create a beverage that is charged with flavor .
I got mine : at Cost Plus World Market at Tempe Marketplace for about $ 10 .
A bit steep , honestly .
Goes with : the increasing heat .
It could be that associate this with costumed super heroes playing Bocce ball , but I have a feeling I 'll be consuming a four pack of Aprihop off an on as the Summer wears on .
It 's absolutely refreshing .
Verdict : I think this is a great brew .
It 's got a little something extra with that apricot flavor that makes it intriguing enough to try it again and again .
A few of my fellow tasters were concerned that this beer would be hard to consume multiple bottles of though , so be warned if you 're not used to drinking heavier brews .
Happy drinking !
This is just brilliant .
I always feel a bit awkward in an elevator funnily enough , but from now on I 'mma try and notice these little things .
Enjoy .
Here we are , the week after E3 !
There are quite a few games to choose from this week , but without a doubt there is one in the bunch that is a must - own title .
Rock Band Unplugged will be released this week exclusively on the PSP .
Besides the usual yearly sports releases , this week will also see the release of Prototype .
We ’ll see if this game is able to stand up to inFamous .

The AMA long ago recognized that the economic principle of supply and demand was vital to its members and to their economic well - being .
Early in the 20th century , from 1908 to 1910 , the AMA worked with the Carnegie Foundation to have written a so - called " scientific report " under the separate auspices of the Carnegie Foundation .
The result was the Flexner Report or Bulletin Number 4 of the Carnegie Commission published in 1910 .
It called for a drastic reduction in the number of medical schools and doctors in the country and their education along scientific lines .
Oddly , this medical report was written not by a doctor but by Abraham Flexner whose only qualifications were as a teacher in Louisville , Kentucky , a basic general education B.A. from Johns Hopkins , and most importantly , his being the brother of Simon Flexner , perhaps the leading physician in the U.S. and head of the Rockefeller Medical Institute .
In fact , although Abraham Flexner is attributed as the " author " of this report and although he may have written its words , the ideas that the report is based on came from brother Simon and the AMA .
The Flexner Report still exerts tremendous influence on today 's medical education and on the U.S. healthcare system :
No medical school can be created without the permission of the state government .
Likewise , the size of existing medical schools is subject to state regulation ; Each state branch of the American Medical Association has oversight over the conventional medical schools located within the state ; Medicine in the USA and Canada becomes a highly paid and well - respected profession ; ... Kessel ( 1958 ) argued that the Flexner Report in effect began the cartelization of the American medical profession , a cartelization enforced by the American Medical Association and backed by the police power of each American state .
This de facto cartel restricted the supply of physicians , and raised the incomes of the remaining practitioners .
SOURCES : http://en.wikipedia.org/...
Kessel , Reuben , 1958 .
" Price Discrimination in Medicine " , Journal of Law and Economics 1 ( Oct. , 1958 ) : 20 –53 .
Slate notes that the physician shortage could reach 100,000 over the next twenty years and also notes the concerns of the Obama administration on the shortage of doctors to provide care especially if reforms are enacted .
Interestingly , the same article shows the continuing powerful role the medical community has played in keeping its numbers in line :
Ironically , just a little more than a decade ago , there was a doctor surplus .
In 1996 , a committee of the Institute of Medicine warned that the United States had a surfeit of doctors caused by foreign - trained physicians coming here to work and recommended freezing med - school class sizes and limiting first - year residency positions .
A year later , Slate ran an article on an alternative strategy for reducing the number of doctors approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration .
Under the Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Project , 41 teaching hospitals received $ 400 million in exchange for not training between 20 percent and 25 percent of the medical residents they would otherwise have trained over the next six years .
SOURCE : http://www.slate.com/...
The United States with over 300,000,000 citizens has only 126 or so medical schools .
The United States stopped opening medical schools in the 1980s because of a predicted surplus of doctors , USA Today reported .
The same article notes :
The marketplace does n't determine how many doctors the nation has , as it does for engineers , pilots and other professions .
The number of doctors is a political decision , heavily influenced by doctors themselves .
Congress controls the supply of physicians by how much federal funding it provides for medical residencies — the graduate training required of all doctors .
http://www.usatoday.com/...
So , in the medical healthcare equation , bringing about reform of the type of delivery system ( whether single payer or something else ) is only part of the solution .
Another vital part of the equation is increasing the number of health care providers to drive down costs .
The reason that the AMA has historically opposed this and indeed , the reason they underwrote the Flexner Report , even choosing in the background its author and making sure of his brother 's good standing with their organization , and then propigated its findings , was to artificially limit the number of doctors being produced so as to increase the pay of the medical community .
The Obama Administration should set out to work with the states to : 1 ) increase the number of graduates from state medical schools ; 2 ) set up new , high quality medical schools to supplement the few medical training schools the country has .
There exists , after all , a huge pool of highly educated and trained people who wish to work in medicine but are kept out by their " union " ( the AMA ) with the help of states and our national government .
This has historical precedent .
After " Sputnik " the US government dramatically increased funding and training for scientists and engineers with a resulting huge increase in their number .
The same thing should be done today in medical care : we need more doctors , nurses , and perhaps even a new category ( ies ) of health care providers with two or three years of medical training and emphasis on primary care .
Stop Trading , Listen to Cramer !
Mad Money 's Jim Cramer weighs in on Rep. Darrell Issa 's allegations against Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Something about the way Americans eat is n’t working -- and has n’t been for a long time .
The number of obese Americans is now greater than the number who are merely overweight , according to government figures released last month .
It ’s as if once we taste food , we ca n’t stop until we ’ve gorged ourselves .
Taking that inclination into account , some people are adopting an unusual solution to overeating .
Rather than battling temptation in grocery stores , restaurants and their own kitchens , they simply do n’t eat .
At least not at certain times of the day or specific days of the week .
Called intermittent fasting , this rather stark approach to weight control appears to be supported by science , not to mention various religious and cultural practices around the globe .
The practice is a way to become more circumspect about food , its adherents say .
But it also seems to yield the benefits of calorie restriction , which may ultimately reduce the risk of some diseases and even extend life .
Some fasters , in fact , ultimately switch from regular , if comparatively rare , periods of hunger to permanent deprivation .
They limit calories all the time .

“ There is something kind of magical about starvation , ” says Dr. Marc Hellerstein , a professor of endocrinology , metabolism and nutrition at UC Berkeley , who studies fasting .
Adds Mark P. Mattson , chief of the laboratory of neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging : “ In normal health subjects , moderate fasting -- maybe one day a week or cutting back on calories a couple of days a week -- will have health benefits for most anybody . ”
Mattson is among the leading researchers on the effects of calorie restriction and the brain .
Not all nutrition professionals see the merits of fasting .
Some think of it as a recipe for disaster , setting up a person for binge eating and metabolic confusion .
Ruth Frechman , a registered dietitian in Burbank and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn. , says she frequently sees such extreme strategies backfire .
“ You ’re hungry , fatigued , irritable .
Fasting is not very comfortable .
People try to cut back one day and the next day they ’re starving and they overeat . ”

Researchers who study fasting and caloric restriction , however , say the body ’s hunger cycle ultimately adjusts .
And from a biological standpoint , they say , fasting can be helpful whether someone is overweight or normal weight .
“ We ’re brilliant at this , ” Hellerstein says , referring to humans ’ physical reaction to not eating .
“ We ’re not good at responding to too many calories , but we ’re very good at responding to fasting .
Fasting , in itself , is not an unhealthy process . ”

Benefits to body
During fasting , almost every system in the body is “ turned down , ” Hellerstein says .
The body changes how it uses fuel .
Certain hormone levels fall .
Growth stops .
Reproduction becomes impossible .
“ By the end of three weeks of fasting you are a completely different metabolic creature , ” he says .
“ It affects many , many processes -- but in a somewhat predictable way that takes you toward disease prevention . ”

Put simply , intermittent fasting appears to offer the same advantages as long - term calorie restriction -- defined as eating at regular times but consuming 25 % to 30 % fewer calories than what is recommended for that person based on age , size and gender ( see accompanying article ) .
People who eat this way tend to do so by filling up on nutrient - dense but low - calorie foods .
They get all the protein , fiber , vitamins and minerals the body absolutely needs -- and very little else .
With intermittent fasting , “ the idea is that maybe you can trick the system to think it ’s starving , but not make it starve every day , ” Hellerstein says .
Researchers are n’t sure why the body apparently benefits from a state of mini-starvation .
One theory is that the process produces just enough stress in cells to be good .
“ What our evidence suggests is that nerve cells in animals that are on dietary energy restriction are under mild stress , ” Mattson says .
“ It ’s a mild stress that stimulates the production of proteins that protect the neurons against more severe stress . ”
What they do know is that occasionally going without food or reducing calories daily makes the body more sensitive to insulin , which helps maintain normal blood sugar levels .
And animal studies suggest calorie restriction may reduce the risk of cancer by slowing the growth of abnormal cells .

“ We ’ve been finding that putting an animal on a reduced - calorie diet for a couple of weeks dramatically slows cell proliferation rates , ” Hellerstein says .
“ This is the case in pretty much every tissue you look at : prostate , skin , colon , liver , lymphocytes . ”
Intermittent fasting and calorie restriction have also been shown in animals to reduce cognitive decline in diseases such as Alzheimer ’s disease and Parkinson ’s disease , Mattson says .

Little research yet

Researchers caution that not many studies have examined humans who are practicing intermittent fasting or caloric restriction .
But the little evidence that exists is favorable .
A study published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that reducing calories 30 % per day increased the memory function of elderly men and women .
The study was performed at the Salk Institute in La Jolla .
University of Utah scientists looked at health data from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , who have lower rates of heart disease than most Americans .
Mormons typically do n’t smoke or drink alcohol , and some abstain from food on the first Sunday of every month .
After controlling for several factors that protect against heart disease , the researchers found that only fasting made a significant difference in lowering the risk of heart disease .
Among 448 people surveyed , intermittent fasting was associated with more than a 40 % reduction in heart disease risk .
Fasting was also linked to a lower incidence of diabetes .
The study was published in October in the American Journal of Cardiology .
Another study showed that asthma patients who fasted had fewer symptoms , better airway function and a decrease in the markers of inflammation in the blood than those who did n’t fast or restrict calories .
The study was conducted because being overweight is known to worsen asthma symptoms .
The study was published in 2007 in the journal Free Radical Biology & Medicine .

“ They complied with the diet pretty well , ” Mattson says .
“ If people know that tomorrow they can eat whatever they want , today they can eat less . ”
The National Institutes of Health is now supporting calorie - restriction research at three medical centers .
At one study site , Washington University in St. Louis , Dr. Luigi Fontana is following the largest group to date of people who practice caloric restriction or intermittent fasting .
So far his research shows that such people are not malnourished and have excellent cardiovascular health .
“ Eating less is important because 65 % of the American population is overweight , ” Fontana says .
“ But another question is :
If you are already lean , should you change your diet to improve your health and possibly extend your life span ? ”
That ultimately may be the strongest selling point of a reduced - calorie lifestyle .

( For first - person accounts , see accompanying article . )
“ It does demand more than some other diets , ” says Joseph Cordell , a St. Louis lawyer who limits his intake to 1,800 to 1,900 calories a day .
“ But surely the payoff is dramatically better than anything else .
I feel so much better and have more energy .
And there is this prospect of living so much longer than you otherwise would . ”

Daily calorie consumption has increased among American adults , from an average of 2,234 per day in 1970 to an average of 2,757 in 2003 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
The number of calories needed each day to maintain weight varies according to age , gender and activity level .
A calorie calculator to individualize your intake can be found on the USDA website MyPyramid.gov .
Here are some general calorie consumption recommendations from the USDA :
* Active females ages 19 - 30 : 2,400
* Active females ages 31 - 50 : 2,200

Image of part of a stellar remnant whose explosion was recorded in 185 A.D .
Thanks to a unique “ ballistic study ” that combines data from ESO ’s Very Large Telescope and NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory , astronomers have now solved a long - standing mystery of the Milky Way ’s particle accelerators .
They show in a paper published today on Science Express that cosmic rays from our galaxy are very efficiently accelerated in the remnants of exploded stars .
During the Apollo flights astronauts reported seeing odd flashes of light , visible even with their eyes closed .
We have since learnt that the cause was cosmic rays – extremely energetic particles from outside the Solar System arriving at the Earth , and constantly bombarding its atmosphere .
Once they reach Earth , they still have sufficient energy to cause glitches in electronic components .
Galactic cosmic rays come from sources inside our home galaxy , the Milky Way , and consist mostly of protons moving at close to the speed of light , the “ ultimate speed limit ” in the Universe .
These protons have been accelerated to energies exceeding by far the energies that even CERN ’s Large Hadron Collider will be able to achieve .
“ It has long been thought that the super - accelerators that produce these cosmic rays in the Milky Way are the expanding envelopes created by exploded stars , but our observations reveal the smoking gun that proves it ” , says Eveline Helder from the Astronomical Institute Utrecht of Utrecht University in the Netherlands , the first author of the new study .
“ You could even say that we have now confirmed the calibre of the gun used to accelerate cosmic rays to their tremendous energies ” , adds collaborator Jacco Vink , also from the Astronomical Institute Utrecht .
For the first time Helder , Vink and colleagues have come up with a measurement that solves the long - standing astronomical quandary of whether or not stellar explosions produce enough accelerated particles to explain the number of cosmic rays that hit the Earth ’s atmosphere .
The team ’s study indicates that they indeed do and directly tells us how much energy is removed from the shocked gas in the stellar explosion and used to accelerate particles .
“ When a star explodes in what we call a supernova a large part of the explosion energy is used for accelerating some particles up to extremely high energies ” , says Helder .
“ The energy that is used for particle acceleration is at the expense of heating the gas , which is therefore much colder than theory predicts ” .
The researchers looked at the remnant of a star that exploded in AD 185 , as recorded by Chinese astronomers .
The remnant , called RCW 86 , is located about 8200 light - years away towards the constellation of Circinus ( the Drawing Compass ) .
It is probably the oldest record of the explosion of a star .
Using ESO ’s Very Large Telescope , the team measured the temperature of the gas right behind the shock wave created by the stellar explosion .
They measured the speed of the shock wave as well , using images taken with NASA ’s X -ray Observatory Chandra three years apart .
They found it to be moving at between 10 and 30 million km/h , between 1 and 3 percent the speed of light .
The temperature of the gas turned out to be 30 million degrees Celsius .
This is quite hot compared to everyday standards , but much lower than expected , given the measured shock wave ’s velocity .
This should have heated the gas up to at least half a billion degrees .
“ The missing energy is what drives the cosmic rays ” , concludes Vink .

Cyanide is in love with a protein called the cytochrome oxidase .
The cytochromes in the membrane of the mitochondria are involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation .
Oxidative phosphorylation is when the cell makes ATP energy for the cell .
The cell needs proteins called cytochromes in order to complete the process of producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation .
So , in normal circumstances , ATP is produced by the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation .
This requires oxygen .
When the process is working , oxygen is reduced to water .
When cyanide is present ( remember that cytochrome oxidase and cyanide are in love with each other ) the cyanide binds to the cytochrome oxidase and prevent oxygen from binding .
Cyanide does not let go , therefore , oxygen cannot bind nor can it be reduced to water .
Because of this , the mitochondria cannot make ATP .
When a cell cannot make ATP , the cell dies .
That is why it is toxic !
The movement to call Israel to account for its crimes against the Palestinian people is growing , it is " invading the mainstream discourse , becoming part of the constant and unrelenting drumbeat against Israel . "
It could eventually threaten the existence of the Jewish state by undermining the support it receives from its strongest backer , the U. S. government .
That was the message of alarm delivered by the Executive Director of the American Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee , Howard Kohr , to the AIPAC Policy Conference on May 3 . [ i ]
AIPAC is one of the principal organizations that lobby publicly on behalf of Israel in the United States , where it is an important influence on foreign policy .
Among the 6,000 dignitaries who attended its policy conference were more than half of the members of the Senate and a third of the members of the House of Representatives .
Featured speakers included Vice President Joe Biden , Senator John Kerry , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and Israeli President Shimon Peres .
AIPAC and its allies are often alleged to act as a kind of shadow government in Washington , distorting policy in Israel 's interest rather than that of the U.S .
This stands reality on its head .
The pro-Israel lobby carries real weight in the halls of power , but only because the U.S. and Israel share the same fundamental interests .
The U.S. relies on Israel to keep the Arab states of the Middle East divided , weak , and under constant threat of attack , thus ensuring that they remain subservient to Washington .
For its part , Israel could not continue to exist in its present form without the strong political and material support it receives from the U.S.
It received more than $ 2.5 billion in military aid from the U.S. in 2009 . [ ii ]
Israel and the United States may be partners with shared objectives , but the relationship is a highly unequal one .
Kohr 's address focused on the growing power of the international movement against Israel 's criminal behavior , identifying support for boycott , divestment and sanctions as a particularly worrisome development .
Kohr pointed to a variety of statements and actions against Israel 's onslaught on Palestinians in Gaza , including demonstrations in Spain and Germany .
He noted that 400 British academics had demanded that Britain 's Science Museum cancel an event highlighting the work of Israeli scientists and that an Italian trade union calls for a boycott of Israeli products .
" Incredibly , there now is even an Israel Apartheid Week conducted in cities across the globe , " he added .
Kohr noted the strength of opposition to Israel in the Middle East , Europe , and in international forums .
But he voiced particular concern over the movement 's progress in the United States " where Israel stands accused of apartheid and genocide , where Zionism equals racism , where a former president of the United States can publicly accuse Israel of apartheid .
" Significantly , the AIPAC leader also insisted on the profound nature of the issues that divide supporters and critics of Israeli policy .
What we are witnessing is the attempted delegitimization of Israel ; the systematic sowing of doubt that Israel is a nation that has forfeited the world 's concern ; a nation whose actions are , in the strict meaning of the term , indefensible .
This is more than the simple spewing of hatred .
This is a conscious campaign to shift policy , to transform the way Israel is treated by its friends to a state that deserves not our support , but our contempt ; not our protection , but pressured to change its essential nature .... I'm not saying that these allegations have become accepted .
But they have become acceptable .
More and more they are invading the mainstream discourse , becoming part of the constant and unrelenting drumbeat against Israel .
These voices are laying the predicate for an abandonment .
They 're making the case for Israel 's unworthiness to be allowed what is for any nation the first and most fundamental of rights : the right to self - defense .
....
They are preparing us for a world in which Israel stands alone , isolated , and at risk .... Now , there 's little we can do to stop the boycotts of Israeli goods launched in London or Lisbon or Rome .
There 's little we can do to stop Israel Apartheid Week .
But there is much we can do to stop this campaign from taking hold here .
Here where it matters the most , in Washington , where United States policy is forged , we must stop the delegitimization of Israel .
We must not let it penetrate the halls of Congress and the counsels of our president .
To win support for Israel from the U.S. ruling class , Kohr argued , friends of Israel must address " the absolute foundation , the base on which all else rests , " that is , the fact that Israel is " a Western outpost in the Middle East .
To those who make that accusation , I say you are right .
Israel is the only democratic country in the region that looks
West , that looks to the values and the vision we share of what our society , our country should aim at and aspire to .
If that foundation of shared values is shaken , the rationale for the policies we pursue today will be stripped away .
The reasons the United States would continue to invest nearly $ 3 billion in Israel 's security ; the willingness to stand with Israel , even alone if need be ; the readiness to defend Israel 's very existence , all are undermined and undone if Israel is seen to be unjust and unworthy .
" Kohr 's argument that Israel is a garrison state , " a Western outpost in the Middle East , " the front line of the defense of imperialist interests in the region , is not often stated in such forthright terms .
But it is quite accurate , and speaks to the source of the conflict in the region .
Palestine appeals for solidarityIn his speech , Kohr voiced great alarm at the growth in solidarity with the Palestinian people in recent months .
The unprecedented growth of the international solidarity movement is a grass - roots response to the crimes committed by Israel during its murderous 22 - day assault on Gaza , and the tight siege of the territory that it maintains to this day .
Solidarity with Palestine is being expressed in many different ways .
One of these is the international campaign for boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) against Israel .
Support for BDS has grown considerably in recent months , which is why the AIPAC leader highlighted it as a cause for particular concern .
The BDS movement responds to an appeal for solidarity that was issued by Palestinian civil society in July 2005 .
More than 170 organizations , including trade unions , political and social organizations , and women 's and youth groups , issued the appeal .
The signatories represent all three components of the divided Palestinian nation , namely , refugees , Palestinians living under Israeli occupation , and Palestinian citizens of Israel .
The appeal from Palestine said , in part , We , representatives of Palestinian civil society , call upon international civil society organizations and people of conscience all over the world to impose broad boycotts and implement divestment initiatives against Israel similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era .
We appeal to you to pressure your respective states to impose embargoes and sanctions against Israel .
We also invite conscientious Israelis to support this call , for the sake of justice and genuine peace .
These non-violent punitive measures should be maintained until Israel meets its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people 's inalienable right to self - determination and fully complies with the precepts of international law by : 1. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall ; 2 .
Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab - Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality ; and3 .
Respecting , protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in U.N. resolution 194. [ iii ]
Students mobilize for PalestineStudents have been in the forefront of the solidarity movement with Palestine .
The attack on Gaza spurred student solidarity to new heights .
In what one newspaper described as " the biggest student revolt for 20 years , " students in the U.K. organized occupations at 34 universities .
They used the facilities to hold meetings and show films promoting awareness of the oppression of the Palestinians .
Many occupations demanded that their university provide practical aid to Palestinian universities and students .
Another common theme of the movement was a call to end all ties to arms manufacturers - the university - military connection being particularly strong in the U.K .
The universities promote research that benefits the merchants of death ; they also invest in those companies .
The student movement achieved some notable gains .
Glasgow Strathclyde University agreed to end its purchases from Eden Springs , an Israeli company that produces bottled water from land in the Golan Heights that Israel refuses to return to Syria .
Several universities agreed to provide scholarships to Palestinian students .
Others organized fundraising for Palestine ; many of these efforts are ongoing .
The Oxford and Manchester universities agreed to donate surplus books , journals and other educational material to universities in Palestine .
At the University of Manchester , an emergency meeting of the student union attended by more than 850 people adopted a motion committing the union to campaign for BDS .
One of the most important results of the wave of occupations was to raise consciousness of the Palestine issue among thousands of students and beyond .
It also provided activists with valuable experience in organizing on this issue and forged links between them .
Following on the occupations , many of the campus Palestine committees have increased their activity in support of BDS .
Efforts are also being made to build a more sustained student Palestine solidarity movement . [ iv ]
In early February , new ground was conquered in the U.S. when Hampshire College agreed to implement a policy of divestment , the first college or university in the country to do so .
Bowing to a two - year campaign by Students for Justice in Palestine , the Board of Trustees agreed to withdraw its investments from six companies targeted by SJP because they profit from the Israeli occupation of Palestine .
SPJ noted that " this groundbreaking decision follows in Hampshire 's history of being the first college in the country to divest from apartheid South Africa 32 years ago , a decision based on similar human rights concerns . " [ v] Archbishop Desmond Tutu hailed the decision : " This is a monumental and historic step in the struggle for Palestinian equality , self - determination and peace in the Holy Land by non-violent means .
I see what these students have accomplished as a replica of the support of their college of our struggle against apartheid in South Africa .
Hampshire College 's decision to divest should be a guiding example to all institutions of higher learning . " [ vi] Israeli Apartheid WeekIn his speech to the conference , AIPAC leader Hauk twice referred to Israeli Apartheid Week ( IAW ) , an annual series of presentations and film showings that focus on the Israeli apartheid system and the need for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
Initiated at the University of Toronto in 2005 , IAW events took place this year on five continents in more than 40 cities and towns , 11 of them in Israeli - occupied Palestine , during the first week of March . [ vii ]
Organizers of IAW in Canada , one of the centers of the movement , had to contend with a sustained barrage of attacks and threats from Zionist organizations backed up by the federal government .
In February Jason Kenney , Canada 's Minister of Citizenship , Immigration , and Multiculturalism , decried the " anti-Zionist version of anti-Semitism " which maintains that " the Jews alone have no right to a homeland . "
A few weeks later Kenny took aim directly at IAW .
Speaking to the House of Commons , he proclaimed that " Israel Apartheid Week is not about [ freedom of opinion ] ....
We condemn these efforts to single out and attack the Jewish people and their homeland . "
He thus suggested , without the slightest basis in fact , that IAW organizers were violating Canada 's criminal code , which bans " hate propaganda .
" University administrators on a number of campuses followed the government 's lead , attempting to disrupt Israeli Apartheid Week .
But IAW organizers were successful in beating back these attacks .
The daily events unfolded as planned , with audiences of up to 500 in Toronto and Ottawa and 400 in Montreal .[ viii ]
Boycott Motorola , Caterpillar , Israeli produceCampus - based activities in solidarity with Palestine are one facet of a broader international campaign , which includes targeted boycotts of companies that profit from Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians .
Motorola is one such company .
The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation is urging consumers to " Hang Up On Motorola " until it stops selling communications and surveillance equipment to the Israeli military and to Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land .
The group organized a protest outside Motorola 's annual shareholders meeting in Chicago on May 4 .
Inside the meeting , representatives of the Presbyterian , United Methodist and other churches pressed shareholders to adopt a resolution that would instruct Motorola to follow corporate standards consistent with international law .
The pressure on Motorola has already forced it to give up some ground .
After Human Rights
Watch announced that its teams had found shrapnel carrying Motorola serial numbers at some of the civilian sites bombed by Israel in its recent assault on Gaza , the company sold the department that makes the fuses for the bombs .[ ix ]
Caterpillar is another target .
Israel makes extensive use of its bulldozers to demolish Palestinian homes and to build the apartheid wall .
In early February the Church of England announced that it had withdrawn investments of more than £ 2.2 million ( $ 3.5 million ) from Caterpillar , following a policy that it adopted in 2005 of not investing in companies that support the occupation .
Other churches and faith - based organizations have joined the divestment movement against the company . [ x ]
In Canada , the Committee Against Israeli Apartheid and other solidarity activists have organized a boycott of Indigo Books and Music .
They demand that the majority shareholders of the bookstore chain , Heather Reisman and Gerry Schwartz , publicly end their support of Heseg , the Foundation for Lone Soldiers .
Reisman and Schwartz created the foundation in 2005 to reward " lone soldiers , " volunteers who travel to Israel to serve in the Israeli military .
Every year , Heseg grants scholarships to a hundred or more of these zealots to help them remain in Israel after they complete their military service . [ xi ]
For the last two years , solidarity activists have picketed and distributed leaflets periodically outside some of the company 's main bookstores .
They have also spoken out at some of its high - profile promotional events and at its annual shareholder meetings .
The Indigo campaign has been a useful way to reach out and educate the general public about Palestine .
It has also helped to maintain the visibility of the issue during periods when the mainstream media chooses to ignore it .
In Europe , consumer boycotts of Israeli products , particularly agricultural produce , are gaining momentum .
The U.K. - based daily The Guardian reported in its April 3 edition that " Israeli companies are feeling the impact of boycott moves in Europe ... amid growing concern within the Israeli business sector over organized campaigns following the recent attack on Gaza .
Last week , the Israel Manufacturers Association reported that 21 % of 90 local exporters who were questioned had felt a drop in demand due to boycotts , mostly from the U.K. and Scandinavian countries .
Last month , a report from the Israel Export Institute reported that 10 % of 400 polled exporters received order cancellation notices this year , because of Israel 's assault on Gaza .
"
The article also cited the Israeli financial daily , The Marker , which said that " the horrific images on TV and the statements of politicians in Europe and Turkey are changing the behavior of consumers , businessmen and potential investors .
Many European consumers boycott Israeli products in practice . " [ xii ]
Veolia : a major victory for the corporate boycott campaignEuropean solidarity activists have waged a particularly effective campaign against the French multinationals Veolia and Alstom .
These companies are part of a consortium that is building a light railway connecting occupied Jerusalem to Israeli settlements in the West Bank , reinforcing Israel 's hold on Palestinian land .
In the U.K. , the Palestine Solidarity Campaign conducted an active petition campaign against Veolia 's attempt to win a 25 - year waste collection and recycling contract worth £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) with the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council .
On March 16 the council announced that Veolia had failed to qualify for the shortlist of three companies that would be invited to bid on the contract .
Also in March , the Swedish national pension fund AP7 announced that it was removing Alstom from its investment portfolio .
Activists in Sweden had organized a public education campaign for divestment .
The pension fund specifically cited the Jerusalem rail project as the reason it had blacklisted the company .[ xiii ]
The following month the Urban Community of Bordeaux cancelled its contract , worth 750 million euros ( $ 1.0 billion ) , with Veolia .
Although the French municipality cited commercial factors , the cancellation came in the wake of a major controversy over Veolia 's involvement in the Jerusalem project .
The Galway City Council in Ireland and the Stockholm Community Council in Sweden both recently decided not to renew their contracts with Veolia .[ xiv ]
Finally , the pressure became too much for Veolia .
On June 9 the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the company was abandoning the Jerusalem project .
The paper described the company 's decision as a " body blow " to the project , noting that " the French firm had been losing major projects in Europe because of its involvement in the Jerusalem job .
Observers claim that 's the real reason Veolia opted out . " [ xv ]
This marks the first major victory of the corporate boycott campaign .
Veolia was forced to divest from the Jerusalem project as a result of a targeted and sustained campaign in various countries , coordinated internationally with the help of the Palestinian BDS National Committee .
The victory demonstrates how such campaigns can produce tangible victories .
It is likely to spur supporters of Palestine to increase their efforts to force corporations to sever their ties with Israel .
Labor solidarity Israel 's bloody assault on Gaza earlier this year has also led to new initiatives by organized labour in solidarity with Palestine .
Not surprisingly , support for Palestine and the boycott movement is particularly strong in South Africa .
Many South Africans see Israel 's oppression of Palestinians through the prism of their own experience under apartheid .
In early February dock workers in South Africa , members of the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) , announced that they would refuse to offload a ship from Israel that was scheduled to dock in Durban on February 8 .
COSATU and the Palestine Solidarity Committee of South Africa explained the significance of the dock workers ' action in this way :
The pledge by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) members in Durban reflects the commitment by South African workers to refuse to support oppression and exploitation across the globe .
Last year , Durban dock workers had refused to offload a shipment of arms that had arrived from China and was destined for Zimbabwe to prop up the Mugabe regime and to intensify the repression against the Zimbabwean people .
Now , says SATAWU 's General Secretary Randall Howard , the union 's members are committing themselves to not handling Israeli goods .
SATAWU 's action on Sunday will be part of a proud history of worker resistance against apartheid .
In 1963 , just four years after the Anti-Apartheid Movement was formed , Danish dock workers refused to offload a ship with South African goods .
When the ship docked in Sweden , Swedish workers followed suit .
Dock workers in Liverpool and , later , in the San Francisco Bay Area also refused to offload South African goods .
South Africans , and the South African working class in particular , will remain forever grateful to those workers who determinedly opposed apartheid and decided that they would support the anti-apartheid struggle with their actions .
Last week , Western Australian members of the Maritime Union of Australia resolved to support the campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel , and have called for a boycott of all Israeli vessels and all vessels bearing goods arriving from or going to Israel .
This is the legacy and the tradition that South African dock workers have inherited , and it is a legacy they are determined to honor , by ensuring that South African ports of entry will not be used as transit points for goods bound for or emanating from certain dictatorial and oppressive states such as Zimbabwe , Swaziland and Israel .
COSATU and the Palestine Solidarity Committee reaffirmed their commitment to campaigning for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
They called on the South African government to sever diplomatic and trade relations with Israel and announced a week of activities under the theme : " Free Palestine ! Isolate Apartheid Israel ! " [ xvi]
COSATU was the first major national labour federation to call for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
Several other national labour federations have followed suit , including those of New Zealand and Ireland .
On April 24 the convention of the Trade Union Congress of Scotland voted overwhelmingly in favour of BDS after an extensive debate .[ xvii ]
A few weeks later the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions , which represents more than a third of the country 's work force , urged its government to lead an international boycott of Israel if it continued to violate Palestinian rights .[ xviii ]
Individual unions and labour organisations in many countries have also taken a stand .[ xix ]
In June 2007 the national conference of UNISON , the largest union of public workers in the U.K. , with more than 1.3 million members , called for " concerted and sustained pressure upon Israel including an economic , cultural , academic and sporting boycott . " [ x x ]
More recently , in the wake of the assault on Gaza , the leadership of the largest teachers ' union in France , the Fédération syndicale unitaire , endorsed the BDS campaign and called on the European Union to impose sanctions on Israel . [ xxi]
On the other side of the Atlantic , in April 2008 the Canadian Union of Postal Workers became the first country - wide union in North America to adopt a BDS policy .
Denis Lemelin , the national president of CUPW , has spoken at a number of meetings and demonstrations in defence of Palestinian rights over the last year .
On January 7 he wrote to Prime Minister Stephen Harper on behalf of the union to ask the Canadian government to apply a policy of boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel to force it to comply with international law , including the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes .[ xxii ]
In recent years CUPW has waged a series of battles against the government 's moves to downsize and privatize postal services .
The union also has a history of supporting international freedom struggles .
It was the first union in Canada to call for a boycott of apartheid South Africa .
In a joint statement , several solidarity organizations noted that the union " played a lead role in labour solidarity with South African workers , engaging in concrete actions such as the refusal to handle mail from South Africa . " [ xxiii ]
The Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees , which represents more than 220,000 workers in the public sector , has played a key role in blazing the trail for labour solidarity in Canada .
The decision of CUPE Ontario's May 2006 convention to endorse boycott , divestment and sanctions sparked massive controversy , thereby drawing international attention to the Palestinian appeal for BDS .
Supporters of Israel in various quarters including government officials , editorialists , and even leaders of other unions , directed a torrent of abuse against the union , alleging that the decision was anti-Semitic , undemocratic , and outside the union 's jurisdiction .
Sid Ryan , the president of CUPE Ontario , received numerous death threats ; his family was also threatened .
Ryan and the chair of the union 's international solidarity committee were inundated with hostile telephone and email messages .
Ryan and the union have stood firm against the pressure .
Union activists organised an extensive grass - roots education campaign , using an attractive 16 - page pamphlet " Towards peace and justice in the Middle East " produced by the CUPE Ontario international solidarity committee .
Ryan continued to speak out for Palestine on every possible occasion .
As a result , the Zionists were unable to find a base of support in the union ; they chose not to contest the BDS policy at the 2008 convention .
But the public campaign of vilification of Sid Ryan and CUPE Ontario continues , boosted by a personal attack on Ryan by the Canadian government .
Quebec teachers , students support boycottA year after the CUPE Ontario convention , a major union in Quebec joined the boycott , divestment , and sanctions movement .
The Fédération nationale des enseignantes et enseignants du Québec ( National Teachers Federation of Quebec ) is the largest union of teachers in higher education in Quebec .
Its 23,500 members work at community colleges , universities , and private schools .
At its May 31 - June 1 , 2007 meeting , the federal council of the union reiterated its long - standing solidarity with the Palestinian people and its right to self - determination .
The council also endorsed the BDS campaign .[ xxiv ]
In November 2007 the FNEEQ published a special edition of its magazine , Carnets , with the title , " Do more for Palestine . "
The attractive , 32 - page magazine contains articles that explain what life is like under Israeli occupation , Israel 's " separation " wall , why Canada is not a friend of Palestine , and the situation of women under the occupation .
Five pages present the need to boycott , divest from , and sanction Israel ; the views of two Israeli citizens who support BDS , Ilan Pappé and Michel Warschawski , are featured .
The lead editorial , written by the president of the FNEEQ , Ronald Cameron , explains that the union is educating its members so that they will understand why taking concrete action to support the Palestinian people is an urgent issue of labor solidarity . [ xxv ]
Compared to the abuse showered on CUPE Ontario , criticism of the FNEEQ 's decision to join the boycott - Israel movement has been relatively mild .
Quebec is the area of the country where popular sentiment is most favourable to the Palestinian cause .
Various unions in Quebec have been active on this issue over the years , and the union leadership in higher education supports the Palestinian cause .
( CUPW , discussed earlier , is one of a small number of major Canada - wide unions that have a sizable membership in Quebec . )
The FNEEQ 's record of support for Palestine is particularly strong .
In October 2004 it sponsored a delegation of 20 Quebec teachers who attended an international conference on Education , Globalization and Social Change in Ramallah , Palestine .
( Willie Madisha , then president of COSATU , also participated in the conference . ) .
The FNEEQ has participated in several other Quebec - based solidarity delegations to Palestine since then .
In late May a 17 - person delegation from Quebec that included members of the FNEEQ , CUPE and the CUPW spent a week investigating the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories .
Israeli authorities turned them back when they attempted to enter Gaza .
The FNEEQ is also helping to educate students about Palestine .
It organized workshops on the issue on community college and university campuses across Quebec during the 2007 - 2008 school year , in collaboration with the Quebec Public Interest Research Group and the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante .
The ASSÉ represents approximately 42,000 Quebec students .
In May 2008 it became the first major student union in Canada to join the international BDS campaign . [ xxvi]
The FNEEQ and the ASSÉ joined forces again this May when they jointly published Israël Ne Peut Pas Rester Impuni !
( Israel Cannot Remain Unpunished ! ) a 14 - page dossier that explains how Israeli military rule undermines the right to education in Palestine .
Much of the content consists of translations of material produced in Palestine , notably by the Right to Education Campaign at Birzeit University .
The two unions have made copies of the dossier available to the public on their web sites .[ xxvii ]
At its May 30 - 31 congress , the FNEEQ unanimously reaffirmed its support for BDS .
It also decided to participate in the World Education Forum , part of the World Social Forum movement , that will be held in Palestine in October 2010 .[ xxviii ] Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia : no ties with IsraelOne of the aims of the international boycott - Israel movement is to induce governments to break all economic and diplomatic relations with Israel , treating the Zionist state as an international pariah .
This is starting to become a reality in Latin America .
Cuba broke relations with Israel in September 1973 , on the eve of the Yom Kippur war . [ xxix ]
Time and again in international forums the revolutionary government has spoken out in support of the struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples and against Israeli aggression .
It has translated those words into action whenever it could .
However , for decades Cuba 's has stood alone in the region in its support for Palestine .
In the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean , domination by Washington was the rule , and with it , support for U.S. foreign policy .
Israel became notorious for the support it gave - through arm shipments , special " advisors " and the like - to bloody dictatorships from Guatemala to Chile .
But now a process of radical transformation is unfolding across the region .
Radical , popular movements have emerged in many countries as large numbers of working people begin to act to improve their circumstances .
These movements are putting their stamp on society and government .
One important result of this process has been the creation of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) , an alliance of seven countries that promotes fair trade and mutual aid based on principles of solidarity rather than profit .
ALBA also champions respect for national sovereignty and unity of the region against U.S. domination . [ xxx ]
The rising tide of struggles in Latin America has been accompanied by a rise in support for the Palestinian people , including by the governments of the region .
ALBA has led the way on this .
In September 2008 the ALBA countries were instrumental in securing the election of Father Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann as president of the General Assembly of the United Nations .
D'Escoto is a well - known supporter of Palestine .
As foreign minister of the Sandinista government of Nicaragua during the 1980s , he played a prominent role in exposing Israel 's role in the " dirty war " that Washington organized against his country .
On November 24 d'Escoto told a meeting at the U.N. that 60 years after partition , " the failure to create a Palestinian state as promised is the single greatest failure in the history of the United Nations . "
He went on to say that " although different , what is being done against the Palestinian people seems to me to be a version of the hideous policy of apartheid . " [ xxxi ]
Addressing the General Assembly later the same day , he repeated the apartheid characterization , adding that " I believe it is very important that we in the United Nations use this term .
We must not be afraid to call something what it is .
" D'Escoto also urged the member states to consider implementing sanctions against Israel .
" More than twenty years ago we in the United Nations took the lead from civil society when we agreed that sanctions were required to provide a non-violent means of pressuring South Africa to end its violations .
Today , perhaps we in the United Nations should consider following the lead of a new generation of civil society , who are calling for a similar non-violent campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions to pressure Israel to end its violations . " [ xxxii ]
ALBA was founded by Venezuela and Cuba , and the Venezuelan government has been especially forthright in speaking and acting for justice in the Middle East .
This is an expression of the profound anti-imperialist character of the struggle that has been unfolding in Venezuela since President Hugo Chavez was elected in 1999 .
In July 2006 Chavez forcefully denounced the war that Israel had unleashed on Lebanon , and Venezuela matched its words with deeds .
It withdrew its ambassador from Israel , sent 20,000 tons of emergency aid to Lebanon , and began a drive to raise funds for Lebanese reconstruction . [ xxxiii ] Soon after Israel began its attack on Gaza , Venezuelans took to the streets in protest .
Speaking to a rally in Caracas on January 9 , 2009 , Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro announced that his country would send 80 tons of medicine , water , and food aid to Gaza , as well as 30 doctors and a humanitarian work brigade .
On January 14 , both Venezuela and Bolivia broke off diplomatic relations with Israel .
When Israel retaliated by expelling Venezuelan diplomats , Chavez responded that " it is an honour for this socialist government and this revolutionary people to have our representatives expelled by a genocidal government such as Israel . " [ xxxiv ]
Bolivia 's president , Evo Morales , announced that his country would formally indict Israel 's leaders for war crimes in the International Criminal Court .
" They 've made the world move backwards with crimes against humanity that we have n't seen since Rwanda and Yugoslavia , " he said . [ xxxv ]
Bolivia is also a member of ALBA .
On April 27 Venezuela and the Palestinian Authority established formal diplomatic relations and opened a Palestinian embassy in Caracas .
Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al - Maliki said that the embassy would coordinate solidarity with Palestine across Latin America.[ xxxvi ]
A Palestinian embassy has functioned in Havana , Cuba for decades .
A growing movement , larger struggles ahead The BDS movement now includes its first national Jewish organization .
At its first annual general meeting on June 14 , the Independent Jewish Voices ( Canada ) overwhelmingly endorsed boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
" Independent Jewish Voices has voted to join the international boycott campaign because we stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people and support their right to self - determination , " said Diana Ralph , co-chair of the organization .
" We are calling on the Canadian government and all Members of Parliament to push for immediate sanctions on Israel . "
IJV has chapters in seven Canadian cities .[ xxxvii ] Israel 's prestige and moral standing in the world has suffered a serious setback as a result of its barbaric attack on the besieged population of Gaza .
Growing numbers of people are coming to understand Israel 's crimes , the apartheid nature of the Israeli state , and the need to express solidarity with the Palestinian people through concrete action .
The protests against Israel 's actions in many countries were unprecedented in their size and duration .
New forces are joining the international movement in solidarity with Palestine .
As part of this process , the international campaign for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel is emerging as one of the most important ways to demonstrate this solidarity .
This survey of recent developments provides only a partial picture of the scale and diversity that the BDS movement is acquiring as it grows .
( The movement is actively promoting an academic and cultural boycott of Israel , for example .
For more information on this boycott , see the website of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott , http://www.pacbi.org/index.php and the article " Palestine and the Cultural Boycott " by Rafeef Ziadah , http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21206
.) But even this partial account is sufficient to demonstrate that the international campaign to boycott Israel is making headway on a number of fronts .
Although still relatively new , the movement has achieved some notable successes .
It shows the promise of developing into a powerful and sustained international force that can help attain justice for the Palestinian people .
AIPAC 's call to arms is a grudging recognition of these initial successes of the movement and , above all , of its potential .
It is evident that supporters of the Jewish - only Israeli state - be they official lobbyists , powerful government figures , or others - intend to redouble their efforts to smear the BDS movement as anti-Semitic and to suppress public debate of Israel 's crimes .
Supporters of the rights of Palestinians are responding by uniting with others to defend the right to free speech on these issues and by reaching out to win new support for the boycott - Israel campaign .
Art Young is a member of the Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid in Toronto .
Imagine having glacier water piped into your house for not only your drinking water needs , but for bathing as well .
Pristine water that comes from melting glaciers in British Columbia is now being sold as “ Glacier Bathâ „ ¢ ” and offered as “ The Perfect Balance Between Luxury and Health ” by a company called Luxury Water Utilities .
Believe it or not , as they say .
“ Locked in an icy vault for over 10,000 years , in the sub -Arctic ranges in beautiful British Columbia , Canada , and carefully retrieved from the rapid descending flow of melted glacier ice , this pure protected under - melt is the most natural ancient source of water in the world . ”
According to the company ’s press release , Glacier Bathâ „ ¢ is for “ luxury connoisseurs ” and “ the sophisticated consumer ” who wish to choose their own water source for their “ primary hydration needs . ”
They also state that glacier water is superior to common water sources , due to not being filtered through the ground , which may allow the water to pick up organic particles and pollutants .
While all of the information may be true of glacier water , the average citizen in the U.S. is not going to be able to choose anything other than municipal tap water , and for the majority of the world ’s population , gaining access to any sort of clean , potable water is a huge issue .
Glaciers are the source of water for many communities , especially in the western U.S. , but I do n’t think you ’ll see these claims on any municipal water supplies .
For this company to claim that Glacier Bathâ „ ¢ is “ an environmentally friendly hydration service ” in any sense other than letting the end consumer bathe in and drink pure water seems to be stretching the definition of “ environmentally friendly . ”
One has to wonder how much energy is consumed in the process of collecting and transporting this glacier water from British Columbia to the end user .
Thirsty in Suburbia also took issue with the company ’s claims :
“ â€ ¦Luxury Water Utilities , LLC , a California - based sustainable water resources service companyâ€ ¦ ”
When life hands you climate change , make glacier - ade !
“ â€ ¦Glacier Bathâ „ ¢ system â€ ” an environmentally friendly hydration serviceâ€ ¦ ”
I think they mean â€œfriendlyâ€ in the Facebook sense .
“ â€¦premium glacier water .
Locked in an icy vault for over 10,000 yearsâ€ ¦ ”
Hello , do you have Sir Glacier in a can ?
Well let him out !!!
“ Glacier water is superior to common water sources , because it is not filtered through the ground where a variety of dissolved solids and organic particles such as rocks , sand , metals , chemicals and underground pollutants can attach to each water molecule . ”
Iâ€™m trying to imagine a rock attached to a molecule .
“ â€¦fine waters from rare water sources from around the world that are guaranteed 100 % natural in compositionâ€ ¦ ”
That is , guaranteed to be two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen .
“ Fine Water Imports Inc. , headquartered in Las Vegas , Nevada , ”
I should have guessed !
Itâ€™s the global center of water sustainability !
If you should you be in the market for “ luxury water ” , here ’s hoping that you ’ll read between the lines of the marketing materials !
The dream Mr. Gordeyev conceived in 1974 to run faster and jump higher without getting tired might never have become a popular option for commuters or even caught on as a sport .
But unlike the Segway , the American - invented self - balancing scooter , it never had a chance .
Instead , the boots became a military secret , as generals envisioned soldiers running swiftly and effortlessly alongside armored vehicles .

The boots were declassified in 1994 , and Mr. Gordeyev and his partners imagined growing rich by selling their invention to a lazy public .
Instead , the company went out of business in 2006 .
Like the boots , Russian scientists are still trying to gain traction in the capitalist world .
A company in Saratov making a novel transport airplane with no tail , called the “ flying saucer , ” never got off the ground .
Russia also has other examples of good ideas later bungled in the process of commercialization .
The Russian inventor of the Tetris video game was unable to patent his invention , and thus lost out on huge amounts of money .
Russian engineers invented submersible pumps for oil wells , but failed to invest in their development ; now Russian companies buy Western models from Halliburton .
And , in contrast to the United States , venture capital firms and start - up companies in Russia have not congregated near technology universities .
Russian computer programmers , successful in Silicon Valley , are best known at home for hacking .
The thriving Midwestern family farm is no longer , having been choked by industrialized agriculture and replanted with subdivisions .
A shifting economy , combined with an old - fashioned lifestyle that does n't translate from generation to generation , is forever altering the landscape .

He loves the place and worries over its lost way of life , even as he knows what it feels like to be a young man and want to leave .
Carrying one camera and one lens , Frazier walks Iowa 's gravel roads , gets his feet wet in the milking barn , pulls up a stool in the small - town bar .
Through black - and - white photographs , he makes a record of his own emotions as he travels through the state .

I have been watching the intense coverage during the last 18 hours of Michael Jackson ’s career offered in honor of his untimely passing .
As I watch the images I am struck over and over again by how feminine his voice was , how feminine his face was–or what was left of it after so much knife work–even how lacking of male secondary sexual characteristics he seemed to be .
I am forced to remember the castratos of Italian opera whose amazing young voices were preserved by the now taboo procedure of castration producing the counter tenor voice of the castrati .
Listening to Jackson recount his unhappy childhood and the monstrous exploitation of his talent he endured at the hands of his father , I am frightened to wonder if he did not endure similar treatment to produce this amazing counter tenor voice that made him such a star .
Surely , had puberty done its thing , his voice would have dropped to the normal tenor range and his body would have shown the masculinity puberty produces in men .
I could imagine that this voice was falsetto , the forced counter tenor voice of an intact male .
But in all his interviews that amazing counter tenor voice remains and endures .
This would explain so much .
Not only his amazing counter tenor voice and his feminine form , but also his difficulty in fathering children so that arcane maneuvers were required to produce three children .
We still do not know where the third child came from , as I heard this morning .
It might also explain why he was unable to sustain marital relationships with his two wives , the second of which was seemingly bought and paid for as a surrogate mother .
It would be interesting to do paternity tests on the children to see if they were in fact his biological children or if they were gotten with borrowed semen .
That would make a wild ride of the inheritance battles about to take place .
The androgyne that was Michael Jackson was a constructed persona even more than any celebrity has ever been constructed .
Even in the music videos where he struggles to exert his macho identity , there is a clear awkwardness and faux persona in evidence .
This would explain why he could so resolutely assert that there was no possibility of sexual contact between himself and the children he took to his bed .
In the two interviews where he is pressed to defend this behavior there is an inexplicable persistence in his demand that he could never hurt a child and that he could never be a pedophile .
And were he a castrato he might clearly be telling the truth .
And like the Peter Pan character he so loved , his refusal to grow up might be the result of a surgical intervention in the biological processes of maturation .
Such is the taboo and revulsion of this surgery that I doubt we will ever know the truth of this question , but it seems such a likely possibility it wants discussion .
And as I am sure to catch hell for even raising this possibility , let me assure my fellow bloggers that I am in as much awe of his career and contributions to American Popular music as anyone could be .
But there is this conjecture that fascinates me .

The recession is taking its toll on the conservative movement , and religious right leaders ’ intellectual rigidity is helping to put a nail in the coffin of a once - influential constellation of ideas regarding the free market .
This was made clear by a recent lecture at the conservative movement ’s philosophical mothership , the Heritage Foundation .
Jay W. Richards , author of a new book , Money , Greed , and God : Why Capitalism is the Solution and Not the Problem , said nothing new when he addressed the question , “ Is the free market moral ? ”
Richards defended unregulated capitalism in the language of evangelical Christianity , reflecting the melding of social and economic conservatism Heritage has pedaled for two generations .
What was remarkable about the event was that conservatives felt the need to apologize for such long - established doctrine .
To watch Richards ’ lecture or read his book is to enter a time warp straight back to the late 1970s , when conservatives were rebelling against “ big - government liberalism ” which they equated with “ godless communism . ”
But much has changed since then .
Many conservatives concede that the eight - year reign of George W. Bush was one of the most disastrous in the nation ’s history .
Most Americans have come to believe orthodox free - marketism was a false gospel .
And even growing numbers of conservative evangelicals are deeply troubled by the vast inequality and environmental degradation created by giving big business free reign .
There is still no sign of a mass defection of the evangelical base , but the openness of evangelicals to an alternative economic vision has the social conservative old - guard fearful that their rank and file could walk away from the free - market camp .
In response to this fear , leaders such as Gary Bauer of American Values , Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council , and Focus on the Family ’s James Dobson are hardening their rhetoric , reviving old clichés that simply do not speak to the new economic reality .
Just this week Bauer sent an e-mail to members of his group to “ Stop the Stimulus ! ” — legislation that passed four months ago — and to educate Americans on the “ economic dangers of the left ’s radical socialist agenda . ”
Bauer ’s upcoming Values Voters Summit has one session planned to show how health reform means “ rationing your life away ” and another to teach activists how to organize antitax “ tea parties . ”
However , not a single session offers solutions for families struggling with health care bills , unemployment , or home foreclosure .
Is it any wonder that a movement with so little to offer people who are suffering is nervous ?
The 5 - percent shift of evangelical voters to the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008 — with much sharper increases among younger voters — demonstrates that many evangelicals want new solutions , even if they ’re still leery of the left .
Rice University professor D. Michael Lindsay , author of Faith in the Halls of Power , suggests that social conservative leaders may be sticking with the old party line because they still believe it .
He points out that many evangelical religious leaders are faith entrepreneurs who built large churches , media ministries , and activist organizations using strategies modeled on the business world .
“ In the leadership cohort , I would say over the last 30 years they have seen the benefit of the free market in the religious sector work to their advantage , ” he said .
“ Because evangelicals are religious entrepreneurs , they have an affinity for business entrepreneurs , and the downturn has not changed this . ”
But the religious right ’s leadership paralysis may simply be born of fear .
“ I think that they feel that they need to reinforce the relationship between evangelicals and Republicans , ” said Sarah Posner , author of God ’s Profits : Faith , Fraud , and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters .
As leaders circle the free - market wagons they revert to “ pre-welfare reform rhetoric , ” Posner said .
“ There ’s no discussion of regulation of Wall Street , ” just epistles spreading the good news of the free market .
Richard Cizik is one of the high - profile leaders of the Christian right who defected from the movement because of its rigid small - government views .
He is convinced that his old allies on the right learned the wrong lessons from history .
He describes his former allies as “ zealots , ” whom he defines by paraphrasing Winston Churchill : “ A zealot is someone who wo n’t change his mind and wo n’t change the subject . ”
“ It ’s not as if the antiregulatory DNA of evangelicals ca n’t be changed , ” says Cizik , pointing to the years - long process that convinced him that “ the ‘ magic ’ of free - market economics has shown itself to be snake oil . ”
Along with his concern about global warming , Cizik says he also lost 30 percent of his 401k in the financial crash .
He attributes Obama ’s improved margin among evangelicals to this group ’s desire for new economic policy and says that openness to Democratic candidates could grow if the president ’s policies succeed in turning the economy around .
And if evangelical leaders remain more faithful to the Republican Party and business interests than to the interests of their members , they will become similarly irrelevant .
“ The Bible warns about this , ” Cizik says .
Scripture should be a caution to leaders who will surrender their remaining independence in the service of free - market forces :
“ What is the profits of the man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul ? ”
Lester Feder is a freelance journalist covering conservative politics and popular culture .
In an email someone mentioned to me a particular key invention from a few decades ago , which was responsible for a number of other high - tech innovations that we now enjoy , and asked me to “ show us how any of that could have happened if there were no patents . ”
My response is below .
Why is the burden on me to show how it could have happened without patents ?
The question is itself question - begging , as it assumes the patents played a causal role , which must be either explained away or for which a substitute incentive effect must be found .
I ’d say that almost any invention that comes will come eventually –maybe even sooner , absent the patent system , absent the state ( see Yet Another Study Finds Patents Do Not Encourage Innovation ) .
In my experience , this view is almost universal among inventors and engineers .
We would have had transistors by now without Shockley , Planck , and Schrödinger ; we would have had light bulbs without Edison ; and one - click purchasing on web sites without Jeff Bezos .
Maybe a bit later , but eventually .
And maybe even earlier–patents slow things down too , after all .
And we cannot forget that a huge factor in innovation is wealth .
Wealth is needed to provide spare time and resources to engage in research and development .
And wealth is no doubt hampered severely in a society that has a state , which any patent society must .
Without a state there would be no patents , but a far richer world , and more innovation because of that factor alone .
Finally–so what if we would n’t have had invention X , Y , Z , as early , or even ever , without a patent system ?
After all , a patent system undeniably has costs in terms of both rights and money .
How can it be shown that having invention X is worth the violation of rights incurred as a result of the patent system necessary to generate X ? Utilitarianism is a bankrupt doctrine , after all .
And even if you approach it from a utilitarian , wealth - maximization angle : how can it be shown –who has shown ? –that the cost of the patent system that generates X is less than the value of X ?
Naponta egy évre elegendő napenergia érkezik a Földre , terjednek a széler őművek , jönnek a negyedik generációs atomerőművek , de az áttörést a most készülő első fúziós erőmű jelenti .
Francia - magyar energetikai konferencia volt Budapesten .
Elég lenne a Szahara 0,3 százalékát lefedni naper őművekkel , hogy egész Európát el lehessen látni megújuló energiaforrással .
Ezért döntött úgy húsz jelentős német cég , hogy tárgyalásokat kezd egy óriási erőműpark megépítéséről .
A projektet és a találkozót is a Desertec Foundation szervezi , a vállalat célja , hogy közel 100 gigawatt kapacitású naper őm űparkot hozzon létre Észak - Afrikában .
A fenti képen piros négyzetek jelölik azokat a területeket , amiket le kéne fedni , hogy a világ , Európa , vagy a Közel - Kelet és Észak - Afrika ( MENA ) 2005 - ös energiaigényét ki lehessen elégíteni , a legalsó négyzet pedig azt a területet jelöli , amin meg lehetne termelni a 100 gigawattot .
A beruházást nehezíti , hogy a farmokat politikailag instabil országokban kellene létrehozni , ezért valószínűleg nem is egy területre összpontosítanának .
Akárhogy is , az együttesen létrejövő parkok a legnagyobb hálózatot adnák ki a világon – nyolcvanszor több elektromosságot termelnének , mint a Mojave - sivatagba tervezett társuk .
Az áramot nagyfeszültségű vezetékeken keresztül szállítanák Európába a Földközi - tengeren keresztül , hogy a kontinens fogyasztásának egy jelentős részét napenergiából lehessen fedezni .
A projekt még legalább 10 - 15 évre van a megvalósítástól , de a legkomolyabb szereplők már elkezdtek foglalkozni a beruházással .
A csapatban benne van a Siemens , a Deutsche Bank , valamint olyan energetikai cégek , mint az RWE vagy az Eon .
Nyilatkozatuk szerint fontosnak tartják a küzdelmet a klímaváltozás ellen , de az is szerepet játszik elhatározásukban , hogy az egyre fogyó fosszilis energiaforrások mellett a napenergiában látják a megoldást egy 2050 - es energiaválság megelőzésében .
A beruházás viszont nem lesz olcsó , egy 100 gigawattos erőmű megépítési ugyanis legalább 400 milliárd eurós költséggel járna .
A farmok nemcsak Európának , hanem a térségnek is jól jönnének , mert a környékükön a megtermelt energia elhanyagolható részét felhasználva oázisokat lehetne létrehozni , amik enyhíthetnék a helyi lakosok egyre súlyosbodó vízproblémáit .
Az megújuló energiákkal foglalkozó európai hivatal vezetője , Herman Scheer azonban szkeptikus a beruházással kapcsolatban .
Szerinte sokkal kisebb léptékben kéne gondolkozni , mert az óriási farmok komoly kockázatoknak lennének kitéve a homokviharok és a térség ellenségesked ő országai miatt .
Mások azonban azt mondják , hogy éppen az ilyen megaprojektekkel lehetne csökkenteni a szén - dioxid - kibocsátásunkat , és csak jelentős beruházással lehet érdemben növelni a megújuló energiaforrások arányát .
A tömeg pár év alatt lerombolhatja az Erzsébet teret .
A parkot és a Gödör Klubot ugyanis nem intenzív bulizásra tervezték , és a hirtelen siker ellenére senki nem tartja karban és fejleszti Budapest legnépszer űbb terét .
Mert mindenki szerint másnak kéne .

A prominent Russian human rights activist , Natalia Estemirova , has been found dead in the North Caucasus .
She was bundled into a van and abducted as she left her home in Chechnya on Wednesday morning , a colleague said .
Her body was found in Ingushetia .
The Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed " outrage " at the murder , and ordered a top - level investigation .
Ms Estemirova had been investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya for the independent Memorial group .
Memorial is one of Russia 's best known rights groups , working to document Soviet - era abuses and those taking place more recently , especially in Chechnya .
In recent months , she had been gathering evidence of a campaign of house - burnings by government - backed militias .
Forcefully taken Ms Estemirova , who was 50 according to Russian prosecutors , had worked in the past with the activists Anna Politkovskaya , who was shot dead in 2006 , and Stanislav Markelov , who was killed in January this year .
There is no shred of doubt that she was targeted due to her professional activity
Human Rights Watch
Obituary : Natalia Estemirova
In 2007 she was awarded the inaugural Anna Politkovskaya Prize , and had also received awards from the Swedish and European parliaments , Memorial said .
In a statement the group said she " was forcefully taken from her house into a car and shouted that she was being kidnapped " at about 0830 local time ( 0430 GMT ) .
Her body was found in woodland near Nazran , the main city in neighbouring Ingushetia , about nine hours later .
She had bullet wounds to the head and chest .
' Terrible tragedy '
The New - York based human rights group Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said Ms Estemirova had been working on " extremely sensitive " cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya .
" There is no shred of doubt that she was targeted due to her professional activity , " said Tanya Lokshina , HRW 's Russian researcher in Moscow .
Campaign group Amnesty International said her murder was a consequence of the impunity that has been allowed to persist by the Russian and Chechen authorities and an attempt to gag civil society in the country .
In a statement , Irene Khan , the organisation 's head , described her as " a courageous and inspiring woman " .
" Human rights violations in Russia , and especially in the North Caucasus , can no longer be ignored .
And those who stand up for human rights need protection , " she said .
" The terrible tragedy of the killing of Natalia Estemirova is a crime that should be denounced by the authorities and every effort must be made to bring those responsible to justice . "
Rare justice
Ms Estemirova was engaged in very important and dangerous work , says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow , investigating hundreds of cases of alleged kidnapping , torture and extra-judicial killings by Russian government troops or militias in Chechnya .
Memorial says it believes that government security services of some nature must be involved in her killing .
Our correspondent says no evidence of that has emerged so far , but that it was the government - sponsored militias that had most to fear from her work .
She is the most recent in a long line of human rights activists and lawyers to have been killed or attacked in Russia .
The history of these sorts of cases over many years is that very rarely are their killers ever brought to justice , our correspondent says .

Mr Carson was the first US government official to meet Mr Mugabe for years Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has branded a top US envoy " an idiot " with a condescending attitude .
He said that Johnnie Carson , US assistant secretary of state for African affairs , wanted to dictate what Zimbabwe could and could not do .
The two spoke on the sidelines of last week 's African Union meeting in Libya .
The Obama administration has been sceptical of the power - sharing government formed between Mr Mugabe and his opposition rivals .
Mr Mugabe told the state - owned Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe that nothing came out of his talks with Mr Carson - his first meeting with a US government official for many years .
" You would not speak to an idiot of that nature , " he said .
" I was very angry with him , and he thinks he could dictate to us what to do and what not to do . "
Mr Mugabe pointed out that the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) supported the unity government .
" We have the whole of SADC working with us , and you have the likes of little fellows like Carson , you see , wanting to say : ' You do this , you do that . '
" Who is he ?
" I hope he was not speaking for Obama .
I told him he was a shame , a great shame , being an African American . "
Robert Mugabe met Mr Carson on the sidelines of the AU summit Mr Mugabe was also not fond of Mr Carson 's predecessor , Jendayi Frazer , who is also black .
In May last year he described her as " a little American girl trotting around the globe like a prostitute " after she suggested that the then - opposition Movement for Democratic Change had won the disputed presidential election .
Meanwhile , the Herald also reports that Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has apologised to Mr Mugabe after ministers from his party , the MDC , boycotted a cabinet meeting last Monday .
The ministers had decided instead to head to Harare airport to welcome Mr Tsvangirai back from a tour of Europe and the United States , where he had been lobbying for aid for Zimbabwe .
He said he had raised about $ 500 m ( £ 300 m ) , not the $ 7bn the country 's finance minister said the country needed to revive its economy .
President Obama committed $ 73 million , but said : " It will not be going to the government directly because we continue to be concerned about consolidating democracy , human rights , and rule of law . "

The U.S. has been an occupied nation for all of my life of seventy - two years .
We are occupied and oppressed in complete violation of the Constitution and laws derived from it by the secret police armies of the Republicrat Party .
These armies have top - secret members and units within the U.S. that secretly spy on us and collect information and plan the passage and execution of illegal activities against us as standard operating procedures .
All of our presidents since FDR , who was president when I was born in 1937 , and all of those directly involved in the secret armies or in their pseudo - oversight by Congress have known in general ways of all of these “ High Crimes . ”
The presidents have , as far as we know , given them vague , general , illegal authorizations under laws passed by Congress specifically to make it look to ignorant people like they do not violate the Constitution , but the very presence of such a tyrannical , secret police occupation of our nation is in itself an obvious violation of the entire purpose of the Constitution .
This fact is known to all serious lawyers and anyone else who has studied the Constitution , but they all know that saying so will be the kiss of death professionally and that the Big Media would brand them as “ crazy ” for speaking such obvious truths .

The current chit - chat spat between the Republican and Democratic wings of the ruling Republicrat Party is so far one of the many minor such spats for publicity and power that erupt between the wings of the Party .
So far we are seeing only secret tips of secret ice - bergs of this total tyranny in the U.S.
We saw far more revealing , big tips of the immense and ever - growing ice - berg of these tyrannical High Crimes when the American love of liberty was still burning , but flickering more and more as it weakened under the blanket of One Party , secret police rule .
The revelations of the FBI decades of spying , burglaries and other crimes against Americans after Hoover died and the Church Comm .
revelations of the conspiracy at the top by the presidents and their top people to murder foreign leaders , spy on the U.S. , and so on were major revelations .
They did not keep the High Crimes secrets .
They at least revealed them .
But then they did nothing to effectively stop them by imprisoning the Criminals who committed these High Crimes .

Stich , Rodney Best Price : $ 12.00 Buy New $ 27.99 ( as of 11:35 EST - Details )
Members of the Senate Oversight Committees supposed to make sure that the secret police armies do not spy on Americans and commit other High Crimes have written late in life about how absurd the whole idea of such oversight is .
Bill Bradley ’s memoirs are a good example .
He gives details of how totally non-over - sightful they are .
Fulbright revealed in his memoirs that he even suspected the secret police , presumably the CIA , may well have been involved in the assassination of JFK and bringing Nixon down over the Watergate burglaries and cover-ups .
Now the spirit of liberty is so weak and dim among the great mass of Americans that they will not even pay much attention to this latest tiff between the wings of our One Party tyranny about these vast , secret armies occupying our nation , eating out our substance and routinely carrying out High Crimes of tyranny over us .
Those who do pay any attention will only learn that some secret activities remain a total secret from the public and will do so in perpetuity and that the struggle for power between the wings of the Party will not endanger any Super Criminals committing such secret High Crimes .
The Best of Jack D. Douglas
by Brett Stevens on July 16 , 2009
American conservative thinking has overwhelmed most of the world ’s conservative parties .
Their idea is to base intense patriotism on the idea that we ’re “ free , ” and can do whatever we want as individuals , and use that to justify caring about social order .
Ultimately what conservatives are trying to argue toward is that the society as a whole is more important than the individual , and that the individual must adapt to common sense about how reality works .
They think “ freedom ” is a vector to that because it sounds good .
As a result , they ’ve invented this mythos that Big State government — think Hitler , Stalin and Democrats — wants to take away your ability to do whatever you can afford to do .
After all , those who are born smarter and work diligently tend to have some cash ready to use .
In this view , you can buy that big SUV because global warming is an illusion , and no one should be able to tell you what to do so you can be a rugged individualist .
This thinking is doomed for the following reasons :
Given such freedom , people opt for the least obligation possible .
They ’re not going to uphold traditional values , but demand no values .
You ca n’t out -“ freedom ” the Democrats .
They offer no restrictions , no cultural norms , and a welfare state .
Almost no obligation , even to go to work .
If everyone acts on their freedom , we ’re not going to pull together in the same direction , and we wo n’t be able to face big problems of resources limiting our ability to do whatever we want .
It ’s that latter one — limited resources versus unlimited needs and desires — that we ’re going to face .
For a minute , assume that global warming is simply a power grab by third world countries who want the first world to turn off its industry so they can get ahead .
Fine — but what about pollution , species depletion , limited farmland , low water supplies , and violent cities ?
The libertarians and Republicans this week set up a great wail about a new face in Washington who they associate with Big State decisions .
They will claim he is against their Holy Book , their values as individualists , and the sanctity of life .
And thanks to resourceful bloggers , you can read excerpts from a hard - to - find book co-authored by Holdren in the late 1970s , called Ecoscience : Population , Resources , Environment , online .
In it , you will find the czar wading into some unpleasant talk about mass sterilizations and abortions .
Reason
Oh no !
Abortions and mass sterilizations — those might not be fair to the rugged individualist .
But they also might be required by the demands of our situation here on earth .
After all , the world is n’t just humans — it ’s an environment , too , and scarcity of resources including space which will regulate humanity .
We can make decisions within the anthrosphere , but since we ’re one part of a big world , we may not have the ability to make those decisions the way we want to .
Sometimes , we must simply adapt .
It is now hard to think of a single major problem we face , here in Britain or elsewhere , which would not be solved , or at least ameliorated , by having fewer people .
Everything from hospital waiting lists , crowded trains , the looming energy crisis , water and sewer systems unable to cope , unaffordable housing and unavailable dentistry have , at their core , Britain ’s burgeoning population .
Our roads will become even more congested , our trains more crowded and even slower , the waits for service longer and delays ever more a part of life .
Housing will become ever more unaffordable , we will have to spend billions on new schools and hospitals to cater for the equivalent of two new Londons – two vast metropolises somehow to be shoehorned into what is already a desperately crowded land .
We will , inevitably , lose great swathes of our countryside .
The green belts will have to disappear .
Ghastly and ill - conceived ‘ new towns ’ will spring up all over the South East and Midlands , the areas where new people want to live .
London and its environs are already , effectively , full ; but that will not stop them getting fuller still .
The Daily Mail
His point is refreshingly clear : even if we just look at numbers of people , what happens when we get more ?
We all live in cities , and the cities expand .
The countryside is consumed .
Whatever environmental problems exist get worse .
How do we reconcile the individual ’s unlimited wants and desires with a finite amount of space before we wreck things we need or should keep sacred , like a healthy environment and unpolluted air and water , or just enough space so that earth is not a giant sardine can ?
Here ’s a short list of data points about how we ’re wrecking this planet with overpopulation :
You get the picture .
Now on to the magic question : how is it that we have systematically failed to address these problems , and that they ’re still elephants in the room today ?
You ’ll notice that a lot of our effort spent on this blog is devoted to smashing the idea of equality , or that each person has a “ right ” to do whatever they want .
We also spent a lot of time pointing out that people have different abilities and hence values to a forward - moving civilization .
Our goal in this is to smash the sacred cow of the conservatives , which is individual autonomy as a promised right to all people .
It is also a sacred taboo of the left through their dogma of “ equality . ”
Why would we do this ?
After all , we ’ll be more popular if we promise you can buy that SUV , and that just buying green light bulbs will take care of the problem .
The people who make those promises are far more popular than us .
However , dishonesty has a way of coming back to haunt people .
When our writers go home at night , we have no guilt on our consciences because we did not lie — we faced the truth with a level gaze and if it did n’t blink first , we did n’t back down .
Our society is making people into small atoms that do not interact with others .
People recede into themselves and do not face reality and mortality .
They fear anything except what they intend to do , or in other words , their wants and desires .
Students are immature , they rely too heavily on Internet tools such as Wikipedia as research sources , they fail to learn independently and they expect success without putting in the effort , said respondents to the survey by the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations .
“ The McGuinty government is applauding itself for increased graduation rates from secondary school , ” says the confederation ’s report , which urges more funding for for classrooms .
“ However , it appears that secondary students are not receiving the requisite skills that they need to be successful in university studies . ”
Only 2.27 per cent thought students are better prepared .
Observers blame a number of factors , from inflated parental expectations to the self - esteem culture that leads young people to believe that failure is impossible and paying tuition means getting a good grade .

Look at what this article shows us : the end result of “ freedom , ” or agreeing to have no direction except personal directions , is that people recede into themselves and become less capable , and more solipsistic .
We ’ve been so busy worrying about how to make everyone feel equal and wanted , we ’ve forgotten about the world around us .
Now as the free resources get tighter , we ’re going to have to make hard decisions about the future .
Conservatives are making the biggest career screwup ever by not simply being honest .
They could be like the government in the article above — promoting themselves for having made more people graduate , even if at a lower rate of quality , or in other words , hiding the truth behind one positive attribute of a bad situation — or they could be honest .
When you fail to tell the truth , you are de facto lying , because you are hiding things people need to act on behind a smokescreen of happy — like lying to them directly and telling them something or other is not a problem .
Conservatives are attempting to embark on a big lie to try to beat the even bigger “ freedom ” dogma of the Democrats .
It is not going to work .
If instead they got practical about facing this situation , starting with the hard parts we are afraid to face — that not everyone can fulfill all of their wants and desires , and that we ’ll have to rank people by their usefulness — they will become known as honest people as the years go by .
And people will thank them for that .

Climbing a tree is not only a great way to connect to our playful memories of yesteryear , it is also a great workout for your arms , wrists , hands and fingers , especially strengthening the grip as good as any exercise out there , ( in my humble opinion ) .
Â
It may feel awkard to do and you may be ridiculed by those below , but if everyone realized what a great workout it is , they would be doing it .
Â
It may be the next workout fad .
Â
Of course it takes one with a decent level of athleticism and the ability to overcome the fear of heights that we are all born with to engage in those sort of life endangering workout , but with the right safeguards , you will greatly reduce the chances of a major or minor injury .
Â
The great thing about the tree climbing workout is that it is a natural movement are bodies our accustomed to as our ancestors millions of years ago engaged in this behavior on a daily basis .
Â
The body does not forget , but sometimes it needs a reminder .
Here are the few steps to climbing a Tree
1.Â
If you have a buddy that is belay certified and you are equipped with a harness and rope to greatly improve the chances that nothing goes wrong if you do slip it would be a great idea to use , both as a beginner to get acclimated to climbing a tree , or as a novice , or pro as a safeguard ..
However , if you free climb without rope , assume the worst can happen and use common sense and the instructions I provide below .
2.Â Select a healthy dry tree that has a lot of sturdy , healthy limbs that are branched out so you can always reach the next higher one up easily ( you 'll thank me on the way down ) .
3.Â Always test a limb's strength that your about to grab before committing any weight to it and make sure you have a firm hold of another branch as you grab the limb for backup .
Â
That way if you grab a weak or dead branch , you 'll have the other to save your fall .
Â
Speaking of which ; you should never have your full weight on any one branch , because if it snaps or you slip , and you have n't a grip on another branch for a safety net , you 'll have to develop powers of levitation to escape , or be lucky enough to grab a branch before you land on you head .
3.Â
As you begin your ascent of the tree , take methodical steps with your foot placement on branches keeping the limbs centered under your shoe , with your weight even on each foot .
Â
Always make sure to have at least one foot resting on a branch - never dangle your legs as you climb , you should always be using your legs and arms equally when climbing - something few beginners realize .
Â
However , if you want a better arm workout , you can put more energy into lifting with your arms rather than stepping up with your feet - just always have at least a foot on a limb .
4.Â
As you climb , alternate your hands and feet with your movement giving each human limb a turn at touching each tree limb ; i.e. right hand , then left foot , then left hand , then right foot .
Â
Repeat until you have reached a good twenty feet from the top ( DANGER - thins out up there , no need to try that ) .
Â Climb back down in the same fashion .
Advanced Technique
5.Â
If you are climbing a tree like a coconut that has no limbs except towards the top I find a good technique to use is to hug the backside of the tree with your hands , arms locked and outstretched .
Â
Place your feet planted on the tree facing upright ( you need flexible ankles ) , knees slightly bend and then shimmy your feet up until your body forms a sideways v facing the tree like so :
Â < I
Once you have shimmied your legs up far enough towards your hands gripping the backside of the tree , a friction will form .
Â
Make sure your hand grip is strong , if it is not you 'll simply fall backwards .
Â
Once you have achieved the sideways V against the tree and feel comfortable , the only way your body should be able to move is if you swivel sideways in a circle around the tree . Â
Once your comfortable and centered , you can then shimmy your hands and feet up carefully and slowly until you have reached a desired nest of limbs from which you can perch atop .
To get down do the same thing in reverse .
Â
If you start to panic or lose your grip , just bear hug the tree , and resign yourself to some scratched arms , legs and confidence as you slide down in shame - just kidding .
Â
This form of climbing takes great grip strength , balance , and confidence , otherwise it is a scary proposal .
Â
If with those three things it is dicey .
Â I do n't recommend it .
On occasion you get some defender of patents who is upset when we use the m-word to describe these artificial state - granted monopoly rights .
For example here one Dale Halling , a patent attorney ( surprise ! ) posts about " The Myth that Patents are a Monopoly " and writes , " People who suggest a patent is a monopoly are not being intellectually honest and perpetuating a myth to advance a political agenda . "
Well , let 's see .
First , see my post Epstein and Patents , noting that the pro-patent Epstein writes :
Patented goods are subject to a lawful monopoly created by the state in order to induce their creation .
No one thinks that new pharmaceutical drugs will be invented by private firms that cannot receive a rate of return sufficient to recover [ various costs ] .
...
The legal monopoly granted by the patent is the only mechanism that allows the producer to recover those fixed costs ....
Is the pro-patent Epstein being dishonest ?
And see my comments ( 1 , 2 ) on The Three Stages of Invention post , excerpted below :
First , as to whether patents are monopoly grants -- hell , even the feds admit this : " Section 154 and related provisions [ e.g. Sec. 271 ] obviously are intended to grant a patentee a monopoly only over the United States market .... "
U.S. Supreme Court , Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp. , 406 U.S. 518 ( 1972 ) .
See also : King Instr. v. Perego , by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( " Congress made the policy choice that the " carrot " of an exclusive market for the patented goods would encourage patentees to commercialize the protected inventions so that the public would enjoy the benefits of the new technology during the patent term in exchange for granting a limited patent monopoly .
In other words , the public expected benefits during " ' the embarrassment of an exclusive patent as Jefferson put it . ' "
Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 10 - 11 ( 1966 ) . )
See also Engel Ind. v. Lockformer Co. ( " We hold that the disputed royalties provisions do not inappropriately extend the patent monopoly to unpatented parts of the patented system " ) ; Carborundum Co. v. Molten Metal Eq. Co. ( " A patentee , in demanding and receiving full compensation for the wrongful use of his invention in devices made and sold by a manufacturer adopts the sales as though made by himself , and therefore , necessarily licenses the use of the devices , and frees them from the monopoly of the patent . " )
And : Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. , 331 U.S. 218 , 230 ( 1947 ) :
The Florida statute is aimed directly at the promotion of intellectual creation by substantially restricting the public 's ability to exploit ideas that the patent system mandates shall be free for all to use .
Like the interpretation of Illinois unfair competition law in Sears and Compco , the Florida statute represents a break with the tradition of peaceful coexistence between state market regulation and federal patent policy .
The Florida law substantially restricts the public 's ability to exploit an unpatented design in general circulation , raising the specter of state - created monopolies in a host of useful shapes and processes for which patent protection has been denied or is otherwise unobtainable .
It thus enters a field of regulation which the patent laws have reserved to Congress .
The patent statute 's careful balance between public right and private monopoly to promote certain creative activity is a " scheme of federal regulation . . . so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it . "
Brenner v. Manson , 383 U.S. 519 ( 1966 ) :
Whatever weight is attached to the value of encouraging disclosure and of inhibiting secrecy , we believe a more compelling consideration is that a process patent in the chemical field , which has not been developed and pointed to the degree of specific utility , creates a monopoly of knowledge which should be granted only if clearly commanded by the statute .
Until the process claim has been reduced to production of a product shown to be useful , the metes and bounds of that monopoly are not capable of precise delineation .
It may engross a vast , unknown , and perhaps unknowable area .
Such a patent may confer power to block off whole areas of scientific development , without compensating benefit to the public .
The basic quid pro quo contemplated by the Constitution and the Congress for granting a patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility .
Unless and until a process is refined and developed to this point -- where specific benefit exists in currently available form - there is insufficient justification for permitting an applicant to engross what may prove to be a broad field .
Diamond v. Chakrabarty , S.Ct. ( 1980 ) , Brennan 's dissent :
I agree with the Court that the question before us is a narrow one .
Neither the future of scientific research , nor even the ability of respondent Chakrabarty to reap some monopoly profits from his pioneering work , is at stake .
Patents on the processes by which he has produced and employed the new living organism are not contested .
The only question we need decide is whether Congress , exercising its authority under Art. I , 8 , of the Constitution , intended that he be able to secure a monopoly on the living organism itself , no matter how produced or how used .
Now you can argue that patent holders do not necessarily have " monopoly power " ( see The Importance of Patents for Economic Development - 1999 , by Prof. William Hennessey ) , but as Rothbard et al. have pointed out , the government 's concept of monopoly is flawed ; the only issue that matters is whether there is a legal monopoly granted .
See , e.g. , Hoppe , A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism , ch. 9 , pp. 185-86 :
The monopoly problem as a special problem of markets requiring state action to be resolved does not exist .
In fact , only when the state enters the scene does a real , nonillusory problem of monopoly and monopoly prices emerge .
The state is the only enterprise whose prices and business practices can be conceptually distinguished from all other prices and practices , and whose prices and practices can be called " too high " or " exploitative " in a completely objective , nonarbitrary way .
These are prices and practices which consumers are not voluntarily willing to pay and accept , but which instead are forced upon them through threats of violence .
See also Rothbard , Man , Economy , and State ( with Power and Market ) : " The only viable definition of monopoly is a grant of privilege from the government . "
Now it is , indeed , clear that a patent is a monopoly grant to someone that permits them to charge above - market prices ; this is exactly the goal of the patent law : to provide this monopoly profit to inventors so as to incentivize them to innovate and file for patents .
And it is why , for example , Blackberry paid over $ 600 million to NTP in a recent patent suit ; and it is why consumers will have to pay more for Blackberry services than they otherwise would , etc .
Did NTP have " monopoly power " as defined by the government 's antitrust scheme ?
I do n't know .
Probably not .
But did they extort RIM / Blackberry by use of the government - granted patent monopoly ?
Of course .
See also Arnold Plant , The Economic Theory Concerning Patents for Inventions , sections 16 , 19 , 20 , 24 :
The patent system may , on the one hand , be expected to affect the making of inventions in two ways .
The first is to divert inventive activity into those fields in which the monopoly grant will be expected to prove most remunerative .
It may , secondly , affect the total amount of inventive activity .
... the utilitarians assumed that the patent system was responsible for the greater part of inventing activity .
The question which they one and all failed to ask themselves , however , is what these people would otherwise be doing if the patent system were not diverting their attention by the offer of monopolistic profits to the task of inventing .
By what system of economic calculus were they enabled to conclude so definitely that the gain of any inventions that they might make would not be offset by the loss of other output ?
By no stretch of the imagination can the inventing class be assumed to be otherwise unemployable .
Other product which is foregone when scarce factors are diverted in this way completely escaped their attention .
... at the beginning of this century Professor J. B. Clark was still writing : " If the patented article is something which society without a patent system would not have secured at all - the inventor 's monopoly hurts nobody ...
His gains consist in something which no one loses , even while he enjoys them . " ?
No inkling here that the patent inducement to invent diverts scarce human effort from other production , and that the subsequent exploitation of patents again interferes with the disposition of scarce factors which would obtain under competitive conditions .
...
It seems unquestionable not only that a very considerable volume of inventive activity must definitely be induced by price conditions , but also that that activity is diverted by price movements from other types of endeavour as well as from other fields of invention .
Entrepreneurs faced with new difficulties or with new opportunities will divert not only their own attention , but that of every technician who can be spared , from the business of routine production to that of urgent innovation .
They will not rely exclusively upon those types of professional inventors whose autonomous output pours out in a stream of unvarying size , and some of whom may be prepared , in return for the inducements which the entrepreneurs can offer , to transfer their spontaneous activity to their service .
It can not be assumed that all who are capable of innovation spend their whole lives in inventing .
Many of them are also able administrators and production controllers ; some in the past have been clergymen and barbers , and in our own time there is a steady flow of technicians from the research laboratories of pure science into those of industrial invention and out again .
...
The patent system ... enables those who " have the monopoly of the right to use a patented invention to raise the price of using it ... and in that way to derive a larger profit from the invention than they could otherwise obtain .
The effect must surely be to induce a considerable volume of activity to be diverted from other spheres to the attempt to make inventions of a patentable type .

And I do n't like what I see .
For three years I had been seeing her for " Major Depressive Disorder " and been treating her with Effexor and Restoril and thought I was doing a good job of it , too .
Proud of myself , you see , that I had reduced her symptoms AND managed to keep the number of pills she was on to well under the psychiatry average of 19 .
I rule .
Also and by the way , she had an above - elbow amputation from a bus accident ten years ago .
She had phantom limb pain , in this case feeling that her missing hand was bunched up into a fist , .
Occasionally , she 'd even get a charlie horse in the forearm which was n't there .
Sometimes if she was distracted , or if she distracted herself , the pain would go away .
Other days , it was terrible.etc , etc , you get the idea .
The New Yorker had a recent article on Ramachandran , the neurologist famous for discovering that phantom limb pain was n't the result of damaged nerve endings in the stump , but of a brain malfunction : the brain had rewired itself to think that a stump was there .
What needed to be done was to teach the brain that it was n't there ; or , more immediately , trick the brain into relaxing the fist that is n't there .
He did this by putting a large mirror in front of the person , facing / reflecting the good arm .
Looked at from that side , it looked like you had two good arms .
You would then clench and unclench your " two " fists , and you / your brain would " see " the other hand ( that was n't really there ) also unclenching .
You 'd feel as if the fist was relaxing , and the cramp would go away .
Apparently , the results were sudden and profound .
So.I.I was a little nervous , I do n't mind telling you this up front .
I set up the mirror just as Ramachandran had described .
At first she did n't really get it , she wiggled her fingers , and nothing was happening .
" What I want you to do , " I ad libbed , " is look in the mirror , and imagine that your left hand is doing the exact same thing as your right , simultaneously . "
I showed her by opening and closing my fists .
" In other words , open and close both of your fists .
" I barely finished my sentence when her eyes popped wide .
" Oh my God .
Oh my God .
" My eyes popped open , too -- We did that for a minute , and I asked her to then play a scale on an imaginary piano , 1 - 2- 3- 4-5-4-3 - 2 - 1 , with " both hands .
" She started crying .
This is n't an exaggeration .
" I can't believe this .
I can actually feel my hand ... " This , I thought with immense pride , is awesome .
II .
Well , it 's a wonderful story , I guess , and if this was the end of it it would be suitable foror maybe one of the medical journals that we pretend to read .
Maybe I could sell the story to TV .
But it 's not the end , there are some hard questions to be asked that no one will ever ask :
Sure , it worked , sure , she feels better , sure , she thinks I 'm awesome .
Why did it take meto try somethingwith her ?
Ramachandran 's mirror technique is medical school stuff .
Everyone knows it .
Everyone .
If you do n't know it children on the street kick you in the shins .
If you were in a coma during medical school then you still would have picked it up from a trillion other places , fromtotoOf course I knew the significance of the mirror .
Of course I knew how to do it .
I just never did .
It never even occurred to me to do it .
The mirror occurred to me ; doing it never occurred to me .
I 'll tell you that every single time I saw her stump , the theoretical implications of Ramachnadran 's mirror immediately came to my mind , I imagined the mirror .
But I never tried it .
Not just me , but it also never occurred to the ten years of doctors she 'd seen in her life .
Absolutely every single doctor knows about the mirror .
Not one tried it .
And it was n't that I was lazy or did n't care -- I had tried Elavil , Neurontin , Lyrica , Cymbalta -- no , I did n't expect much from them , but I tried them , I thought , why not ?
Maybe it could help ?
But I never evenusing the mirror .
I can't understate this : I wasabout the mirror in her presence , but never thinking aboutthe mirror .
I was n't asleep , I was n't drunk , I was n't inattentive , I was n't bored .
I was just too much in my world .
So I ask you : did I help her ?
Or did I make her suffer needlessly for three years ?
III .
Without ducking responsibility , what 's wrong with medicine today is that it is predicated on providing treatment , not on reducing suffering .
Not on solving problems .
The reason it never occurred to me to use the mirror is because the mirror is not something doctors do .
Never mind it is fairly safe .
What we do is offer treatments .
Medications .
Procedures .
NotDo you know what every single one of my patients who lives in Flavor Country have in common ?
They 're on Lipitor .
That 's what doctors do when confronted with the results of smoking .
Not nicotine patches or wellbutrin or talking them through becoming a different person .
They treat the results .
The smoking is an afterthought .
Think about how much controversy there is over using medicationsoff label for something else .
Where , then , is the cognitive strength to do something that is n't even considered a treatment ?
Most residents fantasize about doing something like the mirror on a patient , partly because it sounds cool , but unfortunately really because it puts them on an equal footing with their supervisors .
They 'll never know as much aboutas their supervisors , but they can know more about this .
This is how they can distinguish themselves .
Once they grow to the point where they are knowledgeable about the Guidelines , then there 's no reason to use mirrors .
IV .
Also -- and again not to minimize my own responsibility -- part of the problem with all of the popularizers like Oliver Sacks , NPR , , is they trivialize the information to the point of uselessness .
" So that 's why the Kurds hate the Sunnis !
I 'll have a latte . "
There 's a sense among doctors that if it appeared in , say , , it 's not real medicine .
When I was a resident I tried the Sacks insights .
None of them ever worked .
It was n't either of our fault : there 's a big gap between practicing medicine and watching
What I did n't do , of course , is watchand then go back andhow I might actually apply it .
V.Now , all you patients , think about this : there is more than a slight chance that your doctor knows how to help you , but is n't trying it .
Maybe it's another medication , maybe it's an intervention , maybe it 's information he 's simply not telling you .
Not on purpose -- it does n' tto him to tell you .
Not because he 's bad , of course .
I do n't think I 'm bad , not a badanyway .
But hell , if I had to sit with every patient and think out of the box on every issue with them , and individualize the treatment while still maintaining scientific rigor -- drawing not just medicine but from all possible fields that might be applicable to the current problem , being " conscious of the patient 's spirituality " not because that 's what doctors are supposed to pay lip service to , but because I might be able to use it in a clever manner to obtain , spending time proportional to what is actually going to matter ( like smoking ) and less on treatments I am conditioned to provide reflexively ---- then what kind of a doctor would I be ?

Preparing our youth for the future of science in genetics .
I am a high school freshman biology and junior - senior genetics teacher .
My school is a large public , magnet school in a high - need community .
I will be teaching a new class in genetics prompted by a large student interest on the expanding discipline .
This is an advanced class for upperclassmen and will deal with complex issues in genetics , with an emphasis in technology .
To fully engage students it is vital to provide hands - on , inquiry - based labs to fully understand the difficult material .
Unfortunately , I have limited supplies or monetary sources available at school to perform even simple labs .
I hope with quality lab supplies I can build a quality genetics program which will further promote student interest in the sciences .
To strengthen the genetics curriculum , I need supplies for lab explorations .
I need 3 flightless fruitfly kits ( for 3 classes ) and a class set of genetics of corn which will be utilized to instill the concepts of inheritance .
This will make it possible for my students to see first hand how organisms inherit certain physical patterns , characteristics , and even mutations .
Science labs are an engaging and memorable experience that allow students to explore the many concepts in the classroom .
You will make it possible for my students to see first hand how organisms inherit certain physical patterns , characteristics , and even mutations .
You will also be giving my students an opportunity to explore genetics in the way many professionals do .
These students are eager to explore genetics and they need your help !
The National Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC ) of Nigeria said recently they have seized a large consignment of Chinese - made fake drugs labeled ' Made in India ' .
Last week , the NAFDAC issued a press release stating those fake anti-malarial generic pharmaceuticals with the label ' Made in India ' were actually found to have been produced in China .
The UK newspaper The Observer had also reported recently that fake Chinese drugs were flooding the UK market .
Indian government has registered ' strong protest ' with the China 's foreign trade ministry , according to sources in the commerce ministry of India .
China denied that it was a major exporter of fake drugs .
Bian Zhenjia , China 's deputy commissioner of the State Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it was wrong to say that China was a major exporter of fake drugs .
' ' I do not agree with what the foreign media has been saying .
The Chinese government has always paid great attention to cracking down on fake drugs , '' Bian said at a news conference in Beijing yesterday .
The India ’ High Commissioner in the Nigerian capital of Abuja , Mahesh Sachdev said :
While this a case of a Chinese company exporting fake drugs labeled ' Made in India ' which has been accidentally exposed , it is unlikely to be an isolated incident .
Indeed there is no reason for Nigeria to be the only country to be receiving such consignments , Mahesh Sachdev wrote in a letter to his country 's Commerce Secretary GSK Pillai .
It not only dents our image and takes our legitimate market share , it also erodes the distinction between generic and fake medicines that we have been campaigning for at WHO and WTO , the High commissioner said in the letter .
About 60 % of drugs in Nigeria are imported .
Between 2001 and 2007 , more than 30 Indian and Chinese companies were banned in Nigeria for exporting fake drugs to the country .
India and China have been accused of exporting drugs to Africa that fail to meet international safety standards .
The main markets involved are Ghana , South Africa , Ivory Coast and West Africa .
The Nigerian minister of information , Dorothy Dora Akunyili said that fake drug manufacturers have become so sophisticated that even multinational drug companies find it difficult to say whether their own drugs in Nigeria are genuine or fakes .
EHealth Ontario paid a consultant who submitted an invoice for eight hours of work in which she said she consulted herself , then followed up with questions for herself .
Agency spokeswoman Deanna Allen said the bill contained a typo and that the consultant had in fact consulted and followed up with a colleague , but acknowledged the agency had paid the invoice as filed .
Documents obtained by the Star raise yet more questions about practices at the controversial agency .
Miyo Yamashita of Anzen Consulting Inc. filed an invoice to eHealth Ontario earlier this year for work on Jan. 6 , 2009 that included receiving " instructions from M.Y. on privacy materials , " sending information to " M.Y. for review " and " phone calls with M.Y. on follow - up questions . "
Yamashita is a managing partner at Anzen , which received a four - month $ 268,000 contract to produce a communications plan and branding strategy for eHealth Ontario .
EHealth , established in 2008 to develop electronic health records for the province , is at the heart of a controversy involving high - priced consultants and untendered contracts , which critics say were awarded to long - time associates of key figures at the provincial agency .
The eHealth affair dominated yesterday 's question period , the last before the Legislature 's summer break .
The Progressive Conservatives and the New Democrats called for the removal of Health Minister David Caplan , eHealth Ontario CEO Sarah Kramer and board chair Dr. Alan Hudson .
Documents obtained by the PC party under a freedom - of - information request detail Anzen 's contract , dated Oct. 6 , 2008 to Jan. 30 , 2009 .
The documents , obtained by the Star , also show Yamashita bills at $ 300 an hour .
Yamashita did not respond to requests for an interview , but Anzen issued a statement to the Star yesterday .
" Anzen stands behind the work we have completed and invoiced to eHealth Ontario , " Anzen 's Sylvia Kingsmill said in an email .
" We believe our work has been of high quality and our accounting highly transparent . "
Documents also show Anzen submitted an invoice to eHealth for $ 7,000 for " speech writing services " for Kramer 's address to an Ontario Hospital Association conference late last year .
The Anzen invoice , dated Nov. 30 , 2008 , shows that Anzen used Hugh MacPhie & Company , a boutique management - consulting firm , for speech - writing services .
MacPhie used to work in former premier Mike Harris 's office as a speech writer .
Industry experts say charging $ 7,000 for a speech is not unreasonable .
Interim PC Leader Bob Runciman charged yesterday in the Legislature that Caplan has failed to take proper action on eHealth and is defending " offensive " expenditures .
Premier Dalton McGuinty and Caplan again appealed to the opposition to wait until provincial Auditor General Jim McCarter completes his review of eHealth .
An extensive third - party review is also in the works by PricewaterhouseCoopers at Caplan 's request .
Anzen told the Star it looks forward to participating in the third - party reviews .
The culture of entitlement at eHealth Ontario is something " I have never seen before " in health care , said New Democrat MPP France Gélinas ( Nickel Belt ) .
EHealth Ontario was established after the Smart Systems for Health Agency was dissolved last year .
Smart Systems was criticized for spending $ 647 million in taxpayer dollars with little to show for it .
The opposition parties say eHealth contracts were awarded to long - time associates of Hudson and Kramer .
Yamashita is married to Michael Guerriere , the managing partner for Courtyard Group .
Courtyard held three untendered contracts from eHealth Ontario worth nearly $ 2 million with start dates ranging from October 2008 , to Jan. 30 , 2009 , the FOI documents show .
Hudson , a respected neurosurgeon who has helped transform wait times in Ontario , and Guerriere worked together at the University Health Network , both leaving in 2000 .

Allen has told the Star that prior to Kramer 's arrival at eHealth in November 2008 , the board of directors , not Hudson , made decisions on contracts .
Hudson and Kramer were not available for interviews yesterday .
Courtyard has said it has also written to both the auditor general and the eHealth board to " welcome the independent reviews . "
Ron Artest , who nearly derailed the Los Angeles Lakers ’ championship drive , will apparently be joining them for the next joyride through the playoffs .
The Lakers agreed to give Artest their full midlevel exception , about $ 33 million over five years , with an opt - out after the fourth year .
However , the parties left the door open to adjust the terms before the deal is signed Wednesday , including the possibility of a shorter contract , according to a person familiar with the talks .
The N.B.A. has a moratorium on signings and trades , and no deal can be completed until Wednesday .
“ I am very excited to finally be going to L.A. , ” Artest said in a statement released by his agent David Bauman .
“ For years now , the Lakers have expressed interest in having me play for them , but we could never get the stars to align .
I ’m finally a Laker and I can’t wait to get on the court with Kobe , Pau and the rest of the team , and play for Phil .
I ’m very , very excited to be a Laker .
I look forward to helping the Lakers defend their championship , and it will be great to finally not get booed in the Staples Center . ”
Artest , a fearsome defender and a potent scorer , is coming off perhaps his best season .
He helped lead the Houston Rockets to a 53 - 29 record , despite the loss of Tracy McGrady to an injury .
The Rockets pushed the Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference semifinals , after losing center Yao Ming .

Programming Paradigms for Dummies : What Every Programmer Should Know .
In G. Assayag and A. Gerzso ( eds . ) New Computational Paradigms for Computer Music , IRCAM / Delatour , France .
This chapter gives an introduction to all the main programming paradigms , their underlying concepts , and the relationships between them .
We give a broad view to help programmers choose the right concepts they need to solve the problems at hand .
We give a taxonomy of almost 30 useful programming paradigms and how they are related .
Most of them differ only in one or a few concepts , but this can make a world of difference in programming .
We explain briefly how programming paradigms influence language design , and we show two sweet spots : dual - paradigm languages and a definitive language .
We introduce the main concepts of programming languages : records , closures , independence ( concurrency ) , and named state .
We explain the main principles of data abstraction and how it lets us organize large programs .
Finally , we conclude by focusing on concurrency , which is widely considered the hardest concept to program with .
We present four little - known but important paradigms that greatly simplify concurrent programming with respect to mainstream languages : declarative concurrency ( both eager and lazy ) , functional reactive programming , discrete synchronous programming , and constraint programming .
These paradigms have no race conditions and can be used in cases where no other paradigm works .
We explain why for multi-core processors and we give several examples from computer music , which often uses these paradigms .
I have not found this paper in the LTU archives , but I though it is likely of interest to this community .
Of course , the author is well know here ( e.g. , his book Concepts , Techniques , and Models of Computer Programming ) .
I like the bird 's eye view of this paper .

The new iPhone and the Palm Pre both launched this week , but bring few major features that have n’t been seen before ( Images : Courtesy of Apple and Palm )
Innovation is our regular column that highlights the latest emerging technological ideas and where they may lead .
This week was a big one in the world of gadgets .
Not only did the firm leading the smartphone market , Apple , unveil a a new iPhone ; but a new contender , Palm , staked its reputation on a smartphone of its own .
Yet despite all the fanfare , neither phone offers much that is new .
Each boasts a luscious full - colour , multi - touch - sensitive screen , GPS , Bluetooth , Wi-Fi access , a camera , light sensors and an accelerometer – as do their competitors the Blackberry Storm , HTC Magic and various others .
The core package of what makes up a smartphone has already been established and the competition between them will be , for now , over relative subtleties rather than unique , blockbusting hardware .
Yet cutting - edge research is still suggesting genuinely novel additions to the smartphone package .
Here are just a few of them …

Feeling the squeeze
Giving phones a new way to pick up their users ’ intentions could make the devices more intuitive to use and open up many new applications .
One idea being explored by Brandon Taylor and Michael Bove at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge is to build pressure sensors into the phone that can detect the exact position of a person ’s fingers .
The phone can switch function depending on your grip ; flipping between camera , phone , music player or games controller as appropriate , for example , without you pressing any buttons .
Backwards approach
Another suggestion is to put the touchscreen on the back , not the front .
That avoids what Patrick Baudisch at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam , Germany , and Microsoft Research in Redmond , Washington , calls the “ fat finger ” problem of your digit obscuring what you are trying to select .
When a user moves a finger along the back of such a device , they see a ghostly finger on the screen , creating the sense that the gadget is transparent .
After a first , somewhat - clunky , prototype Baudisch is now testing a much - improved slimmer version called NanoTouch .
It ’s about the size of a small phone , but the unusual interface allows greater precision .
In tests , users have been able to accurately touch targets on the screen just 1.8 millimetres across .
Distant forces
Another answer to the small screen problem is to move the user interface off the device altogether .
Alex Butler ’s team at Microsoft Research in Cambridge , UK , added infrared sensors to a phone to let it detect the position of fingers up to 10 centimetres away , when the device is placed on a flat surface .
This system , dubbed Sidesight , can be used to interact with objects onscreen without touching the phone at all and could be particularly useful for using a handset to control another device , whether a robot or a TV .
The prototype device tested well , with users reporting they felt they were touching the imaginary edges of large photos as they manipulated them .
Battery life continues to be a problem , with many smart phones running low on juice after a day of heavy use .
This week Nokia suggested a possible answer with a prototype that scavenges energy from mobile antennas and TV masts to charge itself .
At the moment it can only grab 3 to 5 milliwatts – but if the Nokia team can increase that level by a factor of ten , the phone would scavenge enough energy to actually recharge the battery .
Feel the beat
Suggesting new ways for phones to communicate with their users is also keeping researchers busy .
The “ Frankenphone ” designed at the Deutsche Telekom Laboratories in Berlin , Germany , vibrates with a heartbeat that is strong when the phone is fully charged , but weakens as the battery runs low .
User tests suggest that some find the beating phone a reassuring presence in their pocket – although others think it ’s annoying .
A similar idea from the University of Glasgow , UK , uses a phone ’s vibrate function to simulate the feel and sound of sloshing liquid to communicate battery life .
These concept devices are currently doing the rounds at science and technology conferences rather than consumer trade fairs , but it ’s only a few years since the very concept of the smartphone was little more than a research project , so any one of them could , in a modified form , soon find its way into a pocket near you .

Court rules taxi driver falsely accused of rape can receive compensation in legal first
A taxi driver falsely accused of rape could receive a five - figure compensation payout after winning a landmark victory .
Clive Bishop , 49 , says his life was ruined after a drunken 17 - year - old passenger claimed he attacked her .
Kirsty Palmer later admitted she made up the allegations and was jailed for ten months for perverting the course of justice .
Humiliated : Clive Bishop , pictured with wife Sue , was falsely accused of rape by Kirsty Palmer
When he applied for compensation , Mr Bishop described how months of living under a cloud of ' slurs and lies ' had caused him enormous suffering .
But the foster carer was twice refused a payout by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority on the grounds he had not come to physical harm .
That ruling has now been overturned on appeal - the first time the authority has agreed to compensate for the mental trauma of a false criminal accusation .
It is not known exactly how much he will receive but his lawyers estimate it could be up to £ 10,000 .
Kirsty Palmer : Cried rape
Mr Bishop , who has fostered ten children with his wife Sue , picked
up Palmer in his taxi from a nightclub in February 2007 .
The mother of two was drunk and had already been sick .
But only hours after dropping her at her home , police arrived at Mr Bishop 's house at 4.30 am and arrested him in front of his wife on suspicion of rape .
Mr Bishop said : ' I kept trying to explain to the police that it was nonsense .
' But I kept being told to shut up .
I was in shock but convinced that they 'd realise I had n't done anything and let me go . '
Mr Bishop was questioned for 12 hours before being subjected to ' humiliating ' intimate forensic examinations and bailed .
His taxi was also seized for forensic examination and he was under police scrutiny for a further three months .
Ostracised by his community , Mr Bishop says he tried to return to driving his taxi , but found himself unable to find work .
Months later , Palmer confessed that after being locked out of her house in her drunken state she had knocked on a neighbour 's door and falsely claimed she had been raped .
But despite her admission , Mr Bishop was twice refused compensation because he had no physical injuries .
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority overturned those decisions last week at a closed hearing in Taunton , Somerset .
Mr Bishop will now undergo a psychological evaluation to determine the amount he will be eligible to receive before officially applying for compensation later this year .
The amount he gets will depend on the psychological damage he suffered from the incident as well as his lost earnings .
Yesterday Mr Bishop , from Walton in Somerset , told how he had been ' to hell and back ' .
' It 's been such a difficult time for me and my wife , ' he said .
' They claim you are innocent until proven guilty but in reality that is not the case .
People always assume the worst and we had to live with three months of slurs and lies about my character .
' That is why this ruling is so important to me - I could not ever drive a taxi again so this decision will make a huge difference to my life .
I 'm just so very happy and relieved . '
His lawyer Russell Pearce said : ' It is a landmark case - especially for all those who have suffered the extensive trauma that a false allegation can bring .
' This now means that in the future other people will be able to make an application , which is very important . '
I think I ’d like to start an internet movement .
Due to Apple ’s recent actions regarding the Google Voice app , I intend to criticize Apple every day at OSNews for 1984 days , or until they perform a very subtle and simple act of contrition .
I ’d like to enlist the help of every tech journalist , blogger , twitterer , Facebook denizen , and person who ever talks to another person .
I ’m that girl in the running shorts with the hammer , people !
I ’m throwing the hammer at the big creepy guy on the screen !
We do n’t have to be slaves anymore !
Read on for the full manifesto .
Like many people , I ’m fed up with the way that Apple is handling the iPhone .
The release of the iPhone will go down as one of the pivotal turning points in computing history .
It upped the ante for mobile computing .
Pre -iPhone , mobile computing devices were crap , and that was largely the carriers called the shots .
Smartphone handsets were all about generating big monthly fees for the carriers and not treading on their crummy overpriced ringtone and lousy ancillary service offerings .
The carriers did n’t want a truly useable , open handset , and without mobile networking , the PDA market was in the doldrums and unlikely to generate exciting innovation .
Apple raised the bar with a powerful , elegant device that had the potential to do for mobile computing what the personal computer did for computing in general .
Even if the iPhone ultimately fails , its existence will mark a turning point that may ultimately eclipse the Apple II’s .
Now they ’re cocking it up .
And there ’s some suspicion all about the carrier again .
If you ’ve been living under a rock for the past few days , the straw just broke the camel ’s back .
We ’ve all been complaining for years about Apple ’s App Store follies .
First , there was no App Store , and we complained about that ( and their stupid protestations that native apps were n’t needed ) .
Then there was an App Store , and in between fawning over the various apps , we complained about the apps that were conspicuously absent , and particularly about the shoddy treatment of developers who wanted to release the apps we wanted .
Now , there are a zillion other complaints about the iPhone , but deep down most of us are understanding people , and we ’re grateful that the iPhone is as good as it is , and we realize that it may take time for Apple to get around to fixing all the little gripes .
But the lack of openness and transparency around App Store approvals is the big one .
And it ’s inexcusable .
That ’s pure shortsightedness and territory - protection at the expense of the customers .
Apple needs to pay a price for coddling AT&T , and they definitely need to suffer some fallout for all the other crap they ’ve pulled with the App Store .
And here ’s the thing .
If Apple wants to throw AT&T under the bus , they can .
Apple is the power player in this relationship .
If Apple wants to , they can blame this whole problem on AT&T , move forward , and all AT&T can do is take it .
In fact , screwing over AT&T would be the smartest move they could make since they launched the App Store .
AT&T sucks .
But Apple apparently does not have the will to do the right thing .
They ’re complacent .
Apple ’s loyal fans have been too loyal and too forgiving .
The tech media has been too fawning , present company included .
My proposal :
For the next 1984 days , OSNews and every other technology news site and blog should write something negative about Apple .
Let ’s throw some sawdust into Apple ’s carefully lubricated PR machine by initiating a daily stream of petty online complaints against Apple and its products .
I , for one , am committed to spending some time each day to telling inconvenient truths about Apple .
If I accidentally miss a day , I ’ll be sure to post two gripes the next day to make up for it .
And I ’m going to contact as many other tech sites as I can and see if I can get them to do the same .
OSNews is a relatively obscure niche publication , but if I can garner enough support from my more mainstream brothers - in - arms , we can get Apple ’s attention .
I know all the rest of you are fed up too .
I ’m looking at you , TechCrunch !
I
If you do n’t want do give me credit for fomenting this rebellion , steal my idea .
Or start your own rebellion and vow to poop on Apple ’s lawn every week for a month .
I do n’t care .
I ’ll try not to be boring and repetitious .
Once I run out of serious contemporary complaints , I ’ll reminisce about old complaints from the past , like the one - button mouse and the the original mac ’s lack of cursor keys .
Man , do you guys remember how expensive the Lisa was ?
What were they thinking !
But I ’m going to see if we can get a tide of bad PR to wash over the tech - centric corner of the internet , and our one simple demand will be this :
Throw AT&T under the bus .
That ’s all we ask .
Here ’s how it works : Apple can save face here .
All they have to do is release the Google voice app ( and not cancel GV Mobile ) and announce that they had been getting pressure from AT&T but they decided to tell them to suck it and they approved the App anyway .
They can even pretend that the whole thing was a misunderstanding , and they ’d never actually denied the Google Voice app .
They were just thinking about it and it all got blown out of proportion .
They can throw this whole thing down the memory hole .
But we ’ll know .
The general public will never know there was a controversy .
The shareholders will soon forget and go back to wondering what happens when Steve finally kicks the bucket .
( May he live long and prosper ) .
But we , the leaders of the bad PR rebellion , will take this miniscule act of public contrition as a stealth representation of Apple ’s commitment to quietly make some substantial changes to the way it manages the App store and stop mistreating its developers .
And we ’ll keep watching , to make sure this understanding between gentlemen is enforced .
See how reasonable this is ?
I ’m not asking for a miracle .
I ’m not going to ask for what I really want , which is a truly open iPhone platform .
I ’ll live with the submitted - for - approval App Store .
I ’ll be understanding that sometimes there will be delays and screw - ups .
But I wo n’t stand for Apple fooling itself into thinking that it does n’t answer to its customers .
So , for the next five years I will criticize Apple .
Throw AT&T under the bus as a sign of your conversion , and I ’ll go back to ( mostly ) singing your praises .
Why do this ?
So why get so bent out of shape over a gadget and a gadget - maker ?
I guess it ’s because I think of the iPhone as more than a gadget .
It ’s a turning - point .
It ’s also a point of leverage against the tyranny of the mobile carriers , who have strangled innovation in mobile computing for too long .
The carriers desperately want to forestall the fate of becoming a dumb pipe and want to keep their “ value added ” features .
Some of their more frivolous value adds are clearly soon to be swept away , but they ’re going to cling to voice calls and text messages with all their might .
But this is a battle for survival , and it ’s them or us .
As long as the carriers get to differentiate between different kinds of data going over their network , mobile computing will fail to reach its potential and developers will have their hands tied .
For a short window of time , customer demand for the iPhone is so intense that Apple has the power to dictate terms to the carriers and establish some important precedent .
This could be a huge win for mobile computing users .
Apple is under the delusion that this present situation should be seen as merely an opportunity for them , and they need to be reminded who they work for .
In the big picture , the Google Voice app is quite unimportant .
But so was the tea tax .
And Apple is dependent enough on a constant stream of good PR , that a sustained torrent of bad PR will get their attention .
One person boycotting Apple or writing an impassioned blog posting may not get the job done , but if all of the thought leaders online pull together and do this , Apple will take notice .
And , as a reader so astutely pointed out , this is n’t , of course just about AT&T .
Right now , AT&T is the most influential carrier , but as the iPhone moves across the globe , Apple has a chance to set the carriers straight all over the place .
They should make an example of AT&T and put the world ’s other carriers on notice .
Let ’s tell a story
Before I step off my soapbox , I ’d like to revisit a familiar story and draw your attention to a new moral of that story :
Remember that cornerstone of techno - mythology about how IBM created the PC architecture but failed to grasp its revolutionary potential ?
That they valued their designs so little that they allowed themselves to get bamboozled by some punk kids into a partnership wherein the aforementioned punk kids would be able to ship a non-IBM operating system with the device and therefore co-opt its amazing potential and ultimately garner most of the profits from its popularity ?
Well , I bet Steve Jobs and Apple remember that story pretty well .
Problem is , they ’re learning the wrong lesson from that story .
They think that they ’re IBM in the story , and that by recognizing the potential of their new platform , they wo n’t let Microsoft and Compaq and WordPerfect and Lotus jump in and get all the glory and make all the money .
But they do n’t realize that they ’re not IBM in the story .
They ’re bizarro - IBM .
They ’re the alternative universe IBM , where IBM executives do recognize the PC ’s potential , and they make sure not to partner with Microsoft , and they do n’t open up the PC hardware spec , and they carefully control software vendors ’ access to the platform .
In this world , bizarro - IBM keeps a tight lid on the PC , and they sell thousands of PCs to large businesses at thousands of dollars each , and after a few years , these large businesses realize that mainframes and dumb terminals really are where it ’s at .
Meanwhile , bizarro - Apple is creating a much - more open personal computer , and succeeds in completely revolutionizing computing .
At some point , bizarro - Free Unix and bizarro - Linux enter on the scene to keep Apple on its toes , but the upshot is in 2009 most people are using Apples and “ Micro - soft ” never releases an operating system .
Hey , dumb-asses , do n’t be bizarro - IBM .
IBM never would have been able to control the PC platform .
By trying to , they would only have ensured that someone else ’s PC platform would have succeeded instead .
As we all know , IBM ’s PC did n’t succeed because it was the best ( or even that good ) .
It succeeded because it was flexible , affordable , and accessible to developers .
Apple , you ’re famous for your refusal to compromise on your ideals about how the computing experience should be .
Though the Mac is n’t as closed as it used to be , it also is n’t as open as it used to be .
You probably feel like you ’ve hit the sweet spot on hardware - openness .
But guess what , if Apple computer users had never been able to install any app they wanted on their machines , you would have been out of business in 1976 .
And thus concludes my story , and my revolutionary clarion call .
1983 days to go .
Tell your friends .
David Adams is Publisher of OSNews , a die - hard Apple fan and Mac user , a devoted iPhone devotee , a daily Linux - on - the - server user since 1994 , a former Palm user who misses Grafitti , a sad sack who ’s still upset about the Newton being discontinued , and a guy who uses Windows every day and does n’t think Vista is nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be .
He also realizes that if Apple proves to be intransigent , and nobody joins his revolution , there ’s no way he ’ll bother to keep this up for 1,984 days , but it ’s just such a perfect number to use , and instead he ’ll keep it up for a few months then give up in disgust and ultimately sell his iPhone when his AT&T contract runs out .
I am only sharing this information knowing very well that it might be already available on the inetrnet somewhere .
This was e-mailed to me a few days ago and I could n't just delete it as trash .
These are some hair - raising anecdotes narrated by non other than the survivors themselves .
Have a look !
1. Vesna Vulovic : The Stewardess who survived a terrorist attack at 33,000 feet
. A Yugoslav Airlines DC - 9 departed from Copenhagen for Belgrade ( via Zagreb ) with 28 passengers and crew on January 26 , 1972 .
When the plane reached at an altitude of 33,000 feet , a bomb in the cargo section , planted by the Ustashe Croatian separatist group , exploded .
The plane blew up , disintegrated and crashed in the mountains .
In what must be one of the greatest survival stories of all time , stewardess Vesna Vulovic survived the 33,000 feet descent sitting on the tail of the plane .
As she later stated in an interview , 22 year old Vulovic was n't even supposed to be on that plane .
it was another Vesna who was supposed to be on that flight , but she was happy with the mix - up as it allowed her to make her first trip to Denmark .
She ended up with a fractured skull , two broken legs , and three broken vertebrae - one of which was crushed and left her paralyzed from the waist down .
Vulovic spent several months in and out of hospitals ; operations allowed her to walk again .
She became a celebrity when the Guinness Book of World Records invited her to a ceremony in London with Paul McCartney .
She is listed for surviving the longest fall without a parachute .
Vulovic is now a national hero in Serbia and spent the late 90s marching in Belgrade against Slobodan Milosovic .
After reading my title , I suppose many will automatically think I am some sort of anarchist or revolutionary .
If so , then thank you for the complement .
If only I could be thought of in such an honorable way ?
The very intrusive and invasive U.S. Census , which I have written about in the past , here and here , can be used in my opinion , to make a case for secession .
Not that a case for secession can't be made using a myriad of other criteria , but due to the original reasoning for the census , I think one can show that any country with more than 300,000,000 people cannot possibly remain a free republic .
It simply is not possible .
Our nation was intended to be several states , with a federal system to oversee the protection of individual rights .
It has become a single nation - state with all control coming from a central - planning leviathan .
This is an untenable situation and was bound to lead to tyranny .
This in and of itself is reason enough to pursue secession .
First , let 's look at the Census issue .
Stated in Article 1 , Section 2 of our constitution :
Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years ; and excluding Indians not taxed , three fifths of all other Persons .
The actual enumeration shall be made within three years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent term of ten years , in such manner as they shall by law direct .
The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand , but each state shall have at least one Representative .
There are a couple of things that stand out in this passage .
First , an actual enumeration ( simple head count ) shall be made every ten years .
This count of heads is all that is authorized by the constitution , and is to be done so that a proper ratio between the representatives and the people can be determined , and to also determine the proper apportionment of direct taxes among the several states .
As an aside , the number of representatives has been fixed at 435 since 1911 .
The total population of the United States in 1911 was 93,863,000 .
Obviously , our population has increased almost three and one half times since then without any change in representation .
Secondly , the writers of our current constitution said that there should not be more than one representative for every thirty thousand people , and going forward from the original 65 members , the rule of one representative for every thirty thousand people was generally accepted .
As I will discuss later , there were no fixed upper limits on the number of representatives , but the Founders did caution against too large a number ; but why ?
Atlas Shrugged ( Centen ...
Ayn Rand Best Price : $ 8.90 Buy New $ 16.10 ( as of 05:35 EST - Details )
The ratio of representatives to people was not exact as heavily populated centers would have fewer representatives per capita , but the end result was to be full and fair representation of all the people .
Since the number of representatives has been fixed for almost one hundred years , what is the point of the current Census ?
Since no additional representation is even being discussed and no talk or legislation exists to change this number , is the Census now valid and / or constitutional ?
I do realize that specific district changes do occur and that apportionment of some taxes ( actually very little ) is still constitutional , but I think a very good argument could be made that not only is the modern Census completely unnecessary , but that it might now be unconstitutional as well due to the fact that the primary reasoning for this count has been thrown aside by the federal government .
If no count will result in a change of representation , then the costly and invasive U.S. Census should be stopped immediately .
Obviously , the modern census count is used not to determine representation as originally intended anyway , but is used as a tool to determine the improper and unconstitutional amounts of wealth redistribution , and to gain personal and private information about the citizenry .
The coming census also includes a precise mapping by GPS of every address .
What in the world does locking in my home position in a government database have to do with representation or apportionment ?
This information , by the way , is none of their damn business !
This in and of itself is reason enough to scrap this invasion of privacy because the entire census count is nothing more than a farce to help expand government interference into private matters .
What does all this mean ?
A breakdown of the numbers is useful here .
Initially , there was one representative for every 30,000 people .
In 1911 when the representative number became fixed at 435 , there was one representative for every 216,000 people .
Currently , there is one representative for approximately every 760,000 Americans .
If we were to go back to the original plan , we would now have to have about 11,000 representatives .
Is anybody up to 11,000 campaigns and elections every two years ?
Before you answer , think about the unseen consequences .
Karen DeCoster pointed out to me that having thousands of representatives , as ridiculous as it sounds , might prove to be beneficial .
Can you imagine the bottleneck if 11,000 politicians were trying to agree on a particular piece of legislation ?
Nothing would ever get done , rendering the political process mute .
This might not be a bad idea after all , as gridlock is a desired end .
Gridlock stifles political aggression and is certainly a friend of freedom .
Times have certainly changed over the past 200 years or so .
James Madison once thought that the number of representatives , as long as not too small or too large , was not a big issue .
He thought this because he had faith in the American people ; in that they would not continue to vote for those who would advance tyranny , and considering the times , he was most likely correct in his assumption .
What in the world would Madison think if he were alive today ?
His trust in the American people would be shaken beyond repair .
How could anyone today believe that our liberty is safe in the hands of the imbecilic and unenlightened American voter ?
Secession , State , and ... Best Price : $ 25.31 Buy New $ 40.30 ( as of 10:15 EST - Details )
His foreknowledge was evident when he said :
What change of circumstance , time , and a fuller population of our country may produce , requires a prophetic spirit to declare , which makes no part of my pretensions .
Judging from his words , he understood that times would bring change and that larger and larger populations would cause problems in representation .
Given the times of our Founders , one representative for every 30,000 people seemed proper , but today , one for every 760,000 is absurd .
Let 's face it ; this country has become too large for freedom to survive under its present form of government .
Instead of freedom , we now have socialism , fascism and tyranny .
So what can be done about it ?
I think there is only one logical answer : Secession !
Secession should not be feared but embraced .
Our country was borne by secession and in my opinion can only be saved by secession .
Secession in my mind is an inherent , God - given right .
If one is bound by or to the state by force , freedom has no validity and cannot exist .
Secession is the virtual unbinding of the chains of tyranny .
It is the emancipation if you will , from the servitude of the state and awakens the spirit of liberty .
What better solution is there when extreme conditions exist ?
Many will balk at the idea of secession but there is no need .
Our country would not be torn apart , but restored , by separating ourselves from a tyrannical government .
Secession is not a breakup of the country because the country will remain intact .
The spirit of America would not be lost but regained .
The oppressive power of the federal government would be curtailed , and in many cases eliminated .
Just think of the benefits if the federal government 's power was eradicated .
Massive taxation and inflation would all but disappear .
Unjust and unholy foreign aggression would not be possible .
Spying , wiretapping and unwarranted searches would be a thing of the past .
The growing police state and standing armies could not be funded at current levels and would have to be pared back .
U.S. military bases in other countries would have to be closed and all military personnel could come home where they belong .
The insane war on drugs and its accompanying prison - state apparatus would shut down .
With these changes , torture would no longer be the rule of the day , and civil and just law could return .
In other words , a return to freedom would be evident and real prosperity would once again be available for all to seek .
Does this sound euphoric ?
Of course it does , because freedom and free markets are euphoric in a real way , unlike the so - called socialistic euphoria based on theft and oppression .
This is serious business !
It is important , it is imperative , and time is of the essence !
Any secession from this tyrannical government , whether by states , portions of states , or regions , will require gargantuan efforts by individuals .
This government will never be receptive of any plan to limit its power , and secession is a virtual elimination and negation of centralized government .
No break from this behemoth can or will be achieved through government action or government process .
That would be an exercise in futility and would fuel even more oppression .
It will require that those involved , whether individuals , groups of individuals or entire states , not obey any unconstitutional or unjust federal law .
As should be evident , this will be no easy task , but the rewards of victorious secession are freedom , liberty and prosperity .

The Best of Gary D. Barnett
Google sold its stake in AOL at a US $ 717 million loss , according to a regulatory filing made on Monday .
Time Warner purchased Google 's 5 percent share in AOL on July 8 for $ 283 million , AOL said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Google bought the share of AOL in late 2005 for $ 1 billion .
The purchase paves the way for Time Warner to spin off AOL , a move it has said it plans to finally make by the end of this year .
Time Warner has been struggling for years to rid itself of AOL , after merging with the company in 2001 .
The combination of the companies did n't work out as planned .
AOL in particular has struggled , failing to make up lost revenue from its shrinking Internet - access subscription business with new revenue from online ads .
Its transition to a business based on ad revenue has not kept up with the rest of the industry .
For example , in 2008 , U.S. online ad spending grew 11 percent , according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau , but AOL 's online ad revenue dropped 6 percent .
Earlier this year Google told Time Warner that it wanted to sell its stake in AOL and wrote down the value of the investment by $ 726 million .
At the time , Google said that AOL remained a valued partner .

As the United Nations wrapped up the testimony gathering portion of its investigation into the Israeli war against the Gaza Strip , an Israeli human rights group today described the “ disgraceful ” treatment of some of the detainees held during the war .
The group reported that the Israeli military kept the detainees in ditches , handcuffed and blindfolded , with no access to food , water or restroom facilities .
The detainees were subjected to violent interrogations by Shin Bet , and their families were threatened .
Many are still being held with no access to their lawyers .
The Israeli government has declined to cooperate in any way with the probe , and abandoned its own probe despite several Israeli soldiers making serious accusations .
The official position is that the military acted appropriately and even admirably in the war and the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians .
All the human rights group reports which have accused them of war crimes have been condemned as unfair .
Despite the enormous evidence to support it , the UN team says it is “ too early ” to determine if Israel actually committed any war crimes during the war .
They are expected to submit a report sometime next month .
An Eyewitness Account of the “ Kerfuffle at Golden Pond Lane , ” March 21 , 2009
( This post was published on Playboy.com )
I was there when the so - called “ Class War ” went down .
I saw the whole thing happen , on a cul - de- sac called Golden Pond Lane .
Until now , no one has told the real story of what went on that warm spring day in Connecticut .
So I will .
Before I take you to that epic battle , bear with me for a brief digression –I promise it will pay off later .
I was born and raised a few miles away from what was known as “ The Serial Murderer Capital of the World ” –Santa Cruz , California circa early - mid-1970s .
At one point there were three major serial murderers working the same beach town ’s turf at once .
Which probably explains why I was an inveterate bedwetter until I was about five .
Over time serial killers lost their shock value and got absorbed into pop culture , while I learned to hold in my piss until I got out of bed .
Life returned to normal .
But one incident from that scene haunted me then , and still gives me bladder - spasms today .
It involved the most notorious of all the Santa Cruz serial killers , Edmund Kemper , an ogre - sized nerd who specialized in murdering hitchhiking hippie girls , chopping up their bodies and sodomizing the cuts .
One day Kemper picked up a young dance student named Aiko Koo , drove her into the woods , and pulled out a gun to terrify her .
It worked .
As Kemper later said , “ I pulled the gun out to show her I had it … she was freaking out .
Then I put the gun away and that had more effect on her than pulling it out . ”
Now here comes the really disturbing part : instead of killing her right then and there , Kemper put the gun down , stopped his car and got out , then closed and locked the door .
I repeat : Kemper locked himself out of the car .
With his gun inside , next to the girl .
He gave the victim a chance to save herself .
Guess what the girl did ?
She unlocked the door and let him back in .
As Kemper himself later explained , “ She could have reached over and grabbed the gun , but I think she never gave it a thought . ”
She never gave it a thought .
After she let him back in the car , Kemper went to work according to serial - killer script : he taped her mouth and squeezed her nose , suffocating her to death … yada - yada - yada .
The ol’ Freud Gone
Wild schtick , no surprises here , folks .
It ’s not the murder that ’s so horrifying , it ’s that she unlocked the door and let him back in .
That was us , “ the people , ” in the opening battle of the Great Class War a few weeks ago–right when we had our one chance to win , we went Aiko Koo .
Proving that she ’s the depressing norm , not the horrifying abberation .
You may have heard about the big Class War Showdown in the news last month : a group of protestors angry over AIG bonuses chartered a bus and toured the mansions where the AIG executives lived , going straight to their front doors .
With no intention of Christmas caroling or trick - or - treating .
No , this had class war written all over it .
And for the first time , the plutocrats were running scared .
Here ’s how the “ Battle of Golden Pond Lane ” unfolded : On Friday , March 20 - after a week of populist rage over news that Americans were funding obscene multimillion dollar bonuses to the same AIG multimillionaires who ruined our economy , word spread about an anti-AIG bus tour of the mansions of the company ’s execs , planned for March 21 .
The plan was to transform the bus into a kind of Class War Assault Vehicle , and steer it straight into the upper- class New England hamlet where all the AIG execs live : Fairfield , Connecticut .
It was like Stripes meets Spartacus , and I would n’t have missed it for the world .
The robbed would see exactly where the robbers lived , what their homes looked like , what their addresses were , where their front doors were located …
The bus tour was arranged by a quasi - socialist organization called Connecticut Working Families , a group with deep ties to the notorious ACORN group , the bogeyman of the Fox News bitter - cracker mob .
That was all the plutocrats had to hear : a busload of commies and ACORN panthers were heading into their neighborhood , like Mugabe ’s goons , to burn down their mansions .
For about 36 tense hours , suburban - New York ’s plutocrats felt like the Byzantine Christians in 1453 , with the barbarians just hours away from slaughtering and raping anything that moved in Fairfield , Connecticut .
In a panic , nine AIG execs announced that they were handing back their million - dollar bonuses to the American taxpayers .
It was incredible .
For the first time in living memory , “ the people ” were starting to win .
They had the power to instill fear and claw back some of their wealth .
And all because of the Magic Class - War Bus and its Angry Pranksters .
It was n’t easy getting a seat on the bus , and if I had n’t tracked down the cell phone number for Joe Dinkin , the communications director for the Connecticut Working Families Party which organized the bus tour , I probably would n’t have made it on board .
“ I ’ve been getting all kinds of death threats and crazy calls today ! ” Dinkin told me , laughing nervously .
“ Rush Limbaugh attacked us on his show today , and that got all his crazy fans after me .
They posted my cell phone number on Limbaugh ’s site , and ever since then it ’s just been crazy , the things these people said to me on the phone .
Death threats …
Man , the hatred in their voices is just crazy ! ”
Dinkin was laughing , but I do n’t think he knew just how ferocious a monster he ’d pissed off with his bus tour idea .
The next morning , I drove out to the AIG Bus Tour meeting point , which was the local ACORN office in the depressed center of Bridgeport , Connecticut–one of those decaying mid-sized cities that America quietly abandoned a few decades ago .
By the time I arrived that morning , the parking lot next to the Domino ’s pizza outlet was already crawling with media figures : reporters , cameramen and TV semi-celebrities .
There was no way we ’d all fit .
So when the chartered bus pulled up across the street from the Domino ’s outlet , the reporters bum - rushed it like Who concert fans .
It was an aggressively ugly bus : a belching , decrepit hulk with dented corrugated aluminum siding .
The perfect Country Club Assault Vehicle for terrorizing the upper-class plutocrats we were going to visit .
Poor Joe Dinkin was put in charge of the seating arrangement — the minute he stepped off the bus , the reporters nearly tore him limb from limb .
He dragged himself away from the bus door and down the street ; the reporters clung to him like lions pulling down a struggling wildebeest .
Joe tried to impose order as the reporters yelled out their organizations and why they had to be on the bus : New York Times , CNN , New York Post , NBC .
Poor Joe trembled so badly that all he could manage was to jot down a few chicken scratches on a piece of paper .
He quickly lost control , as the reporters turned back to the bus and tried storming it again .
Chaos ensued , and eventually the organizers realized that it was between the protesters being on the bus , or the media being on the bus .
So one by one , they started pulling protesters off the bus to make room for the media .
Eventually we — the media types — we all got our seats .
As we pulled out , one of the reporters ironically shouted , “ Where are the protesters on this bus ? ”
The bus erupted in cynical snickering .
We had n’t even set out from Bridgeport for the first big battle of the Class War , and already it was going badly .
The bus arrangement mirrored the same elitist structure that was supposedly being challenged : people who mattered were on the bus that mattered ; the nobodies were put into miserable minivans that followed behind us .
The charter bus slowly made its way from depressed working - class Bridgeport into Fairfield .
It was like the anti-Heart - of - Darkness , a journey from decrepit Bridgeport , up - river into the familiar world of sterile middle - class suburbia — and then deeper still , up - river to the socio- economic headwaters , a hamlet of unattainable luxury and civilization that we could only dream about .
We ’d gone from shit to champagne .
The reporters ’ sneering and quipping died down to a respectful hush as we slowly rolled past perfect , gleaming colonial mansions , with their grotesquely - vast front lawns and their perfectly - kept streets .
All of this divine luxury had a strange way of transforming the anger on our bus into something a lot more feckless : awe , and self - loathing .
We did n’t belong here , and we knew it .
Somehow it was our fault that we were in the drab bus , and they were in the shiny Lexus SUVs .
Hell , the fine residents of Fairfield only see buses like ours on the right lane of I -95 as they zoom to their Manhattan high - rises .
What was this ugly beast doing here , in Fairfield , mucking up the view ?
The remaining half - dozen protesters who were kept on the bus like protected species also felt this awe .
One of the protesters , Mark Dziubek , recently - downsized from a steel rolling mill , told me that even though he ’s spent his whole life in nearby Southington , he ’d only been through Fairfield once in his life .
Dziubek , a burly father of five , was the token white protester remaining on the bus .
He was already getting used to this life with the people who count , and did n’t relish the idea of going back to his life .
“ I ’m thinking that for my retraining , maybe learning to be a photographer , ” he told me .
“ Does it pay ? ”
I told him absolutely not , that it was an even more doomed - to - poverty profession than print journalism , which was also a guaranteed ticket to an early stroke - from - bitterness .
But you could see why Dziubek was impressed , with all the photographers snapping photos of him , the exhilarating sensation of suddenly counting .
The bus stopped and let us out at the corner of Mine Hill Road and Golden Pond Lane .
Last out of the bus were the showdown ’s two stars , both African - Americans .
One was a middle - aged pastor named Mary Huguley , and the other was Asaad Jackson , a 24 - year - old ex-boxer - turned - activist sporting dreadlocks down to his beltline .
They were going to confront the rich white AIG executive , Douglas Poling .
He was the one who took the largest bonus , $ 6.4 million .
Poling apparently was so unnerved by the unfolding scenario that he returned his bonus a day before we arrived , while Poling ’s fellow AIG exec neighbor up the street , James “ Jackpot Jimmy ” Hass , blubbered to reporters that he had also given back his multimillion - dollar bonus and could n’t people just look into their hearts and show him some mercy .
Huguley and Jackson deliberately and dramatically marched down Golden Pond Lane towards Poling ’s mansion , while about 50 members of the media elite jostled and swarmed around them like worker bees with the queen .
This scene unfolding was every American plutocrat ’s worst nightmare , once unimaginable , now a reality that could be viewed from Poling ’s second - story window :
Two poor , pissed - off blacks , surrounded by a phalanx of the liberal elite media , marching up to my hard - won mansion in broad daylight , banging on my front door , demanding a cut of my wealth .
On the deepest - plutocrat ’s - fears scale , Willie Horton rates about a 2 compared to this class - war nightmare .
Pastor Mary on Golden Pond Lane with the liberal media elite : Douglas Poling ’s worst nightmare come true
As we got closer to 177 Golden Pond Lane , we saw some uniformed policemen standing at the edge of the cul - de- sac with three healthy - looking white men in weekend sweatshirts and baseball caps , and two undercover cop cars — sporty SUVs — in the driveway of Poling ’s neighbor .
A regular Fairfield cop car slowly tailed our crowd from behind — just want to make sure nothing happens here , folks … .
Two menacing bodyguards patrolled Poling ’s front yard : a shaven - headed guy in business casual wear with a goatee and shades , who tried giving the impression of a relaxed , experienced veteran ; and a gorgeous Latino woman in a Ninja jumpsuit , who paced the lawn like a caged she - lion just begging for one of us lowlifes to stick our hand into her range , where she ’d tear it off with some jujitsu move .
Poling was apparently gone that day — I imagine he was scouting out citizenship opportunities in plutocrat - friendly autocracies like Kazakhstan or Liechtenstein .
Poling ’s security : the relaxed goateed dickhead , and the pacing ninja she - bitch
So here we were : the big Class War showdown .
Pastor Mary and Asaad Jackson gave the TV cameramen time to adjust their positions , then the mob moved forward right up to Poling ’s driveway .
This was it : we were at the North Bridge in Concord , at Harper ’s Ferry , at Sproul Plaza with the cop car surrounded … the moment when it could have broken into open warfare , the moment when others crossed the line they could never go back on .
It was amazing to think how vulnerable America ’s elite are : they do n’t use high walls and security fences and armed goons to guard their wealth , the way they do in so many countries .
Instead , they just rely on our sense of shame , something innate that tells us we do n’t belong here , we ’ll be leaving now , we ’re sorry …
This was the moment to smash that peasant sensibility .
We ’d already smashed through that barrier and found ourselves facing a robber - baron class that only bothered pitching two security goons against 50 or so of us , the Great Class War was about to begin , right here , on Golden Pond Lane .
The security goons blocked the two African - American protest leaders from delivering a symbolic letter to Poling ’s front door .
The protest leaders had been instructed not to confront the bodyguards or anyone , so they did n’t .
As reporters jostled for the money photo , the security goons started to threaten the rest of us if we so much as crossed over Poling ’s gutter .
Who was going to take that first step into the unknown ?
Who was going to violate a plutocrat ’s private property boundary ?
The goons were starting to feel confident , as it became clear that no one had the nerve to cross that line .
The tide was turning back their way .
And this was the moment when it all fizzled , the peasants melted back into the woods .
We had the gun , and we were in control — but right at that moment , we opened the door and let the Edmund Kemper plutocrats back into the car .
The security goons instructed Pastor Mary and Asaad to put their letter into Poling ’s mailbox .
Pastor Mary did .
Then she said some sort of prayer , and started walking back .
CNN asked what she thought of Poling ’s house , and she replied that the house was “ lovely . ”
And then we walked back to the bus .
What began as the promised opening shots in the Great Class War instead turned out to be something like a field trip for a high school civics class , with everyone learning the importance of being responsible .
The organizer , John Green , deemed it a success , and since then his group has never flirted with anything remotely as incendiary again .
By the time we got back , the news was already announcing the end of the Class War : “ Outrage Over Bonuses Wanes . ”
Congress backed off from its populist posturing , news pundits toned down their scripted outrage , and We , the People , returned to doing what small - “ w ” - we do best : getting screwed .
Just when we held our fates in our own hands , we went Aiko Koo : unlocked the door and handed the gun to the Kemper - crats .
We are nothing but fleshlights for the plutocrats to work themselves out on whenever they feel like it , and they know we pose as much threat to them as a hunk of soft rubber .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday backed away from his plan to raid local governments for $ 1.9 billion to help balance the state ’s books -- a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from municipal leaders and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle .
“ If both parties do n’t like to borrow from local government , then of course we wo n’t borrow from local government , ” Schwarzenegger said , answering an audience question after a budget speech in Escondido .
His spokesman later said the governor would drop his proposal only if state lawmakers agreed to other spending cuts to bridge the budget gap .
Members of the Legislature ’s bipartisan budget committee Friday criticized the idea of borrowing from local governments , saying it would exacerbate the state ’s long - term financial problems .
The $ 1.9 billion would have to be repaid with interest within three years .

“ I ’m not stuck with any of those ideas , ” Schwarzenegger said later .
“ What ’s important for us is that we solve . . . the $ 24 - billion deficit . ”
Los Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe said he was encouraged by the governor ’s comments , though not entirely relieved .
“ The reality is if they do n’t do it that way , they have to do it some other way , ” he said of the proposed cuts .
“ The question is now :
Where does it come from ?
We ’re still in a difficult position -- we ’re not worry - free . ”
Schwarzenegger said his finance department was already looking for ways to replace any borrowing from municipalities .
He said savings might be obtained by cutting foster care services or state employee health benefits , for example .
After unveiling the governor ’s May budget proposal , Schwarzenegger finance director Mike Genest said the administration had “ scraped the bottom of the barrel ” to find acceptable spending cuts .
That could make identifying new cuts , and selling them to the Democrat - dominated Legislature , particularly difficult .

Meanwhile Friday , some employees in the state Senate were bracing for the possibility of involuntary , unpaid furloughs four months after rank - and - file state workers were forced to stay home two days each month without pay .
The governor ordered the original furloughs but does not have that authority over the legislative branch .
According to an e-mail obtained by The Times , sent by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg ’s chief of staff to other top Senate aides , Republican and Democratic senators voted in closed - door caucuses this week to furlough staff earning more than $ 50,000 annually .
The e-mail says the goal is to save 5 % of workers ’ pay .
That equals roughly one furlough day a month .
In addition , dental and orthodontic benefits would be reduced .
And the Senate employees ’ vision care plan , which allows for two pairs of glasses each year , could be “ reduced from 2 to 1 pair of glasses , ” according to the e-mail .
No action has been taken yet , the e-mail states , and the Senate Rules Committee , which must approve such reductions , will not meet for two weeks .
The state Assembly has not furloughed its employees but is examining options for reducing expenses , said Jon Waldie , chief administrative officer of its rules committee .

The furloughs would be part of the Senate ’s attempt to slice 10 % from its budget -- and the Legislature ’s broader effort to close California ’s projected $ 24 - billion shortfall .
Tensions are running high in Sacramento .
The state faces a looming fiscal “ meltdown , ” according to state Controller John Chiang .
He released new projections this week showing that the state will run out of money by July 28 without quick action on spending cuts , higher taxes or a combination of both .
Schwarzenegger wants prompt action .
“ After June 15th , every day of inaction jeopardizes our state ’s solvency , ” he said Friday in Escondido .
Lawmakers on the budget committee pressed for a more deliberative approach , focusing on a July 1 deadline .

More backlash for Craigslist 's Erotic Services Tuesday , with Illlinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan demanding that the section be removed from the site .
More backlash for Craigslist 's Erotic Services Tuesday , with Illlinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan demanding that the section be removed from the site .
Madigan sent a letter to Craigslist Monday decrying what she deemed " the rampant prostitution and exploitation of women . "
She added that while the site agreed late last year to government - endorsed terms , it has n't yet fully upheld them .
" While there has been an approximately 40 percent decrease in daily postings , more than 400 ads are posted daily in Chicago alone , and the vast majority of ads blatantly violate even the most basic terms of use , " she wrote .
The call is just the latest in a series of outraged responses on the part of government officials , largely stemming from the recent so - called " Craigslist Killer . "
Phillip Markoff was arrested recently on charges that he murdered a young girl he met through a Craigslist ad .
Craigslist co-founder Craig Newmark told ABC News on Friday that he has no plans to shut down the Erotic Services section .
Last week , Craigslist made a tentative pledge to again update the security procedures surrounding its " Erotic Services " section , but announced no solid plans .
That announcement came after Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called on Craigslist to make specific changes to its Erotic Services section .
In November , Craigslist started requiring people who post ads on the " erotic services " section of the site to provide credit card verification and pay a fee .
In March , Sheriff Thomas J. Dart of Cook County , Illinois filed suit against Craigslist , accusing its owners of knowingly promoting and facilitating prostitution .
UPDATE : Craigslist responded to Madigan in a Wednesday blog post .
" We look forward to meeting with Attorney General Madigan to discuss progress made since our Joint Statement last November , and to hear any and all ideas she and others may have that could help reach our shared goal of eliminating illegal activity from Craigslist , while preserving all of the functionality and positive attributes that are currently enjoyed by the overwhelmingly law - abiding craigslist community of users . "

TEGUCIGALPA , Honduras ( CNN ) -- Honduran soldiers shot out the tires of buses headed for a demonstration in support of ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya , a video obtained by CNN shows .
This image from a cell phone video shows Honduran soldiers shooting out the tires of a bus .
The video , believed shot within the past two days , shows a line of buses stopped on a road in what is reported to be the city of Limones .
The city is about 70 miles ( 112 kilometers ) northeast of the capital , Tegucigalpa .
A noisy , chaotic crowd is milling around the buses while soldiers move among them .
Some slight pushing can be seen .
" The people united can never be defeated , " many crowd members chant in unison .
Gunfire is heard and the crowd grows quieter .
More shots are heard and then the video shows soldiers shooting out the tires on a yellow bus .
Air hissing from a tire can be heard and the video shows a flattened tire .
Watch the soldiers shoot the tires »
The recording was made on a phone camera by Zelaya supporter Oscar Baron and made available to CNN .
Another video of the same incident was posted on the Youtube Internet site Thursday under the title " Golpe de estado en Honduras " ( Coup in Honduras ) .
CNN reporters in Honduras have received reports from Zelaya supporters who say troops have stopped buses bringing protesters from the countryside to prevent them from attending rallies in Tegucigalpa .
Honduran military officials said they were unaware of any such incidents .
" I have not been informed of this incident .
I cannot confirm or deny it , " Honduran Army spokesman Col. Ramiro Archaga told CNN by phone .
The military 's main job is to protect the nation 's borders , Archaga said , " not guaranteeing internal security . "
Hector Ivan Mejia , spokesman for the Security Ministry , said he had no information of buses being fired upon .
" Protesters will be arrested for vandalic acts but they will not simply be stopped on their way to protests , " Mejia said .
The military removed Zelaya from power Sunday and flew him to nearby Costa Rica .
Congressional leader Roberto Micheletti was sworn in that afternoon as interim president .
Pro-Zelaya protesters have skirmished with troops in some parts of Tegucigalpa , but the incidents have received little mention from Honduran TV stations .
Instead , the stations have given wide coverage to large demonstrations in support of Micheletti .
The United Nations and the Organization of American States have condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated .
The United States and most countries in Latin America also have criticized the coup .
The United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid and many nations have recalled their ambassadors from Honduras .
In an emergency meeting late Tuesday , the OAS gave Honduras 72 hours to reinstate Zelaya or face suspension from the 35 - nation hemispheric organization .
That deadline expires Saturday and the OAS has scheduled a 1 p.m. meeting to discuss the situation .
OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza arrived Friday afternoon in Honduras to notify " stakeholders " of the terms of the resolution , the organization said .
Zelaya , a leftist who took office in 2006 , has said he will return to Honduras after Saturday 's deadline .
Micheletti said Zelaya would be arrested if he returns .
At the center of the dispute was a referendum Zelaya had vowed to carry out even after the country 's supreme court and congress found it illegal .
The nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country 's charter to allow the president to run for re-election .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Zelaya ally , won a similar referendum this year and many Hondurans thought Zelaya was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in November .
Zelaya has denied that was his intent .
Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio " Pepe " Lobo .
After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule , Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981 .
Since then , the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people , about 70 percent of whom live in poverty .
Military interventions were once common in Latin America , but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s .
Before Sunday , the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez , when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement .

Personally , I wo n't change my signature this way .
For now :)
I actually tried the same thing after reading " Google Apps : The Missing Manual " last year but forgot to post about it !
[ Reposted from FF ]
It ignores it if it's in the signature .
I tried writing " This Sentence is to murder the ads in Gmail " but it only worked if it was in the main part of the message ( above the --)
Fuuny . :)
But why people who send e-mails would do this , to prevent recipients from seeing ads besides their e-mails ?
Never hear of Ad Block ?
Adblock Plus is better and keeps your mental health :)
Zim
How much would you pay to use Gmail ?

Google gets tons of value just from having access to the data .
So if you 're suggesting the service has to make money somehow , no , it does n't .
What can I do to remove the ad at the bottom of this page ?
Or is it only wrong when someone else makes money off of online advertising ?
I kinda feel bad using Safari AdBlock .
I might disable it for Blogoscoped .
Lex
Everyone is used to seeing ads on the internet , and everyone is used to ignoring them .
The difference is that google is more intrusive and Jerome is using that against them to disable the ad feature .
Less anger at ads and more excitement over the hack ... or at least that is my interpretation .
The Seasteading Institute , committed to the ongoing development of ocean communities , has just announced the winners of their first annual design content .
Could people really end up living in these hypothetical off - shore communities ?

The design contest had five categories : Overall , Best Picture , Aesthetics , Personality , and Community Choice .
( The winners from each category are shown in this post in that particular order , so the first design up top is the Overall winner , the one to the right is Best Picture , and so on . )
With prizes ranging from $ 250 to $ 1000 , the design contest attracted both amateur and professional architects from around the world , as the winners hailed from such far - flung locales as Estonia , Hungary , Brazil , and Minnesota .

Seasteading , a term derived from combining " sea " and " homesteading " , is a general term given to the notion of either converting existing structures , such as old boats or disused oil rigs , or custom - building new ones to allow people to live in the middle of the ocean .
Generally , this also includes the interrelated goal of establishing a sovereign state on the open seas , away from any existing governmental structures on dry land .
Patri Friedman and Wayne Gramlich - whose 1998 article " Seasteading – Homesteading on the High Seas " is generally given credit for popularizing the term - founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008 in order to better organize the seasteading effort .
Perhaps the most famous - and , to some extent , the only - example of successful seasteading is the microstate of Sealand , which started life as the World War II sea fort HM Fort Roughs .
Located six miles off the coast of Suffolk , Sealand was occupied by Roy Bates and his family in 1967 .
Crowning himself Prince Roy , Bates declared the disused fort to be the independent Principality of Sealand .
Although the " country " is only the size of about two tennis courts , the Bates family has lived on the desolate fort for much of the last four decades .
As one might well imagine , Sealand 's history is about as eccentric as it origins , including an attempted invasion by a group of German and Dutch entrepreneurs in 1978 , which forced the exiled Prince Roy to take up arms to reclaim his country .
( How that has n't become a movie yet is completely beyond me . )

Sealand 's story is well worth reading up on , as it's just about the only topic I know of that can make the differences between de jure and de facto diplomatic recognition absolutely fascinating .
Still , the question remains what , if any , long - term viability seasteading has .
The success of the Bates family at least suggests it 's possible to exist out on the open sea with limited government oversight ( although the British government did still handle all the mail sent to Sealand ) , and the Seasteading Institute has raised over 500,000 dollars in support of their work .
Of course , whether that would be enough to build even a fraction of any of these designs is an open question .
In the meantime , at least we can take some small comfort in the fact that , should Waterworld ever prove terrifyingly realistic , at least a few people will be well prepared .

Here in the UK , the schools have broken up for their summer holidays .
That means the roads will be less busy , the weather will get worse ( always does ! ) and the airports will go on strike and there will delay after delay after delay , as thousands of families will be holidaying .
Are you holidaying this summer ?
We are .
My wife and I are off to somewhere real nice .
My wife and I celebrate our 25 years of marriage this year and we are flying off to an exotic secret location !
We are leaving our ‘ adult children ’ in charge .
I just hope the house is still here when we get back !
So how do us bloggers keep our sites active while on holiday ?
Well , I ’m taking my laptop with me and I shall be blogging from the exotic location .
Do n’t tell my wife – I have yet to tell her !
Only kidding .
Of course I ’m not going to take my laptop , I shall use the local internet cafes each day and keep everything nice and active .
Save me lugging the laptop with me .
Yes , I am kidding again !
You do n’t have to take your laptop , you do n’t have to visit the local internet cafes … if you plan and prepare in advance .
Your blog posts
You do have to write them before you go on holiday .
You can not get away with that one .
So a little extra effort up front and write the number of blog postings you want published while you are away .
Then when you enter the blog post , with the wordpress time stamp you can decide when you ’d like it posted .
Just edit the date and WordPress does the rest .
Simple .
Plugin Updates
While you are away , there will be updates to certain plugins .
It does n’t matter .
None of them will be urgent and you can simply update them on your return .
The same goes for any WordPress updates .
Twitter
By having the Twitter Tools plugin installed , when your pre-published posts are actually posted , you can have them automatically announced on Twitter .
Comments
Before a comment appears on my blog , the “ comment author ” must have a previously approved comment ( WordPress settings in “ Discussion ” ) , so comments from ‘ approved ’ individuals will continue to appear .
New “ commentors ” will have to wait for my return for me to approve .
I could just let Akismet do it ’s stuff but sometimes ‘ spam ’ comments still get through and I ’d rather wait until I return and approve any new “ commentors ” .
Contact and Emails
I get quite a few emails either directly or via the ‘ contact ’ section of my blog .
Any that come through while I am on holiday will have to wait until I return .
When I reply I shall explain why it has taken a while for me to respond .
So that ’s what I do while I am on holiday and no one needs to know that you are really away .
What do you do to keep your blog active while you are away ?
What tips do you have ?
Dow Chemical and Algenol Biofuels , a start - up company , are set to announce Monday that they will build a demonstration plant that , if successful , would use algae to turn carbon dioxide into ethanol as a vehicle fuel or an ingredient in plastics .
Because algae does not require any farmland or much space , many energy companies are trying to use it to make commercial quantities of hydrocarbons for fuel and chemicals .
But harvesting the hydrocarbons has proved difficult so far .
The ethanol would be sold as fuel , the companies said , but Dow ’s long - term interest is in using it as an ingredient for plastics , replacing natural gas .
The process also produces oxygen , which could be used to burn coal in a power plant cleanly , said Paul Woods , chief executive of Algenol , which is based in Bonita Springs , Fla .
The exhaust from such a plant would be mostly carbon dioxide , which could be reused to make more algae .
“ We give them the oxygen , we get very pure carbon dioxide , and the output is very cheap ethanol , ” said Mr. Woods , who said the target price was $ 1 a gallon .
Despite the ballyhoo of the recent Aipac national policy conference in Washington , when Israel - US bonds were feted , relations between the two countries are currently more strained than at any time since 1991 .
That was when the elder George Bush , as US president , fiercely lobbied Yitzchak Shamir to join in the Madrid peace conference .
Relations then reached their nadir when James Baker uttered his infamous remark about Israel 's American - Jewish supporters : " Fuck the Jews , they do n't even vote for us . "
If relations continue to deteriorate in coming months , we might have to go back in time to the Suez crisis of 1956 to find a time when relations were this fraught .
A case in point is Iran .
That bogey - nation was everywhere at the Aipac conference .
Every keynote speech – if they were n't directly written by that group 's staff – seemed unmistakably scripted and " on message " , dedicated to the existential threat that Iran poses not just to Israel , but the entire world .
A glossy brochure distributed at the Aipac meeting showed a map ( pictured below ) centred on Iran and beyond , with a dark ominous ring around Iran 's neighbours and as far away as India , Russia , Africa and eastern Europe .
The message : these are the countries under imminent threat of Iranian ballistic missiles .
A map contained in a brochure distributed at an Aipac meeting
The brochure copy even intimates that the next step for Iran is " building a missile with range to reach US territory " .
( Never mind that Iran does n't yet have any ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear weapon , nor will it have the bomb itself for anywhere from a year to five years depending on which you source you choose to believe . )
Israel is in the midst of a massive diplomatic , political and intelligence campaign , both public and covert , that could lead – if those officials behind it have their way – towards a military strike on Iran .
It is a war for the hearts and minds of Americans .
Or you might call it the war before the war .
In intelligence circles , this Israeli project is known as perception management and defined by the department of defence as :
Actions to convey and / or deny information … to foreign audiences to influence their emotions , motives and objective reasoning as well as to intelligence systems and leaders … ultimately resulting in foreign behaviours and official actions favourable to [ US ] objectives .
In various ways , perception management combines truth projection , operations security , cover and deception and psychological operations .
The Israelis are following the template of the Bush administration 's run-up to the Iraq war .
First , the US government advocated half - hearted efforts at diplomatic engagement .
Then it ratcheted up pressure through sanctions and UN resolutions .
That is where the Israeli campaign stands now .
Aipac 's members carried a unified message to Capitol Hill during their lobbying of US senators and members of Congress .
They demanded that Congress pass the most draconian sanctions ever proposed against Iran .
They demanded that Iran be offered a limited time in which to respond to an ultimatum insisting it drop its nuclear programme .
What then ?
If you review Aipac 's literature and the various commentaries published either by Israeli diplomats or their supporters in the US media , they do n't specify what comes next .
But any sensible person can guess that the final step will be war : " Israeli leaders have … hinted at pre-emptive military strikes if they decide that diplomacy has failed . "
The Israelis surely know that the Obama administration will never go to war against Iran .
In fact , they know that Obama would not approve of Israel doing so .
But I 've become convinced , in doing the research and speaking to knowledgeable sources , that Israel is prepared at some date in the near future to attack Iran itself , even against the wishes of the US .
This of course will put Obama in an untenable position : do US forces attack the Israelis ( in effect defending the Iranians ) and risk the fallout that would occur in relations between the Democratic administration and American Jews ?
Or does he allow the Israelis to carry on to their targets and bomb Iran , accepting the bloodletting and mayhem that will inevitably result ?
If Israel wishes for the latter outcome , they must lay the groundwork here in the US for tacit acceptance by the American people of a third - party attack on Iran .
Indeed , they are already a good deal of the way toward this goal , as the latest polling from Rasmussen Report reveals .
According to it , 49 % of Americans believe that if Israel attacks Iran then the US should help Israel .
Some readers may say this is alarmist .
Before I learned some of the information I gathered from sources both public and not , I also would have labelled this as overly dramatic .
But Israel has n't shrunk , for example , from drafting opinion columns for US newspapers on the menace posed by Iran , and telling the editor that a local Jewish community leader would be attaching his name to it .
Within the US Israel exploits a willing circle of Likudist advocacy groups and thinktanks – such as the Washington Institute for Near East Peace , the Israel Project , the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs as well as Aipac itself – that are closely scripted and co-ordinate their political message with Israeli diplomats .
While some of these groups deny such a close affiliation , there is proof of scripting and amplification of the Israeli government 's agenda .
And of course there may be cases in which the organisations know the needs of their patron so well that they need no prompting .
In another example , Israeli diplomats monitored and encouraged a member of Congress to host an anti-Iranian conference that would advocate Israel 's message of sanctions ( and more ) .
Israel , along with enablers like Aipac , has not shrunk from hounding its critics .
One peace activist in the US so angered Israeli authorities that he was driven from a job through a whispering campaign in the community , which also included a disparaging article leaked to a willing reporter .
The level of hubris necessary to pull this off is astonishing .
Fresh off the dismissal of the Rosen - Weissman spy charges involving its own employees , Aipac is flexing its political muscle and reminding the world of its resurgence .
It does this through a combination of manipulation , public lobbying and punishment of its enemies .
We in the US must be prepared to resist .
We must protect ourselves from Israel 's propaganda offensive ginning up war with Iran .
We must encourage President Obama to stay strong in his commitment to Israeli - Arab peace , whether or not Israel is a willing partner .
Keeping our eyes on the prize of peace is going to be the hardest challenge of all , because the Netanyahu government is doing everything it can to divert the world 's attention .
In this post I ’d like to say what a P - partition is , what a Gorenstein ring is , and plan to discuss a chain of topics which will lead from one to the other .
Roughly the first half of this post can be found in Section 4.5 of Richard Stanley ’s Enumerative Combinatorics , Vol 1 .
First , let ’s start with P - partitions .
Here P is a finite poset with p elements .
The standard definition of partition is of course a way of decomposing a positive number into a sum of positive numbers , i.e. , 5 = 1 + 3 + 1 .
Since we do n’t care about the order , we just list them in descending order , so the example becomes ( 3,1,1 ) .
Another way to interpret this is in terms of posets : let [ m ] be the usual ordering on the set { 1 , 2 , … , m} .
Then a partition of n using at most m parts is the same as an order - reversing map , where is the natural numbers ( including 0 ) under the usual order , such that .
Now replace [ m ] with an arbitrary partition P and we can talk about P - partitions .
Also , we ’ll say that a P - partition is strict if from before is strictly order - reversing .
Given a poset P , let a ( n ) , resp . , be the number of P - partitions , resp .
strict P - partitions of n , and define the generating functions and .
I ’ll note two facts : as rational functions , we have
where is a polynomial of degree strictly less than , so that is a quasi-polynomial .
Second , we have a reciprocity law :
,
and this implies that , where a( - n ) makes sense since it is a quasi-polynomial .
There is a refinement of this reciprocity which I wo n’t mention .
Here ’s another way to think of P - partitions : think of them as points inside of .
But not just any points : the order - reversing requirement gives some linear inequalities , so they live in some rational cone .
Then a (n ) is the number of lattice points of this cone with the intersection of the hyperplane .
These intersections will be polytopes , but in general not ones with integer vertices .
But there is a way to get integral polytopes .
Instead of P - partitions of n , let be the number of P - partitions such that for all x in P .
This is the order polynomial of P ( it ’s not that bad to show that it is indeed a polynomial ) .
Similarly , let be the number of strict P - partitions such that for all x in P .
Then we can interpret as the number of lattice points in with inequalities and for all inequalities in P .
This is a polytope O ( P , n ) ( called the order polytope of P ) , and in fact , it will have integral vertices .
We can even describe what they are : define a filter F of P to be subset such that if and y is in F , then so is x .
Then each vertex is where F is a filter .
Then the integer points in O ( P ,n ) are in bijection with order - preserving maps , which are in turn in bijection with order - reversing maps .
In this case , the order polynomial is a special case of the Ehrhart polynomial of a polytope O ( P ) = O ( P,2 ) .
Since counts the interior points of O ( P , n+1 ) , reciprocity for Ehrhart polynomials implies that .
Well now that we have an integral polytope , we also get a toric variety .
This is the projective variety corresponding to the Ehrhart ring , which is defined as follows .
Given an integral polytope and a field K , let K [ Q ] be the K - vector space with basis elements corresponding to integer points , where dP is the dth dilation of Q .
These are multiplied just like monomials are multiplied , and we grade K [ Q ] by the degree of z .
Then by definition , the Hilbert function of K[ Q ] is the Ehrhart polynomial of Q .
Now let ’s give some properties of the order polynomial of P which might tell us some information about the Ehrhart ring K [ O ( P ) ] ( and its toric variety ) .
First , let L be the length of the longest chain of P .
Then for .
We say that P is graded if for any given elements x and y , all maximal chains between x and y have the same length .
Then P is graded if and only if for all m .
We can see this as saying that the number of interior integer points of O ( P , L+m ) is the same as the number of integer points of O ( P , m ) for all m .
Combined with the vanishing statements , this is also equivalent to saying that when we write the generating function as a rational function , then the numerator polynomial has palindromic coefficients .
Since this is the Hilbert series of K [ O ( P,2 ) ] , we now mention
Theorem ( Stanley ) .
If R is a Cohen–Macaulay domain over a field K , then R is Gorenstein if and only if the numerator polynomial of its Hilbert series has palindromic coefficients .
A proof can be found in Stanley ’s paper Hilbert functions of graded algebras , along with other interplay between numerical conditions of Hilbert series and properties of the ring .
So I ’ve fulfilled my promise of connecting the two topics in the title , but I need to say what a Gorenstein ring is !
The significance comes from Serre duality .
We ’ll give a geometric definition first .
For a variety X of dimension n , X is Gorenstein if the canonical bundle is a line bundle , where is the cotangent bundle of X .
Of course , X nonsingular implies that X is Gorenstein .
For a finitely generated domain over K , we say it is Gorenstein if its corresponding affine variety is Gorenstein .
Chasing through all of the above , we have conclude that if P is a graded poset , then the affine cone of the toric variety associated to its order polytope ( this means the affine variety of K [ O ( P ) ] forgetting that its graded ) is Gorenstein ( what a mouthful ! ) .
In other words , the toric variety is arithmetically Gorenstein ( this implies that it ’s Gorenstein also ) .
Now an algebraic definition says that a local K - algebra R of dimension n is Gorenstein if and only if is 0 for , and is K for i=n .
And then a ring is Gorenstein if all of its localizations are Gorenstein .
There ’s a lot more equivalent definitions , which you can find on the wiki article .
Finally , here ’s something which connects to my previous posts on Boij–Söderberg theory .
If is Gorenstein where I is a homogeneous ideal , then the graded Betti table exhibits symmetry ( we may have to assume that I is prime , but I ’m not sure ) .
To be more precise , if we write the table with the convention that is the rank of the ith syzygy module in degree - i-j , and the table has c+1 columns and r+1 rows , then ( assuming that the top left corner is entry ( 0,0 ) ) .
In fact , this is another characterization .
And now we have a lot of examples of symmetric Betti tables !

IN the debate over health care reform , one issue looms large : whether to have a public option .
Should all Americans have the opportunity to sign up for government - run health insurance ?
President Obama has made his own preferences clear .
In a letter to Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Max Baucus of Montana , the chairmen of two key Senate committees , he wrote : “ I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating alongside private plans .
This will give them a better range of choices , make the health care market more competitive , and keep insurance companies honest . ”
Even if one accepts the president ’s broader goals of wider access to health care and cost containment , his economic logic regarding the public option is hard to follow .
Consumer choice and honest competition are indeed the foundation of a successful market system , but they are usually achieved without a public provider .
We do n’t need government - run grocery stores or government - run gas stations to ensure that Americans can buy food and fuel at reasonable prices .
An important question about any public provider of health insurance is whether it would have access to taxpayer funds .
If not , the public plan would have to stand on its own financially , as private plans do , covering all expenses with premiums from those who signed up for it .
Virgin Media is to launch an unlimited music download subscription service in partnership with Universal Music , home to artists including Amy Winehouse , U2 , Kanye West and Elton John .
The initiative is aiming to respond to communications minister Lord Carter 's expected call in tomorrow 's Digital Britain report for more attractive alternatives to illegal downloading .
Virgin Media 's as - yet - unnamed service , which includes a deal with Universal to look at measures such as a " temporary suspension " of internet access for illegal downloaders on the cable operator 's network , will launch by the end of the year .
The company , which hopes the service will bring about a " rapid and permanent change " in music habits in the UK , is in talks with other major music labels about expanding the service ahead of its official launch .
Today 's announcement comes on the eve of the publication of Lord Carter 's Digital Britain report , which is expected to contain more stringent measures to tackle illegal downloading of music , films and TV shows .
Carter , the communications minister who will leave the government next month after presenting his final Digital Britain report , has called for a joined - up approach to tackling illegal downloaders involving internet service providers cracking down on heavy offenders .
He has also called for the development , with rights owners , of new e-music models to entice consumers away from illegal sites .
" Government has a role in creating the right legal and regulatory framework for rights and copyright , " said Carter .
" However , the market will flourish through innovative commercial agreements between companies , and agreements such as this will help significantly in reducing any demand for piracy . "
Virgin Media believes the service will prove popular because it will offer an " all you can eat " service for a monthly fee , in which the music can be streamed or downloaded on to any device by members and kept permanently .
Rival online music store iTunes currently charges on a per-track or per-album basis .
The proposed monthly pricing structure of the new Virgin Media downloads service has not been revealed .
But the company is thought to be looking at charging at a level roughly the cost of purchasing " a couple of albums a month " .
This would put a monthly subscription at about £ 15 .
An " entry level " offering will also be made available for customers who download music regularly but may not want an unlimited offering .
" Virgin Media 's agreement with Universal is a world first and lays the ground for a truly unique service when it launches later this year , " said Richard Branson , the chairman of Virgin Group and a shareholder in Virgin Media .
" It will give music fans all the MP3s they want for a small monthly fee whilst supporting the artists whose creativity is the lifeblood of music . "
In addition Universal Music and Virgin Media say they will work together to protect the music company 's intellectual property to " drive a material reduction in the unauthorised distribution of [ Universal 's ] repertoire across Virgin Media 's network " .
This will include raising awareness of online piracy , legal downloading alternatives and , as a last resort for " persistent offenders " , a temporary suspension of internet access .
Suspension of service could be for as little as five minutes .
" No customers will be permanently disconnected and the process will not depend on network monitoring or interception of customer traffic by Virgin Media , " the company said .

Twitter is all the rage since the publicity that followed both the Kutcher / CNN race for followers , and Oprah ’s first twitter that was all capital letters – a big no -no on the Web .
Even before that though one of the most popular thing to do was to create some business based on or around Twitter .
Such is the case with StatTweets which used the Twitter service to provide stats of everything from college hoops games to just plain interesting stats .
In the intervening months from when the first StatTweets account was created until now the main account has gained 63,000 followers .
This is n’t taking into account all the sports team oriented accounts it also used to keep folks informed about their favorite teams .
All was good up until two weeks ago when all of a sudden Robbie , the gentleman behind StatSheets.com , found that all but two of the accounts on Twitter used by StatTweets had been suspended .
In the response to his enquiry to Twitter support as to the what was wrong he got a reply that said the accounts had been suspended for the following reasons
1. Copyright infringement 2 . Mass account creation 3 . Squatting
In his post today Robbie addresses each of the points raised by Twitter and acknowledges that while they might be right about the second , but questioned why his services were centered out when others like BuzzTap was n’t , but as far as the other two reasons were just ridiculous .
He ends his post with a general warning to anyone thinking of trying to build anything around Twitter
I waited semi-patiently for 2 weeks in the hopes that Twitter would come around , but @ Caroline and @ Crystal ( Twitter Support ) have been unresponsive other than a couple of form responses .
I ’m sure now that Twitter is post - Oprah , my request is at the bottom of the priority queue .
But are n’t they biting the hand that feeds them ?
I ’m providing a unique information service on Twitter and they shut me down without so much as a warning .
To make it worse , they have n’t even responded to my repeated inquiries .
This does n’t bode well for other businesses that are trying to use Twitter .
We are all at the whim of a Twitter Support person ’s interpretation of how you are using your accounts and how that complies with their TOS .
I ’ve been saying much the same thing for sometime both here at The Inquisitr as well as my own personal blog .
By depending on the whims of a business that itself has no publically announced business model you are leaving yourself open to situations your business could be working one day and then gone the next .
Not a good way to do business no matter how you look at it .
A cleaner at the Myer department store in Melbourne 's CBD has had a lucky escape after he was bitten on the finger by one of the world 's deadliest snakes , which remains on the loose in the city .
The 29 - year old man was throwing rubbish in a dumpster in a laneway outside the Lonsdale Street store when he felt something sharp on his finger .
He pulled out his hand and found a snake about 20 centimetres long dangling from his finger , said Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Bentley .
The man was taken to St Vincent 's Hospital , where a swab test confirmed he had been bitten by a brown snake , one of the deadliest snakes in the world and the leading cause of snakebite deaths in Australia .
A bit of sour news Thursday -- in the form of increased jobless benefit claims and higher wholesale prices -- suggested the economy was moving in fits and starts even as the recession eases .
Analysts said the pace of unemployment claims should ease after auto industry layoffs are completed .
Inflation , meanwhile , remains under control , and any threat of a dangerous bout of falling prices seems remote .
The number of new jobless claims last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 637,000 , from a revised 605,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said .
That exceeded analysts ’ expectations of 610,000 .
Economists noted that initial claims remained below a peak reached in late March -- a sign that the wave of mass layoffs announced earlier this year probably has crested .

“ This is yet more evidence that we are now past the worst , ” Paul Dales , U.S. economist at Capital Economics , wrote in a research note .
Separately , the department said wholesale prices climbed 0.3 % last month , larger than the 0.1 % gain economists had expected .
The biggest jump in food costs in more than a year offset a second monthly decline in the price of energy products .
A 43.7 % jump in egg prices helped drive food costs higher .
The increase , the largest on records dating to 1992 , was partly a one - time blip , because Easter occurred in April , Labor Department economist Scott Sager said .
The same dynamic drove pork prices up 2.5 % .
The overall 1.5 % increase in food costs also represents a leveling off after food prices fell in four of the previous five months , economists said .

Even with the larger - than - expected gain in the producer price index , wholesale prices over the last year have dropped 3.7 % .
That ’s the biggest 12 - month decline since 1950 .
ATHENS  On Monday morning , forklifts nosed through a sprawl of antiquities in the second - floor gallery of the New Acropolis Museum here , bearing marble statues and steles .
Technicians tugged at bulky black cables , laborers drilled and welded , and a cleaning crew  many of its members working on hands and knees  scraped mounds of white plaster off the floor .
“ My apologies , ” said Antonis Samaras , Greece ’s culture minister , who was overseeing the final preparations for the museum ’s debut on Saturday .
“ But it ’s like the Olympics , ” he added , referring to the 2004 Athens Games .
“ Everything will magically come together on opening night . ”
If it does , Greece will finally , after decades of preparation , procrastination and acrimonious debate , have a large - scale , architecturally ambitious and modern center for the care and display of artifacts from its most important ancient site .
The museum , which cost $ 200 million and sits near the base of the Acropolis with a direct view of the Parthenon , is one of the highest - profile cultural projects undertaken in Europe in this decade .
Intended as “ the ultimate showcase of classical civilization , ” Mr. Samaras said , it was built to promote tourism and , like any large , government - financed museum , to stir national pride .
But it was also meant , not incidentally , to spark discomfort in another country in the European Union .
No single age group is faring well during the recession .
That 's for sure .
Employment experts agree that record unemployment is affecting all age demographics .
But data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that some age groups are being hit harder by unemployment than others .
In fact , workers age 25 to 34 may be bearing the brunt of layoffs and hiring freezes .
Consider the following statistics :
Unemployment is highest for 25 - to 34 - year - olds .
It 's at 10.5 percent , 1.1 percent higher than the national average .
The 25 - to 34 - year - old age bracket has the most people unemployed of all age brackets -- 3.5 million people are out of jobs .
Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , the unemployment rate for 25 - to 34 - year olds has more than doubled , from 4.8 percent to 10.5 percent .
Meanwhile , employment has steadily declined for 25 to 34 - year - olds each month since the start of the year .
Workers age 25 to 34 have the lowest level of employment next to workers 55 years of age and older .
Workers age 25 to 34 have experienced 4.5 million job losses since May 2008 , the most job losses of all age groups .
25 - to 34 - year - olds make up the largest group of underemployed workers .
More than 2 million 25 - to 34 - year - olds are working part - time jobs because they can't find full - time jobs or because their hours have been cut — which is more than any other age group .

John Challenger , CEO of global outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. , says unemployment may be hitting younger workers hardest because of their perceived inexperience .
" In an environment where companies are very thinly staffed , employers need people who can perform multiple tasks , multiple roles , " says Challenger .
" Younger workers in this environment may get marked down in the hiring process for not having enough experience .
Companies may be opting for someone they know can hit the ground running and who they wo n't have to train on the job . "
Another reason why unemployment may be so high among workers age 25 to 34 is because they may have short tenures with their employers and because a lot of employers use a " last one hired , first one fired " method for determining who to cut in a layoff , adds Challenger .
The same reasoning around tenure explains why unemployment rates are considerably lower for older workers .
" Many older workers have acquired more job tenure with their employer , and therefore , may be less likely to be laid off than younger workers , " notes Steve Hipple , an economist in the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Division of Labor Force Statistics , via e-mail .
Sara Rix , strategic policy advisor with the AARP 's Public Policy Institute , says unemployment rates for older workers have historically been lower than younger workers .
" The major reason older workers have a lower unemployment rate is because they 're more likely than their younger counterparts to drop out of the labor force [ if they can't find a job ] , " says Rix .
" When that happens , they 're not counted as unemployed . "
Unemployment may also be higher among younger workers because they 're not protected from age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( ADEA ) , whereas workers over 40 are .
" Perhaps some employers are less likely to dismiss older workers out of fear of age discrimination lawsuits , " notes Hipple .
The good news for younger workers is that they 're less likely than older workers to be unemployed for long periods of time .
They have the lowest rates of long - term unemployment ( unemployed for 27 weeks or more ) .
Older workers age 55 and up are most likely to be unemployed the longest and experience the highest rates of long - term unemployment , according to the BLS data .

With more than 1.4 million students attending charter schools and 426 new charters opening this school year , the charter movement is gaining momentum .
Are small , independent schools the future of publicly financed education ?
What is a charter school ?
It ’s an independently run public school that ’s been freed of the usual school district rules .
Some charters are started with an assist from local school districts , but most are launched by independent groups seeking to challenge the local education bureaucracy with new ideas and curricula .
Charter schools claim higher standards — and ambitions — than ordinary public schools , and are n’t bound by union rules on teacher tenure , assignments , and hours .
There are currently 4,600 charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia , educating about 3 percent of public school students in the U.S .
What ’s the point ?
To improve schooling — especially for students in low - income , low - performing school districts .
The quality of U.S. public education has been a source of growing concern in recent decades .
Internationally , U.S. students rank 25th in math proficiency and 15th in reading .
In some major American cities , including Washington , D.C. , whole school districts are failing .
By breaking out of the standard school mold , and providing real competition , supporters hope to lead a revolution in school quality .
How effective are charter schools ?
Some produce students with higher test scores than regular public schools , and some do not ; it ’s hard to draw any blanket conclusion , and there is much disagreement about how to compare public and charter school students .
Critics complain that charter schools cherry - pick the most promising students ; in addition , parents who choose charter schools are by definition committed to their kids ’ education , giving these students another big edge .
So are better test scores at some charter schools proof of better schooling , or simply a reflection of the fact that students arrive with more motivation and parental support ?
Charter school advocates , though , point out that 60 percent of charter students are minorities , most are poor , and many are refugees from dysfunctional public schools .
Perhaps that ’s why a 2006 Department of Education report actually found charter students performing , on average , slightly below those in regular public schools .
So why bother ?
Because some charter schools truly do excel .
Students at KIPP schools ( see below ) , for instance , generally achieve far superior test scores .
Tens of thousands of families are on waiting lists to get their children into charter schools , an expression of popular demand that supporters contend speaks for itself .
What ’s more , charters have attracted a powerful following despite the fact that , on average , charters receive only 78 percent of the funding that traditional public schools receive .
“ Our students want to be here , and we have institutionalized the notion of high expectations , ” said Ernie Harper , acting school leader of Freedom Academy Charter School in Camden , N.J .
Is n’t that true of all charter schools ?
Yes , but success requires extraordinary commitment from administrators , teachers , parents , and students .
At the Harlem Children ’s Zone in New York , the school day is 10 hours long , classes are held on Saturdays , and the school year extends into August .
After New York ’s public housing authority transferred Altheo Serrao and her three children from Manhattan to a project on Staten Island , she and the children began commuting two hours each way so they could continue at the Children ’s Zone .
“ This is not something I ’m willing to give up , ” Serrao said .
At her local public school , she said , the children are “ expected to fail . ”
Do some charter schools have problems ?
Yes — the lack of oversight can lead to trouble .
A charter school in Philadelphia is under investigation because the school ’s operator hired family members and routinely made school purchases from companies he owned .
Another Philadelphia charter school is under investigation for its high administration expenses , including millions of dollars paid in rent , management fees , and salaries to a single for - profit company .
Nationwide , more than 12 percent of charters opened since 1992 have failed , many because of improprieties .
But charter school advocates , eager to break up the public school monopoly , oppose more regulation , and a high - stakes battle is now under way between pro-charter reformers and teachers ’ unions and public school administrators .
The 3.2 million­–member National Education Association , the largest union in the nation , says that reformers have a conservative political agenda to drain public schools of funds .
Reformers counter that the unions are more interested in easy workloads , permanent jobs , and hefty pensions than in making sure children are educated .
Which side is President Obama on ?
Apparently , both .
As a Democrat , the president is generally allied with unions , which have generally been opposed to charters .
But Obama ’s relationship with the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers is not especially warm .
AFT members booed him at a 2007 union event when he advocated merit pay for teachers , and neither the AFT nor the NEA endorsed Obama in the Democratic primary campaign .
Once in office , Obama chose a charter school in Washington as the site of his first presidential visit to a school .
On the other hand , his administration recently curtailed funding for a federal charter program in Washington , D.C. , schools , a move that outraged charter school supporters .
While saying he supports the “ competition ” charter schools provide , Obama has also said , “ Charter schools are n’t the only answer . ”
But for poor parents with children trapped in dysfunctional schools , they might be the only answer available now .
A real success story
Committed to the idea that “ demography does not define destiny , ” the Knowledge Is Power Program is a network of 66 mostly charter schools located in minority , low - income neighborhoods in 19 states and the District of Columbia .
School begins at 7:30 a.m. and continues until 5 p.m. , with tutoring provided in the evenings .
Saturday morning classes are common , and students commit to three weeks of summer school .
If that seems out of the ordinary , so are the results that KIPP schools achieve .
So far , more than 80 percent of KIPP alumni have gone on to college , a matriculation rate bearing no resemblance to that of most public schools with student populations similar to KIPP ’s , which is 90 percent African - American or Latino .
Despite salaries 15 percent to 20 percent higher than district averages , teacher turnover is high at KIPP , in part because administrators fire teachers who fail to achieve results .
“ At KIPP , there is no blaming ‘ downtown , ’ ” one school director said .
“ There is no blaming ‘ the system . ’ ”
Bloomberg files this report on the recent rise of insider selling , company executives dumping the most shares since mid-2007 , shortly before the broad stock market ’s peak .
Executives at U.S. companies are taking advantage of the biggest stock - market rally in 71 years to sell their shares at the fastest pace since credit markets started to seize up two years ago .
Insiders of Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index companies were net sellers for 14 straight weeks as the gauge rose 36 percent , data compiled by InsiderScore.com show .
…
Sales by CEOs , directors and senior officers have accelerated to the highest level since June 2007 , two months before credit markets froze , as the S&P 500 rebounded from its 12 - year low in March .
The increase is making investors more skittish because executives presumably have the best information about their companies ’ prospects .
Surely this ca n’t be a good development for your typical retail investor , many of whom have just recently convinced themselves that it ’s OK to put some money back into stocks again .
Perhaps a visual aid might help …
The good news is that the 2007 stock market peak did n’t occur until some four months after insider selling peaked in June .
Here we are , almost exactly two years later , and it appears that the timing could be again aligned for a fall season that does not treat equity markets kindly .
Why is insider selling so important ?
It ’s quite simple …
“ If insiders are selling into the rally , that shows they do n’t expect their business to be able to support current stock - price levels , ” said Joseph Keating , the chief investment officer of Raleigh , North Carolina - based RBC Bank , the unit of Royal Bank of Canada that oversees $ 33 billion in client assets .
“ They ’re taking advantage of this bounce and selling into it . ”
…
“ They ’re looking to take some money off the table because they think the rally will come to an end , ” said Ben Silverman , the Seattle - based research director at InsiderScore .
“ It ’s the most bearish we ’ve seen insiders , on a whole , in two years . ”
The last time there were more U.S. corporations with executives reducing their holdings than adding to them was during the week ended June 19 , 2007 , the data show .
The next month , two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds filed for bankruptcy protection as securities linked to subprime mortgages fell apart , helping trigger almost $ 1.5 trillion in losses and writedowns at the world ’s biggest financial companies and the 57 percent drop in the S&P 500 from Oct. 9 , 2007 , to March 9 , 2009 .
There ’s much more information in the report about stock sales at individual companies , but , perhaps the most important detail is that insider selling reached an all - time record back in the first quarter of 2000 , as the 18 - year bull market in stocks reached its climax , the official demarcation point between “ dotcom ” and “ dotbomb ” .

When Web Scouts , Inc. wrote its tank warfare game iCombat for the iPhone , the company put a few extra lines of code into the application .
The code checked the size of the application 's . plist and , if the files size differed from what it was when the company packaged the application , it would phone home .
Checking the size of the .
plist file is a popular means of detecting whether an application is being run as a cracked version from a third party website or an official version from the app store .
During the cracking process , the . plist changes formats and thus changes in size .
Numerous developers have used this method to collect data on unauthorized usage or just to disable an application altogether .
Now , Web Scouts , Inc. has made the information it collected public along with their thoughts on the issue of App Store piracy .
The numbers are staggering .
Pirates made up almost 74 percent of the application 's users during the period in which the statistics were tracked .
In the first seven days alone , the application had 6,350 users , 5,261 of which were pirates .
That means , at the time of launch , the application realized four pirated copies to every one copy sold ( The original article stated a five to one ratio , but that has been pointed out as inaccurate ) .
Eventually , the ratio did level off , reaching one legitimate copy for every one pirated .
Oddly enough , however , the company was surprisingly upbeat .
In the end , the makers of iCombat decided that the effort to thwart pirates was n't worth the trouble , as none of the users they directed to a page asking them to buy the application actually purchased .
After all , even big - name software companies know that not every illegal copy equals a lost sale .
" The goal behind launching an app is n’t thwarting pirates , it is getting users and generating sales , so leave the ' making a point ' anti-piracy measures to the big guys , " Web Scouts wrote on its website .
" The competition is so fierce to get noticed in the App store that any attention is good attention . "
In the end , the company suggests that developers continue to make an application better and think about a lite version so people can try before buying .
Frankly , I 'd be curious to see if a lite version hurts legitimate sales in the end , particularly in the game genre .
For quality products this might not be the case , but some users might lose interest before they pull the trigger on the full version .

This computer - generated image released by Plantagon shows the design of a vertical greenhouse project .
Vertical greenhouses that grow organic fruit and vegetables smack in the middle of crowded cities where land is scarce may soon be a reality , a Swedish company developing the project said Friday .
Vertical greenhouses that grow organic fruit and vegetables smack in the middle of crowded cities where land is scarce may soon be a reality , a Swedish company developing the project said Friday .
" A tomato seed is planted on the ground floor on a rotating spiral and when it arrives at the top , 30 days later , you pick the fruit , " the vice president of Plantagon , Hans Hassle , told AFP .
In a few decades , 80 percent of the global population will live in cities , increasing the need " to grow fruits and vegetables in an urban environment due to the lack of land , " he said .
With a vertical greenhouse , " we could have fresh organic produce every day and sell it directly to consumers in the city , " Hassle said .
That way , " we would save 70 percent on the cost of fresh produce because right now 70 percent of the price is transport and storage costs , " he said .
Fresh and healthy produce would thereby also become more readily available to those with slim budgets , he added .
No vertical greenhouse exists yet , but " several cities in Scandinavia and in China have expressed an interest , " Hassle said .
Each installation would cost around 30 million dollars ( 21 million euros ) , much more than a regular greenhouse .
But the investment would rapidly turn a profit , he insisted .
" With ground space of 10,000 square metres ( 107 , 640 square feet ) , a vertical greenhouse represents the equivalent of 100,000 square metres of cultivated land " thanks to the rotating spiral that allows continual planting .
" An inventor came up with the idea 20 years ago but none of the people he presented it to believed in it .
He presented it to me 10 years ago and it seemed like a good idea , so I talked to Sweco , a Swedish engineering firm , and they agreed to build these vertical greenhouses , " Hassle explained .
A virtual image of what one of the greenhouses could look like resembles a large glass sphere with a pillar in the middle , around which the seedlings rotate on a platform .
" It looks fantastic like that , but the technology is simple , " Hassle said .

That did n’t take long .
Less than two weeks have passed since much of the medical - industrial complex made a big show of working with President Barack Obama on health care reform — and the double - crossing is already well under way .
Indeed , it ’s now clear that even as they met with the president , pretending to be cooperative , insurers were gearing up to play the same destructive role they did the last time health reform was on the agenda .
So here ’s the question : Will Obama gloss over the reality of what ’s happening , and try to preserve the appearance of cooperation ?
Or will he honor his own pledge , made during the campaign , to go on the offensive against special interests if they stand in the way of reform ?
The story so far :
On May 11 the White House called a news conference to announce that major players in health care , including the American Hospital Association and the lobbying group America ’s Health Insurance Plans , had come together to support a national effort to control health care costs .
The fact sheet on the meeting , one has to say , was classic Obama in its message of post - partisanship and , um , hope .
“ For too long , politics and point - scoring have prevented our country from tackling this growing crisis , ” it said , adding , “ The American people are eager to put the old Washington ways behind them . ”
But just three days later the hospital association insisted that it had not , in fact , promised what the president said it had promised — that it had made no commitment to the administration ’s goal of reducing the rate at which health care costs are rising by 1.5 percentage points a year .
And the head of the insurance lobby said that the idea was merely to “ ramp up ” savings , whatever that means .
Meanwhile , the insurance industry is busily lobbying Congress to block one crucial element of health care reform , the public option — that is , offering Americans the right to buy insurance directly from the government as well as from private insurance companies .
And at least some insurers are gearing up for a major smear campaign .
On Monday , just a week after the White House photo - op , the Washington Post reported that Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina was preparing to run a series of ads attacking the public option .
The planning for this ad campaign must have begun quite some time ago .
The Post has the storyboards for the ads , and they read just like the infamous Harry and Louise ads that helped kill health care reform in 1993 .
Troubled Americans are shown being denied their choice of doctor , or forced to wait months for appointments , by faceless government bureaucrats .
It ’s a scary image that might make some sense if private health insurance — which these days comes primarily via HMOs — offered all of us free choice of doctors , with no wait for medical procedures .
But my health plan is n’t like that .
Is yours ?
“ We can do a lot better than a government - run health care system , ” says a voice - over in one of the ads .
To which the obvious response is , if that ’s true , why do n’t you ?
Why deny Americans the chance to reject government insurance if it ’s really that bad ?
For none of the reform proposals currently on the table would force people into a government - run insurance plan .
At most they would offer Americans the choice of buying into such a plan .
And the goal of the insurers is to deny Americans that choice .
They fear that many people would prefer a government plan to dealing with private insurance companies that , in the real world as opposed to the world of their ads , are more bureaucratic than any government agency , routinely deny clients their choice of doctor and often refuse to pay for care .
Which brings us back to Obama .
Back during the Democratic primary campaign , Obama argued that the Clintons had failed in their 1993 attempt to reform health care because they had been insufficiently inclusive .
He promised instead to gather all the stakeholders , including the insurance companies , around a “ big table . ”
And that May 11 event was , of course , intended precisely to show this big - table strategy in action .
But what if interest groups showed up at the big table , then blocked reform ?
Back then , Obama assured voters that he would get tough : “ If those insurance companies and drug companies start trying to run ads with Harry and Louise , I ’ll run my own ads as president .
I ’ll get on television and say ‘ Harry and Louise are lying . ’ ”
The question now is whether he really meant it .
The medical - industrial complex has called the president ’s bluff .
It polished its image by showing up at the big table and promising cooperation , then promptly went back to doing all it can to block real change .
The insurers and the drug companies are , in effect , betting that Obama will be afraid to call them out on their duplicity .
It ’s up to Obama to prove them wrong .

Summary : David Johnson hosts weekly labor news .
This week 's guests include Germaine Light with concerns in Mahomet schools .
Our featured story is a debate between Socialist John Reimann and Libertarian Wayne Johnson .
I 'm sorry this will be a very short diary as Hillary 's testimony is still in session right now .
I am watching SOS Hillary Clinton 's testimony to the House Foreign Affairs committee on CNN.com whereupon some Republican congressman ( Dana Rohrabacher ) asked about the wisdom in releasing the torture memos , and went on to quote Dick Cheney 's statement to Fox News that torture works to keep us safe .
He continued with Cheney 's claim that there are memos that show that torture techniques work .
Hillary abruptly cut the congressman saying acerbically :
" It wo n't surprise you that I do n't consider him ( Dick Cheney ) a particularly reliable source of information ... I believe we ought to get to the bottom of this "
UPDATE :
Ron Paul just now praised the President 's new policy of engagement with our foreign adversaries rather than the cowboy posture of the past .
Well , well ... interesting .
Hillary concurred .
UPDATE 2 : Just In
Hillary Clinton strongly defended the Obama administration 's support for Women 's reproductive freedoms .
Hillary Clinton earlier in her testimony had strongly defended Women 's access to reproductive freedoms worldwide when Congressman Smith ( R-? ) carried on and on about Margaret Sanger ( founder of Planned Parenthood ) being a Eugenicist and racist .
Hillary defended the administration 's strong support for women 's health , including the work she had done in the Clinton administration to reduce teen pregnancies .
She noted that it was quite instructive that during the past eight years , teen pregnancies were on the rise rather than decline .
Just a few moments ago another Republican congressman Jeff Fortenberry ( R - Nebraska ) had to go back to Margaret Sanger stating that
We should not use American Foreign policy to export abortion ... it will be seen as neo-colonialism ... inst3ad we should turn to Mother Teresa who ... fought abortion by adoption ...
Hillary replied :
Congressman , let me say with respect to Margaret Sanger .
I admire Thomas Jefferson , but I abhor his slaveholding ... I admire Margaret Sanger but I abhor her racism ... that is the way we deal with flawed human beings ...
She went on to restate her strong support for women 's reproductive freedom .
These hearings are very interesting to say the least .
UPDATE 3 : HILLARY KNOCKS OUT THE CHAVEZ STUPIDITY !!!
Hillary is making me very very very happy .
She just right now knocked away all that silly huffing and puffing about " handshake - gate . "
She described the book gift - giving incident as a case of Hugo Chavez camera hogging , including the way he deliberately positioned the book cover so that the title would catch the camera lens .
She said :
I found it all amusing ... President Obama was right ; why should we be afraid of shaking somebody 's hand ... Iran is seeking influence in our hemisphere ... we buy their ( Venezuela ) oil ... let 's see if we can turn some of this ( animosity ) around ... [ laughter ]
To another " concerned Republican " about the Hugo Chavez handshake , she just said :
8 years of isolation has n't worked .
We 've isolated him ( Hugo Chavez ) , so he 's gone elsewhere .
He 's a sociable guy , so he 's found the sorts of friends we do n't like .
Eight years of isolation has n't worked so let 's try something else .
I tells ya there is no better way to knock out " teh stoopid "
UPDATE 4 : SOS HILLARY CLINTON TELLS MIKE PENCE ( R- IN ) TO STFU
I have never heard a more forceful statement of willingness to serve than i just heard Sec. Clinton just state .
Wow , just wow .
Mike pence ( R - In ) went back to the Hugo Chavez well of Republican faux poutrage and tried to trap our SOS but she smacked him right back into the stone age !!!
Pence referred SOS back to her earlier segment that she was amused at Chavez 's antics at the OAS summit .
he claimed there was something wrong with the " leader of the free world being seen with a socialist ... a Castro - wannabe . " he then went on to quote HRC 's comments during the debates in July 2007 when she said she " did not want to be used for propaganda purposes . " he pushed saying ;
Is n't it true that the leader of the free world ...
Is n’t it true that having the President of the United States be seen on the world stage warmly greeting a virulent socialist dictator ...
Our president was used for propaganda purposes ...? ... There is nothing more demoralizing for people fighting for freedom than to see ...
SOS Hillary Clinton slowly replied :
Well Mr. Pence , I have lived a long time now .
I grew up during the Cold War when we were on hair trigger alert of nuclear war .
I remember virulent anti-American communist dictators threatening our country on a regular basis .
I remember our presidents meeting with them , shaking their hands and negotiating ... ... I have also seen us establish normal relations with Vietnam .
I have seen 30 years of normalized relations with China .
And I do n’t think there is any contradiction between standing strongly for our principles and our values , and the give and take of diplomatic encounter ... ... My bottom line is I am here to serve my country , which I have loved since I was a little girl .
I support my President because he is committed to doing whatever he can in the time he is given to serve to make this a better more secure safer world .
There are different approaches .
I respectfully say we spent 8 years trying to isolate Chavez , and what has been the result ?
I do n’t think it ’s been in America ’s interest .
So we are gonna try some different things .
I respect your disagreement .
We want as bi-partisan a foreign policy as possible ....... constructive criticism .
We want your feedback .
But President Obama WON the election .
He beat me in a primary in which he put forth a different approach .
And he is NOW our President , and we ALL want our President to succeed ...
' Nuff said !!!!!!!
*** LATE VIDEO UPDATE ****
FINAL UPDATE
1:25 PM EST Phew !!!
Finally the hearings are over .
Madam Secretary you did us ALL Proud .
Thank you thank you .
You put an exclamation point on the administration 's foreign policy and you taught a few of those congresscritters a thing or two .
You showed that Democrats SHOULD NOT back down from our principles .
Let Repugs defend their failure .
Thank you again .
Now I hope the usually mealy mouthed Democratic congress members will take a page out of our Secretary of State 's book of how to TALK back at Republican obstructionists .
Volatility and Market Fluctuations are Great for Retail Investors
In this tough economic environment , it ’s only natural to feel unsecure about our money in the stock market .
It ’s true that the economy is contracting , it ’s a fact that unemployment is rising and it ’s pretty much a guarantee that housing prices will continue to go down .
However , I ’m still going to tell you to continue investing now .
Invest Now When it ’s So Volatile ?
Sometimes perception can ruin our wealth .
Consider a simple example :
Investor A ( we will call him “ Lucky ” ) began to make a $ 500 monthly investment into the stock market as the market soared .
In fact , the market kept going up without fail for the next 6 months .
Perfect timing right ?
Investor B ( let ’s call him Joe ) on the other hand picked a different timeframe ( much like the times currently ) .
With the same investment of $ 500 per month , he bought into the market as it went down for the first three months , then back to its original price after six .
The following chart could very well illustrate the stock prices for the six months they were invested .
In this example and considering that both Lucky and Joe invested $ 3,000 , which investor came out ahead ?
In the 6 - month bull market , Lucky accumulated 24.90 ( 6.25 + 5 + 4.17 + 3.57 + 3.13 + 2.78 ) shares .
With each share valued at $ 180 , his investment increased to $ 4,482 .
Not bad for timing the market right .
Now let ’s take a look at Joe .
With his luck and timing , he ended up buying 74.29 ( 6.25 + 10 + 14.29 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 ) shares .
With the price being $ 80 a share , his investments are worth $ 5,943.20 after six months !
The Power of Dollar Cost Averaging in a Volatile Market
In our simple example , Joe was able to accumulate many shares at a very low cost .
He believed that while he can’t predict the bottom , prices would eventually be on the upswing again .
As he saw prices drop further , he continued buying into the market , trusting the math and reading about how to not lose sleep in a bear market .
As it turns out , he was one of the few people who benefited from the market downturn .
This simple but powerful example illustrates why you should continue to invest in the market .
No one knows when the bottom will occur , but if you keep investing , you will be able to accumulate shares at incredible prices .
Once prices start to rise again , you will be able to take advantage that much more .
A Few Words of Caution
Before you go off buying securities , make sure you understand these few points as it can help avoid disaster .
Diversification – I hear about dollar cost averaging when buying a stock all the time .
This example is not for individual stocks .
Guess what happened to people whom dollar cost averaged into Lehman Brothers ?
When you keep buying a stock , you are betting that the company behind it will be able to turn around eventually .
When buying into an index like the S&P 500 , you are betting on capitalism bringing back prosperity .
The latter is much safer do n’t you think ?
Holding Power –
The key to the success of dollar cost averaging is time horizon .
How soon do you really need the money ?
If Joe needed his money on the 3rd month , he would n’t do so well .
The stock market can continue to go down for months , if not years !
Do n’t invest any money you need in the short term and expect dollar cost averaging to always work in your favor .
Automatic –
It ’s too difficult for most people to put money into the market when bad economic news are everywhere .
Dollar cost averaging almost only works when you put your contributions in automatic mode so set it up right now and forget about it !
If you are on the sidelines and contemplating when you should get back in the market , now is the perfect time .
Continue investing , because prosperous times will return eventually .

Recalling the context in which it emerged
1 . By the time Hugo Chávez won the 1998 presidential elections , the neoliberal capitalist model was already in deep trouble .
The dilemma he faced was basically whether to refound the neoliberal capitalist model — obviously with some changes , among them a greater concern for social issues , but motived by the same profit - seeking logic — or to seek to build another model . [ 2 ]
2. Chávez chose the latter option .
In naming it , he decided to resuscitate the word socialism , despite the negative connotations it had due to the past .
But he specified that this was a 21st century socialism to differentiate it from the Soviet socialism of the 20th century .
He warned that we must not “ fall into the errors of the past ” ; into “ Stalinist deviations ” that bureaucratized the party and ended up eliminating popular protagonism ; into state capitalism that focused on state ownership and not on the participation of workers in the running of companies .
FRANKFURT / MOSCOW
( Reuters ) - China 's state - run carmaker Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co ( BAIC ) is preparing to make an offer for General Motors '
Opel unit in the coming days , a source told Reuters , but the Russian partner of bid frontrunner Magna MGa .
TO said the race was all but over .
BAIC , a local partner of German auto manufacturer Daimler DAIGn .
DE assembling Mercedes saloons in China , is working out a bid to be submitted before a mid-July deadline , a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday .
General Motors GMGMQ.PK has piled extra pressure on Austrian - Canadian parts maker Magna by talking up rival offers from BAIC and Belgian investment firm RHJ International RHJI .BR in the run-up to July 15 , when Magna wants to be able to sign a deal .
Majority control over GM ’s Opel unit , which also includes plants in Britain and Spain , is being sold as a precondition to state aid for the German carmaker now that the bankrupt U.S. carmaker can no longer afford to finance its foreign subsidiary .
Analysts say BAIC , which is being advised by Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and PriceWaterhouse Coopers , is keen to expand out of its domestic market and build Opel into a global brand .
But it has so far provided scant details of its intentions and its initial document filed to investment bankers running the deal was just two pages long .
One source close to BAIC said it entered the process comparatively late because GM was reluctant to involve it in the process at all .
Sources at GM have said they want to avoid encouraging competition in China from its erstwhile Opel brand .
BAIC declined to comment .
In Moscow , Sberbank SBER.RTS , which is partnering Magna along with Russian carmaker Gaz GAZA .
RTS , said that BAIC , RHJ and a third rival , Fiat FIA .
MI , were all effectively out of the race .
“ I do not see any serious competition .
The choice has been made and the question now is of how to structure the deal , ” Chief Executive German Gref told reporters .
Klaus Franz , head of the Opel works council , told Germany ’s Bild newspaper that GM was playing a high - stakes game to improve the terms of the sale , adding that he knew of no new offer .
That followed comments from Franz in a Wall Street Journal report , in which he expressed strong reservations about any sale to BAIC .
“ They only want technology and have no experience in global auto production , ” the paper reported Franz as saying .
Die schwedische Piratenpartei hat bei der Wahl zum Europaparlament in ihrem Land aus dem Stand 7,4 Prozent der Stimmen geholt .

“ In our culture we were nomads and we believed it was our right to take sheep , to take cattle .
That is how we see the ships .
They are our sheep and we will take them . ”
The ships that Farrah Ismail speaks of are those plying the sea lanes off the Horn of Africa .
And the culture he refers to is that of the Somali nomads who have been raiding rival tribes or clans for centuries .
The story of how this inherently nomadic view of the world was brought to bear on one of the industrial world 's most valuable trading routes is the story of Ismail 's life .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The 38 year old is now languishing hundreds of miles from the sea in one of the driest places imaginable , the desert prison of Mandera in Somaliland .
One of only a handful of self confessed pirates , he has been sentenced to life in this sand - blasted colonial fort built by the British to house an earlier generation of dissenters , rebels and common criminals .
Caught red handed as he prepared to launch attacks into the Gulf of Aden from the port of Berbera he is devoid of the usual need for evasion .
His account of how and why he came to the northern breakaway state is startlingly direct .
“ I came here from a village called Eyl , ” the port at the heart of the piracy surge off Somalia .
“ I came here to kidnap commercial ships from the waters off Berbera .
Sitting in a room crowded with uniformed prison guards and dressed in a stained grey sweathshirt with the letters U.S.A written in faded yellow , red and green , he continues :
“ I decided to come here since it 's nearer to the ships .
There were no pirates I would come here to be successful . ”
Typically lean but not as tall as some of his compatriots , Ismail speaks in halting but unbroken English only pausing to drag hard and often on the luxury of free cigarettes .

He did not begin life , as so many Somali pirates have claimed , as a fishermen on the immense coastline that stretches around the Horn .
Ismail grew up in Mogadishu , the capital of newly independent Somalia , relinquished by Italy after its defeat in World War II .
“ I became a mechanic , I could fix anything , ” he says in a matter of fact tone .
He came to the coast as a young man and ran his own workshop in Bossasso , the centre of Puntland , another breakaway province in a fractured country .
Once there he spied an opportunity that many other young Somalis were just waking up to .
The mainstay of the Somali economy had long been the rearing of cattle for export across the Gulf to arid Saudi Arabia , much of it to feed the annual Haj pilgrims .
Fishing to get money rather than food was comparatively new and as Ismail discovered a good earner .
From owning one boat and a single engine in 1993 he quickly grew a small business harvesting lobsters and shark and making $ 500 per month .
He got married .
“ I had agents in Dubai , I was buying shark nets for $ 108 per piece . ”
Somalia boasts some of the richest fishing grounds in the world , a fact that was not lost on foreign predators in the wake of the collapse of central government in 1991 .
Somali fishermen were already selling to the Gulf States and to Italian companies and the marine bounty was known .
Fishing vessels started to appear from nearby Kenya and Egypt but also from as far afield as China .
“ The first point that compelled us to be sea pirates was the fishermen .
These boats that came , trawlers came and destroyed everything even the small fish from our area . ”
Ismail lost his shark nets in clashes with trawlers , others lost boats or lives .
The operations of the foreign ships were felt in three ways according to Ismail : “ Big fishing trawlers entered our waters , destroyed our facilites , collided with our boats and even killed people .
“ Some dumped toxic waste in our waters . ”
And finally : “ big cruise ships and tankers started to appear . ”
Everything changed in 1997 , he believes when Somali fishermen attacked a Kenyan fishing trawler .
“ They had our lobster and fish on board .
We showed the world community what they had taken . ”
What Ismail insists began as a policing operation quickly shifted .
“ At first it was about the hostility between us , it was about taking revenge .
But when they paid ransoms we decided to take more ships to get more ransoms . ”
The former mechanic took longer to step off the sidelines , eventually joining the growing bands of pirates operating from Eyl in northeastern Somalia .
“ Using my own fishing boat , we got everything : sat phone , weapons ...
We went out to the ocean .
Unfortunately we could not reach them because of the speed .
They were moving faster than us . ”
Talking faster now he recounts another failed attempt where a larger engine landed him alongside a container ship but his ladder could n't reach the deck .
Far from comic , these failed attempts underline the extraordinary adaptability of his countrymen , most with little experience of the sea who have transformed themselves into hardened pirates capable of stopping supertankers and fending off a multinational fleet of warships .
Ismail 's third attempt involved transporting his ship overland and restocking his armoury .
“ I got seven weapons , a bazooka , AK 47s , one pistol , a thuraya ( satellite phone ) .
We were using uniforms from the Puntland coastguard . ”
He believes it would have worked if an informant had n't given the gang away to authorities keen to demonstrate that they were fighting piracy .
The same communications networks that have existed for generations that have enabled the cattle traders to cross the Gulf to Yemen and Saudi Arabia ; the same traffickers of weapons and people have been adapted to exploit a new economic opportunity – hijack and ransom .
There is no sympathy for the merchant seamen he has pursued who Ismail sees as representatives of a world that stood by while Somalia was exploited .
“ I do n't give a shit about them , ” he says with a rare flash of anger .
“ They are like cattle to me , these ships are mine . ”
“ Why do n't you give consideration about the destruction they did to us ? ”
“ This time our problem has touched the outside world .
Finally the rest of the world knows that hijacking ships was a punishment from us . ”
Piracy off the Horn has always had seasons .
When the sea is calm the mother ships and their skiffs go out .
When it is rough they retreat to Somalia 's cliffs and bays .
And as another of these seasons draws to a close the predictable claims are being made that the military solution is working .
So far the multinational fleet has had less impact than the weather .
Nato and other international missions have congratulated themselves on reducing the threat .
Ismail has a different view .
“ These navies can think what they want .
We have shown we will defend ourselves , we will change tactics . ”
Despite his own life sentence , the father of two becomes animated about possible solutions .
“ We need to understand this solution .
We need people to listen to us , to create employment for these fishing communities .
To bring facilities that is the way we can stop these problems . ”
The backwash from the recent killing of at least six pirates first by the French , then by US naval forces has been felt even inside the high walls of Mandera .
“ I am very sorry about French and America fighting pirates .
“ I did n't go to France or to USA , we took these ships in our own waters .
“ If they continue we will start to destroy ships and kill people .
Then there will be serious and heavy consequences . ”
Mobile compatibility tables
This series of compatibility tests is sponsored by Vodafone .
On this page I give a quick overview of the mobile browser compatibility tests I ’ve done so far .
If you want the latest inside scoops on my mobile tests , follow me on Twitter .

Disclaimer
These tests are in no way complete .
Essentially , you ’re looking over my shoulder while I work .
That ’s fine , but do n’t use these tables for serious decisions about the compatibility of your mobile apps yet .
There ’s a lot of incompleteness here ; from the tests themselves down to the table grid .
Right now I ’m not even sure if I should order the entries by browser or by phone vendor .
Not all tests are done on the same phones and / or with the same browsers .
Unexpected problems such as network outages , problems with wifi connections , or Vodafone ’s feared “ content adaptation ” play havoc with my attempts to conduct tests in a uniform way .
That ’s not going to change any time soon .
Anyway , you see the problem : I just do n’t quite know what a proper mobile test is , how to write it , or how to interpret the test results .

Touch action
This series of tests checks the availability and firing order of the mouseover , mouseout , mousemove , mousedown , mouseup , and click events , as well as CSS : hover .
Not all mouse events mean anything in a mobile context , so it ’s interesting to see when the various mobile browser vendors have decided to fire these events .
We have to distinguish here between touch phones , cursor phones , and four - way navigation phones .
Cursor phones are mostly S60 ones , while touch phones can be subdivided in Blackberry on the one hand , where the user can click the screen in addition to touching it , and all other touch phones , where a touch equals a click .
First we ’ll take a look at whether the events are supported at all , while the last few rows of this table show when and in which order the browsers fire the events .

iPhone
The iPhone fires a mouseover and : hover when the user first touches the element .
It fires a mouseout and removes the : hover when the user touches another element .
Essentially , the element retains the focus until another element is touched , and mouseover / out and : hover are tied to this focus exclusively .
On every touch touchstart , touchend , mousemove , mousedown , mouseup , and click fire .
If you touch the element and keep your finger there , only touchstart fires .
If the user drags his finger across the element , only the touch events fire .
Opera Mobile HTC ( touch )
Opera Mobile on HTC does the same as the iPhone , except that
it does n’t support the touch events
mousemove is fired before mouseover
Android
Android does the same as the iPhone , though it also fires focus and blur events before and after the mousemove .
Opera Mobile Motorola ( 4 - way )
Opera Mobile 8.00 on Motorola V3xx behaves quite differently .
This is predictable ; the Motorola has a four - way navigation ( i.e. you use the arrow keys to navigate , and no cursor is shown .
When you focus on the test element , the focus , mousemove and mouseover events fire .
When you click on the test element , the click event fires .
Mousedown and mouseup are absent .
When you go to the other element , the blur and mouseout events fire on the test element .
Opera Mobile SonyEricsson
Touchscreen .
When you click on the test element , mouseover , mousedown , mousemove , mouseup , click fire .
Sometimes it inserts many more mousemoves between mouseover and mousedown , or between mousedown and mouseup .
Mouseout is lacking completely .
I managed to focus on the test element once , but it was by accident and I do n’t know how to repeat that test .
Dragging your finger across the element gives a mouseover and one or more mousemove events .
Again , mouseout is lacking .
Opera Mobile Widget Manager
If the cursor goes over the element , everything works correctly .
On a click , however , the test element loses its focus and the : hover styles .
Mousedown , mouseup and click fire correctly .
When you click for the second time , the element regains focus for a moment , and the mouseover and mousemove events fire before the mousedown , mouseup and click .
However , the expected mouseout event does not fire .
S60 WebKit non-touchscreen
S60 WebKit on non-touchscreen phones supports all events exactly as a desktop computer does .
It has a cursor , after all .
The only slight oddity is that it also fires mouseover and - out events when you move the cursor over the text .
This probably has to do with the ancient WebKit bug that makes the target of the event the text node , and not the element node .
This behaviour does NOT occur on the Nokia E66 .
S60 WebKit touchscreen
Tested on Nokia 5800 , the S60 WebKit touchscreen is weird .
The first touch on the element causes mouseover and mousemove , and applies the : hover styles .
The second touch causes mousemove , mousedown , mouseup and click .
That means you have to touch an element twice in order to fire a click event .
Touching the other element correctly fires a mouseout and removes the : hover styles .
NetFront
NetFront ( on SE C510 , which has a cursor ) behaves exactly as a desktop computer does , except that it does not apply the : hover styles .
NetFront 3.3 on SE K770i , which has 4 - way navigation , does not do anything at all .
NetFront 3.4 on Samsung F700 ( touch screen ) supports only mousedown and mouseup .
Blackberry
The Blackberry applies : hover when you touch the element .
When you click on the element by depressing the screen , mousedown , mouseup and click are fired .
Opera Mini
Opera Mini Nokia E71 does not have a cursor .
On the first click Opera Mini only applies the : hover styles .
On the second click Opera Mini fires the mousemove , mouseover , mousedown , mouseup and click events .
On the third and subsequent clicks Opera Mini fires only the mousedown , mouseup and click events .
On the first click on the other element Opera Mini removes the : hover styles and fires mousedown , mouseup and click .
On the second click on the other element Opera Mini fires mousemove , mouseover and mouseout on the first element .
( The first element automatically gains the focus , so this is sort of defendable . )
Iris
When moving your finger over the element , the mouseover , mousemove and mouseout events fire .
When you touch the element , the : hover style is applied , and mouseover , mousedown , mousemove , mouseup and click fire .
There ’s no way of firing the mouseout event with only a touch action ; it needs a move action .
Bolt
Bolt does nothing at all .
Skyfire
Skyfire does not react when you move the cursor over the element .
To me this is a bug ; if a cursor is available the browser should fire the correct events when the cursor hovers over the test element .
When you click , it applies the : hover styles and fires mouseover , mousemove , mousedown , mouseup and click .
When you click it again , the same happens except for mouseover .
When , after the first click on the element , you move the mouse away , then back , and click the test element again , the : hover styles are removed , the mouseover event does not fire , but the mouseout event does ( between mousedown and mouseup ) .
I think this behaviour is a bug : Skyfire may think you click on another element and fire the correct events , then notices you click on the test element and fires those events .
( But I ’m guessing here . )
When you click on the other element , the : hover style is removed and the mouseout event fires .

Key events / codes and form fields
Key events and codes are downright weird when you try to read them from a form field .
Part of the reason is that many phones with numerical keyboards pop up a special dialogue screen where you can enter your text .
This plays havoc with the events .

In general I advise you not to use key events on form fields at all .
Instead , read out the form field ’s value .

A jump in interest rates means the road to recovery in the housing market suddenly looks steeper .
As of Thursday , the nationwide average rate on a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage is 5.3 percent , up from 4.9 percent a week ago and 4.8 percent two weeks ago .
Rising loan costs appear to be having an immediate impact on housing activity .
Borrower applications to refinance or take out a new mortgage fell 16 percent last week , the
Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday .
The shift comes at a sensitive moment , when the housing slump has shown tentative signs of bottoming out .
The good news is that , despite the recent rise , interest rates on mortgages remain historically low .
Moreover , a key reason for the rise in rates is positive .
More investors are expecting the economy to stabilize later this year , pushing interest rates up from fear - driven lows .
If interest rates stay on their upward march , however , it creates tougher terrain for the housing market .
Fewer families can reap big savings by refinancing an existing mortgage .
And for people looking to buy a home , the rate hike effectively makes homes less affordable .
That means home prices may have to fall further to bring housing demand up to match the glut of homes for sale .
" The big worry is still the record foreclosures that are occurring and the high level of job losses that are still occurring , " says Dan McCue , a research analyst at Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies in Cambridge , Mass .
" Those are two big headwinds for housing ....
When interest rates rise , that ’s another headwind . "
A central question now is how much interest rates will rise , and what role the Federal Reserve may play .
The Fed has been trying to keep mortgage rates down this year , by becoming a big buyer of mortgage securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In effect , the Fed has indirectly become a big new player in the home lending market , pushing down the cost of credit .
But the central bank 's influence will be limited if the private sector markets are moving in the opposite direction and pushing rates up .
Some recent indicators have made economists hopeful that the housing slump may be bottoming out :
• Falling home prices and low interest rates , has boosted the average affordability of homes to historic highs over the past year , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Mortgage rates were above 6 percent a year ago , and home prices have fallen about 15 percent nationwide since then .
• Affordability has improved more in the Western US ( where home prices have fallen further ) than elsewhere .
• Pending home sales , an early gauge of where the housing market is headed , have risen lately .
Despite the hopeful signs , the housing market correction is not complete .
Enough homes are still on sale to last the market for 10 months – a much higher inventory than usual .
Foreclosures continue to add to the pool of available homes .
Some 9 percent of home loans were at least one payment past due in the first quarter , and another 3.85 percent of home loans were in foreclosure , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
President Obama's " making home affordable " policy is preventing some foreclosures .
The program gives banks and borrowers incentives to modify loans , so that monthly payments become affordable .
But it does n't provide an out for people who lose jobs or are deeply “ under water , ” with loan balances much higher than their property value .
Still , some analysts expect the decline in home prices to ease over the next year .
An inventory level of seven or eight months ( instead of 10 ) “ will be a sign that a leveling off in home prices is imminent , ” economist Michael Darda writes in a recent report for MKM Partners , an investment firm .
That could happen later this year , he says .
Although many people worry that the housing market can't stabilize until the job market improves , Mr. Darda says affordability is actually a better predictor than employment of housing demand .
Or in the case of Rolls - Royce 's new $ 700,000 baby limousine , the Ghost , it could be a watch or piece of jewellery , according to Rolls - Royce director of sales and marketing Graeme Grieve .
He says the car , due early next year , will attract new buyers , with 85 per cent of prospects new to the brand .
" ( A car like this ) is pocket change , " Mr Grieve says .
" Most of our customers will have something on their wrist that 's more expensive than this .
This is literally like you or me buying a digital camera . "
Australian Rolls - Royce general manager Bevin Clayton expects to sell 14 new Rolls - Royces this year , despite a base model price rise from $ 915,000 to $ 1,075,000 ( plus on - road costs ) in response to the poor exchange rate and recent increase in luxury car tax .
As for next year , " we 've got 18 firm expressions of interest " for the Ghost , he says .
" There are another 72 people who have an expression of interest but want to see it , feel it and touch it and see what the price is . "
Mr Purves says Rolls - Royce is in the process of a significant model expansion .
" In 2008 we were benefiting from product investment and new product , " he says .
" We 've also benefited from having a long order book . "
He acknowledges the order book has shortened and that " 2009 is fraught with challenges for everyone in the ( automotive ) industry " .
However , that has n't stopped the brand from predicting up to a threefold increase in sales in 2010 .
" Our business is still very strong , " Mr Grieve says .
" We grew 20 per cent last year and are pretty much stable year - on - year at the moment . "
Much of it comes down to the super - wealthy Rolls - Royce customers , most of whom own four or five cars and are willing to take risks .
" The great advantage with us in our market is that no one has really gone anywhere ; no one has lost their job , " Mr Grieve says .
" If you 're worth $ 1.5 billion instead of $ 3 billion you still go out for a meal and you still buy a car .
They might have lost half the value of their assets on paper but they 're pretty much looking to treble when recovery comes .
" ( Many customers ) are looking at the current economic situation as being a challenge and opportunity . "
Social analyst David Chalke is not surprised Rolls - Royce is proving impervious to the downturn .
" Firstly , they do n't actually sell a great number of cars and the people that buy them are extraordinarily wealthy and are largely unaffected ( by the downturn ) .
Their fortune may have dropped from $ 2 billion to $ 1.5 billion but that still leaves plenty for a Roller , " he says .
" The effects of the downturn have been very uneven and the gap between the haves and have - nots is actually getting much greater . "
He says high - flying hedge fund managers were the ones most affected by the recession and they bought " look at me " cars rather than a Rolls - Royce .
" Really , you 're looking at a small group of people in the money market and they bought Porsches anyway , " he says .
Rolls - Royce buyers are more likely to be self - made millionaires , possibly hard - working migrants or the sons of migrants who had set up a successful business .
That said , Mr Grieve acknowledges the financial crisis will take its toll but says the wealthiest people in the world will still be able to afford such luxury .
" The level of new interest has declined , " he says .
" In a lot of cases that 's because they 're focusing on other business interests .
" A number of customers in the US have deferred delivery .
One in particular ... simply because he 's busy buying properties at the moment .
He said he has n't got time because he 's busy flying state to state acquiring real estate . "
Ironically , it 's Rolls - Royce 's business model that makes it adaptable in times of a downturn .
While manufacturers used to large volumes are locked in to production schedules and deals with suppliers , Rolls - Royce 's low volumes can be more easily wound back .
" We have a very flexible production method , " Mr Grieve says .
" Our business is configured to be profitable at very low volumes .
So we have the luxury in the current marketplace to take decisions other manufacturers can't . "
Mr Purves is adamant there is a future for Rolls - Royce .
" We have a pinnacle position in aspiration for the automotive , " he says .
" I do n't see a lack of aspiration in the automobile in future .
" Mobility will continue to be essential .
It will continue to be offered in various different guises .
It 's our job to produce the pinnacle of that . "

The world ’s oceans are like an alien world .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 95 percent of them remain unexplored .
But the mysteries do not start a mile below the surface of the sea .
They start with the surface itself .
Scientists are now discovering that the top five - hundredth - inch of the ocean is somewhat like a sheet of jelly .
And this odd habitat , thinner than a human hair , is home to an unusual menagerie of microbes .
“ It ’s really a distinct ecosystem of its own , ” said Oliver Wurl , of Canada ’s Institute of Ocean Sciences .
This so - called sea-surface microlayer is important , scientists say , in part because it influences the chemistry of the ocean and the atmosphere .
“ One of the most significant things that happens on our planet is the transport of gases in and out of the ocean , ” said Michael Cunliffe , a marine biologist at the University of Warwick in England .
The ocean stores a large fraction of the global - warming gases we produce ; at the microlayer , the gases are pulled down .
“ It ’s the ocean breathing through its skin , ” Dr. Cunliffe said .
Sailors have long known that the surface can be covered with oily slicks ( hence the phrase “ pouring oil on troubled waters ” ) .
But when scientists began studying the surface in the mid-20th century they found it vexing .
A scientist cannot just dunk a bucket into the ocean without dredging up deeper water as well .
“ Even defining the surface is hard , since it ’s moving up and down , ” said Peter Liss , a professor of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia in England .

The " Beat the Heat " program started in 1984 and has grown into a huge event with custom drag - racing cop cars and tons of participation .
The aim of the program is to educate kids and hooligans alike on the dangers of street racing and give them a cheaper alternative .
Of course , having some fun and good PR is an added benefit .
The event is hosted at local dragways and is fully funded by donations and the $ 25 entry fee .
As long as you 're over 18 and have a license you can bring whatever you want and go up against your choice of suped - up squad car .
Organizers are quick to point out a marked decrease in illegal racing in nearby areas since the program began .
If you 're interested and live in the area , the next event is set up for May 23rd at the County Line Drag Way in Miami - Dade County , Florida .
If you ask us , this is a darn good idea .

John Kanzius ERIE , Pennsylvania
Using his wife ’s pie pans and a couple of hot dogs , John Kanzius , 64 , a retired business owner and radio technician , may have discovered a new treatment for some cancers .
When nanoparti­cles made from gold are injected into tumors , they attach to cancer cells .
The Kanzius RF Machine transmits focused radio waves to these nanoparticles , which respond by releasing heat and incinerating infected cells while leaving the surrounding healthy cells intact .
Kanzius ’s research was inspired by his own struggle with chemo­therapy treatments in 2003 and 2004 while battling leukemia .
In 2005 his work gained the attention of the prestigious cancer research centers at the University of Pittsburgh and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .
Both facilities are now testing the treatment on animals .
So far , tests have successfully destroyed localized tumors known as hepatic VX2 carcinomas in rabbits .

David Gowen Oakland , California
One of the last places you ’d expect to find not one but two undiscovered species of plants would be right under the noses of the 7 million people living in Northern California ’s Bay Area .
But David Gowen , a shy retired carpenter , did exactly that .
Now 62 , he is the recent discoverer of two species of tiny wildflowers growing previously unnoticed just across the bay from San Francisco , Navarretia gowenii and Eriastrum sp. nov .
Gowan began studying botany in his free time in 1990 , teaching himself how to identify plants through the collections and expert staff at the University and Jepson Herbaria at the University of California at Berkeley .
His discoveries came about during treks through Lime Ridge Open Space , a 175 - acre nature preserve near Mount Diablo .
As well as giving them their formal Latin names , Gowen has dubbed the plants the Lime Ridge Navarretia and the Lime Ridge Woollystar .
“ I found the navarretia in 1998 , but it was n’t until 2004 that I contacted Leigh Johnson [ at Brigham Young University ] about the plant .
The eriastrum I found in 2003 . ”
Gowen ’s first paper was published in January 2008 in the botanical journal Madroño .
Forrest M. Mims III Guadalupe County , Texas
There may be no amateur scientist more prolific than Forrest M. Mims III , 64 , of south central Texas .
He has published in major scientific journals such as Nature as well as countless general - interest publications .
Mims began teaching himself science and electronics at age 11 and says he never received any formal training apart from a few introductory college courses in biology and chemistry .
In 1969 he cofounded the home electronics company Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems , which built what is considered by many to be the first personal computer , the Altair 8800 .
Mims ’s research and writings span topics ranging from atmospheric aerosols to home electronics ; he is probably best known for the educational electronics kits and books he has created for RadioShack , which have introduced generations of young experimenters to electronics .
He is also editor of The Citizen Scientist , the online newsletter of the Society for Amateur Scientists .
Today Mims devotes himself to atmospheric science ; he recently finished a 265,000 - word tome for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration .

The cost of equipment can be a barrier to entering science .
So it is no small feat to create an inexpensive fluorescent microscope , an instrument often used by medical researchers .
This is what Ely Silk , 65 , a retired business owner and former IBM programmer , did in 2002 when the mercury lightbulb in his regular fluorescent microscope reached the end of its one - to two - month life span .
He replaced the mercury bulb ( which can cost hundreds of dollars ) with a small collection of long - life LEDs emitting a variety of wavelengths .
The LEDs cost only a few dollars apiece , and they eased Silk ’s mind too .
“ I did n’t like the idea of looking through a microscope where 12 inches away from me is something that may explode , ” he says .
“ It just made me uncomfortable . ”
Silk continued to adapt the microscope so that it could , like high - end fluorescent microscopes , detect materials such as chlorophyll or fluorescent dyes , which emit light when irradiated with specific light wavelengths .
The result is a microscope affordable enough for almost any high school biology lab or rural medical facility .
Silk suggests that his microscope design could be used for screening patients ’ sputum for tuberculosis .
Sean Casey Studio City , California
Much of what we know about storms — and especially much of what we see about them on TV — comes from self - made storm chasers .
Filming tornadoes up close and personal demands a love of adrenaline - pumping adventure and an intimate understanding of a twister ’s cryptic workings .
After nine years of running into and away from dangerous weather , storm chaser and IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey , 40 , has mastered these skills and uses them to educate and entertain the public .
Casey is most famous for footage that has aired on the Discovery Channel ’s docudrama series Storm Chasers , which follows scientists as they deploy data - collecting probes inside tornadoes from the confines of 16,000 - pound armored vehicles .
But the filmmaker has been deciphering the natural world through IMAX films for some 21 years .
“ You have to really understand your subject matter so that you can film the more amazing parts of it , ” says Casey , who has made films about volcanoes , hurricanes , earthquakes , ecology , and other subjects .
“ Going out with an IMAX camera , ” he says , “ appeals to my sense of hunting and gathering images . ”
Paul Breed Solana Beach , California
“ I grew up in Alaska .
My dad ran a bush airline , and if you did n’t fix it yourself , it did n’t get fixed , ” says Paul Breed , 46 , owner of a small software company in California .
“ Since that point in time I have always been a builder of things . ”
Breed and his son have constructed prototype lunar landers to compete in the X - Prize Foundation ’s Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge , slated for late 2008 .
A $ 1 million prize will be given to the first team that can demonstrate a prototype capable of performing maneuvers that simulate ferrying a payload between the surface of the moon and lunar orbit .
Breed wants to show that small teams can build relatively inexpensive rockets — he ’s doing it for less than half a million dollars .
His lander design looks like the frame of a pyramid and uses hydrogen peroxide for fuel ?.
Breed and his son were the first team to publish online their full FAA experimental permit application , which painstakingly documents the safety of the trial , often a formidable barrier to entry .
As Breed had hoped , other teams have copied their method .
“ This is a passion , not a moneymaking thing .
If I can persuade three other people that a small team of two or three people can build serious rockets , that ’s significant . ”
Ian Kluft San Jose , California
Impacts by asteroids have transformed the course of life on Earth , most famously by wiping out the dinosaurs .
Identifying craters gives important information about how often impacts occur and what their effects on Earth might be .
Unfortunately , geologic changes tend to erase these craters .
Ian Kluft , a 42 - year - old commercial pilot , believes he has identified a previously overlooked crater in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada , famous for hosting the annual Burning Man arts and countercultural festival .
Kluft ’s first notion that Black Rock ’s rocks were suggestive of an impact crater came during a trip there in 2003 .
Since then he has assembled an assortment of data supporting his idea that the remnants of an impact crater measuring 40 miles across can be found in the desert and its surroundings .
Patterns in the layers and types of some rocks , as well as a series of concentric rings visible in satellite imagery , suggest a dramatic impact in the region .
Kluft began his research in earnest after finding the notations of two mining company geologists from the 1980s .
“ They had enough information between them that if they had even thought of it , they could have made the discovery in 1980 , ” Kluft says .
He hopes to gather enough evidence to persuade a professional geologist to take on the quest .
Stephen Felton Cincinnati , Ohio
Stephen Felton says snails may not look like much , but they fight mean — and they have been doing so for a long time .
Some 450 million years ago , Cyclonema gastropods were attacking other snails by secreting acid onto their victims ’ shells and then boring holes through them .
While this mirrors the behavior of modern snails , no one knew their ancient relatives used the same strategy — until Felton came along .
For more than 40 years , Felton , 73 , has been scouring the Cincinnati area ’s fossil - rich geology as a pastime , assisting professional and fellow amateur geologists .
A highlight of his career came in 2001 when the Paleontological Society recognized his achievements by awarding him the Harrell L. Strimple Award , which celebrates exceptional amateur paleontologists .
Bill Hilton JR York , South Carolina
On 11 acres of South Carolina piedmont , a gentle slope that leads from the base of a mountain to flat land , former high school biology teacher Bill Hilton Jr. , 62 , runs one of the most active bird - banding centers in the Southeast .
In just over 25 years he and visiting volunteers have banded more than 52,000 birds , nearly 3,900 of which are the thumb - size ruby - throated hummingbird ( Archilochus colubris ) , at the Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History .
Every year Hilton also leads expeditions of teachers and amateur scientists to Costa Rica to study and band these humming­birds in their winter grounds .
In 1996 Hilton founded Operation RubyThroat , an online database that allows citizens throughout the hummingbird ’s range in North and Central America to share their observations and data .
“ One of the characteristics of good scientists is that they think with their pencils .
They write down their observations and then share those with other people .
I think the biggest sin in science is not sharing your work , ” says Hilton , who publishes in scientific journals and writes a weekly online missive about research at Hilton Pond .
Operation RubyThroat had a major success this year .
For the first time , a hummingbird that was banded in its tropical wintering grounds was identified in its North American breeding grounds .
Ron Bissinger Pleasanton , California
Only a few years ago , detecting exoplanets — planets that orbit distant stars — was done only at professional observatories .
But from his homemade backyard observatory in Northern California , Ron Bissinger , 58 , leads the charge that has drawn countless amateur astronomers into the hunt for these alien worlds .
In 2001 Bissinger , the CEO of a life sciences company , teamed up with astronomers Tim Castellano of NASA ’s Ames Research Center and Greg Laughlin of the University of California at Santa Cruz .
Their goal was to demonstrate that amateurs could measure the tiny dip in brightness that happens when an exoplanet passes in front of its home star .
The key to making this delicate measurement doable by amateurs is the availability of modern digital cameras combined with relatively small telescopes .
Bissinger continues to be at the forefront of amateur science .
In the last several years he was able to confirm the existence of exoplanets HD 149026 b? ( one of the smallest and densest transiting planets yet detected and also one of the hottest ? ) and XO - 1 b ( a gas giant slightly larger than Jupiter ) .
He continues to work with professional astronomers to document even more extrasolar planets .
Overwhelmingly : the GOP and Bush , a fact the vast majority of the right simply ignored for the past eight years .
Leonhardt lays out the facts that Glenn Reynolds and his fellow partisans keep denying :
David 's bottom line :
About 33 percent of the swing stems from new legislation signed by Mr. Bush .
That legislation , like his tax cuts and the Medicare prescription drug benefit , not only continue to cost the government but have also increased interest payments on the national debt .
Mr. Obama ’s main contribution to the deficit is his extension of several Bush policies , like the Iraq war and tax cuts for households making less than $ 250,000 .
Such policies together with the Wall Street bailout , which was signed by Mr. Bush and supported by Mr. Obama account for 20 percent of the swing .
About 7 percent comes from the stimulus bill that Mr. Obama signed in February .
And only 3 percent comes from Mr. Obama ’s agenda on health care , education , energy and other areas .
If the analysis is extended further into the future , well beyond 2012 , the Obama agenda accounts for only a slightly higher share of the projected deficits .
The Eco-Lamp
Satish Behera is a design student in India who has been exploring the ancient craft of paper maché as an ecological design material .
His style is so unique , his designs so impressionable that they are hard to forget .
His has created a style that is very professional and objects that are very desirable .
( Pics )
Using nothing more than newspaper , glue and varnish , Behera ’s medium winds around and around itself as it becomes both base and cover , while Behera molds each strip into an elegant cultural work of function and art .
Each work has a patina of its own created by the blend of varnish , glue , and paper ink , adding even more distinctiveness to Behera ’s style .
Eco -Ganesha is a modern , ecological sculpture of an ancient Hindu god , a god who , legend has it , has an elephant head .
It is exquisitely formed with rich detail that ’s astounding when you consider the designer ’s medium .
Eco -Ganesha
The Eco- Lamp or the Paper Table Lamp was a challenge for Behara who writes that the unusual form resulted from his placement of the lamp ’s center of gravity .
Though Behara uses every strip of newspaper he acquires in his exploration , he acknowledges that he had to use “ alien ” products like wire , a bulb and the bulb holder .
This is a functioning lamp with a 60 watt bulb .
Wanting to design something more interesting than a box for a speaker , Behara created the Eco - Speakers to look like large snail shells /
Again , you see his meticulous craftsmanship .
Eco -Speaker
Of course , these works were simply explorations Mr. Behara undertook as part of his design coursework , but they ’re awfully interesting and I should think marketable as well !

Bloomsbury Says " Black Does n't Sell "
Justine Larbalestier 's new " young adult " fiction book " Liar " is about a little black girl named Micah who likes to tell lies but who desperately wants to stop .
Bloomsbury liked her book so much they decided to buy it .
They did n't want her to change the concept at all .
Little black girl who tells lies .
Fine .
They decided they know just how to sell a book about a little black girl who tells lies .
According to Larbalestier , Bloomsbury 's marketing department wanted a photo of a girl on the front because that 's what sells , and they showed Larbalestier many different prototypes , some white , some black .
She said she did n't like any of them and strongly objected to the entire concept .
But since cover decisions are not up to writers , she lost , and Bloomsbury went with the present disingenuous monstrosity .
From Larbalestier 's website : " Since I 've told publishing friends how upset I am with my Liar cover , I have been hearing anecdotes from every single house about how hard it is to push through covers with people of colour on them .
Editors have told me that their sales departments say black covers do n't sell .
Sales reps have told me that many of their accounts wo n't take books with black covers .
Booksellers have told me that they can't give away YAs with black covers .
Authors have told me that their books with black covers are frequently not shelved in the same part of the library as other YA -- they 're exiled to the Urban Fiction section -- and many bookshops simply do n't stock them at all .
How welcome is a black teen going to feel in the YA section when all the covers are white ?
Why would she pick up Liar when it has a cover that so explicitly excludes her ?
" 1 . Since when do black covers not sell ?
Does n't a stamp from Oprah Winfrey basically guarantee a bestseller in this country ?
And what about all of popular music ?
What about nearly every style magazine ?
2 .
Even if black covers do n't sell themselves , so the fuck what ?
Sell them .
That 's your fucking job .
Find a way .
I once sold incense from a cart in the mall for a living .
You sell shit by getting it in people 's faces , holding it under their noses , and making them realize that they want it by talking it up and hustling .
You do n't sell shit by trying to manipulate your customer .
That 's how you get a reputation as a snake .
Black , white .
It does n't matter .
Sell the story .
3 . If a black cover is an absolute deal - breaker , THEN USE SOME OTHER IMAGE .
Like , the word " Liar " up in flames .
Or a central image from the text .
A broken mirror .
ANYTHING .
Do n't put a little white girl on the front of your book about a little black girl .
It 's going to change people 's ideas about the narrative , which is primarily a story about identity in the first place .
In Larbalestier 's own words : " Liar is a book about a compulsive ( possibly pathological ) liar who is determined to stop lying but finds it much harder than she supposed .
I worked very hard to make sure that the fundamentals of who Micah is were believable : that she 's a girl , that she 's a teenager , that she 's black , that she 's USian .
One of the most upsetting impacts of the cover is that it's led readers to question everything about Micah :
If she does n't look anything like the girl on the cover maybe nothing she says is true .
At which point the entire book , and all my hard work , crumbles .
" Remember how Biden did n't get to come on stage during Obama 's acceptance speech until Obama was damn good and done talking ?
There 's a reason for that .
Image control .
This is an utterly stupid move for Bloomsbury and utterly hateful .
I look forward to the print - on - demand future , when readers will be able to choose any cover they like for their books , including ones they design themselves .
You want a black Harry Potter ?
You GET a black Harry Potter .
Maybe at this point it 's time for Larbalestier to think " lawsuit .
"
NOTE : Not that it matters , but Justine Larbalestier is white and from Australia .
If she were black and American , I doubt Bloomsbury would have had the balls to do this .
Then again , they probably would n't have bought her book in the first place .
If Bloomsbury was my publisher , I 'd be outraged right now .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
The United States may have been behind the killing of Neda Agha - Soltan , the 26 - year - old Iranian woman whose fatal videotaped shooting Saturday made her a symbol of opposition to the June 12 presidential election results , the country 's ambassador to Mexico said Thursday .
Neda Agha-Soltan , 26 , was shot to death in Tehran on Saturday .
" This death of Neda is very suspicious , " Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said .
" My question is , how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind , got shot in front of several cameras , and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held ? "
He suggested that the CIA or another intelligence service may have been responsible .
" Well , if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements , then choosing women is an appropriate choice , because the death of a woman draws more sympathy , " Ghadiri said .
In response , CIA spokesman George Little said , " Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong , absurd and offensive . "
Though the video appeared to show that she had been shot in the chest , Ghadiri said that the bullet was found in her head and that it was not of a type used in Iran .
" These are the methods that terrorists , the CIA and spy agencies employ , " he said .
" Naturally , they would like to see blood spilled in these demonstrations , so that they can use it against the Islamic Republic of Iran .
This is of the common methods that the CIA employs in various countries . "
But , he added , " I am not saying that now the CIA has done this .
There are different groups .
It could be the [ work of another ] intelligence service ; it could be the CIA ; it could be the terrorists .
Anyway , there are people who employ these types of methods . "
Asked about his government 's imposition of restrictions on reporting by international journalists , Ghadiri blamed the reporters themselves .
" Some of the reporters and mass media do not reflect the truth , " he said .
For example , he said , international news organizations have lavished coverage on demonstrations by supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi , whom the government has said lost to the incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by a landslide .
But those same news organizations have not shown " many , many demonstrations in favor of the winner , " he said .
Further , he said , members of the international news media have failed to report on people setting banks and buses afire or attacking other people .
" The only things they show are the reactions of the police , " he said .
Because of restrictions on reporting in Iran , CNN has been unable to confirm many of the reports and claims relating to protests .
Ghadiri said it is only fair that security forces protect the lives and property of the Iranian people .
" If in America supporters of Mr. McCain had gotten out on the street and tried to burn the banks during the last election , do you think the police would just sit idly by and be a spectator ? " he asked , referring to the GOP presidential candidate who lost the presidential vote in November to Barack Obama .
Ghadiri called on backers of Moussavi to " accept the majority 's victory . "
Ahmadinejad 's overwhelming victory was no surprise , Ghadiri said , noting that a poll published in the United States three weeks before the June 12 elections showed Ahmadinejad with a commanding lead .
" Why do n't you show that ? " he asked .
Ghadiri also addressed questions about the rapid reporting of the election results , which the opposition has cited as evidence that the ballots were not properly counted .
" It was n't said that only four people counted the 40 million votes , " he said .
" There were tens of thousands of people in Iran who counted these votes .
They declared that this is very simple . "

kudos to slinkerwink and chris bowers and nyceve and others for their excellent action diaries and incessant efforts at demanding the non-negotiable PUBLIC OPTION .
However i've called the White House and the many listed senators and those of the HELP committee every day this week since before last Thursday .
And after imploring daily to tell their elected official including the president that the public plan is NON - NEGOTIABLE ( no to 7 year trigger , no to taxing employer health benefits , no to daschle / dole , etc ) the people on the receiving end of my phonecalls say that they have BARELY heard from us .
This is NO exaggeration .
I was about to cry .
The wingnuts and freepers are winning this .
They , even the blue states at Barbara Boxer or Diane Feinstein 's office ( I 'm from CA ) say they get FAR more calls AGAINST the public option than for it .
This includes the White House .
I told the comment operators at thew the whitehouse or Senate offices that a poll came out yesterday saying 76 % in the new NBC / WSJ poll support the Public Option .
They laughed and asked " Really ? ? ? ? "
P.S. : The white house comment operator told me that if i really want to get my message to the president , you MUST EMAIL AS WELL AS CALLING .
I say that goes for the Senators of the HELP committee listed in slinkerwink 's diary .
UPDATE : i just saw a tv ad for CPRights ( Conservatives for Patients Rights , though the ad did not say the word conservative nor show it ! ) telling people to call congress because Obama 's plan would cause 119 MILLION PEOPLE to lose their health insurance .
ABSOLUTE LIES !

' What 's your handicap ? '
Drug mule with £ 83,000 cocaine hidden in golf clubs is caught out by airport staff
Kayti Dryer has been jailed for four years after attempting to smuggle £ 83,000 of cocaine inside her golf clubs
You would expect someone who takes a set of golf clubs on holiday to have a reasonable understanding of the game .
But when suspicious Customs officials asked Kayti Dryer what her handicap was , she apparently thought they were questioning her about a disability .
When she was unable to answer , they seized the clubs and found £ 83,000 worth of cocaine hidden inside the shafts .
Yesterday the 23 - year - old was starting a four - year prison sentence after admitting smuggling the drugs .
Dryer was questioned after her golf bag was X - rayed at Manchester Airport when she got off a flight from the Caribbean in April .
She claimed to have taken the clubs on holiday to Montego Bay in Jamaica .
An airport source said : ' When asked about her handicap , she looked blank and asked them to repeat the question .
They asked her again , she gave no response .
' She clearly did not know what they were talking about and had no idea it was even a golfing term .
It appeared as if she thought they were asking her if she had a disability . '
Traces of cocaine were revealed when Customs officers swabbed her luggage , and when they cut the clubs into pieces they found a 1 kg stash .
Dryer , who is unemployed and from Lewes in East Sussex , pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court .
Mike O'Grady , of HM Revenue & Customs , said it immediately became obvious that Dryer had something to hide .
' When Dryer was asked questions about golf , it was clear that she was totally unfamiliar with the game and she had no legitimate reason for travelling with the sports equipment , ' he said .
Cocaine was concealed in the shafts of golf clubs carried by Dryer between Jamaica and Manchester Airport
Airport security quizzed Dryer and found the cocaine inside her bag after she failed to answer simple questions about the sport
' This is a serious offence and I would strongly encourage anyone with information relating to drug smuggling to contact us .
' We will take every action to detect , seize and bring those smuggling drugs into the country before the courts . '
Earlier this year former England cricketer Chris Lewis was jailed for 13 years for smuggling cocaine worth £ 140,000 into Britain from the Caribbean island of St Lucia .
The 41 - year - old and a friend , basketball player Chad Kirnon , hid the liquid form of the drug in tins of fruit in a kit bag .
Customs officers have warned that drugs gangs may target sportsmen and women as potential ' mules ' in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics in London .
Experts say traffickers are increasingly using routes from West Africa and Eastern Europe as a result of successful anti-smuggling operations in the Caribbean .
Just as our world buzzes with distractions — from phone calls to e-mails to tweets — the neurons in our brain are bombarded with messages .
Research has shown that when we pay attention , some of these neurons begin firing in unison , like a chorus rising above the noise .
Now , a study in the May 29 issue of Science reveals the likely brain center that serves as the conductor of this neural chorus .
MIT neuroscientists found that neurons in the prefrontal cortex — the brain 's planning center — fire in unison and send signals to the visual cortex to do the same , generating high - frequency waves that oscillate between these distant brain regions like a vibrating spring .
These waves , also known as gamma oscillations , have long been associated with cognitive states like attention , learning , and consciousness .
" We are especially interested in gamma oscillations in the prefrontal cortex because it provides top - down influences over other parts of the brain , " explains senior author Robert Desimone , director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and the Doris and Don Berkey Professor of Neuroscience at MIT .
" We know that the prefrontal cortex is affected in people with schizophrenia , ADHD and many other brain disorders , and that gamma oscillations are also altered in these conditions .
Our results suggest that altered neural synchrony in the prefrontal cortex could disrupt communication between this region and other areas of the brain , leading to altered perceptions , thoughts , and emotions . "
To explain neural synchrony , Desimone uses the analogy of a crowded party with people talking in different rooms .
If individuals raise their voices at random , the noise just becomes louder .
But if a group of individuals in one room chant together in unison , the next room is more likely to hear the message .
And if people in the next room chant in response , the two rooms can communicate .
In the Science study , Desimone looked for patterns of neural synchrony in two " rooms " of the brain associated with attention — the frontal eye field ( FEF ) within the prefrontal cortex and the V4 region of the visual cortex .
Lead authors Georgia Gregoriou , a postdoctoral associate in the Desimone lab , and Stephen Gotts of the National Institute of Mental Health , trained two macaque monkeys to watch a monitor displaying multiple objects , and to concentrate on one of the objects when cued .
They monitored neural activity from the FEF and the V4 regions of the brain when the monkeys were either paying attention to the object or ignoring it .
When the monkeys first paid attention to the appropriate object , neurons in both areas showed strong increases in activity .
Then , as if connected by a spring , the oscillations in each area began to synchronize with one another .
Desimone 's team analyzed the timing of the neural activity and found that the prefrontal cortex became engaged by attention first , followed by the visual cortex — as if the prefrontal cortex commanded the visual region to snap to attention .
The delay between neural activity in these areas during each wave cycle reflected the speed at which signals travel from one region to the other — indicating that the two brain regions were talking to one another .
Desimone suspects this pattern of oscillation is not just specific to attention , but could also represent a more general mechanism for communication between different parts of the brain .
These findings support speculation that gamma synchrony enables far - flung regions of the brain to rapidly communicate with each other — which has important implications for understanding and treating disorders ranging from schizophrenia to impaired vision and attention .
" This helps us think about how to approach studying and treating these disorders by finding ways to restore gamma rhythms in the affected brain regions . "

Amazing footage of lunar probe 's final moments before it crashes into Moon
Footage showing the dramatic descent of a probe minutes before it crashes into the surface of the Moon has been released by the Japanese space agency .
The final moments of the Kaguya lunar probe were caught by its on - board high - definition camera as it hurtled downwards on June 11 and as it fell the images were beamed back to Earth
As it sinks lower and lower the desolate and pockmarked landscape is seen looming ever larger as the spacecraft tumbles toward its final resting place .

Long shadows are visible on the surface because the probe landed on the near side of the Moon in an area where the Sun had just set .
Unfortunately at the end of the sequence the film blacks out because the probe entered a ' shaded ' area where there was no sunlight and as a result its impact was not recorded .
However , its disappearance was picked up back on Earth by astronomers Jeremy Bailey and Steve Lee using the Anglo - Australian Telescope in New South Wales , Australia .
The probe caused a flash of light as it exploded on impact and this light was seen fading away .
The ' controlled crash ' completed the Kaguya 's Moon observation mission , which was launched two years ago on September 14 and cost £ 353 million .
In that time the 3 ton probe which measured 2.1 m long and 4.8 m wide , carried out a survey of the moon and mapped its topography and magnetic field .
Furthermore , a month after its launch it jettisoned two 110 lb ' baby ' satellites to create a map detailing gravitational forces .
Astonishingly , it was powered by just 3.5 kW , which is equivalent to the energy used by two standard hairdryers .

[ caption ]
During the mission is also took clear videos of the lunar surface , breath - taking views of the Earth appearing on the horizon as the probe skims across the surface .
In another stunning sequence it captures the Earth eclipsing the Sun .
At first all that can be seen is blackness but then suddenly a halo appears as the Earth moves away to reveal the Sun .
Researchers hope that the data it has collected on this mission could shed further light on the Moon 's origin and evolution .
The planet remains under close scrutiny as India 's Chandrayaan 1 orbiter , launched in October last year , continues to circle it .

This month Nasa launched two Moon missions of its own to find potential landing sites for human exploration .
One of them is the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , which today successfully entered orbit around the Moon following a five - day journey .
In four days ' time it will finalise its initial orbit .
Its job will be to explore the moon 's craters , examining sunlit and shadowed regions , and provide understanding of the effects of lunar radiation on people .
Part of its mission will be to build up three - dimensional maps of the lunar surface .
The other mission is the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) , which separated from LRO soon after they launched together .
LCROSS is taking a separate path to the Moon and will split into two parts once in orbit .
The first part will hit the moon near the South Pole and make a crater around a third the size of a football pitch .
The second part will fly through the dust and ice raised by the impact and study them before landing several miles away .
Watch the last moments of the Japanese probe ...
Watch a spectacular Earth rise observed the Kaguya probe ...
Well ladies and gentlemen , it looks like the summer heat is here once again !
If you ’ve been reading Trees Full of Money for a while , you ’re probably aware of how passionate I am about the use of geothermal energy to heat and cool your home .
Using energy stored in your own back yard , Geothermal Heat Pumps can save consumers 70 % or more on their yearly heating and cooling bills , and best of all ground source heat pumps have a minimal impact on the environment .
Traditional Geothermal Heating and Cooling Systems are Expensive
Unfortunately , the cost of a professionally installed geothermal system is prohibitive to most homeowners .
Complete residential geothermal systems can cost $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 or more depending on the application .
My Do It Yourself Alternative
Until such time that geothermal systems become less expensive ( or I get a significant windfall of cash ) I would like to share my tips on an alternative way to harvest geothermal energy to “ partially ” cool your home during those sweltering summer days .
This method has been utilized by many homeowners in the northern states for years without them ever realizing that they were tapping into a source of renewable energy .
I have simply “ perfected ” the process to get the most efficient use out of the cool air that is stored inside your home ’s basement .
If your home does n’t have a basement or suitable crawl space beneath it , you will not be able to utilize this technique but you may be interested in reading about it anyway .
What Equipment You Need for My DIY Geothermal Cooling System :
A “ Below Ground ” basement or crawl space with direct access from inside your home ( it also helps if your basement or crawl space has a small window that can be opened to add air flow ) .
A Portable Fan .
Optional : A Portable Dehumidifier
Why My DIY Geothermal Cooling System Works
During hot summer days and cold winter nights , basements in our homes stay relatively mild when compared with the outside temperatures and the temperatures in the main part of your house .
This is a classic example of how geothermal energy works .
The temperature of your basements exterior walls are regulated by the relatively constant temperature of the radiant heat trapped only a few feet down beneath the ground adjacent to your home ’s foundation walls .
These temperatures radiated through your basements walls and cool ( or heats ) the air volume inside your basement .
The trick is getting this usually damp and musty cool air distributed throughout the rest of your home .
After some experimenting , I have finally come up with the most efficient method for achieving this goal .
Setting Up My Do It Yourself Geothermal Cooling System
I place a small dehumidifier in my basement the night before to bring the relative humidity down from over 80 % to less 60 % by the following morning .
I also ensure that all of the window shades are drawn on the “ sunny side ” of my house to minimize the effect of the suns “ solar ” heating .
If your has a relatively low humidity then the use of a dehumidifier may not be necessary .
If the outside temperature gets below 75deg during the night I will leave most of the upstairs windows open in my house with fans sucking in the “ cool ” air until the outside temperature gets above this level .
As the sun comes up and the inside temperature of the house begins to rise I wait until the inside temperature of the house gets above 77deg .
At this point I “ turn on ” my geothermal system by doing the following :
I crack open one of the small windows in my basement just enough to let a little bit of airflow through .
Then ( with all of the other windows closed in the house ) I crack open another window in one of my homes upstairs bedrooms with all doors open between the two windows so that air can flow through ( tip : opening the highest window you have in your home will vent out the most hot air in your home [ heat rises ! ] ) .
You can also close of other areas of the house that you do not wish to cool to maximize the cooling effect in the areas of the house you frequent during the day .
I then place a small window fan in an upstairs window with the flow of air pointing out the window .
This technique effectively suck air up from the basement through the house and then out the window .
The trick is to monitor the temperature of the air on the suction side of your fan as it is being pushed outside .
Close the windows ( and the basement door ) and shut the fan down when the drop in the rooms temperature begins leveling off .
It usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour for all of the cool air to be circulated through depending on your fan ’s power and how large your home is .
If all has gone to plan , the temperature inside your home should have dropped a more tolerable 4 - 5 degrees .
This may buy you a couple of hours time that you do n’t need to run your air conditioner .
Caution :
If you run the fan too long , all of the cool air that was trapped in your basement will be displaced by the warmer outside which will then be sucked up into the rest of your home negating the whole process .
You generally only get one shot at this cool air during the day since it will take at least 6 hours for your cool basement walls to regulate the temperature of the new mass of warm air that has been displaced into your basement .
It may seem like a lot of work but you really get the hang of it after a weekend of testing and if nothing else this DIY geothermal energy project is a fun experiment to share with your family !
Thanks for reading and be sure to check out some of my other articles on personal finance , and alternative energy !
I am also curious to hear how this technique works for you , be sure to comment below with any successes , failures , or criticisms of this method !

At the risk of sounding naïve — actually , check that .
Embracing naïveté with two magnificently clenched thighs , riding naïveté down through the upper atmosphere like the bomb in Dr. Strangelove , I ca n’t understand why I ’m supposed to accept that “ the point ” of the Gold Cup was to audition players for South Africa .
Why was n’t the point of the Gold Cup to , you know , win the Gold Cup ?
You : Soccer in the modern era is a complex hydra - headed thing and competitions have to be prioritized and managed and it ’s all a balancing act and compromise and targeted expectations and the conservation of resources .
Me : Yes , I ’ve heard that .
But I want to suggest — and again , I say this with the concentrated innocence of a body pillow that will one day be made the legal bride of a 35 - year - old Japanese virgin — that this whole system has out - finessed itself .
Seriously , if there were a player who showed the kind of craft and subtlety that we routinely employ in judging the importance of soccer tournaments , he’d be spending the summer professing his loyalty to his current employer while not saying anything to discourage Real Madrid .
Think about this .
Had we lost 2 - 0 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final , no one would have cared ; we would ’ve been all insouciant and “ but think of all the guys who got international experience out of this . ”
But since we lost 5 - 0 , it was suddenly a national emergency .
Dear , mild Christopher Sullivan was calling out Bob Bradley ’s selection policy on TV .
Soccer blogs staged fantasy executions that spilled almost as much imaginary blood as real electric ink .
What , exactly , as fans , are we supposed to do with that ?
How are we even supposed to prepare for a game when we do n’t care if we lose it , but do care if we lose it by a lot ?
We ’ve gone way beyond saying a tournament is important or unimportant , like it ’s a switch that we flip .
We ’ve put the thing on a dimmer knob , and we ’re actually taking in tournaments at just the right softly ambiguous level for a dinner party with semi-decent wine .
Now , obviously , this is n’t only an issue for America , and it is n’t only an issue for soccer .
Lots of sports , at least outside the monolithic season - playoff - championship structures of the major American leagues , suffer from confusion over which competitions are the ones people are meant to care about .
Boxing ’s probably the most obvious example , since at any given time over the last hundred years there may have been an actual champion , or there may have been a group of mugs holding some percentage of the 237 variously sanctioned belts .
But soccer has taken this to the point that barely a week goes by when we do n’t find ourselves watching a team not quite trying to a win a game they ’re not exactly interested in — to the point that this is such a distinct match genre that it ought to have its own name , the way some late - season games are called “ six- pointers . ”
( Maybe a “ half - pointer ” ?
Maybe a “ Sisyphus game ” ? )
So what ’s the problem with this ?
To put it very , very naïvely , the problem with this is that it is n’t fun .
Whatever sport is supposed to do for us , whether you think it ’s entertainment or food for the spirit or an excuse to drink liquors and opine , it clearly is n’t supposed to make us endure this kind of strategic quasi- defeatism .
To put this another way — and try to suspend your reality - based objections for a second and just imagine this simply — what would have been more fun , the Gold Cup we just watched or a Gold Cup in which the American stars who beat Spain last month went all - out against the best players from Mexico ?
What sounds like more fun , a Gold Cup that was a semi-unimportant chance to give some untried players a run-out , or a Gold Cup that people cared about like it was the continental championship it ’s supposed to be ?
That people cared about , say , the way they care about the European Championships ?
You : But we have World Cup qualifiers coming up .
We ca n’t wear everybody out .
Plus , we ca n’t risk messing up anyone ’s European career .
For God ’s sake , the Gooch is at A.C. Milan !
Me : I know .
I do n’t know what I ’m thinking .
Clearly no other continent is able to stage a championship that good players play in and everyone tries to win .
Clearly that is an impossible goal , as I was just thinking to myself yesterday when watching a clip of Joan Tomàs scoring the winning goal for Spain in Euro 2008 .
Anyway , I understand that this is how things are , and there are n’t any immediate fixes for it at either club or national level .
( Oh , but what the hell : make participation in national cups optional ; make the Europa League a single - elimination tournament [ which would actually make it more fun than the Champions League on some levels ] ; tie continental championship tournaments to World Cup qualification ; make Franz Beckenbauer the FIFA czar of enforcing the rules on clubs that hold their players back from international tournaments and make the penalty for infraction a weekend seminar hosted by Franz Beckenbauer .
None of these suggestions is a joke , by the way . )
I just think that amid all the hands - being - wrung - so - hard - they - spontaneously - burst - into - flame that ’s followed the Mexico game , we could stand to realize that part of the problem is that we ’ve created a continental championship that no one knows how to feel about .
If we had a North American championship that unambiguously mattered — or if , to go even more pie - in - the - sky , soccer were organized so that , you know , teams were motivated to win the competitions they entered — our current outrage - or - not would n’t be complicated by the fact that we treated the Gold Cup as a clinical trial to determine whether Kyle Beckerman was a World Cup - quality player .
( Since there was obviously so much uncertainty on that point . )
Instead , we got what we got , and as is so often the case in this sport , wound up who knows where .

Reuters reports that blasts at the Ritz - Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta killed at least 9 people , as well as injuring at least 50 .
In addition , Reuters has reported that a car bomb has been detonated at a toll road in North Jakarta not long after - although the Dow Jones news wires report this last explosion was not caused by a bomb but by a pick - up truck , catching fire .
According to eyewitness reports , the blast in both hotels took place just minutes apart , and emanating from within the buildings , pointing to either an attack by suicide bombers - or to the possibility that the explosives were planted there beforehand .
Reports by the Straits Times indicate the latter option is the most probable , as an unexploded bomb has been found and defused at the Marriott hotel .
In any case , all eyewitness accounts say the blasts clearly occurred from the inside out .
Greg Woolstencroft , chief technical officer at a local television station , was near the scene at the time of the explosions .
He told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper : “ I ’ve actually lived at the Ritz - Carlton for 12 months , that hotel has probably got the highest security of any hotel in Indonesia .
And I just do n’t know how someone could get in there with a bomb , given the level of security , the level of screening people have to go through .
I just do n’t know how that person got that bomb in . ”
“ Given the bombing that happened at the Marriott previously ” , Woolstencrof added , “ you ca n’t actually drive into the lobby .
You ’ve got to come through , more effectively at the back of the building to get into the front of the building .
And there there ’s major metal barriers , the vehicles are searched , there ’s armed guards at that checkpoint , once you go up to the lobby there ’s metal detectors , your bags are searched before you go through those metal detectors .
There ’s another area where you go into the basement and the vehicles are checked once again before you go into the basement .
So that ’s the sort of level of security there is , you know , so I just do n’t know how a person would be able to get that bomb in , unless there was some level of cooperation , I do n’t know . ”

All corporate fingers meanwhile point toward the radical Islamists organisation Jemaah Islamiyah ( or ‘ Islamic Organisation ’ ) led by wanted terrorist Noordin Mohammed Top , who has been held responsible for the 2003 attacks on the Marriott hotel as well as the Australian embassy in the following year .
It ’s widely believed that the organization has links with al - Qaeda .
Although Clive Williams at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in Canberra speculated that “ The likelihood is that it was Noordin Top ’s cell that was responsible ” for the recent attacks , a Reuters India report says “ some analysts are investigating whether some Jemaah Islamiyah members are rekindling links with jihadists in Pakistan , raising the question of whether the Jakarta bombings were a purely domestic attack or whether they may have been directed or co-ordinated from abroad . ”
Among those lucky to be alive , is American business lobbyist James Castle and , interestingly , the director of the huge Freeport - McMoran goldmine in the Indonesian Province of West Papua ( owned by Freeport Mc Moran Copper & Gold Inc , operating out of Phoenix , Arizona ) .
Craig Senger , Austrade Commissioner in charge of Mining , was also present when the bombs exploded - reports the Daily Telegraph .
A little extra research reveals something very interesting .
In the course of the last couple of weeks before the blasts in Jakarta , a series of deadly ambushes in the vicinity of several Freeport - owned goldmines in Indonesia ’s remote province of Papua - New Guinea took place .
Although according to the New York Times , Indonesian authorities first blamed separatists in the Free Papua Movement for the attacks , Papuan officials have rejected the possibility , saying “ the ( Free Papua ) movement lacked the kind of sophisticated weapons used in the ambushes . ”
Indonesian news outlets have meanwhile speculated that “ military or police officials , who are paid by Freeport for protection , may have directed the ambushes to secure their business . ”
According to AFP , the Indonesian defence minister Juwono Sudarsono told reporters that foreign NGOs and governments had a history of backing groups that “ agitate ” in Papua .
When asked which countries he was referring to , Sudarsono stated : “ Apparently many neighbouring countries to the South . ” - meaning Australia and New Zealand .
The Indonesian defence minister also told reporters “ he did not believe military or police were involved in the attacks on the US owned goldmines but conceded “ rogue elements ” from security forces could be responsible . ”
A Melbourne born employee of the goldmine , Lukan Biggs , who came under attack in one of the ambushes in the first weeks of July , told the Herald Sun that “ The shooting was planned .
( It ’s ) clear they were using weapons belonging to the police or the military . ”
What an amazing coincidence that the director of the huge Freeport goldmine was present at the Marriott Hotel when the blasts occurred .
The same Freeport , that had been subjected to several ambushes the weeks before , possibly set in motion by foreign governments .
On July 8 , Reuters also reported , a bus and security post were set ablaze near the massive Grasberg mine in Papua , run by a unit of Freeport - McMoran .
Reuters also reported that the Grasberg mine has “ the world ’s largest recoverable reserves of copper and the largest gold reserve ” .
The Asia Times reported that the Indonesian military ( TNI ) “ provides security services to multinational enterprises like the world ’s largest goldmine , owned by Freeport Mc Moran . ”
The first reports point to the possibility of a false flag event , where the perpetrators both attempted to assassinate the Freeman - McMoran goldmine director , and reinvigorate the war on terror in the same attempt .
The presence of the Freeport director at the Marriott Hotel at the time of the blasts could therefore be viewed as the last in a series of attacks on the US owned enterprise ( reputedly the largest in the world ) and - subsequently - the attacks themselves as a geopolitical false flag attack , killing two birds with one stone .

Experts warn Tasmanian devils could be extinct in the wild within 20 years
Australia has lifted protection levels for the Tasmanian devil , the world 's largest surviving marsupial carnivore , from vulnerable to endangered .
The devil population , which is found on the island state of Tasmania , has been decimated by a facial tumour disease .
The number of Tasmanian devils in the wild is thought to have fallen by up to 70 % since the mid-1990s .
The new conservation status will give the animals greater protection under national environment laws .
Strong action
The devils have been ravaged by an outbreak of facial tumours the size of small golf balls .
The cancers are mostly concentrated around the mouth and head .
The disease is contagious and is spread among groups of devils through biting .
Tumour cells are not neutralised by the marsupial 's immune system because of a lack of genetic diversity among the population that exists in the wild only in Tasmania .
Infected animals die within months of the symptoms first appearing .
Despite intense scientific research , a cure has not been found .
Australia 's Environment Minister Peter Garrett said that strong action was being taken to find out more about this mysterious disease and to stop its spread .
Some estimates have suggested their numbers are falling fast and could be as low as 20,000 .
Just The Right Man For The Job
The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a good one ; scientist creates serum that erupts his violent , ultra-strong and monstrous alter - ego .
The actor playing him must have the skills and nuances to display the inner turmoil of the good doctor at once trying to find a cure , and enjoying the power at his possession .
All very interesting stuff and potentially brilliant in the right hands .
So , of course , they gave it to Keanu Reeves .
I do n’t know if anyone else has noticed this , but I ’m pretty sure Keanu had a stroke or something in the early 90’s .
At one point he was the awesome surfer dude in the Bill & Ted movies , Point Break , Parenthood , all that good stuff … and then BAM ! , he seemed incapable of human emotion .
The “ character traits ” of apathy , detachment and cynicism he displayed in Constatine , The Day The Earth Stood Still , The Matrix trilogy , et al could just as easily be described as an entire lack of acting skill .
On the plus side , he does seem to have discovered the fountain of youth .
Or , if not youth , then at least “ age stabilizing . ”
I seem to have gotten off topic at some point .
After the chill of the Bush era , ties between America and Islam can only get better — but how much better ?
Aurora
IT IS three years since Senator Barack Obama pronounced that America “ is no longer a Christian nation — at least , not just . ”
The words sounded harsher than he intended : he meant to make the point in a more positive way , stressing that the United States was as much a Jewish , Muslim , Buddhist , Hindu or non-believing polity as a Christian one .
In Turkey in April the president seemed to turn the formula on its head , declaring that “ We do not consider ourselves a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation ” but “ a nation of citizens ” bound by values .
And in a warmly received speech in Cairo on June 4th , which repeatedly cited the Koran , he called for a “ new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world ” based on the “ truth that America and Islam are not exclusive , and need not be in competition . ”
The philosophy may not be perfectly coherent , but the mood music is clear — absolute opposition to sectarianism , to any emphasis on religious difference rather than commonality .
And quite a lot of Muslims seem willing to hear it .
Take the reaction to a recent appointment that caused far more interest outside America than inside it .
When Dalia Mogahed , an Egyptian - American social scientist , was invited in April to join a White House advisory panel , the press in her native land gushed with excitement .
This was not just because Ms Mogahed , who analyses the Islamic world for Gallup , a polling organisation , is a devout Muslim .
Her appointment ( to a 25 - strong panel on “ faith - based and neighbourhood partnership ” ) was also hailed as an endorsement of her argument that Islamic and Western values are more compatible than civilisational warriors think .
The exuberant reaction to Ms Mogahed 's nomination suggests that , for those willing to look , there are easy ways to warm up relations between the United States and the Muslim world ( including America 's Muslims ) ; the Obama presidency is busy finding them .
Such was the suspicion between most Americans and most Muslims in the Bush era that it did not take much to improve the climate .
One thing that helps is big presidential speeches ( in Turkey in April and in Cairo this week ) ; another is a sprinkling of domestic job offers , mostly to younger Muslim Americans .
In Turkey Mr Obama 's visit is remembered less for what he said , than for some neat choreography that managed to please devout Muslims without upsetting secularists .
His body language went down well —
“ He 's like us , eastern , warm . ”
And as some recent Gallup findings show , the change of guard in the White House led to an immediate upturn in attitudes to America 's leadership among most Arab Muslims ( see chart 1 ) , with the exception of Lebanese and Palestinians .
Meanwhile the American public perceives the Muslim world as hostile to the United States , but it does not — to anything like the same extent — reciprocate that hostility .
Although a steady 80 % of Americans believe Muslim countries are unfavourably disposed to their homeland , only 39 % of Americans ( see chart 2 ) return the compliment by voicing “ unfavourable ” attitudes to the Muslim world .
This suggests that a section , at least , of America 's electorate is open to the idea of better links with Islam .
In Washington 's establishment , meanwhile , venerable figures like Madeleine Albright ( who as secretary of state gave military help to the Balkan Muslims ) are rehearsing reasons why America and Islam can be friends .
For groups committed to that principle , the change in climate feels dramatic .
Daisy Khan , co-founder of the American Society for Muslim Advancement , predicts that a wave of second - generation Muslim - Americans will now enter politics , unlike their cautious , apolitical parents .
In Obama 's America , she thinks , the overseas ties of Muslims can help with civic diplomacy .
Well , perhaps not all overseas ties .
Parts of the American Muslim world are still in shock over long sentences handed out in May to five leaders of the Holy Land Foundation , a charity , on charges of helping Hamas .
As a result of the trial , America 's law enforcers have scaled down once - friendly ties with some Muslim - American bodies .
In its choice of Muslim personnel , the Obama administration has artfully sought out people with little involvement in the messy world of institutional Muslim politics .
But making easy gains , and dodging controversies , including religious ones , has its limits .
Hard choices may lie ahead in the area of religious liberty .
Philosophically , America 's Commission on International Religious Freedom ( a bipartisan body that advises Congress and the White House ) is in step with the Obama mood .
Its latest global report stresses that in many places , Muslims are victims of discrimination , not its perpetrators .
Suffering Muslims ( be they Uighurs in China or Shias in repressive Sunni states like Saudi Arabia ) need America 's support — as part of a foreign policy that favours just , tolerant societies .
So the commission believes , and so the Obama people , in theory , say too .
But how far will the president go in scolding states identified by the commission ?
Its report adds five new countries ( including Iraq , Nigeria and Pakistan ) to the eight already classed as “ countries of particular concern ” over religious liberty .
Among 11 countries placed on the commission 's “ watch list ” are Afghanistan , Indonesia , Tajikistan , Turkey — and Egypt .
Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , will meet the commissioners soon , and they will have some hard questions for her .
The extraordinary and eccentric emphasis on " belief " in Christianity today is an accident of history that has distorted our understanding of religious truth .
We call religious people " believers " , as though acceptance of a set of doctrines was their principal activity , and before undertaking the religious life many feel obliged to satisfy themselves about the metaphysical claims of the church , which cannot be proven rationally since they lie beyond the reach of empirical sense data .
Most other traditions prize practice above creedal orthodoxy : Buddhists , Hindus , Confucians , Jews and Muslims would say religion is something you do , and that you cannot understand the truths of faith unless you are committed to a transformative way of life that takes you beyond the prism of selfishness .
All good religious teaching – including such Christian doctrines as the Trinity or the Incarnation – is basically a summons to action .
Yet instead of being taught to act creatively upon them , many modern Christians feel it is more important to " believe " them .
Why ?
In most pre-modern cultures , there were two recognised ways of attaining truth .
The Greeks called them mythos and logos .
Both were crucial and each had its particular sphere of competence .
Logos ( " reason ; science " ) was the pragmatic mode of thought that enabled us to control our environment and function in the world .
It had , therefore , to correspond accurately to external realities .
But logos could not assuage human grief or give people intimations that their lives had meaning .
For that they turned to mythos , an early form of psychology , which dealt with the more elusive aspects of human experience .
Stories of heroes descending to the underworld were not regarded as primarily factual but taught people how to negotiate the obscure regions of the psyche .
In the same way , the purpose of a creation myth was therapeutic ; before the modern period no sensible person ever thought it gave an accurate account of the origins of life .
A cosmology was recited at times of crisis or sickness , when people needed a symbolic influx of the creative energy that had brought something out of nothing .
Thus the Genesis myth , a gentle polemic against Babylonian religion , was balm to the bruised spirits of the Israelites who had been defeated and deported by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar during the sixth century BCE .
Nobody was required to " believe " it ; like most peoples , the Israelites had a number of other mutually - exclusive creation stories and as late as the 16th century , Jews thought nothing of making up a new creation myth that bore no relation to Genesis but spoke more directly to their tragic circumstances at that time .
Above all , myth was a programme of action .
When a mythical narrative was symbolically re-enacted , it brought to light within the practitioner something " true " about human life and the way our humanity worked , even if its insights , like those of art , could not be proven rationally .
If you did not act upon it , it would remain as incomprehensible and abstract – like the rules of a board game , which seem impossibly convoluted , dull and meaningless until you start to play .
Religious truth is , therefore , a species of practical knowledge .
Like swimming , we cannot learn it in the abstract ; we have to plunge into the pool and acquire the knack by dedicated practice .
Religious doctrines are a product of ritual and ethical observance , and make no sense unless they are accompanied by such spiritual exercises as yoga , prayer , liturgy and a consistently compassionate lifestyle .
Skilled practice in these disciplines can lead to intimations of the transcendence we call God , Nirvana , Brahman or Dao .
Without such dedicated practice , these concepts remain incoherent , incredible and even absurd .
But during the modern period , scientific logos became so successful that myth was discredited , the logos of scientific rationalism became the only valid path to truth , and Newton and Descartes claimed it was possible to prove God 's existence , something earlier Jewish , Christian and Muslim theologians had vigorously denied .
Christians bought into the scientific theology , and some embarked on the doomed venture of turning their faith 's mythos into logos .
It was during the late 17th century , as the western conception of truth became more notional , that the word " belief " changed its meaning .
Previously , bileve meant " love , loyalty , commitment " .
It was related to the Latin libido and used in the King James Bible to translate the Greek pistis ( " trust ; faithfulness ; involvement " ) .
In demanding pistis , therefore , Jesus was asking for commitment not credulity : people must give everything to the poor , follow him to the end , and commit totally to the coming Kingdom .
By the late 17th century , however , philosophers and scientists had started to use " belief " to mean an intellectual assent to a somewhat dubious proposition .
We often assume " modern " means " superior " , and while this is true of science and technology , our religious thinking is often undeveloped .
In the past , people understood it was unwise to confuse mythos with logos , but today we read the mythoi of scripture with an unparalleled literalism , and in " creation science " we have bad science and inept religion .
The question is : how can we extricate ourselves from the religious cul - de- sac we entered about 300 years ago ?
Dear South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster ,
Two days ago you accused craigslist , and me personally , of engaging in criminal acts , reiterating your previous threat to file unwarranted and unconstitutional charges against us that are clearly barred by federal law .
As you put it , “ We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution . ”
These very serious allegations followed the dramatic changes we implemented last week , widely applauded by other Attorneys General , that go far beyond the policies and procedures you yourself personally endorsedjust 6 months ago , as indicated by your signature on the Joint Statement .
So effective in fact , that our “ adult services ” and soon - to - be- retired “ erotic services ” sections combined , for all cities in South Carolina , currently feature a total of 40 ads , all of which comply with our terms of use .
That ’s 40 ads out of a total of 334,180 currently listed on our SC sites .
The rest comprise athriving marketplace for South Carolinians , offering jobs , housing , for sale items , local services , and just about everything else .
Many prominent companies , including AT&T , Microsoft , and Village Voice Media , not to mention major newspapers and other upstanding South Carolina businesses feature more “ adult services ” ads than does craigslist , some of a very graphic nature .
For a small sampling , look ( careful NSFW ) here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here .
Have you fully considered the implications of your accusations against craigslist ?
What ’s a crime for craigslist is clearly a crime for any company .
Are you really prepared to condemn the executives of each of the mainstream companies linked above , and all the others that feature such ads , as criminals ?
craigslist may not matter in your world view , despite our popularity among your constituents , but might n’t you want an endorsement from any of the SC newspapers for your gubenatorial campaign , whose publishers you ’ve just labeled as criminals ?
Do you really intend to launch a criminal investigation against the phone company ?
What about potential new jobs connected to big data center buildouts in SC by Internet companies ?
Are you * sure * you want to prosecute all of their CEOs as criminals ???
If you are threatening our founder Craig Newmark , a board member with no operational role at craigslist other than as a customer service representative , then you are expanding your list of “ criminal suspects ” to include thousands of employees at the above - named companies , or the companies ’ boards of directors , or both .
Mr McMaster , I strongly recommend you reconsider and retract your remarks , and positively affirm that you have no intention of launching criminal investigations aimed at any of these upstanding companies , because in truth none of them are deserving of such treatment .
Certainly when it comes to craigslist , by any objective standard your threats and accusations are unreasonable and unfair :
threats of criminal prosecution are utterly unwarranted by the facts
the charges threatened are unconstitutional and barred by federal law
our adult ad screening regimen is stricter than the one you endorsed
our adult services ads are fewer and tamer than other SC venues
We ’re willing to accept our share of criticism , but wrongfully accusing craigslist of criminal misconduct is simply beyond the pale .
We would very much appreciate an apology at your very earliest convenience .
As I ’m sure would all of the other fine companies whose executives you ’ve called out as criminals .
Sincerely Yours ,
Jim Buckmaster
CEO , craigslist

The eating habits of American children appear to be shifting .
And for a change , the news is good .
Chicken nuggets , burgers , fries and colas remain popular with the under - 13 set , of course .
But new market research shows that consumption of these foods at restaurants is declining , while soup , yogurt , fruit , grilled chicken and chocolate milk are on the rise .
The findings , based on survey data by the Chicago market research firm NPD Group , follow a report last year that childhood obesity appears to have hit a plateau after rising for more than two decades .
That finding , reported by The Journal of the American Medical Association , has been greeted with guarded optimism , and it remains unclear whether efforts to limit junk food and increase physical activity in schools have had a meaningful effect on the way children eat .
But the new data suggest that a number of factors , from the economic downturn to new offerings from fast - food giants , may be influencing a general shift in eating preferences among children .
The data , from NPD ’s Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends , are collected from a representative sample of 3,500 households and 500 teenagers who give detailed information on their restaurant habits .
The figures are considered highly reliable because the researchers collect answers daily , asking participants what they and their family ate and ordered at restaurants the day before .
While this recall method is never 100 percent reliable , the data , collected since 1976 , provide a consistent look at long - term trends .
Politics and video games barely have anything in common , except for a few simulators that put the players in charge of their own countries .
But it seems that , at least in real life , politicians have seen gaming as a widespread phenomenon and , instead of trying to comprehend it and endorse both video game developers and the players , they have decided to regulate it and impose harsh rules and laws .
Germany is the most recent example , as we have now learned that the European country , after going through some big scandals regarding shootings at various schools throughout its territory by angry teenagers , has decided to strictly prohibit violent video games .
The latest victim of this “ crusade ” against violence is the ever - so - popular Counter Strike first - person shooter , a favorite of many gamers all around the world , especially in Germany .
It now seems that the title cannot be offered to public view and is strictly prohibited from government - owned buildings .
This measure has led to the dismantlement of one of Germany 's biggest gaming LAN parties , Convention - X - Treme , as Counter Strike was the major title that would have been played during the conference by almost all the gamers .
Of course , this measure does n't affect the conventions , which are held on private property , but it has severely hampered any type of video game activity that wanted to be accessible and fun at the same time .
Rumors are also flying around that World of Warcraft , the popular MMORPG with over 11,5 million subscribers around the world , has also been banned from public play by several German ruling bodies .
This is definitely a prime example of the government messing with things it does n't want to understand .
Despite being one of the biggest European markets for video games and home to a lot of high - quality developers , Germany is slowly , but steadily , denying any such sort of activity that would even try to show kids and teenagers violent behavior .
Do you think that the European country will realize just what it is doing , or that will it continue to ban any sort of video game that even reveals remote physical contact among its characters ?

Five - a- day :
What you need to know
All good
* Fresh , frozen , chilled , canned and dried fruit and vegetables all count towards your five - a- day .
You do n't have to eat them on their own either – they can be in soups , stews , sandwiches , pasta sauces or puddings .
* Fruit and veg in ready meals and convenience foods do count , but be careful – these meals tend to have a high salt , sugar and fat content which could do more harm than good in large quantities .
* To get five - a- day you need to be eating five different fruits or veggies – five portions of broccoli still only counts as one .
Fruit juice only counts as one portion , no matter how much you drink .
* Five pieces a day is not an average – it's a minimum .
The more fruit and veg you eat , the better .
Bad bad bad
* Dietary supplements like vitamins and minerals do n't count .
* Potatoes and other starchy carbs such as yams and cassava are n't included in the five - a- day quota .
Neither are chips ...
Hollywood , CA – The third installment in the highly - successful Transformer movie franchise will feature a world record breaking two - hour explosion .
The movie is tentatively titled Transformers Go Boom .
" It would be easy with today 's technology to just create an endless loop of explosion that lasts two hours , but audiences can get that from an animated GIF file , " said director Michael Bay .
" Instead we 're working with top pyrotechnic and computer graphic artists to create a unique two - hour explosion .
I 've got a budget of over a hundred million dollars , so you can bet it 's going to be awesome . "
Bay did n't want to reveal other details of the plot , but sources at the studio expects the final cut to run for less than two hours and five minutes .
Moviegoers can also expect the loudest explosion they 've ever heard .
Theaters will have to upgrade their sound systems to the newly designed Bay Bone Breaker Sound System , which will envelop viewers with over 250 decibels of explosive sound .

FLASHBACK VIDEO : Brad covers arrest with ' Fox News Alert ' on FNC last October amidst phony ACORN brouhaha ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/17/2009 , 5:30 pm PT
What 's perhaps most interesting here is what is n't mentioned in this story , as written on the Los Angeles Times ' " L.A. Now " blog .
First , here 's their entire blog item ...
The owner of a voter - registration company pleaded guilty Tuesday to voter - registration fraud , according to the Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office .
Laguna Beach resident Mark Jacoby , who collects signatures for petition drives , pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to three years ' probation and 30 days of service with the California Department of Transportation .
Jacoby , owner of Young Political Majors , registered to vote at Los Angeles addresses that were not his own .
State law requires petition circulators to be qualified voters .
Jacoby will also be required to show proof he is registered at his correct address .
And what they did n't bother to mention in that story ?... Amongst other things , the fact that Jacoby and Young Political Majors were hired by the California Republican Party to head up their voter registration efforts in the state .
Jacoby had been arrested for Voter Registration Fraud last October , smack dab during the media 's orgasmic heights of last year 's phony GOP ACORN " Voter Fraud " hoax , even as Fox " News " ( and the other news outlets who similarly fell for the scam ) was going wall - to - wall with unsupported insinuations about voter fraud by ACORN , Democrats , and Obama .
I heard the news about the arrest of Jacoby just as I was heading out for an appearance on Fox " News , " so I was able to break the news on - air in my own " Fox ' News ' Alert . "
( Video originally posted here , reposted at bottom of this item . )
Given the way the LA Times blog " covered " the story of Jacoby 's plea --- not even mentioning the fact that this guy and his group were hired by the California state Republican Party ---
I 'd say it 's a fair bet Fox would n't even have bothered to mention the original arrest at all had I not been on air and forcing them to do so myself .
Much as they are unlikely to bother reporting Jacoby 's plea today .
Ya think if the head of ACORN had made such a plea ( or even been arrested at all ) it might have been covered just a bit on Fox " News " ?
* * *
Here 's the video from my appearance on Fox with inveterate GOP voter fraud hoaxster John Fund , on October 19 , 2008 .
I broke the news of the arrest of the head of the CA GOP 's voter registration outfit , which I had just received from the CA Secretary of State 's office , in my own " Fox ' News ' Alert " ...
UPDATE : I had n't noted it originally ( though it 's available in a number of the links in the story above ) , but though Jacoby pleaded guilty to the most benign offense , in fact , his company is alleged to have changed thousands of registrations from Democratic to Republican , assuring that those voters would not be able to vote , as expected , in the Democratic primary .
When they did n't outright fake voter signatures on change of registration forms , they used tricks to get voters to give their signature , fooling them into thinking they were signing a petition against child molesters or for cancer hospital funding .
And since it's not clear to so many of the wingnuts linking into this post , allow me to underscore again that this was the head of the firm , which is also under investigation in three other states for similar activity .
That all , of course , is a very different situation from ACORN where it was a handful of workers who were accused of registration fraud , and defrauding ACORN themselves , before being turned into official by ACORN themselves !
Clear on that now , wingnuts ?
In the meantime , while voters were unable to cast votes at all thanks to Jacoby and YPM , there is not a single allegation of any actual voter fraud having been committed by , or at the behest of ACORN .
They are , however , guilty of registering thousands upon thousands of low to middle income voters , who tend to vote Democratic , and thus , they continue to be the target of phony , baseless attacks from the desperate rightwing .
There are three fundamental ways of learning about the world , and they map well to concepts we ’re all familiar with :
Philosophy : Determine the nature of reality by thinking about it .
Science : Determine the nature of reality by testing it .
Religion : Determine the nature of reality by accepting an external explanation on faith .
Reduced , these become :
Thinking Testing Accepting
A number of these blend together in practice .
For example , science often starts with thinking and then moves on to testing .
And philosophy is often interested in determining if its models are correct , and may employ testing to that end .
Faith , or accepting , seems the most vulnerable to modernity under this light , since faith basically means believing absolutely without evidence .
Think about which combination of these you use to learn about the world .
And ask yourself if you ’re happy with the answer .
( CNN ) --
A major earthquake struck off the coast of New Zealand 's South Island Wednesday night , rattling residents and prompting a tsunami warning that was later canceled .
The 7.8 - magnitude quake generated a small , 6 - inch tsunami in Jackson Bay , on the west coast of South Island and a 2 - inch tsunami reported in the Tasman Sea to the north of the epicenter , according to the the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center .
Twenty minutes after the tremor , a 5.8 - magnitude aftershock struck the same region , according to the U.S. Geological Survey , which measures earthquakes around the world .
Australia has warned residents on an island between its east coast and New Zealand to head to higher ground in case of a tsunami .
The initial quake struck around 8:22 p.m. local time ( 9:22 a.m. UTC /5:22 a.m. ET ) and its epicenter was located 150 km ( 95 miles ) west - northwest of Invercargill , according to the USGS .
It is a sparsely populated area of New Zealand .
Map of where the quake struck »
The aftershock struck in about the same area , according to the USGS .
A tsunami warning was issued for New Zealand as a precaution shortly after the initial quake , but was canceled about an hour and a half later .
The warning center said the tsunamis that were generated " may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicenter . "
But , it added , local authorities can assume the threat has passed " for those areas when no major waves are observed for two hours after the estimated time of arrival or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours . "
Australia 's Lord Howe Island -- located more than 600 km ( 350 miles ) off its east coast -- is under a land and marine tsunami warning , the Australian government 's meteorological bureau said .
People living in low - lying areas are advised to head to higher ground , while those on the coast should travel inland as a precaution .
So far , there have been no reports of major damage .
Jill Tauri , who owns a campground in Te Anau near the epicenter , told CNN that she got in a doorway as the quake shook her building .
" It continued to rock and roll for 30 seconds or more , " she said .
" ( It ) seemed like an awful long time . "
Tauri , who has experienced several earthquakes , said she then got in her car to check on her customers .
" Some of them have never experienced anything like it before , " she said .
" One man had packed his bag and he was off , he was going to leave ... but he settled down , he was OK .
I just explained there would probably be some aftershocks and they were all very well . "
The tremor also shook buildings in Queenstown -- located about 110 miles northwest of the epicenter -- and scared residents who ran into the streets , according to the New Zealand Herald .
The quake , which was felt across South Island , downed power and phone lines , the newspaper reported .
" It was n't very violent , more of a rolling feel , " Simon Darby , a resident of the inland town of Wanaka , told the Herald .
" But it had a power about it -- I ran straight outside into the carpark . "
A resident of Invercargill told Television New Zealand that the quake lasted about a minute .
" Things just started to rattle a bit , then the house started to sway , " the man told TVNZ .
He said he and his wife got their three young children out of bed and huddled under a table during the quake , according to the network .
The quake cracked part of his house around the door frames .

The Ideographic Myth
The concept of ideographic writing is a most seductive notion .
There is great appeal in the concept of written symbols conveying their message directly to our minds , thus bypassing the restrictive intermediary of speech .
And it seems so plausible .
Surely ideas immediately pop into our minds when we see a road sign , a death 's head label on a bottle of medicine , a number on a clock .
Are n't Chinese characters a sophisticated system of symbols that similarly convey meaning without regard to sound ?
Are n't they an ideographic system of writing ?

The answer to these questions is no .
Chinese characters are a phonetic , not an ideographic , system of writing , as I have attempted to show in the preceding pages .
Here I would go further :
There never has been , and never can be , such a thing as an ideographic system of writing .
How then did this concept originate , and why has it received such currency among specialists and the public at large ?
Origin of the Myth
The concept of Chinese writings as a means of conveying ideas without regard to speech took hold as part of the chinoiserie fad among Western intellectuals that was stimulated by the generally highly laudatory writings of Catholic missionaries from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries .
The first Western account of the fascinatingly different / Chinese writing was the comment made by the Portuguese Dominican Friar Gaspar da Cruz in 1569 :
A revised version of this chapter appears in Difficult Characters
The Chinas [ Chinese ] have no fixed letters in their writing , for all that they write is by characters , and they compose words of these , whereby they have a great multitude of characters , signifying each thing by a character in such sort that one only character signifies " Heaven , " another " earth , " and another " man , " and so forth with everything else .
[ Boxer 1953:161-162 ]
Cruz 's remarks about Chinese were given wider currency when they were repeated by Juan Gonzales de Mendoza in a book that went through thirty editions in the principal European languages before the end of the century .
A more authoritative description of Chinese writing was advanced by the renowned Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci ( 1552-1610 ) .
His original manuscript , written in Italian , was not published until 1942 , but it was used by a fellow missionary , Nicola Trigault , as the basis for a " liberal version " in Latin that was published in 1615 and went through ten editions in various European languages in the next few decades ( Ricci 1942 : CLXXVI - CLXXVII ) .
From this Latin version of Ricci 's observations , European readers learned that the Chinese have a system of writing " similar to the hieroglyphic signs of the Egyptians " and that they " do not express their concepts by writing , like most of the world , with a few alphabetic signs , but they paint as many symbols as there are words . "
Readers also learned that " each word has its own hieroglyphic character , " that " there are no fewer symbols than words , " and that " the great number of characters is in accord with the great number of things , " though thanks to combining them the characters " do not exceed seventy to eighty thousand " ( Trigault 1615:25 - 29 , 144 ) .
The Popularity among European scholars of these early works on things Chinese is matched by the huge eighteenth - century collection of missionary reports and essays entitled Mémoires concernant l'histoire , les sciences , les arts , les moeurs , les usages , &c des Chinois , par les missionaries de Pekin .
Here the discussion of Chinese characters was introduced in an article signed " Ko , Jés . "
He was one of a number of Chinese converts who spent some time in France and provided information to the missionaries .
In his discussion of the characters the author presented the view that
they are composed of symbols and images , and that these symbols and images , not having any sound , can be read in all languages , and form a sort of intellectual painting , a metaphysical and ideal algebra , which conveys thoughts by analogy , by relation , by convention , and so on .
[ Mémoires 1776:24 ]
This view was taken up and expanded on by the well - known Father J. J. M. Amiot in a longer article in which he described characters as
images and symbols which speak to the mind through the eyes -- images for palpable things , symbols for mental ones .
Images and symbols which are not tied to any sound and can be read in all languages .
... I would be quite inclined to define Chinese characters as the pictorial algebra of the sciences and the arts .
In truth , a well - turned sentence is as much stripped of all intermediaries as is the most rigorously bare algebraic demonstration .
[ Mémoires 1776:282-285 ]
It is a curious fact , however , that while the notion that Chinese writing conveys ideas without regard to sound was widely held , no special name appears to have been coined for it .
Westerners had made the acquaintance of Chinese in the sixteenth century .
Friar Gaspar da Cruz , as noted above , referred to the Chinese symbols as " characters , " and the Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignani , who visited Macao in 1577 , referred to Chinese characters as " that innumberable multitude of exceedingly intricate ciphers which pass for writing " among the Chinese ( Bartoli 1663:147 ) .
It seems that for the next 250 years and more Chinese writing was referred to simply by such noncommittal terms as " characters " and " symbols . "
It was not acquaintance with Chinese but decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing following Napoleon 's conquests in North Africa that led to the coining of several expressions related to the ideographic idea .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the English term " ideographic " was first used in 1822 to describe Egyptian writing .
The French term " idéographique " was first used in the same year ( Robert 1977:957 ) .
This was the very year that the French scholar Champollion announced his success in deciphering the Egyptian script .
It turns out that the English term represents a direct transliteration of the French expression coined by Champollion in a celebrated letter announcing his discovery ( Champollion 1822 ; Anonymous 1822 ) .
Decipherment of this script had long been impeded by the notion that it was symbolic of ideas , particularly mystical or spiritual ones .
It was not just the discovery of the famous Rosetta Stone , with its bilingual text in three scripts ( Hieroglyphic Egyptian , Demotic Egyptian , and Greek ) that made this possible .
As Gordon ( 1968:24 ) stresses : " The decipherment of Hieroglyphic Egyptian required the replace ment of the deep - seated notion of symbolism by the correct view that the main ( though not the only ) feature of the script is phonetic . "
Champollion 's success in deciphering the Egyptian script was due to his recognition of its phonetic aspect .
He believed that what he called " the alphabet of the phonetic hieroglyphs " existed in Egypt " at a far distant time , " that it was first " a necessary part " of the hieroglyphic script , and that later it was also used to transcribe " the proper names of peoples , countries , cities , rulers , and individual foreigners who had to be commemorated in historic texts or monumental inscriptions " ( 1822:41 -42 ) .
These insights won by Champollion are supported by the succinct description of the Egyptian system of writing made by a recent authority : " The system of hieroglyphic writing has two basic features : first , representable objects are portrayed as pictures ( ideograms ) , and second , the picture signs are given the phonetic value of the word for the represented objects ( phonograms ) .
At the same time , these signs are also written to designate homonyms , similar - sounding words " ( Brunner 1974:854 ) .
The same authority also stresses that " hieroglyphs were from the very beginning phonetic symbols .
...
Egyptian writing was a complete script ; that is , it could unequivocally fix any word , including all derivatives and all grammatical forms " ( Brunner 1974:853-855 ) .
Champollion , however , overemphasized the use of " phonetic hieroglyphs " in transcribing foreign names ( in his account this seems to be their only use ) , and he also obscured the significance of his own discovery by calling the Egyptian symbols " ideograms " and the writing " ideographic . "
Moreover , referring to the use of the symbols to write words foreign to the language , he added ( 1822:4 ) : " The Chinese , who also use an ideographic script , have exactly the same provision , created for the same reason . "
It is ironic that the scholar who demonstrated the falsity of the old belief in Egyptian as symbolic and nonphonetic should have helped to popularize terms that powerfully reinforced the popular misconception of both the Egyptian and Chinese systems of writing .
The Essence of Writing
This misconception involves the precise nature of writing -- not Egyptian or Chinese writing but all forms of writing .
The problem is not so complex as we make it out when we let ourselves get bogged down in consideration of detailed differences among the great varie ties of writing .
It becomes quite simple if we limit consideration of the written forms , be they signs or symbols or characters or pictures or whatnot , to the principles involved in the two basic aspects of form and function .
As to form , there is nearly unanimous agreement that writing started with pictures .
As to function , there is less agreement .
Did an Indian or Egyptian or Chinese picture of the sun convey an idea directly , or did it evoke a spoken word and through this intermediary convey the meaning ?
Gelb insists on viewing the question in terms of two stages in the development of writing .
In the first stage , in which he places what he calls " forerunners of writing " ( 1963:59 ) , the symbols are clearly pictographic in form , though he prefers to call them " descriptive " or " representational . "
Just how did they function in conveying meaning ?
Gelb is not very clear , except in a negative sense of how they did not function in systems such as those of the North American Indians .
In these systems the symbols did not represent specific sounds .
Indeed , Indian pictographs were not even formalized or conventionalized and never transcended a sort of ad hoc quality in that they most often dealt with specific situations , were aimed at specific persons , and lacked generality or continuity in time .
A typical example of Indian pictography , one in which it comprises more than the usual isolated symbol or two , is a message passed on by an Indian agent from a Cheyenne father to his son informing him of the transmission of $ 53 .
Another is a come - up - and - see - me - sometime invitation from an Ojibwa girl to her lover ( Gelb 1963:31 - 32 ) .
Both require elaborate interpretation to be understood by anyone but the immediate persons involved .
For the latter the symbols apparently comprised a sort of prearranged code .
As noted by Mallery , the author of the most exhaustive studies available of the pictographs of American Indians , " comparatively few of their picture signs have become merely conventional .
...
By far the larger part of them are merely mnemonic records " ( 1886:15 - 16 ) .
The meager information contained in the Amerindian pictographic symbols stands in contrast to the great amount of knowledge about the economic , social , religious , and other aspects of Sumerian , Egyptian , and Shang societies that can be obtained by reading their voluminous written records .
In the second stage , the pictographic form may be carried over from the first but the wholly new principle of using them to represent sounds makes its appearance , at first haltingly , then increasingly , until it eventually becomes the dominant feature .
At this point , " full systems of writing " come into being ( Gelb 1963:60 ) .
One must insist on this clear dividing line between the two stages of writing .
If we look only at the surface similarity in the depiction of objects in various forms of writing , we shall overlook the significance of the use of a particular picture or sign as a purely phonetic symbol .
To lump together the writing of the American Indians and the early Chinese and Egyptians because of some similarity in graphic forms is to fall victim to the kind of befuddled thinking that is indicated by calling all of them pictographic or ideographic .
This point is of such overriding importance that we must pursue it a bit further by viewing Chinese writing in terms of the two - stage approach .
Suppose we illustrate the matter by taking up once again the character for " wheat . "
We can summarize its form and function in the two stages as follows :
Stage 1 : Protowriting Form : Pictograph of wheat : Function :
To represent the idea " wheat "
Stage 2 : Real Writing Form : Pictograph of wheat : or Function :
To represent the word l ə g ( " wheat " )
To represent the word l ə g ( " come " )
Stage 1 , the era of protowriting akin to that of the American Indians , is assumed but not attested .
We have no record of such a stage , although some evidence of pre-Shang writing is beginning to emerge ( Aylmer 1981:6 ; Cheung 1983 ) , but since elsewhere attempts at writing started with the drawing of pictures , we assume the same for Chinese .
Whether the pictures were vocalized -- that is , represented concepts that were expressed orally in one definite way -- is a matter of disagreement .
In any case there would be no indication of their having a specific phonetic value .
By the time we come to Shang writing we are already well into stage 2 : real writing .
It is not a completely new stage , however , as there are overlaps in certain areas .
The chief overlap is in the form of the symbols .
These are identical in the two stages , or perhaps those in the second stage are somewhat more stylized , a matter of no particular importance .
There may be overlap also for the first function , that of representing , either directly or indirectly , the concept " wheat . "
The second function is , however , completely new in that it introduces the rebus use of the pictograph meaning " wheat " to represent another word with the same sound but with a totally different meaning .
The rebus idea can be illustrated in English by the use of the four following pictographs depicting a human eye , a tin can , a seascape , and a female sheep or ewe :
Taken together these pictographs make no sense as meaning - symbols but do make sense as sound - symbols : eye can sea ewe .
The rebus idea seems obvious to us since we use it in children 's games , but it actually constitutes a stupendous invention , an act of intellectual creation of the highest order -- a quantum leap forward beyond the stage of vague and imprecise pictures to a higher stage that leads into the ability to represent all the subtleties and precision expressible in spoken language .
Writing is now directly , clearly , firmly related to language : to speech .
If there was ever any question whether a symbol had a sound attached to it , this now receives a positive answer .
In the earliest form known to us , the character for " wheat " was borrowed to represent the word " come " precisely because both were pronounced in the same way .
In human history it seems that the idea of using a pictograph in the new function of representing sound may have occurred only three times : once in Mesopotamia , perhaps by the Sumerians , once in China , apparently by the Chinese themselves , and once in Central America , by the Mayas .
( Conceivably it was invented only once , but there is no evidence that the Chinese or the Mayas acquired the idea from elsewhere . )
The idea that was independently conceived by these three peoples was taken over , as were at times even the symbols themselves , though often in a highly modified form , by others who made adaptations to fit a host of totally different languages .
One of the major adaptations , generally attributed to the Greeks , was the narrowing of sound representation from syllabic representation to phonemic representation ( Gelb 1963 ; Trager 1974 ) , after an earlier stage of mixed pictographic and syllabic writing ( Chadwick 1967 ) .
The precise form in which the words in these languages are represented is a matter of quite secondary importance .
With regard to the principle , it matters little whether the symbol is an elaborately detailed picture , a slightly stylized drawing , or a drastically abbreviated symbol of essentially abstract form .
What is crucial is to recognize that the diverse forms perform the same function in representing sound .
To see that writing has the form of pictures and to conclude that it is pictographic is correct in only one sense -- that of the form , but not the function , of the symbols .
We can put it this way :
QUESTION : When is a pictograph not a pictograph ?
ANSWER : When it represents a sound .
The use of the pictograph for " wheat " to represent the homophonous word ləg ( " come " ) transformed the function of the symbol from pictographic depiction of an object to syllabic representation of a sound .
This change in function has been the essential development marking the emergence of all true systems of writing , including Chinese .
Sinological Contribution to the Myth
The fact that some Chinese pictographs have not undergone a change in form parallel to the change in function has tended to obscure the significance of the change that did take place .
As a result , the phonetic aspect of Chinese writing is minimized by many people , even specialists in the field .
Creel in the United States and Margouliès in France are leading exponents of a view that has been taken over , in even more simplistic form , by the public at large .
Both scholars are aware that there is a phonetic aspect in Chinese writing .
Yet their attention is so narrowly focused on the nonphonetic aspect that their otherwise useful contributions to learning ( especially Creel 's informative and readable The Birth of China ) are unfortunately diminished .
Their discussions of Chinese writing are confused and contradictory -- at one time seeming to say one thing , at another something else , but coming down ultimately to a conclusion , that is completely untenable .
Creel ( 1936:91 -93 ) says :
That Chinese writing was pictographic in origin does not admit of question .
On the other hand , Chinese is not , and was not three thousand years ago , a pictographic language in the sense that it consisted of writing by means of pictures all or most of which would be readily understood by the uninstructed .
...
The Chinese early abandoned the method of writing by means of readily recognizable pictures and diagrams .
...
It was in part because the Chinese gave up pictoral [ sic ] writing that they were able to develop a practicable pictographic and ideographic script , with comparatively little help from the phonetic principle .
To draw elaborate pictures of whole animals , for instance ( as is done on some of the Shang bones ) , is too slow a process .
The course taken in many parts of the world was to conventionalize the picture , reduce it to a simple and easily executed form , and then use it to represent homophonous words or parts of words .
The course the Chinese have chosen has also been to conventionalize and reduce , but they then use the evolved element for the most part not phonetically , but to stand for the original object or to enter with other such elements into combinations of ideographic rather than phonetic value .
This parting of the ways is of the most profound importance .
The last two sentences are the crux of Creel 's thesis .
Where Boodberg and others , as noted earlier , see phonetic elements , Creel sees elements that are conventionalized or reduced forms used " to stand for the original object or to enter with other such elements into combinations of ideographic rather than phonetic value . "
This emphasis on ideographic symbols that are merely conventionalized forms of pictographs leads Creel into the fanciful explanations of Chinese characters that were so sharply condemned by Boodberg .
Boodberg 's refutation contained in learned journals known only to specialists could do little to counter the impact of Creel 's views expressed in his popular The Birth of China .
Here Creel says : " We have specialized on the representation of sounds ; the Chinese have specialized on making their writing so suggestive to the eye that it immediately calls up ideas and vivid pictures , without any interposition of sounds " ( 1937:159 ) .
If we take this statement at face value without qualifying it with " What the author really meant to say was ... " -- a practice that runs the risk of misinterpreting what the author meant -- the statement is absurdly false , as can be attested by any reader of this book who has not studied Chinese .
Simply look at the characters sprinkled throughout the work and note how many or how few immediately call up ideas and vivid pictures without any interposition of sounds .
The qualification that we hesitate to read into Creel 's statement is suggested by the author himself , but in the same specialized journal mentioned earlier and quoted to the effect that Chinese is not " a pictographic language in the sense that it consisted of writing by means of pictures all or most of which would be readily understood by the uninstructed . "
But if the ability to grasp an idea " immediately " or " readily " from symbols that are " a practical pictographic and ideographic script " though not " pictoral writing " is limited to those who presumably must be classified as " the instructed , " this makes the otherwise absurd statement inanely true .
For it is equally true that the instructed can immediately grasp an idea whether it is expressed in Chinese characters , in Egyptian hieroglyphs , in Japanese kana , or even in our less than perfect English orthography .
All literates are conditioned , like Pavlov 's dogs , to respond to certain culture - bound stimuli .
The written word " chicken " evokes in my mind precisely the same picture -- or pictures -- as the written character 鷄 ( or 鸡 ) , except perhaps that in the first case I may salivate in anticipation of Kentucky fried chicken and in the second of chicken cooked in soy sauce .
Apart from the error of thinking that Chinese characters are unique in evoking mental images , where Creel and others from Friar Gaspar da Cruz right on down go astray in their characterization of Chinese writing is to succumb to the hypnotic appeal of the relatively few characters that are demonstratably of pictographic origin and to extrapolate from these to the majority if not the entirety of the Chinese written lexicon .
The error of exaggerating the pictographic and hence semantic aspect of Chinese characters and minimizing if not totally neglecting the phonetic aspect tends to fix itself very early in the minds of many people , both students of Chinese and the public at large , because their first impression of the characters is likely to be gained by being introduced to the Chinese writing system via some of the simplest and most interesting pictographs , such as those presented at the beginning of Chapter 5 .
Unless a determined effort is made to correct this initial impression , it is likely to remain as an article of faith not easily shaken by subsequent exposure to different kinds of graphs .
This may also explain the oversight even of specialists who are aware of the phonetic aspect in Chinese characters , including such able scholars as Li and Thompson ( 1982:77 ) , who refer to Chinese writing as " semantically , rather than phonologically grounded " and consider that a character " does not convey phonological information except in certain composite logographs where the pronunciation of the composite is similar to one of its component logographs . "
It takes a profoundly mesmerized observer to overlook as exceptions the two - thirds of all characters that convey useful phonological information through their component phonetic .
Myth vs. Reality
A limited number of pictographic or semantic characters , like the limited number of what Bolinger ( 1946 ) Calls " visual morphemes " and Edgerton ( 1941 ) " ideograms in English writing , " or even the extensive but still limited systems such as mathematical or chemical notation , cannot be considered indicative of full systems of nonphonetic writing that can function like ordinary orthographies to express nearly everything we can express in spoken language .
The fact is that such a full system of nonphonetic writing has never existed .
The system of Chinese characters , the Sumerian , Accadian , and Hittite cuneiform systems , and the Egyptian hieroglyphic system were none of them complete systems of semantic writing .
For Sumerian and Accadian , Civil ( 1973:26 ) provides figures summarized in Table 8 showing the relative importance of phonetic versus semantic elements in various texts .
With respect to Egyptian , Edgerton says that " of the total number of signs in any normal hieroglyphic or hieratic text , the overwhelming majority will not be ideographic at all but phonetic " ( 1940:475 ) .
The same is true of Chinese , as was shown in great detail in Chapter 5 .
Semantic Versus Phonetic Aspects of Cuneiform Symbols Symbols Sumerian Accadian Syllabograms 36.4-54.3 % 85.6-95.7 % Logograms 60.3-42.8 % 6.5- 3.5 % Classifiers 3.1-2.9 % 7.6-0.7 %
Nonphonetic symbols occur in every writing system .
But using the existence of these symbols , however numerous , to conclude that whole systems not based on sound have existed , or even that such systems are possible , are unwarranted assumptions that lead inevitably to the complete obfuscation regarding the nature of writing that is expressed in the Ideographic Myth .
This myth , it is apparent , exists in two aspects .
Both must be rejected .
The first is that the Chinese characters constitute an existing system of ideographic writing .
This has been shown to be factually untrue .
The second aspect is the validity of the ideographic concept itself .
I believe it to be completely untenable because there is no evidence that people have the capacity to master the enormous number of symbols that would be needed in a written system that attempts to convey thought without regard to sound , which means divorced from spoken language .
A few , yes , as in any writing system , including English with its numerals and other " visual morphemes . "
Even quite a few , given the large number of Chinese syllabic signs and graphs without good phonetic clues .
But while it is possible for a writing system to have many individual " ideographs " or " ideograms , " it is not possible to have a whole writing system based on the ideographic principle .
Alphabetic writing requires mastery of several dozen symbols that are needed for phonemic representation .
Syllabic writing requires mastery of what may be several hundred or several thousand symbols that are needed for syllabic representation .
Ideographic writing , however , requires mastery of the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of symbols that would be needed for ideographic representation of words or concepts without regard to sound .
A bit of common sense should suggest that unless we supplement our brains with computer implants , ordinary mortals are incapable of such memory feats .
The theory of an ideographic script must remain in the realm of popular mythology until some True Believers demonstrate its reality by accomplishing the task , say , of putting Hamlet or at least Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address into English written in symbols without regard to sound .
Objections to the Term " Ideographic "
We need to go further and throw out the term itself .
Boodberg proposed doing so years ago when he sharply criticized students of early Chinese inscriptions for neglecting the phonological aspect of Chinese writing and for " insisting that the Chinese in the development of their writing ... followed some mysterious esoteric principles that set them apart from the rest of the human race . "
Boodberg added ( 1937:329-332 ) :
Most students in the field have chosen to concentrate their efforts on the exotically fascinating questions of " graphic semantics " and the study of the living tissues of the word has almost completely been neglected in favor of the graphic integument encasing it .
...
The term " ideograph " is , we believe , responsible for most of the misunderstanding of the writing .
The sooner it is abandoned the better .
We would suggest the revival of the old term " logograph . "
Signs used in writing , however ambiguous , stylized , or symbolic , represent words .
The last sentence should be given the utmost emphasis : Chinese characters represent words ( or better , morphemes ) , not ideas , and they represent them phonetically , for the most part , as do all real writing systems despite their diverse techniques and differing effectiveness in accomplishing the task .
Boodberg 's objections to describing Chinese writing as ideographic were anticipated by a century in a remarkable book by Peter S. DuPonceau .
The author , a leading scholar who was president of the American Philosophical Society , was one of the outstanding general linguists of the first half of the nineteenth century in the United States .
Although his work has been briefly noted by Edgerton ( 1944 ) and by Chao ( 1940 ) , it has not received the attention it deserves among Chinese specialists .
I must confess to having failed to check his views until quite recently , a failure which has put me in the position of reinventing the wheel .
For DuPonceau , with an insight that is truly astonishing in view of the limited sources available to him , presents cogently reasoned arguments against the notion of Chinese as an ideographic script and against the whole concept of ideographic writing .
His presentation , though faulty in some points ( as noted by Chao 1940 ) , constitutes what is probably the most extensive refutation yet written of the Ideographic Myth .
DuPonceau ( 1838:106-107 ) summarizes the background of the ideographic concept by noting the general opinion that Chinese writing
is an ocular method of communicating ideas , entirely independent of speech , and which , without the intervention of words , conveys ideas through the sense of vision directly to the mind .
Hence it is called ideographic , in contradistinction from the phonographic or alphabetical system of writing .
This is the idea which is entertained of it in China , and may justly be ascribed to the vanity of the Chinese literati .
The Catholic at first , and afterwards the Protestant missionaries , have received it from them without much examination ; and the love of wonder , natural to our species , has not a little contributed to propagate that opinion , which has taken such possession of the public mind , that it has become one of those axioms which no one will venture to contradict .
But DuPonceau does venture to contradict , and in no uncertain terms .
In a succinct statement which might well serve as a credo for all students of Chinese to memorize , he concludes ( 1838 : xxxi ) :
That the Chinese system of writing is not , as has been supposed , ideographic ; that its characters do not represent ideas , but words , and therefore I have called it lexigraphic .
That ideographic writing is a creature of the imagination , and cannot exist , but for very limited purposes , which do not entitle it to the name of writing .
That among men endowed with the gift of speech , all writing must be a direct representation of the spoken language , and cannot present ideas to the mind abstracted from it .
That all writing , as far as we know , represents language in some of its elements , which are words , syllables , and simple sounds .
The conclusions obtained so long ago by DuPonceau are matched by the equally insightful observations of his contemporary , the French sinologist J. M. Callery .
In the introduction to his syllabary of 1,040 phonetic signs Callery states ( 1841:i ) :
If the works of the illustrious Champollion had not already proved conclusively that the Egyptian hieroglyphics , previously regarded as symbolic signs , are , for the most part , nothing but phonetic signs , that is to say , signs destined to represent the different sounds of the language , I would perhaps not dare to raise my feeble voice to say before the scholarly world that the Chinese characters are also , for the most part , nothing but phonetic characters intimately tied to the sounds of the language , and not symbolic or ideographic signs , as has generally been believed up to now ; however , since the barrier of prejudice has been overcome , and in almost all the sciences the eminently rational procedure of observation has been adopted , I am hazarding to put under the eyes of the public the result of my researches on the phonetic system of Chinese writing .
It is a pity that " the eminently rational procedure of observation " adopted by DuPonceau and Callery has been so much neglected by modern scholars .
It is disheartening to see how pervasive is the idea that the Chinese in the development of their writing have followed , in Boodberg 's words , " some mysterious esoteric principles that have set them apart from the rest of the human race . "
It is particularly disheartening to see levelheaded scholars suddenly taking leave of their critical faculties when confronted by Chinese characters .
One reason for the pervasiveness and tenacity of the myth , I am now convinced , stems from the use of the word " ideographic . "
The term itself is responsible for a good deal of the misunderstanding and should be replaced , since its repetitious use , as in the big lie technique and in subliminal advertising , insidiously influences our thinking .
Boodberg has suggested that it be replaced by the term " logographic , " others by " morphemic . "
These terms have been widely adopted in academic circles , but many scholars apparently see no real difference between them and " ideographic . "
In his discussion of Sumerian writing , Civil ( 1973:21 ) quotes a French writer who uses the term " idéographique " ; Civil follows it immediately with the bracketed explanation " [ i.e. , logographic ] . "
A college textbook on linguistics ( Geogheghn et al. 1979:131 - 1 ) equates the two terms in the following statement : " In logographic writing systems each character that is used represents either a concrete or abstract concept or idea .
( For this reason , they are also called ideographic . ) "
Kolers , who believes that " there are two major writing systems in the world today , the semantic and the phonetic " ( 1970:113 ) , makes no distinction between the two concepts underlying the two terms in his confused references to Chinese writing as a system that is " not phonetic " and contains logographic compounds " that are " derived from pictures " and are " intuitively appealing " ( 1969:353 , 357 , 360 ) .
These typical examples show that the term " logographic " is simply being taken as a fancier equivalent for " ideographic " and is not fulfilling the expectation of Boodberg and other sinologists that it would help avoid misconceptions regarding the basic nature of Chinese writing .
Both terms are inadequate and misleading because they fail to indicate that the process of getting from graph to word / morpheme involves the phonetic aspect of the latter and because this failure leaves the way open to the idea that we get from graph to word / morpheme by means of some nonphonetic , in a word , " ideographic , " approach .
Only the adoption of some such term as " morphosyllabic , " which calls attention to the phonetic aspect , can contribute to dispelling the widespread misunderstanding of the nature of Chinese writing .
The term " ideographic " has been used not only by those who espouse its basic meaning but also by others who do not necessarily accept the concept but use the term out of mere force of habit as an established popular designation for Chinese characters .
I find , to my chagrin , that in my previous publications I have been guilty of precisely this concession to popular usage without being aware of the damage it can cause .
As a repentant sinner I pledge to swear off this hallucinogen .
I hope others will join in consigning the term to the Museum of Mythological Memorabilia along with unicorn horns and phoenix feathers .
Mike raises the following question :
From
Nz ’s perspective , what was the world like before the death of God ?
The best answer I have at the moment is The Gay Science # 84 the last paragraph .
Maybe that ’s * way * before the death of God though or maybe that ’s basically what it is .
I do n’t have GS handy , but I did come across an interesting and relevant notebook entry from 1887 :
What advantages did the Christian morality hypothesis offer ?
1. it conferred on man an absolute value , in contrast to his smallness and contingency in the flux of becoming and passing away
2. it served the advocates of God to the extent that , despite suffering and evil , it let the world have the character of perfection – including “ freedom ” – and evil appeared full of sense
3. it posited a knowledge of absolute values in man and thus gave him adequate knowledge of precisely the most important thing .
it prevented man from despising himself as man , from taking against life , from despairing of knowing : it was a means of preservation – in sum : morality was the great antidote against practical and theoretical nihilism .
[ This is from Pearson ’s and Large ’s Nietzsche Reader , p. 385 ]
So I take it that , before the death of god , it felt like we were significant , and that was a good survival strategy for staving off despair and suicide .
Now the question is whether we can live with the truth , and invent for ourselves some new survival strategy .
In this same set of notes , Nz provides the eternal recurrence as such a strategy .
He seems to think it ’s better than accepting the plain old “ you live , you die , that ’s it ” since that thought makes nothingness the “ goal ” of the universe , or at least becomes the universe ’s prevalent theme .
If nihilism is something to be fought against — and for Nietzsche , it was — we need a replacement for God .

Sure , feedback - directed optimization ( FDO ) would probably help a lot .
But static compilers face some inherent difficulties when compiling a dynamic language : - Dynamic languages generate tons of code paths , even for simple operations .
A static compiler has to compile * all * code paths .
Apart from the overhead , this pessimizes the fast code paths , too ( esp. PRE and register allocation ) .
A JIT compiler only generates code for paths that are actually executed ( this may also differ between runs ) .
- Even with FDO , static compilers have to be very conservative about inlining and specialization to limit code growth .
A JIT compiler can be more aggressive , because it has to deal with a much lower number of code paths .
-
Not even the best C compilers are able to hoist complex control structures out of loops .
Once you lower ( say ) a load from a hash table ( a loop following the hash chain ) to the LLVM IR , you lose the original semantics .
This usually means you cannot optimize it or eliminate it , either .
That 's not to discourage you from your work -- just to point out some difficulties you 'll be facing with llvm - lua .
The following trivial Lua function is a nice optimization challenge : function f( x , n ) for i=1 , n do x = math. abs ( x ) end return x end
The inner loop has two hash table loads ( _G [ " math " ] , math [ " abs " ] ) , a function dispatch and a call to a standard library function .
Here 's the corresponding checklist for a Lua compiler in increasing order of complexity : LJ1 LJ2 yes yes Type - specializes the hash table loads ( object and key type ) .
yes * yes Inlines both hash table loads ( * partially inlined by LJ1 ) .
no yes Specializes the loads to the hash slot ( omit chain loop ) .
yes yes Specializes to a monomorphic function dispatch for abs ( ) .
yes yes Inlines the abs ( ) function .
no yes Hoists both hash table loads out of the loop .
no yes Hoists the abs ( ) out of the loop ( abs ( abs ( x ) ) ==> abs ( x ) ) .
no yes Emits an empty loop ( could be optimized away , too ) .
Now try to get 8 x yes with a static compiler , while preserving the full Lua semantics ( e.g. somebody might do math.abs = math . sin or _G might have a metatable etc. ) .
Good luck ! :-) >

The large dataset is an out - of - cache problem and cache thrashing ( esp. for FFT ) dominates the timings .
IMHO the small dataset is better suited to compare the performance of the different VMs .
Anyway , for the large dataset LuaJIT 1.1. x gets 89.80 and Lua 5.1.4 gets 13.87 on my box .
And here 's a preliminary result for LJ2 : FFT 85.91 [ 1048576 ] SOR 821.95 [ 1000 ] MC 73.14 SPARSE 324.05 [ 100000 , 1000000 ] LU 820.51 [ 1000 ] SciMark 425.11 [ large problem sizes ] ( i.e. 31 x faster than plain Lua ) For comparison , GCC 4.3.2 - m32 - march=core2 - O3 - fomit- frame - pointer : FFT 93.00 [ 1048576 ] SOR 883.53 [ 1000 ] MC 180.16 SPARSE 716.08 [ 100000 , 1000000 ] LU 1149.43 [ 1000 ] SciMark 604.44 [ large problem sizes ]
( I 've reformatted the C program output to match the Lua output . )
Ok , so LJ2 is getting closer to C's performance .
It 's already on par with C for simpler benchmarks ( like mandelbrot or spectralnorm ) .
But there still remains a lot to do ...

Nathan ( L ) and his brother were due to fly to the Isle of Man on Wednesday A 14 - year - old schoolboy from the Isle of Man has died while on holiday in Thailand after being sucked into a swimming pool pumping system .
It is thought Nathan Clark Griffiths opened a vent at the bottom of the pool in an attempt to retrieve his goggles .
The boy was at a water park in Pattaya , east of Bangkok , with his family .
His mother Marion Griffiths criticised a delay in the rescue attempt caused by a lifeguard 's refusal to believe the vent had been opened .
Thai police are investigating how Nathan , who had been in the pool with his brother Rhys , 15 , was able to lift the vent , which should have been locked .
Language barrier
The incident happened on Friday at a water park in the resort , which is 85 miles ( 137 km ) from Bangkok .
Ms Griffiths said : " I just can't believe that the lifeguard did not act quicker .
I 'm numb now but anger will set in .
" The boys had been playing in the pool , they had one pair of goggles between them .
Rhys said Nathan went under the water , he could see his long black shorts and then next minute he was gone .
He knew something was seriously wrong .
" Rhys panicked and jumped out of the pool and ran over to the lifeguard but he could n't understand him and did n't believe the grille had opened . "
Nathan was also with his father Jimmy Clark , 48 , his stepmother Kat and her son Kevin , 8 , who all live together in Thailand .
He was trapped for far too long
Marion Griffths , Nathan 's mother " His stepbrother Kevin translated but the lifeguard told him he was lying because he said the vent was locked and so impossible for Nathan to have got through it .
" It was only when they got Jimmy , my ex-husband , that the lifeguard took them seriously but by then Nathan had been under the water a long time . "
He was sucked into a pipe in the water pumping system and was found in the pool 's engine room 20 minutes later .
Ms Griffiths added : " Jimmy got him out and tried to give him mouth - to - mouth .
" Jimmy said as soon as he saw Nathan come out of that pipe he knew he was gone , he was trapped for far too long . "
Ms Griffiths , 40 , lives with Nathan 's 10 - year - old sister Naomi in Douglas in the Isle of Man. Nathan and his brother had been due to fly back to the island on Wednesday to spend the summer with their mother and sister .
A Thai police commander said Nathan was swimming with his brother in a whirlpool area .

" We are all heartbroken , " added his mother .
Nathan 's family have criticised lifeguards at the pool for refusing to take their pleas for help seriously or carry out a search of the pumping system .
The water park has now reportedly offered the family compensation .
As Nathan 's body was lying on the ground Thai paparazzi took photographs of him which prompted his father to hit out , striking one camera with a spanner .
Some images have since appeared on Thai news channels .
Ms Griffiths added : " It 's horrific for people to treat my son 's death in such a way .
I was sitting here in the Isle of Man and I am seeing pictures on Thai television of my son lying in that pump room with his little hands on his chest . "
Mr Clark was fined £ 240 by Thai police over the incident .
The Foreign Office said : " Our consular people in Thailand are giving assistance at this tragic time for the family . "
The Clark family had been due to move to India where Nathan 's father Jim had been posted for work .
Nathan was a pupil at Ramsey Grammar School until he moved to Thailand in April 2008 , said a spokesman for the Isle of Man Government 's department of education .
Nathan also attended Ballacloan Primary School and then Scoill Vallajeelt School .
Ian Walmsley , former head teacher of Scoill Vallajeelt , said he remembered the teenager with fondness and was very saddened by the news .

Before Twitter , free newspapers seemed a brilliant way for the internet generation to keep up .
Abandoning cover price for advertising revenue alone looked like an economic model tailor - made for the digital era .
Free titles were launched around the world amid predictions that they would teach the net generation about newspapers .
As proprietors ponder the value of Transport for London 's ( TfL ) new contract to distribute free daily titles on the tube their future looks less certain .
" Most of the local weeklies that have closed in recent months have been frees , " says Dominic Ponsford , editor of Press Gazette , " Given that they are entirely dependent on advertising you would think that free daily newspapers might be susceptible to recession , too . "
The evidence is that they are .
Last week the pioneering free newspaper group Metro International ( no relation to Britain 's own Metro ) announced plans to sell newspapers in Italy and Portugal .
Metro International 's 2008 annual report reveals that only nine of the company 's 20 publishing operations were profitable .
Analysis of the first quarter of 2009 , published by the website Newspaperinnovation.com , reveals that eight of its 13 majority - owned titles recorded losses .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Austria Oberösterreichische Neue , a free title for the Linz area , has announced that it will close .
Portugal recently lost the sporting freesheet Diario Desportivo and the San Francisco free daily City Star closed on 15 May .
Italian title , 24 Minuti , closed in April .
Swiss freesheets , Le Matin Bleu and 20 Minutes , are to merge .
" In 2004 /2005 free newspapers became very popular , " says Dr Piet Bakker of Newspaperinnovation.com .
" Everyone jumped on the bandwagon .
Now we find ourselves with four or five free newspapers in a single market .
Even a booming market could not support that many . "
Steve Auckland , managing director of Associated Newspapers ' free newspaper division , agrees that the field is too crowded .
" Where there are number two or number three titles in a market they will close . "
National circulation of Associated 's British Metro dipped 2 per cent between April 2008 and April 2009 , a performance many paid - for titles would kill for .
The London market looks even livelier .
Associated 's London Lite (+ 0.31 per cent ) and News International 's thelondonpaper (+ 0.98 per cent ) posted annual circulation increases in April .
" Free newspapers work well in densely populated areas , " says Lawson Muncaster , chief executive of the London financial freesheet City AM , " Being national is much harder .
Free newspapers can't be national in a recession . "
But Muncaster agrees that the London market is unsustainable : " By global standards London Lite and thelondonpaper are not models of how free newspapers can work .
They will take decades to pay for themselves . "
He believes free newspapers must adapt to survive .
" A lot of the executives running free newspapers have come from the old , paid - for model .
It is instilled in their minds that circulation is important .
That is nonsense .
A loyal core audience is more valuable . "
He says advertisers will be increasingly be attracted to papers with niche readerships .
" Free daily newspapers will succeed by doing the things paid for titles used to do ; building relationships , original journalism and concentrating on editorial quality . "
Piet Bakker says big city markets in northern Europe may only be able to sustain a single profitable title .
" Titles such as thelondonpaper and London Lite have exactly the same demographic .
They are in head - to - head competition for the same readers . "
Such direct competition will produce casualties says Bakker , but profitable free newspapers may emerge as one of the few surviving mass media outlets .
The most successful titles attract bigger readerships than many websites .
Advertisers like them .
Associated 's Auckland admits that time are challenging but he remains optimistic : " Our readers are young .
Because of falling interest rates most of them have more disposable income than 12 months ago . "
But Bakker says many free daily newspapers are struggling in the recession .
" At the moment they are offering 90 per cent discounts to advertisers and discounts are like heroin , very easy to get on and very hard to get off . "

Peppermint is used in candy and sweet treats for adults and kids alike , but it also has medicinal uses .
The scientific name is Mentha x piperita , and is often just called " mint " .
Peppermint originally came from Europe , but can now be found in backyards and gardens all over the world , as well as growing in the wild .
Believe it or not , humans have been using peppermint plant oil for almost ten thousand years …. and peppermint , which is a hybrid of two plants , has therefore been referred to as the “ world ’s oldest medicine . ”
You 'll find it in pretty much every brand of toothpaste , for the clean taste and smell that it adds .
The modern peppermint plant is actually a hybrid of two original wild plants - water mint and spearmint - and has stronger medicinal properties than either of the two originals ; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
New studies are showing that traditional wisdom about this plant was right on target .
Read on for more uses and benefits of this wonderful , spicy - smelling essential oil .
I 've found that maintaining a proper to - do list consistently boosts my productivity .
The challenge , however , is finding task management software that fits with my workflow .
I 've tried several web solutions — including Remember the Milk ( RTM ) and a self - hosted Tracks setup — but the problem with browser - based to - do lists is that I tend to ignore what 's not immediately visible on my desktop .
Fortunately , there are several reasonably good open source to - do list tools for Linux .
I recently started using Getting Things GNOME ( GTG ) , an organizer for the GNOME desktop environment that provides a robust feature set and a relatively high level of usability .
Although it 's still at an early stage of development and has some rough edges , it meets my needs better than any of the other to - do list programs that I 've tested .
It has supported for nested substasks , tagging , and task notes .
The GTG user interface provides several convenience features that I find particularly advantageous .
It has a quick - add entry box which allows users to create new tasks on the fly without having to input any extraneous data .
Users can optionally specify tags for the task directly in the quick - add box alongside the task title .
Another nice user interface feature that I like is the Work View , which will give you a flattened and filtered view of your task list with immediate action items .
GTG is written in the Python programming language , which makes it easy to modify and extend .
I 've added several additional features to it myself , including a D - Bus interprocess communication interface which the GTG developers recently merged .
Using D - Bus , I 've been able to tightly integrate GTG into my article management workflow .
For example , I wrote a script that allows me to add new tasks directly from Vim , my favorite text editor .
GTG has a modular backend system that will eventually make it possible for the program to store its data in web - based services such as RTM .
At the present time , however , the only backend that is officially supported by the program 's developers is one that stores tasks in flat XML files on the filesystem .
Using GTG's APIs , I implemented my own experimental backend that stores the tasks in a CouchDB database .
I 'm hoping to use CouchDB 's replication features to keep my tasks synchronized between computers .
The only major downside of GTG is that I have n't quite found a way to integrate it with the Evolution messaging client , which I use for e-mail .
Evolution has its own built - in to - do list system that is cumbersome and less feature - packed than GTG's , but has one really nice feature -- it lets users seamlessly convert an e-mail into a task item .
I 'd like to be able to do that , but push the generated task into GTG instead of Evolution 's built - in to - do system .
With that goal , I started coding an Evolution plugin in C# that will take advantage of my GTG D - Bus interface .
I ran into a snag , however , as I have not been able to get the NDesk D - Bus library to work properly in an Evolution plugin ( but it works fine in a standalone program ) .
I 've posted some preliminary test code .
If anybody knows what I 'm doing wrong , I 'd appreciate some tips .
Other task management tools
GTG mostly works great for me , but it might not meet everyone 's needs .
There are plenty of other options for users who have different requirements .
Another good choice for GNOME users is Tasque , a lightweight to - do list program that integrates well with RTM and has a highly streamlined user interface .
Originally created during a Novell Hack Week , Tasque has become quite popular and it shipped by default as part of the GNOME environment in OpenSUSE 11.1 .
For KDE users , the top - notch task management tool is KOrganizer .
It can be used standalone or as part of Kontact , the KDE messaging suite .
KOrganizer has a very rich feature set , including support for subtasks , calendaring integration , task progress , and alarms notifications .
It stores its data in Akonadi , KDE 's unified PIM storage service .
There is a simple to - do list widget that integrates with KOrganizer and will make it easy for users to see their pending tasks directly on their desktop .
KDE users who want RTM support might want to keep an eye on the RTM Plasmoid , which is still under development .
There is also a Plasmoid that works right now which is based on the RTM Google Gadget .
Traits are units of code reuse in Scala .
Traits encapsulates methods and field definitions .
Their role is similar to that of interfaces in Java - A workaround for Multiple Inheritance .
But unlike Interfaces they can have method and field definitions .
More features will be explained in the article .
Defining Traits :
A trait definition looks like a class definition but uses the keyword “ trait .
trait Bounceable{ def bounce ( ) : String= " Bounce Method in Trait " }
The above declared trait has a concrete method .
The ability to declare concrete methods in an trait gives default implementation option .
In interfaces one has to write / copy - paste the default declaration in each class which implements the interface or declare a class that implements that interface and let other classes extend the concrete class .
The first method has code repition and the second method has the restriction that a class can extend only one class .
So this feature of “ trait ” stands out best .
As in Java a class implements interface , in Scala classes traits are mixed into a class .
This is done using either extends or “ with ” keywords .
class Ball(s : Int ) extends Bouncable{ var size : Int override def toString ( ) : String= Integer.toString ( size ) }
In the above example we are using extends to mix in the trait - Here Ball is implicitly inherits trait ’s superclass which is “ AnyRef ” .
Lets try to use the class Ball to test the mixed in trait .
object Test{ def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) ={ var ball = new Ball ( 33 ) var ball2: Bounceable= new Ball ( 400 ) println ( ball.bounce ( ) )
// This prints " Bounce Method in Trait " println ( ball ) // This prints " 33 " println ( ball2.bounce ( ) ) println ( ball2 ) } }
Note : Output written as comment .
Regarding the ball2 instance being declared as type “ Bounceable ” .
Its a valid declaration cause supertype references can refer to the instances of its subtypes .
But they cannot access the methods / fields declared by the subtypes ( different with the overriding case ) .
Lets consider a more better example which extends a class and mix in multiple traits .
Modifying the Ball class a bit :
class Ball(s : Int ) { var size : Int=s ; override def toString ( ) : String = " Size of Ball : " + Integer.toString ( size ) } class Basketball (s : Int ) extends Ball(s ) with Bounceable{ override def bounce ( ) : String = " Basketball is bouncing " override def toString ( ) : String= " Basketball of size : " + size } object Test{ def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) ={ var basketBall= new BasketBall ( 400 ) println ( basketBall ) println ( basketBall.bounce ) } }
In the above example class Ball is a super class which the class Basketball is extending and the class Basketball mixes in with Bounceable .
The concrete method in Bouncebale is overridden in Basketball .
Though the trait may look like Java Interface there are subtle differences .
Traits can maintain state by declaring fields .
Traits look more or like class with a few exceptions .
The traits cannot have class parameters i.e parameters passed to the primary contructors of a class .
For example -
we can have class Ball ( x : Int ) but not trait Ball ( x : Int )
super call is bound statically but in traits its bound dynamically .
This can be used to create a stackable trait .
Let me tell u about Rich and Thin interfaces before contiuning further -
Rich Interfaces -
Too many methods =>
Easy for client but difficult for implementer
Thin interfaces -
Few mehtods => Easy for implementer but difficult for client as he has to write more code to get the desired output .
Traits can be used to create Rich Interfaces which are Thin , means traits can have lot of methods -
Many of them are implemented in terms of the few unimplemented methods .
So the class which mixes these traits provides the implementation for the few unimplemented methods .
The end result being whole set of methods making it easy for the implementer and the client as well .
Lets look at one such trait “ Ordered ” .
Suppose u want to create a custom data value and want to provide comparision operators , we would be busy writing methods like less Than ( < ) , greater Than ( > ) , lessThanEqualto ( <= ) and so on .
Instead scala provides “ Ordered ” trait .
Extending this trait makes the work lot easier .
In the example below i have created a custom MyRectangle class and extended the trait Ordered .
I would be comparing the rectangles based on the “ area ” of the rectangle .
Greater the area , larger is the rectangle .
class MyRectangle (w: Int , h: Int ) extends Ordered [ MyRectangle ] { val width : Int=w val height : Int=h override compare ( that : MyRectangle ) : Int= ( this.width*this.height ) -( that.width*that.height ) } object MyRectangleTest{ def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) ={ val myRect1 = new MyRectanlge ( 3,4 ) val myRect2 = new MyRectanlge ( 4,5 ) val res= if ( myRect1 > my Rect2 ) { my Rect1 } else { myRect2 } println ( res ) } }
One should carefully observe the compare ( ) method .
If the difference is positive then the receiver is greater than the argument else the argument is greater .
Also note that the type of the objects being compared is passed as the type parameter along with the trait name .
Here we have found the difference between the areas of the rectangle .
The Ordered trait does not provide the equals method .
There ’s one more usage of traits called Stackable traits .
I would be writing about it in another post .

“ I know lots of stupid people who went to Ivy League schools . ”
Charlie Rose mentioned , in an interview with KKKarl Rove , that [ Supreme Court judge nominee Sotomayor ] attended Princeton and Yale Law School , and Rove responded :
Speaking of stupid people , here 's what he said about his little pal Georgie :
“ The myth was that this guy , who was a Yale history grad and a Harvard MBA , was not smart , ” Rove told the Chicago Tribune .
In December 2008 , Rove also touted Bush ’s time at Harvard and Yale in a Wall Street Journal column , writing , “ You do n’t make it through either unless you are a reader . ”
I 'm still trying to figure out 1 ) How putzes like Rove remain on the air ( Never mind , it 's the Faux News Channel ) , and 2 ) Why they get so much air time elsewhere ( Never mind , it 's the corporate media ) .
Much of the public ’s attention regarding the rising incidence of obesity and issues related to weight control in general has been focused on good foods vs bad foods .
Most popular diets are based upon the premise that the kinds of foods one eats is a dominant factor in determining weight – low carb vs low fat , for example .
Meanwhile , there is a growing body of scientific evidence , approaching consensus , that by far the dominant factor in weight control is the amount of calories one consumes , not the form in which those calories come .
The best science - based nutritional advice for weight control seems to be – exercise regularly and practice portion control .
For other health concerns , like heart health and avoiding diabetes – eat a well - balanced diet and get more of your calories from plants than animals .
That ’s it in a nutshell , but it is hard to sustain a multi-billion dollar weight loss and self - help industry with such simple advice .
Further , it is human nature to prefer quick fixes and easy answers to tough love .
Weight control is not complex , but it turns out to be very difficult for most people .
Will power is not enough for 95 % of the population .
We can hardly blame people for what appears to be almost universal human traits .
As a public health issue , approaches to obesity are not going to be found in scare tactics and weight loss schemes .
The culture needs to change .
Part of that cultural change , in my opinion , is getting away from the very notion that the problem is caused by “ bad foods ” .
The latest target of this approach is high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
As reported by Consumer Reports :
In 2004 , researchers from the Louisiana State University and University of North Carolina published a paper that theorized that high - fructose corn syrup in beverages could play a role in the obesity epidemic .
They looked at the correlation between the 1,000 percent increase in high - fructose corn syrup consumption between 1970 and 1990 , and a correlating rise in obesity rates .
Because of the way the body metabolizes fructose from beverages , the researchers argued , it may play a role in the obesity epidemic .
Of course , this was a classic example of confusing correlation with causation .
The rising rate of obesity correlates with an overall increase in calories , and there is no evidence to implicate any particular source of calories as being the culprit .
Simple chemistry helps put HFCS into some perspective .
Table sugar is sucrose , which is a combination of fructose and glucose – two common simple sugars .
Corn syrup is mainly glucose , but HFCS is manufactured to have about 50 % fructose and 50 % glucose – the same ratio as sucrose or table sugar .
There are metabolic differences between fructose and glucose .
Often studies showing that pure fructose can alter sugar and fat metabolism are presented as evidence against HFCS , missing the point that the ratio of fructose to glucose in the American diet has not changed with the introduction of HFCS .
A recent review of the literature published in the Journal of Nutrition , regarding the association of HFCS and obesity , concluded :
The panel concluded that evidence from ecological studies linking HFCS consumption with rising BMI rates is unreliable .
Unlike some prominent epidemiologists , the expert panel concluded that the evidence from epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials is inconclusive .
They also noted that there were inadequate data available that distinguish between HFCS consumption and sucrose consumption with respect to weight gain .
Further , they acknowledged that while the sweetener level and type have changed over time , the fructose : glucose ratio in the U.S. food supply has remained the same for 50 y .
Finally , the panel concluded that HCFS did not contribute to weight gain any differently than other energy sources .
In other words – HCFS is not the boogeyman .
It is a distraction from the real issue – an increase in overall caloric intake .
There may also have been a rise in total sugar intake , but the types of sugars have not changed .
A diet with a large proportion of simple sugars is not a good idea because such a diet is also likely to contain too many calories , and high sugar intake increases the risk of diabetes .
Now , of course , the corn lobby is hard at work promoting this information – that HFCS is not the bad guy .
But do n’t make the mistake of assuming that because some information is in line with the interests of a specific corporation or industry that means the information is false .
Any such information is likely to have winners and losers , that does n’t mean it ’s a conspiracy of the winners .
We could just as likely conclude that negative information about HFCS is a conspiracy of the sugar cane lobby .
This does mean that we have to look for corporate interests in the published scientific data , and demand full disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest .
There does n’t appear to be any in the literature I reviewed – it seems there is a broad based consensus , not just corporate shills .
I ’m sure this wo n’t stop some from accusing me of being part of the corn lobby .
The bottom line is that HFCS is sugar .
It is high calorie and has no other nutritional value other than as fuel .
It should be consumed , like all sugars , in moderation .
People should be aware that HFCS = sugar , and not be confused by this on food labeling .
But we will not impact the rise in obesity by treating HFCS as the culprit , or by replacing it with other sugar - based sweeteners .
We need more evidence - based public health measures to fight obesity – making healthy choices easier , making portion control easier , and disclosing calories on menus so that people know how many calories they are consuming .
We do n’t need boogeyman scare tactics .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
This much seems certain about the Cash for Clunkers program : Consumers are happy to take government rebates to buy new cars .
Other than that , confusion reigned Friday .
The fate of the $ 1 billion trade - in program was up in the air over concerns that it may have already burned through its funds less than a week after it was officially launched .
And it was unclear how much longer car buyers would be able to trade in clunkers after reports surfaced on Thursday night that the program would be suspended .
On Friday , the Obama administration said it was working with Congress to try to get more money and that Clunkers deal certificates would be honored through the weekend .
" The program will be in place " for anyone who had been planning to make a car purchase this weekend , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN .
" This program appears to be a success for car buyers , car dealers , car companies and taxpayers . "
One of the program 's main champions in Congress , Sen. Debbie Stabenow , D - Mich. , told CNN that the Michigan , Ohio and Indiana congressional delegations are working on a $ 2 billion extension of Clunkers program .
Stabenow had said the effort has provided an important boost to the economy and resulted in 200,000 car sales .
" I am delighted to hear dealers say that all of their salespeople are busy and they are selling more cars in a day than they had been selling in a month , " Stabenow said .
Meanwhile , the Transportation Department was sorting out how much of the plan 's funds have already been committed .
Cash for Clunkers , which Congress passed in June , is set to end on Nov. 1 or whenever its $ 1 billion budget has been depleted .
An early version of the Clunkers proposal before it passed Congress called for appropriating $ 4 billion .
On Friday morning , the government 's official CARS.gov
Web site , set up to provide dealers and consumers with information about the plan , still showed $ 780 million remaining in the coffers .
But many deals are still waiting to be processed , according to dealers .
Brian Benstock , president of Paragon Honda in Woodside , N.Y. , said his dealership had already written 60 Clunker deals since July 1 , the earliest date from which deals would be accepted .
One deal was signed at 11:55 p.m. last night , Benstock said , after reports had circulated indicating that the program might be suspended .
" We 're telling the customer , ' We 're the only dealer open on Northern Boulevard .
You 've got four minutes , ' " he said .
The customer traded in a an old Mitsubushi Diamante sedan for a new Honda CR - V crossover SUV .
Benstock said he was surprised to hear the program might have reached its limit already .
Like many dealers , he said , he had already purchased advertising in Friday 's newspapers and he had sent out 176,000 direct mail cards to owners of qualifying Clunkers in his area .
" Can you imagine the position we were in last night ? " he said .
" We had 176,000 missiles in the air and we 're hearing it 's cancelled . "
Bob Goldberg , general manager of Premium Nissan in New Rochelle , N.Y. , said he had already given discounts totaling $ 27,000 on six Clunker deals when he heard the reports late Thursday .
" I did n't sleep at all last night , " Goldberg said .
" I feel terrible .
All of a sudden the money 's gone .
It 's a little nerve wracking . "
Under the plan as enacted , vehicles purchased after July 1 will be eligible for refund vouchers worth $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 on traded - in gas guzzlers .
The trade - in vehicle has to get combined city and highway fuel economy ratings of 18 miles per gallon or less .
The program aims at helping the struggling auto industry by taking inefficient cars off the road and spurring new sales .
" With this program , we are giving the auto industry a shot in the arm and struggling consumers can get rid of their gas - guzzlers and buy a more reliable , fuel - efficient vehicle , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement Monday .
Domestic auto sales have been hit hard by the recession and credit crunch and helped propel the bankruptcies and government bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler .
In June , the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate fell to 9.7 million , a pace well below recent years .

Much has made — by the mainstream media and others — of the claim that cannabis use causes certain types of mental illness , specifically schizophrenia and psychosis .
Most notably perhaps , a team of researchers writing in the July 28 , 2007 edition of the prestigious scientific journal The Lancet , boldly proclaimed that smoking cannabis could boost one ’s risk of a psychotic episode by 40 percent or more .
Naturally , this alarmist rhetoric received wall - to - wall coverage by the mainstream press .
Even more troubling , the supposed ‘ pot - and - schizophrenia ’ link was one of the primary reasons cited by British PM Gordon Brown , ex-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and others as the impetus for reclassifying cannabis ( from a verbal warning to a criminal offense punishable by up to five years in jail ) in the United Kingdom .
Of course , there was a fatal flaw with The Lancet ‘s argument — one that , oddly enough , every single MSM outlet failed to mention .
Empirical data did not support the investigators ’ hypothesis that smoking marijuana was associated with increased rates of schizophrenia or other mental illnesses among the general public — a fact that even the authors begrudgingly admitted when they declared , “ Projected trends for schizophrenia incidence have not paralleled trends in cannabis use over time . ”
Which brings us to 2009 .
Two years after The Lancet ‘s dire predictions , a team of researchers at the Keele University Medical School have once and for all put the ‘ pot - and - mental illness ’ claims to the test .
Writing in a forthcoming edition of the scientific journal Schizophrenia Research , they compare long - term trends in marijuana use and incidences of schizophrenia and / or psychoses in the United Kingdom .
And what do they find ?
“ [ T ] he expected rise in diagnoses of schizophrenia and psychoses did not occur over a 10 year period .
This study does not therefore support the specific causal link between cannabis use and incidence of psychotic disorders . …
This concurs with other reports indicating that increases in population cannabis use have not been followed by increases in psychotic incidence . ”
Should we expect an apology — or even better , a change in policy — from the Gordon Brown regime any time soon ?
Or at the very least , will some sort of ‘ correction ’ be forthcoming from the mainstream news media ?
I would n’t hold my breath .

Al Franken , a satirist known for his biting political humor , is headed to the U.S. Senate , the survivor of an epic legal struggle that opponent Norm Coleman finally conceded he could n't win .
Franken 's triumph followed a 5 - 0 decision Tuesday by the Minnesota Supreme Court declaring him the winner and a quick concession by Coleman .
Franken , a Democrat , could be sworn into office soon after the July 4th holiday .
" I do n't know if it has really sunk in , " said Franken , appearing at his home in Minneapolis shortly after receiving a congratulatory call from Coleman , a Republican .
" He said it was a very hard - fought campaign .
I said , ' Norm , it could n't have been closer . '
" It was a nice way to end this . "
Franken 's arrival in the Senate could give Democrats a 60th vote on many issues , a filibuster - proof majority that could help advance President Obama 's agenda .
Conceding defeat outside his St. Paul home shortly after the court ruling , Coleman sidestepped questions about whether he would turn his attention to running for governor in 2010 .
" We 'll talk about the future in short order , " he said .
The ruling and concession ended a bitter eight - month fight over the 2008 election , its recount and a trial that lasted seven weeks .
The two candidates and their allies spent over $ 50 million on their campaigns , the recount and the trial .
Some Minnesotans were relieved to see it all come to an end .
" It 's definitely about time , " said Craig Harris of Minneapolis , strolling on the Nicollet Mall Tuesday afternoon .
" We 've had a missing voice [ in the Senate ] for several months , and that can't be a good thing . "
In recent months , Coleman had left open the possibility of appealing a state court decision against him to the U.S. Supreme Court .
But Minnesota 's highest court gave him little grounds for hope .
Standing by lower court
It rejected point by point Coleman 's claims that inconsistent practices by local elections officials and rulings by a lower court during the trial prevented perhaps thousands of valid absentee ballots from being counted .
The lower court ruled in April that Franken had won by 312 votes .
In upholding that ruling , the Supreme Court said Coleman had " not shown that the trial court 's findings of fact are clearly erroneous or that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretion . "
The Supreme Court concluded that " Al Franken received the highest number of votes legally cast and is entitled under [ Minnesota law ] to receive the certificate of election as United States Senator from the State of Minnesota . "
At the heart of Coleman 's appeal was his insistence that the varying treatment of absentee ballots violated voter rights to equal protection under the Constitution .
But the justices said voter rights were n't violated because local officials merely applied state election law differently for the convenience of their residents .
There has to be evidence of an intent to discriminate , they wrote .
" Coleman neither claims nor produced any evidence that the differing treatment of absentee ballots among jurisdictions during the election was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination against individuals or classes , " the court said .
" No claim of fraud in the election or during the recount was made by either party , " the high court wrote .
It added that the trial court -- a three - judge panel -- did n't discriminate when it excluded certain types of absentee ballots from being counted .
Coleman had claimed that the trial court should have been more lenient , accepting flawed ballots cast by some voters because local officials had done so on Election Day .
" But the law ... requires strict adherence , " the Supreme Court wrote , adding that Coleman had n't proven that local elections officials had been more lenient .
The Supreme Court also rejected Coleman 's comparison of the Senate election to vote problems in Florida during the 2000 presidential race .
Florida had no standards for determining voter intent on ambiguous ballots , but in Minnesota , " There were clear statutory standards for acceptance or rejection of absentee ballots , " the justices wrote .
The high court gave short shrift to Coleman 's argument that he should have been allowed to inspect ballots in some Minneapolis precincts to see whether there was any double counting .
Justices also dismissed his complaint about 132 missing ballots elsewhere in Minneapolis , saying he " introduced no evidence of foul play or misconduct " and that the ballots were represented in machine totals on Election Day .
Two of the seven justices assigned to the state Supreme Court -- Eric Magnuson and G. Barry Anderson -- did not take part in the decision because they had sat on the state Canvassing Board that oversaw the recount .
Individuals with higher mid-life Body Mass Index ( BMI ) in the 1960s have been found to have lower memory and thinking skills and a sharper decline in these abilities in old age , compared to those with lower BMI in mid-life .
“ The adverse effects of being overweight and obese are not limited to cardiac function , but also extend to brain function , ” says Anna Dahl doctoral student at the School of Health Sciences , Jönköping .
Several studies , including studies from the Swedish Twin Registry , have shown that individuals who are overweight or obese in mid-life are at an increased risk of suffering from dementia .
“ We have extended this knowledge and shown that being overweight or obese in mid-life also negatively affects memory and thinking skills independent of dementia .
Moreover , these skills decline more rapidly in old age among those who were overweight or obese in mid-life , ” writes Anna Dahl in an article published in the Journal of Gerontology .
“ The steeper decline in memory and thinking skills observed among individuals who were overweight or obese in mid-life , cannot be explained in our study by an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases , ” says Anna Dahl .
“ There are probably other mechanisms that explain this link . ”
The association between BMI and memory and thinking skills has been investigated in a study of the Swedish Twin Registry , the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging ( SATSA ) , carried out as a joint project between the School of Health Sciences , Jönköping and the Karolinska Insti­tute .

Etisalat sent a text to its 145,000 Blackberry users
An update for Blackberry users in the United Arab Emirates could allow unauthorised access to private information and e-mails .
The update was prompted by a text from UAE telecoms firm Etisalat , suggesting it would improve performance .
Instead , the update resulted in crashes or drastically reduced battery life .
Blackberry maker Research in Motion ( RIM ) said in a statement the update was not authorised , developed , or tested by RIM .
Etisalat is a major telecommunications firm based in the UAE , with 145,000 Blackberry users on its books .
In the statement , RIM told customers that " Etisalat appears to have distributed a telecommunications surveillance application ... independent sources have concluded that it is possible that the installed software could then enable unauthorised access to private or confidential information stored on the user 's smartphone " .
It adds that " independent sources have concluded that the Etisalat update is not designed to improve performance of your BlackBerry Handheld , but rather to send received messages back to a central server " .
The concern over this unauthorised access only came to light when users started reporting problems with their handsets .
After downloading the update , users across the country noticed significantly reduced battery life , poor reception and in some cases , handsets stopped working altogether .
Users have complained that the firm 's customer service is unable to provide information on the problem .
Initial advice led many users to simply buy new batteries .
' Surveillance solutions '
The update has now been identified as an application developed by American firm SS8 .
The California - based company describes itself as a provider of " lawful electronic intercept and surveillance solutions " .
It is not clear why Etisalat wanted to include the software in the download .
The firm issued a brief statement last week , calling the problem a " slight technical fault " , saying that the " upgrades were required for service enhancements " .
Etisalat told BBC
News that it stands by last week 's statement and has not yet responded to further requests for comment .
" There may be a good reason they wanted to install the software , " said one Blackberry user in Dubai who did not want to be named .
" But my biggest problem is that my phone wo n't work .
If you call customer service you either can't get through , or they do n't know what to tell you .
I do n't know what to do . "
RIM has now issued its own update allowing users to remove the application .
Customers of the country 's rival service , Du , have not been affected .

Pizza Theorem
If a circular pizza is divided into 8 , 12 , 16 , ... slices by making cuts at equal angles from an arbitrary point , then the sums of the areas of alternate slices are equal .
There is also a second pizza theorem .
This one gives the volume of a pizza of thickness and radius :
If it was up to the MPAA , every website with links to copyright infringing files would be banned from the Internet .
Perhaps they should take a closer look at their own website first though , since it 's vulnerable to an XSS attack , making it possible to browse
The Pirate Bay directly from the MPAA website .
It is no secret that the MPAA and other anti-piracy outfits rather spend their money on lawyers than web - designers or coders .
Unfortunately for them this sometimes leads to awkward situations .
For example , it turns out that the MPAA website is vulnerable to XSS attacks allowing the public to inject images , frames and all sorts of random code into the site .
About a year ago the RIAA website suffered from a similar vulnerability and was wiped clean .
The RIAA fixed the problem within a few hours and eventually all the ‘ lost ’ content was restored , but not before thousands of people had fun with it .
The XSS vulnerability on the MPAA website was found on the about page where visitors can submit their favorite movie .
In the screenshot below it says “ thank you for taking the time to share your favorite movie , ” which is the actual text that people get to see when they fill out the form .
The Pirate Bay logo and the links to the latest movie torrents are obviously not supposed to be there .
It is “ a proof of concept that demonstrates an XSS attack on mpaa.org website , ” writes Vektor who covered the details in a blog post , adding that it should be taken as a joke .
No lies there , as it made us smile indeed .
RMJM has just reached the halfway mark on construction of the Capital Gate tower in Abu Dhabi , becoming " the most leaning building on Earth " .
Take the jump for images and press release ...
WORLD’S MOST LEANING TOWER REACHES HALFWAY POINT
( NEW YORK ) —
As the world ’s eyes follow the development of the Capital Gate tower in Abu Dhabi – which will become the most leaning building on Earth – the international architects RMJM have confirmed that it has successfully reached the critical half - way point .
Capital Gate , which is being built by Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company ( ADNEC ) , will lean 18 degrees westward , 14 degrees more than the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa .
The design of the central core of the building , which slants in the opposite direction to the lean of the building , straightening as it grows , has never been attempted before .
“ When complete , Capital Gate will be a modern day icon for Abu Dhabi , recognizable throughout the world .
Capital Gate is not about being the biggest or the tallest , it is about advanced technical ingenuity and aesthetic splendor , ” said Simon Horgan , ADNEC Group CEO .
“ This is one of the most challenging buildings under construction in the world at the moment but due to the partnership between ADNEC , RMJM and all contractors on the project , ground breaking solutions are being designed on a daily basis . ”
Tony Archibold , RMJM Project Director , added : “ Passing the half - way point in development is a great success and we are now entering a critical period in Capital Gate ’s development .
While we are facing some of our toughest architectural challenges , it is also the beginning of the most exciting stage as the structure takes shape . ”
A gigantic internal atrium , including a tea lounge and swimming pool suspended 263 feet above the ground , has been constructed on the 17th and 18th floors , the halfway point of the 35 - story , 525 - foot tall tower .
This milestone offered the designers their toughest architectural challenge and it is at this point that the unique lean of the structure becomes evident .
Because of its unique posture , the 35 - story Capital Gate is being constructed on top of a 7 - foot - deep concrete base with a dense mesh of reinforced steel .
The steel exoskeleton known as the diagrid sits above an extensive distribution of 490 piles that have been drilled 100 feet underground to accommodate the gravitational , wind and seismic pressures caused by the lean of the building .
Capital Gate will house Abu Dhabi ’s first Hyatt hotel – Hyatt at Capital Centre , a presidential - style luxury , 5 - star hotel and will provide 200 hotel rooms for Abu Dhabi and will serve ADNEC ’s visitors and exhibitors as well as international business and leisure travelers .
The iconic tower will be the centerpiece of the Capital Centre development , an AED8 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) business and residential micro city being constructed around the thriving Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre .
MMA ’s Adrenaline III Bragging Rights at the BJCC Arena in Birmingham , Alabama was held Saturday night ( June 13 ) , with the main bout between former UFC champion Tim Sylvia and former WBO World heavyweight boxing champion Ray Mercer .
We ’d normally tell you to skip ahead to the video at this point if you do n’t want to know the results , but it ’s hardly worth the bother .
Perhaps backing the controversy surrounding the match , Mercer knocked out Sylvia in not just the first round or the first minute , but the first ten seconds .
Tim Sylvia threw one kick then Mercer threw a right that connected and put Sylvia straight to the floor .

The financial crisis and high oil prices caused the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to drop by half in 2008 .
That is the conclusion of an analysis of preliminary data released yesterday by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency ( NEAA ) .
The data , from oil giant BP , also show that for the first time developing nations were responsible for pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than developed nations and international transport combined .
But Jos Olivier of the NEAA warns that it is difficult to say whether the slowing trend of emissions will continue next year .
Emissions grew by 1.7 per cent in 2008 , compared to 3.3 per cent in 2007 .
The agency ’s analysis suggests that this was mostly because oil consumption decreased globally for the first time since 1992 .

Biofuel benefits
The researchers say a growing switch to biofuels in the US , Europe and China , encouraged by national climate and energy policies , helped contribute to the trend .
Biofuels accounted for 2.5 per cent of global fuel consumption in road transport in 2008 , representing a gross saving of over 100 million tonnes in CO 2 emissions .
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programme , 2008 was the first year new investments in renewable energies were greater than investments in fossil - fuelled technologies .
While cheaper oil and greater incentives to use renewable fuels played a key part in slowing emissions , the global financial crisis which kicked off in the autumn of 2008 also played a role by restricting industrial activity .
In particular , the high - energy steel production industry was hard hit .
Caps brought cuts
Finally , says Olivier , the European emissions trading market demonstrated it could be effective in limiting emissions despite the criticism it has received .
“ The scheme managed to get domestic CO 2 emissions from large industries down by 3 per cent , ” Olivier told New Scientist .
None of this means governments can sit back and relax .
How emissions will vary this year is difficult to predict , says Olivier .
Oil prices dropped at the end of the year , but are slowly climbing again , and no one knows how long the financial downturn will last .
What ’s more , the growth in annual emissions can vary by a few percentage points from one year to the next even without a financial crisis , pushed by factors that are as fickle as winter temperatures and their effect on heating bills .
“ Governments would be wise to maintain their support for reducing fossil fuel use with energy conservation measures and by expanding renewable energy use , ” says Olivier .

A reader writes :
I was entirely against substance use - from caffeine to alcohol to illegal drugs - until a close friend of mine unexpectedly passed away when I was 21 .
I had smoked periodically starting that year ( maybe 5 - 10 times ever ) , but after he died , my use / abuse really took off .
In short , I stopped giving a damn about what I put in my body .
I always went back and forth about writing to you regarding my self - medication of Asperger 's Syndrome , but the reader posted earlier convinced me .
I , too , am diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome ; people tell me I 'm intense , committed , hard - nosed , highly principled ( on a borderline - pathological level ) , honest / blunt to a fault , overly formal / polite , etc .
At that time , I also became friends with a group of people that , had I not started smoking cannabis on a regular basis , I would have never been friends with .
I started going to parties ( something I had never , ever done before ) , speaking out about issues that moved me , and just generally interacting with people in a manner I had never been comfortable with .
That is not to say that I 'm a shy person ; I have never been a shy individual , I 've never hesitated to " tell it like it is " or to speak up if I feel wronged .
But something about cannabis made me socially " normal " ( a word I do n't agree with ; I support neurodiversity as a concept ) .
Cutting through the haze of daily cannabis use ( and there is a haze ; take it from someone who 's been smoking daily for 7 + years now ) can be difficult .
But for me at least , that haze is a moot point , and sometimes even a bonus .
Ask my girlfriend ; about a year ago , I told her I was going to stop using cannabis .
After two weeks she was ready to kill me .
She told me that our relationship was in jeopardy if I did n't get back on the cannabis .
It sounds extreme , but she said it in one of those half - kidding / I 'm - really - being - serious kind of ways .
When I 'm not using cannabis regularly , I become an incredibly manic over - achiever who does not let petty obstacles like peers , social stigmas , or friends get in his way .
When I 'm not on cannabis , it is nothing for me to end a years - long friendship because I perceive it as getting in the way of my achievement ( and this has happened before ; it took a lot of work to bring it back ) .
Not only that , but my " routines " ( AS term ) are n't nearly as important to me if I 'm regularly smoking .
Example : my morning routine is to wake up early , put on a pot of coffee , let the dog out , pour my cup of coffee , let the dog back in , stir in my cream , then sit on the couch and read or listen to my iPod until my coffee is done .
If I have n't been smoking regularly , and my girlfriend comes down and lets out the dog BEFORE I put on the pot of coffee , that will completely ruin my day if not my entire week .
I 'll be irritable by the time I get to work , and liable to snap at the smallest provocation .
On the other hand , if I had smoked the night before , I will notice that my routine has been jockeyed , but it just wo n't bother me that much .
The same goes for my social connections ; when I smoke , I reflect upon , and come to value a social connection , but it 's a cognitive process for me ...
It 's not something I do naturally , and it's not something I 'm inclined to do if I 'm sober ( my mind says , " THERES NO TIME , THERES NO TIME " )
I guess you could say my overal point is this :
All people are different .
All people choose to use substances for reasons that you may not understand , or care to understand .
But one thing is consistent with every single person I have ever met in my entire life : Everyone has vices in which they indulge , whether it 's ducking outside of work to smoke a cigarette , ordering an appetizer and dessert with dinner , making your partner wear handcuffs to bed , laying around and playing video games , snorting coke in the bathroom at the bar or club , skipping religious service , blazing up after a hard day 's work , or having a nightcap ...
And everyone has reasons for doing these things .
And until they decide that those reasons are no longer worth doing whatever it is they 're doing , societal stigmas , oppressive laws , and shaming will only alienate people .
Nottinghamshire police force is being investigated by the RSPCA after two alsatian police dogs died when they were left in a car by their handler during the heatwave .
The force , which reported the animals ' death to the organisation , had recently spent £ 300,000 on new kennels , it was revealed today .
The dogs were found dead in a private car which had been left in the car park at Nottinghamshire police headquarters in Arnold on Tuesday afternoon .
Their handler , who was on duty , had gone inside some time before the dogs were found dead .
The handler , who has not been suspended and is now at home on leave , could be prosecuted , the force confirmed .
The maximum sentence for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is six months in prison and a £ 20,000 fine .
The car park is close to the force 's new kennels .
The force has its own dog breeding programme but it is thought the alsatians had been donated by a breeder for public service .
Councillor John Clarke , the chairman of the Nottinghamshire Police Authority , said : " I think there will be some retribution for this at some point in the future .
But I know the team will be mortified .
It 's a very close - knit team .
It 's tragic when you consider we have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on kennels .
Unfortunately tragedies do happen . "
Peter Davies , the assistant chief constable , said : " This is a tragic incident and we value the important work our police dogs carry out on a daily basis .
That is why we swiftly reported this incident to the RSPCA and we will be working with them very closely . "
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said : " It was reported to us yesterday by Nottinghamshire police .
We are investigating and they are co-operating with us .
I am sure this is n't the first incident and it wo n't be the last . "
Police – who laid a bunch of white lilies , chrysanthemums and gypsophila outside their headquarters today – confirmed they had received complaints from angry members of the public .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had received a referral from the force and was deciding whether to investigate .
The Dogs Trust , the UK 's largest dog welfare charity , said it was " saddened " by the news .
A spokeswoman said : " Whilst the cause of death is still to be determined , the charity would like to remind dog owners and police dog handlers that leaving your dog locked in a car can prove fatal , particularly during a heatwave .
It can take just 20 minutes for a dog to die and temperatures reach over 40 degrees in some vehicles . "
The discussion around whether or not jailbreaking iPhones should be exempt from the DMCA has just reached a level of ridiculousness that words can’t really describe any longer .
As some of you might know , Apple and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are in a tussle with one another over whether or not the US Copyright Office should put an exemption in the DMCA allowing the jailbreaking of iPhones .
Apple ’s reasoning for why no exemption should be made is rather …
Over - the - top .
Every three years , the US Copyright Office holds hearings about possible exemptions to the DMCA .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a request to have jailbreaking of iPhones added as an exemption , and Apple has been fighting that request ever since , stating it constitutes a breach of copyright .
Apple ’s most recent filing says that jailbreaking of iPhones could lead to crashing transmission towers – among other things .
According to Apple ’s filing , people can access the iPhone ’s baseband processor ( BBP ) on jailbroken iPhones .
This chip controls the phone ’s connection to the operator ’s network .
By hacking the BBP , you can change the phone ’s exclusive chip identification ( ECID ) , which in turn can be used for malicious purposes .
“ With access to the BBP via jailbreaking , hackers may be able to change the ECID , which in turn can enable phone calls to be made anonymously ( this would be desirable to drug dealers , for example ) or charges for the calls to be avoided , ” Apple said .
It is interesting to note that operators generally rely on SIM cards for identification purposes .
In addition , Apple adds that by giving several jailbroken iPhones the same ECID , you can cause a transmission tower to malfunction , circumvent data limits , or even crash the tower through denial - of - service attacks .
“ In short , taking control of the BPP software would be much the equivalent of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer — to potentially catastrophic result , ” Apple said .
In the filing , Apple neatly summarises its objections to the request by the EFF to allow jailbreaking :
Crashes & instability
Malfunctioning & safety
Invasion of privacy
Exposing children to age - inappropriate content
Viruses & malware
Inability to update software
Cellular network impact
Piracy of developers ’ applications
Instability of developers ’ applications
Increased support burden
Developer relationships
The Apple / iPhone brand
Limitation on ability to innovate
I have to hand it to Apple – they know how to push all the right buttons .
Of course , the entire list is a prime example of ‘ fear , uncertainty , and doubt ’ .
There are countless mobile platforms out there that are not restricted in the way the iPhone platform is – S60 , Android , webOS , Windows Mobile , Blackberry – and none of them seem to be really posing any problems to mobile operators .
It ’s quite clear that all Apple ’s interested in is making sure the platform stays as closed and controlled as possible , as to ensure a steady flow of income to the company – jailbreaking is done because people want control over the phone they bought , and what applications they ’ll run on it .
There ’s nothing wrong with Apple wanting to protect its interests , but it ’s sad that it has to resort to such FUD to get there .
Twitter has been used to fight tyranny , deliver tragic news , follow politics , and now some California residents have found another innovative purpose for the microblogging service : marketing weed .
A medical marijuana dispensary in California has begun gravitating to online mediums , including Twitter , to get the word out , according to Fox News .
Under California law , nonprofit dispensaries can distribute marijuana to patients who have a medical need for this alternative treatment .
The Artist 's Collective
The Los Angeles based Artist 's Collective is a small , nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary that donates some of its proceeds to opportunity grants for artists , writers , performers , and musicians .
To be able to purchase marijuana from the Artist 's Collective you need to have a doctor 's note certifying that you would benefit from marijuana as a medical treatment .
The Collective has recently launched a large digital presence with its own Web site , Facebook page , MySpace account and Twitter feed , and uses all of these online tools to connect with its members .
Twitter , however , turns out to be the Collective 's best way to reach out to the public .
The Collective has only been open for a few months , but the nonprofit told Fox News that business really started hopping once it signed up for Twitter in June .
The Collective 's tweet stream mixes adverts for the latest pot strains and sales , with quirky tweets from a " day in the life of a medical marijuana delivery driver " -- the Artist 's Collective offers free delivery ( sorry weed only , no side trips for food ) .
Recent Collective tweets :
" The most frequently heard comment when crossing the threshold of a new patient 's home is , " Sorry about the mess . "
" Place your orders now for Rice Krispie Jamboree !
Made with South Bay Healing Magic !
Available by July 11th . "
" The Russian mob calls .
( At least that 's the accent . )
" Vat is this strain ?
Are you wholesaler ? "
No , we 're a creative non-profit .
Do n't shoot ! "
" New for our Members : Blackberry Kush and Green Crack .
Blackberry is excellent for relaxation while Green Crack will give you an energy boost . "
Why Twitter ?
I guess it 's not entirely surprising that Twitter was the online game - changer for increasing the Collective 's membership .
And it makes sense .
I mean , let 's face it , when you 're flying high on Green Crack or Blackberry Kush and dying for that Domino 's guy to show up with your pizza , the time it takes to read one tweet -- 140 characters or less -- is about as long as you can concentrate .
Think weed is the only drug advertised on the Internet ?
Think again .

" We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit .
It was n't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else , it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place , and it was not an organized demonstration ....
Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back .
It was like the last straw .
It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us ... "
Today is the 40th Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots , which became " Christopher Street Liberation Day " , and ultimately the Gay Pride movement , the festival you attend in your city every year .
But it was n't pretty .
As always , speaking truth to power and religious moralization never is .
There have been many , many come before us that have fought for our freedoms .
Not all of them have been in uniform .
And some will never get the attention that their bravery and persistance deserve .
There have already been some very good diaries on the events at Stonewall Inn which changed the way gay people view themselves in America forever .
Some diaries did n't get the attention they deserved , while others were blessed with an author 's name who Kossacks recognize and rec more frequently .
But I just thought there would be something terribly wrong to let June 28th , the Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots , to go by without at least trying to pin my own personal celebratory card on the wall for my sisters and brothers to remember and celebrate .
So here 's to my Forequeers .
Thank you girls , some of you adults with a full head of political activism who fought with years of preparation , and some innocent young kids left homeless on the benches of Christopher Park who stood up just out of the innate sense that something wrong needed to stop , all of whom made that night the night gay people would never go back into the closet without a fight .

I ’ve worked in offices , and I ’ve worked in cubicles .
( I ’m actually writing this in a double - wide that I share with another writer .
Thankfully , she ’s busy transcribing a tape , so I have a moment ’s peace . )
And I ’m here to tell you : Collaboration is great , but sometimes I ’d kill for a door .
I will confess :
Once , I almost did .
I got into a loud bar fight with an architect on the topic of cubicles .
Fittingly , this outburst took place just down the road from the University of Colorado , where in 1968 , a fine - arts professor named Robert Propst came up with the “ Action Office . ”
Propst ’s vision was to give white - collar workers , then toiling amid rows of desks in huge open spaces , both more privacy and a way to individualize their space .
By that measure , cubicles were an improvement .
But in the hands of space - mad facilities planners , the idea was perverted to justify an officescape that resembled the Chicago stockyards .
Dilbert was born .
Scott Adams got rich .
The vogue for one - size - fits - all offices reached its apotheosis in the dotcom years , when Intel CEO Andy Grove famously foreswore his suite for an 8 - foot - by - 9 - foot cubicle .
Endearing as that egalitarian gesture was , nobody has yet been able to prove that shoehorning knowledge workers into . . .
( Young colleague plunks himself down on my desk .
Wants advice on an upcoming story .
Go away ! )
Where was I ?
Oh , yes .
Productivity .
Lost .
Right .
Like many problems in the work arena , this one turns on numbers .
The savings that accrue from jamming employees into cubes rather than offices , particularly in high - rent markets , can be huge .
The productivity gains that come from giving workers a space where they can do uninterrupted , heads - down work — those are harder to quantify .
Shockingly , there has been no defining Frederick Taylor - esque research on knowledge - worker productivity .
But Tom Davenport , professor of management and information technology at Babson College , has tried to crack the code with a yearlong survey of workers , academics , and executives in HR , IT , and facilities planning .
He found that three factors determined white - collar performance : management and organization , information technology , and workplace design .
The last , he says , has a measurable effect — for good and ill .
“ Open offices do lead to more unstructured communication , ” he says .
But “ those same offices can lead to problems of concentration .
If you value reflection or deep thought , it gets tough . ”
Call it the attention - deficit office .
Office - design companies are struggling to remedy the problem .
Herman Miller is rethinking both the cubicle and the office landscape and plans to unveil new designs in the near future .
Its engineers are experimenting with a signal light that could connect from your phone — or a Word document — to the name tag on your “ workstation ” ( to Millerites , using the word “ cubicle ” is like cussing in church ) , glowing red if you do n’t want to be interrupted .
They ’ve also developed a sound - muffling technology that allows workers who deal with confidential information to have voice privacy , although it creates too much of a din for widespread adoption .
But Gervais Tompkin , regional design director of architectural firm Gensler ’s San Francisco office , says simply designing a better cube is like putting lipstick on a pig .
“ Dilbert was a real - estate effectiveness issue , ” he says .
“ The effectiveness of the employee is now worth more than the real estate . ”
That ’s why some progressive companies are relocating the space - planning function from the COO ’s office to the HR department .
( A snorting laugh rumbles across the newsroom as a jovial editor regales coworkers with a tale about the University of Georgia ’s mascot .
Much hilarity ensues .
Where ’s my mute button ? )
