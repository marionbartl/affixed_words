When we come into contact with the other person , our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion , even if that person says and does things that are not easy to accept .
We practice in this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person being lovable .
We really have to understand the person we want to love .
If our love is only a will to possess , it is not love .
If we only think of ourselves , if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person , we can not love .
People deal too much with the negative , with what is wrong .
Why not try and see positive things , to just touch those things and make them bloom ?
In true dialogue , both sides are willing to change .
Training is needed in order to love properly ; and to be able to give happiness and joy , you must practice DEEP LOOKING directed toward the other person you love .
Because if you do not understand this person , you cannot love properly .
Understanding is the essence of love .
If you cannot understand , you can not love .
That is the message of the Buddha .
[ True Love .
A Practice for Awakening the Heart . ]
So if we love someone , we should train in being able to listen .
By listening with calm and understanding , we can ease the suffering of another person .
[ True Love . A Practice for Awakening the Heart . ]
Love is the capacity to take care , to protect , to nourish .
If you are not capable of generating that kind of energy toward yourself - if you are not capable of taking care of yourself , of nourishing yourself , of protecting yourself - it is very difficult to take care of another person .
In the Buddhist teaching , it 's clear that to love oneself is the foundation of the love of other people .
Love is a practice .
Love is truly a practice .
[ Shambhala Sun March 2006 ]
The essence of love and compassion is understanding , the ability to recognize the physical , material , and psychological suffering of others , to put ourselves " inside the skin " of the other .
We " go inside " their body , feelings , and mental formations , and witness for ourselves their suffering .
Shallow observation as an outsider is not enough to see their suffering .
We must become one with the subject of our observation .
When we are in contact with another 's suffering , a feeling of compassion is born in us .
Compassion means , literally , " to suffer with . "
Some good news from Arkansas .
Importantly , the judge was willing to overturn a public vote on because it was unconstitutional :
A circuit judge today stuck down Arkansas ’ ban against unmarried couples adopting or foster - parenting children .
Act 1 , passed by voters in 2008 , unconstitutionally burdens non-marital relationships and acts of sexual intimacy between adults by forcing them to choose between becoming a parent and having any meaningful type of intimate relationship outside of marriage , Circuit Judge Chris Piazza ruled in a lawsuit challenging the law .
“ It infringes upon the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed to all citizens of Arkansas , ” the judge ruled in the lawsuit filed by the ACLU .
The ruling was based on the state constitution , not the U.S. constitution .
Here ’s the Judge ’s decision :

6 Ways to not Reach Your Full Wealth Potential
When we are young , we often hear about how we need to work hard to reach our potential .
We may also hear some bright , young professional referred as someone with great potential .
But how often do we think about our wealth potential .
We all have the ability to reach our dreams and achieve financial freedom .
Some of us may even achieve financial freedom with out maximizing wealth potential .
And that ’s because there are some things that will keep you from reaching your potential that you need to address .
Here are 6 things that can keep you from reaching your wealth potential :
1. Paying interest
The most obvious impediment to reaching your wealth potential is debt .
Any time you are paying interest , you are giving money to someone else for no other purpose than to pay for the privilege of borrowing money .
You get almost no benefit from paying that money .
Even worse , you are paying that money to someone else , instead of using it yourself to build your own financial success .
Get out of debt as soon as you can , including taking some steps to pay your mortgage off as quickly as possible .
The less money you pay in interest to others , the more you have to put to work on your own behalf .
2 . Making interest - free loans to the government
In a very backward way , many of us get excited about receiving a tax return .
This is because we think of it as “ free ” money .
The truth is , unless you are eligible to avoid paying taxes altogether , this is actually your money — it ’s just being returned to you .
Basically , you ’ve just provided the government with an interest - free loan .
The government gets to use that money , and then returns it to you .
Check your tax withholdings to make sure that you are claiming the proper number of exemptions , and stop holding out extra .
This sort of “ savings plan ” does n’t put your money to work for you .
The IRS estimates the average tax return to be at more than $ 2,000 .
Consider the interest you could earn if you invested that instead ?
Along those same lines , make sure that you handle your investments in the most tax efficient way possible .
If necessary , get a tax professional to help you figure out the best way to structure your assets so that you get the maximum tax efficiency .
It ’s usually well worth the cost .
3. Failure to factor inflation into your plans
Often , when we plan for the future , we forget about inflation .
Inflation is the erosion of your money ’s spending power .
The fact that costs increase each year means that it takes more dollars to buy things .
You do n’t get any more of these items ( sometimes you get less ) , but it takes more money to make your purchases .
You may need $ 12 in 15 years to by something that costs $ 10 today .
You can see how it can quickly add up , keeping your money from going as far as it could .
As a result , it is vital that you take steps to prepare for inflation , and arrange your finances so that you have investments whose returns beat inflation .
4 . Focusing too much on the small things
We ’ve heard about the “ latte factor ” and how making small changes to live more frugally can help you save money in the long run .
This is true .
However , sometimes it is n’t always efficient .
Especially if you are so focused on clipping coupons that you miss the fact that you might be spending more money in paying interest on your auto loan or on some other large purchase .
Those tiny savings probably wo n’t overcome the larger amounts of money bleeding out in other areas of your finances .
In the end , you need to see the big picture , and realize that focusing too much on small savings can limit you .
5 . Getting too emotional
Money inspires all sorts of emotions .
Fear , enthusiasm , greed and pleasure are all emotions that can come out as a result of how you are involved with money .
While it is probably impossible to completely separate your emotions from your finances , you can tone it down a little .
Try to avoid making decisions ( like abandoning your 401k ) in the heat of the moment .
Probably the worst times to make financial decisions are when you are fearful and when you are overly optimistic .
Both mind states can lead to poor decision making that can limit your earnings in the future .
6. Spending and saving without a plan
You need to have a plan in order to reach your wealth potential .
Without a clear idea of what you are doing with your money , it is impossible to shepherd it in an effective manner .
You need to have clear priorities as to what you want to spend your money on , so that you are able to live the lifestyle you want .
Just as important , you need to have a plan for saving and growing your money .
Choosing the best investments ( including where you put your cash savings ) is a vital part of maximizing your wealth potential while preserving your future .
Having a plan can also help you maintain some objectivity and check your emotions .
This list is by far not the most complete list and us human beings invariably find new ways of sabotaging our own financial well being .
Do you have other examples of how we hinder our progress towards our wealth potential ?
Let ’s hear them and we will update this list with your suggestions .

The other day at my shopping centre there was a young woman perched behind a makeshift desk asking people if they had any old bits and pieces of gold or gold jewellery that were surplus to requirements .
The gist of the message was :
With the price of gold booming you could be sitting on a small fortune .
" Exchange your unwanted , damaged , outdated and worn gold for CASH ! "
The flyer in the form of a glossy $ 50 note goes on : " Our consultants will test and value your gold items .
We will give you CASH on the spot ! " .
So , here it is 2010 and everyone wants gold .
It 's a funny old world ; it was n't that long ago gold was on the nose , especially in Australia .
In the late 1990s gold was considered by Australia 's economic movers and shakers as old hat , soiled goods .
We were told our sophisticated financial system had moved on .
Well we all know where the system ended up - in the GFC without a paddle .
Had you invested in some shiny stuff you would be well rewarded by now .
This week the price of gold jumped by more than $ 19 .
It 's sitting somewhere around $ US1115.00 an ounce .
In November 1997 the then Treasurer , Peter Costello , shocked some people when he announced he 'd signed off on the sale of $ 2 billion worth of Australian bullion .
On the day he announced the sale the price was around $ US306.00 an ounce .
At the time , according to Mr Costello , gold " no longer plays a significant role in the international financial system " .
Three days after the bullion was sold Australian gold shares slumped 16 per cent .
With gold languishing there were more than a few people within government and the Reserve Bank congratulating themselves on such a prescient sell off .
But no - one else seemed to be selling , certainly not the US , and Robert Champion de Crespigny at the time expressed concern about Australia 's ambitious move .
The then executive chairman of Normandy Mining , Australia 's largest gold mining group said :
" I think the Reserve bank has handled this extremely clumsily " .
Gold , he said , had a future if you took a long term view .
So here it was 1997 and Australia had sold two thirds of its gold assets in a single day , and sold into a buyer 's market .
While the sale helped pay down debts , the deal was to cost Australia billions of dollars in the long run .
But at the time people were lining up to congratulate the Treasurer .
Bill Shields who was with the Reserve Bank and who went on to become Macquarie Bank 's chief economist seemed to echo the Federal Treasurer 's words .
He said he thought the gold price would remain under pressure and depending on how supply responded it could fall lower .
Gold , he said " no longer has a role in the monetary system and with low inflation it is an unattractive investment relative to interest bearing securities and equities " .
While that sentiment was certainly shared in the plush offices of bankers in Australia , it was n't on the minds of China 's money men and women .
Two years after Australia 's Government sold off two thirds of the nation 's bullion , China made a startling admission .
Over six years it had quietly bought 454 tonnes of gold ( presumably some of it was Australia 's ) .
The gold price fell sharply in 1999 , down to $ US251.70 , mainly on concerns that central banks were reducing gold bullion reserves .
But by the end of that same year gold had rebounded and was fetching US $ 338 an ounce .
Since then it has gone up steadily .
This week it reached beyond $ US1134.00 .
That 's nearly three and a half times the price when Australia flogged two thirds of the farm .
At that price I 'm thinking seriously about that old gold crown at the back of my mouth .
But let me say as a journalist I make a lousy investment advisor , although I can say with some confidence I wish my superfund had bought some of Peter 's gold in 1997 .
So where to now ?
With the US economy chugging along and fears of another correction , the greenback is seen as no safe haven .
And what about the US debt ?
Add to that the sheer amount of paper currency being printed and the old gold coins are looking good .
Europe is in a worst state with Greece , Portugal and Spain in all sorts of economic bother .
As a result confidence in the euro has fallen and it has taken a flogging on world currency markets .

Republicans are in the White House
From Mr Doug Henwood .
Sir , Clive Crook ’s call ( April 12 ) for a revival of an old - style GOP opposition is a little strange , since Barack Obama himself is a liberal Republican .
Or maybe not so liberal a Republican .
Consider the healthcare bill .
The individual mandate has its origins in the Nixon administration ’s response to Teddy Kennedy ’s single - payer bill in the early 1970s .
The insurance marketplace has its roots in the American Enterprise Institute ’s response to Bill Clinton ’s healthcare scheme .
Speaking of Mr Clinton , was n’t it he who said “ we ’re all Eisenhower Republicans here ” ?
And he was n’t too happy about it .
The not - so - liberal Republican part is most visible in education policy .
President Obama has continued George W. Bush ’s “ No child left behind ” emphasis on testing and charter schools , and has even taken up attacking teachers ’ unions .
Arne Duncan , his education secretary , has declared in terms indistinguishable from Milton Friedman ’s that Hurricane Katrina was the best thing that ever happened to the New Orleans school system because it furthered that quasi-privatisation agenda .
Who needs “ moderate ” Republicans in opposition when they ’re already in power ?

I have Ubuntu installed on my notebook computer ( from now onwards , I will call it host computer in this post ) which has a wired ethernet connection to a broadband internet service provider .
I want to have a WiFi network broadcast in my room using my host computer so that any other notebook ( guest ) or smart phone with WiFi capability in the vicinity can connect to the broadband internet with host notebook working as a gateway .
I had this problem from long ago since I wanted my broadband to be shared on my Sony Ericsson P1i .
and I searched whole of the internet to find a solution but none actually worked .
Today after some fiddling I finally made my P1i to hook to the broadband with Ubuntu notebook working as a gateway .
This tutorial I am presenting has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx and works perfectly fine .
I can't guarantee it to work on earlier distributions because I myself had seen funny characters in WiFi network search list in P1i on 9.10 Karmic Koala and it never worked for me .
So , lets proceed .
1 . Turn on your notebook 's WiFi if there 's a dedicated switch to turn it on .
On my Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Si 3655 notebook , WiFi can be turned on usingkey combination .
2. Click on theicon ( which looks like ) in the notification area and click Create3 .
In the dialog box that pops up , put the network name as anything ( I put ) .
Setas .
In thebox , enter any five digit number ( I entered ) .
Click4 .
Now right click on theicon and click
In thedialog box that pops up , go to thetab .
Click ( or the network name you had provided ) and click Edit .
5 .
In thedialog box that opens up , set theas .
Make sure thecheckbox is checked and in thetab , andis set to .
Now click Apply .
Your network is ready !!!
Congrats !!!
But thats only 50 percent of the hurdle complete .
You might have reached this far several times using other tutorials and how tos available on the net .
Lets proceed through to get the configuration details for the client pc / notebook / smart phone .
6 . Open a terminal ( for eg. by pressingthen typingand pressing enter ) .
In the terminal typeand press enter .
Scroll down tothe place whereis written .
Beside that , in the second line you will see three things viz.and .
Note these things somewhere safely .
In my case inet addr is 10.42.43.1 and Mask is 255.255.255.0 .
No need to note7 .
Use the following manual configuration details for the client system : IPv4 Addr : 10.42.43.2 ( for a yet another machine use 10.42.43.3 and so on ... )
Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0DNS
Address1 : 208.67.222.222DNS
Address2 : 208.67.220.220
After doing all this above you may notice that the client computer connects to net successfully but the host computer is n't able to access any website .
Thats because the network manager blanks the DNS records set inTo solve this , typein any terminal and there appendand save the file .
Afterwards you will be able to surf the web on gateway computer as well , normally .
You may notice that the network manager blanks out /etc/resolv.conf every now and then and you 've to manually edit it and add nameservers .
This is a very common problem faced by GNOME users .
To get rid of this just type the following command in terminal and press enter .
Now I am going to explain how did I connect my P1i to this network to use the broadband internet .
1. Turn on2 .
Touchfor scanning for new networks
You will see the newly created networklisted there with a lock icon.3 .
Now go toby tappingin thepage and tapping4 .
There tap5 .
Fill in the details as shown in the screenshot and create the connection .
6 .
Now in thetab highlightand tap , then tapand fill in the details as shown in the screenshot .
Similarly fill in the details for the DNS address .
Pressand come back to .
There scan for networks .
You will notice a yellow star beside th network name WLAN .
Hit thebutton after highlighting WLAN.7 .

Marching to defend Maoist barricades against right - wing provocations .
[ For more coverage of the struggle in Nepal , please click HERE . ]
Story and photos by Jed Brandt , Kathmandu
May 11 , 2010 -- jedbrandt.net --
The largest mobilisation of human beings in Nepal 's history brought hundreds of thousands of villagers into the capital Kathmandu for the May 1 protests – and the entire country to a standstill .
On May 1 , this city belonged to the members and supporters of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) .
From Kalinki to the Old Bus Park , packed buses poured into the city .
Every seat and aisle was filled .
Young men perched on the roofs .
Bags of rice , lentils and vegetables were stockpiled in the schools , wedding halls and construction sites that served as makeshift camps for the protesters .
Since I arrived in Kathmandu , it has been a remarkable thing to see the hammer and sickle waved so proudly across the city .
But on May 1 , seeing thousands of union workers walk across the shuttered city to greet villagers , many of whom were seeing a city for the first time – all that put flesh and blood to the old communist symbol .
Hammer for the workers , sickle for the peasants .
Business was completely stopped .
Cars and motorcycles were called off the roads and so , for the first time in a month , crisp blue skies opened up as the veil of smog lifted .
Then the Maoists implemented a nationwide general strike – called a bandh in South Asia .
Their supporters closed businesses , schools and transportation in the capital and other centres .
It was a major show of power by the Maoist party .
And it was more – it was a daring political initiative that confirmed the Maoists ’ genuine popular mandate .
Six months ago , the Maoist vice - chair Dr. Baburam Bhattarai described the plan :
Now we [ can ] really practice what we have been preaching .
That means the fusion of the strategy of protracted people 's war and the tactic of general insurrection .
What we have been doing since 2005 is the path of preparation for general insurrection through our work in the urban areas and our participation in the coalition government .
-- Interview , October 26 , 2009 .
Now , in May , we are all seeing the results of those preparations .
No other party , no other force in Nepal could pull anything like this off .
By contrast , the enemies of the Maoists were only capable of paranoid fear - mongering about country people entering the capital , threats of violent repression and their unsuccessful attempt to get merchants to defy the bandh .
Shutting down a capital
Starting May 2 major intersections were blockaded , most with singers , dance performances and music playing throughout the day while protesters sat in knots with long single - file lines stretching out to the radial streets .
Each of these eighteen sites was dubbed a " barricade " , though the only physical obstacles in the streets were the large excited crowds of rebels .
The main focus of the general strike was in Kathmandu , but ten other urban areas also held mobilisations , and rallies were held along the Indian border in Nepal ’s southern Terai .
Cries of “ Lal salaam ! ” ( Red salute ! ) went up from the rows of people lining both sides of the road .
Smiles , raised fists and pride .
Simple people held the city , and the power of the day was lost on no one .
When Prachanda , Dr. Bhattarai , Kiran and other Maoist leaders drove the length of the “ Red Revolution ” Ring Road , shouts and raised fists rippled the entire way .
Whatever they claim in the government halls , the Maoist connection to Nepal ’s vast , impoverished people is umistakable .
Prachanda is their leader .
Even second - string Maoists command more respect on the street than the unelected parties sitting in the government .
Violence and chaos were predicted by the governmental parties .
The Maoists displayed overwhelming people ’s power and sobriety -- despite repeated violent provocations from the pro-status quo Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) - allied Youth Force , Hindutva gangs in the south and the tensions which accompany any bandh .
Breaking out of a stalemate
This political crisis in Nepal has at times seemed slow and festering .
But not now .
Aggressive forces are pushing for resolution .
There is impatience all around .
It has become the kind of crisis that can suddenly rupture into a military coup or a lower class revolution .
The deadlocked Constituent Assembly has not met in over a month .
The May 28 deadline for writing Nepal 's first democratic constitution is rapidly approaching .
“ We are in mobilisation now , non-stop until victory ” , said one student leader manning a barricade near the government ministries .
“ Our strategy is direct to socialism , our tactics will not be simple . ”
For their part , the Maoists reject new talks with the governmental parties until the prime minister steps aside .
And so the spotlight shifts from negotiations to the streets – where the dancing and festivity of May 1 increasingly gave way to tension and open street clashes .
And even then , the tactical array of this Janandolan ( people 's power uprising ) put dancing in front of fighting .
At each of the eighteen barricades , where several thousands held key junctions through sheer numbers , dance troupes encouraged participation and popular ballads brought the young crowds to their feet .
Some contingents would practice running in files back and forth through the streets , rushing forward to stop on a dime .
But they too would cheer and dance with each sprint .
People 's power and provocations
Leaders of governing parties openly called on merchants to defy the Maoist shutdown .
On May 5 the UML - allied Youth Force fired shots at a group of YCL cadre .
A semi-automatic pistol was found on the scene , with spent cartridges .
Luckily no one was injured .
Then on May 7 , upper class Nepalis staged the largest non-Maoist rally of the week – about 20,000 gathered in Kathmandu – their official purpose was to urge a non-violent conclusion to the constitutional process .
Leaders of the sponsors , the Chamber of Commerce and Nepal Bar Association , insisted they were non-partisan , and that the rally was not in defiance of the strike .
But then anti-Maoist groups formed out of that rally to launch provocations against the large encampments of Maoists .
Kathmandu ’s “ peace rally ” quickly proved to be anything but peaceful .
I arrived in the area just as their peace rally had ended .
Several breakaway groups had marched towards the Maoist barricades .
Several hundred anti-Maoists marched up to the Sunhara barricade where roughly 1000 Maoists held the intersection .
The counterrevolutionaries chanted they would put " Prachanda 's head in a noose . "
The Maoists responded by turning up their music and encouraging people to dance instead of allowing themselves to be provoked .
" We make a singing revolution , a dancing revolution – a new type of revolution " , said Swanaam , a Maoist leader who is involved with ideological work .
" We will not act against those people only because they disagree with us . "
Meanwhile , the fact that the 200 YCL cadre defended that intersection and were each armed with fighting sticks – well , that also did n’t hurt .
Wiping his eyes , swollen from police tear gas , YCL commander Pun described another of the breakaway groups as " vigilantes ” .
He told me they threw rocks into the protesters ' mess hall at the City Hall convention centre .
Bystanders and protesters were hit with sticks .
When the YCL and others responded , police turned loose with tear gas into the mess hall and baton charges at those on the street .
Roughly a thousand Maoist protesters broke through two weak police lines to protect their encampment , and were repelled with more tear gas .
They threw rocks back at the police as they scattered into the Old Bus Park .
Light clashes between Maoists and the police erupted around the city center for two hours .
The entire area between the convention centre and Singhadurbar was shaken .
Police also gassed the law campus of Tribuvan University , which had been taken over by a revolutionary student faction and offered as housing to protesters from the villages .
Clusters of revolutionary protesters massed near the Singhadurbar ministries that the Maoists have been blockading for days .
Dozens were lined up along the sidewalks rinsing their eyes , red and swollen from the gas .
Many smeared white toothpaste over their faces to cool the burn .
As I interviewed people , we could hear the street fighting just a few blocks away .
Diwash , an earnest young communist and student body president at one of the national university ’s satellite campuses , was cool in the face of the provocations .
He told me :
Obviously their motive is to lengthen the strike to the end of the interim constitution .
They want to bring presidential rule by Yadav .
This is only the bad dream of the government parties .
We are strong enough to make revolution .
We can not capture only the state .
If we get Prachanda as prime minister , there are many in the army who are in our hand .
An older man yelled out " 80 per cent ! "
Diwash dismissed the vigilante attacks , saying they were distractions and not the " main contradiction " .
" When their psychology is down , we capture the state .
We are strong , steady " , Diwash continued .
" Ready to put communism , not pure communism in the abstract , but socialism .
We can put hospitals , all the schools to the people and not as business .
A new constitution means land reforms and people 's government that develop to communism . "
The fighting in the capital was clearly threatening to escalate .
And , though the detail of their calculations are not known , the Maoist leadership decided that they were not yet ready , at this moment , to ride the tiger all the way to a showdown with the military .
An orientation for ongoing confrontation
Prachanda , chairperson of the Maoist party , appeared on Nepal television late May 7 to announce that the strike would be suspended .
He called for a rally to converge on the next day .
He said " decisive struggle " would continue -- to topple the current government and replace it with one led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) .
On Saturday , May 8 , I joined one of the hundreds of feeder marches into the city centre .
I was surrounded by a couple thousand Newari people marching from the north side of town .
The drummer corps leading us kept the pace .
But the rest of the marchers were more involved in conversations over the events of the last days than chanting .
The tension was palpable .
The Prime Minister had not stepped down .
There had been two days of escalating confrontations .
And this crowd was clearly braced for new provocations .
We passed through the Durbamarg shopping centre .
All the expensive stores of the elite were again open for business .
There was obviously little satisfaction for us in that .
At the Martyrs ' Field in Ratna Park , I ran into Madushi Bhattarai , a student leader at Tribuvan University .
“ Do you know what 's going on , ” I asked .
" We will know today .
A step back , I think , for two steps forward " , said Madushi .
" In the people 's war we had two ceasefires , and used them to advance .
We will have a new tactical phase . "
Madushi's speaks English with uncommon fluency , having studied in London .
She confided that she did n't know what to expect , but saw this as a " twisting path towards May 28 " .
" The Janandolan has n't been called off .
Not the agitations either " , Madushi said .
" If you look at Nepali Maoists from the eye of past communist movements , you wo n't be able to understand us .
Since our movement 's earliest years , no one has been able to predict how we will go .
This defines our leadership .
Our goal is socialism , that is constant and we are not confused .
Whether elections or people 's war -- or this general strike -- we find our tactics from our goals . "
" We have confidence in our leaders , " Madushi said , shaking her head in acknowledgment that her own parents are among those leaders of the Maoist party .
" Many of the cadre in my arc were injured yesterday and are very frustrated with the stop to the strike .
People were recovering from injuries and heard the announcement on television without meetings inside the party . "
Wrapping up a dress rehearsal
When we arrived at the rally , the waiting crowd was sober .
A low buzz of talk rose from the many groupings of people .
Comedians and musicians took turns on the stage until the last of the feeder marches entered .
Several party leaders spoke .
But everyone was waiting for Prachanda .
" We made history with the most peaceful strike in Nepal 's history " , Prachanda began .
" We felt the pressing need , as the largest party , to be sensitive to the plight of the people ” – even while the government had remained indifferent to the just demands for the prime minister ’s resignation .
" People who supported us have started to hurt .
Labourers were starting to suffer .
We have called the strike back for now . "
" The ball is now in the government 's court " , Prachanda said .
" We will respond only after it comes back . "
Prachanda rejected negotiations with the government so long as the prime minister refuses to step down .
" If we do n’t have the peace and constitution we want , the patience , non-violence and civility of this strike will not be seen the next time . "
Prachanda then told his assembled cadre :
The strike is suspended , but this struggle has not ended .
Janandolan III has started .
The strike was only a dress rehearsal .
We will show you the entire drama before May 28 if our demands are not met .
Nepal ’s Maoists do n’t cling to rigid models from China or Russia .
They are famous for their non-dogmatic ways .
But Prachanda ’s words here do clearly echo Lenin ’s famous description of early Russian street clashes as a “ dress rehearsal ” for the final seizure of power in 1917 .
Since 2006 , the Maoists in Nepal have been working to supplement their rural People ’s Liberation Army with powerful new upsurge of popular combativity .
Janaldolan I was a 1990 uprising that gave birth to this generation of revolutionary leaders .
Janadolan II was the 2006 uprising that brought down the monarchy .
Janadolan III is the Maoists ’ term for the third uprising that is now being waged for their radical program of a " New Nepal " .
By calling this last week of strikes and protests a “ dress rehearsal ” , Prachanda is saying that the curtain may rise on a long - prepared opening act .

Three - term GOP Senator Robert Bennett of Utah was defeated in a pre-primary state party caucus on Saturday , a defeat being blamed on anti-incumbent sentiment and Bennett's " liberalism " – Utah Republican Mormons being the liberal firebrands they are .
In particular , the state 's small but vocal contingent of TeaTards was irate over Bennett 's vote for TARP :
" I do n't think it 's a matter of conservative .
I think it 's a matter of fiscal or financial responsibility , what the Tea Party people are about and the vote for TARP and the vote for the bailout was , in our opinion , pretty fiscally irresponsible and that 's what 's raised the ire of most people , " David Kirkham , a Tea Party activist , told CNN in an interview .
These are bedrock TeaTard talking points .
" Fiscal responsibility " mandates an all - encompassing hatred of the stimulus package , TARP , and all other financial crisis - related spending over the past two years .
But surely they are happy about the chance to ( finally ) live in a stimulus - free world , as FY2010 is rapidly coming to a close and there are no existing or foreseeable plans to renew the massive distribution of Federal funds at the state and local levels .
In a world in which cuts to the military budget are being discussed openly , you can bet the house ( in the unlikely event that you still own it ) on Congress rejecting any follow - up stimulus proposal .
We are all getting used to the fact that our respective states – especially , but not limited to , places like California , Illinois , Georgia , Virginia , and Michigan – had a pretty miserable time with their budgets in FY2010 .
Now , as we approach the 7/1/2010 start of the stimulus - free fiscal year , we will soon be looking back on 2009 as the good ol ' days .
Take a look at this summary list of proposed austerity measures being considered in state capitols around the country .
We 've all watched the financial disaster in Greece unfold with an unusually high level of interest here in the States .
Rarely do we concern ourselves with the domestic politics of foreign countries .
But we have been entranced by Greece 's meltdown , probably because we know without saying it that the same thing will happen here before long .
And it will be sooner than many of us imagine at the state level .
Next year 's state and local budgets are going to see the kind of triage solution applied in Greece – 10 , 15 , or 20 percent across - the - board cuts .
Other states will reject that tactic and make Tough Choicestm , meaning they will focus all of the damage on things used by the unwashed masses – public education , transit , Medicare , CHIP , and a grab - bag of other programs that are n't useful to suburbanites and thus politically expendable .
To steal a phrase from George W. , our reaction to this impending budgetary armaggeddon is " uniquely American . "
The Greeks rioted ; we applaud .
They demanded fewer cuts ; we demand more .
They understand the relationship between social spending and their standard of living ; we do n't .
They realize how much worse things are about to get ; we seem to think that recovery might be around the corner .

The Green party was today hailing a historic general election performance , after Caroline Lucas became the party 's first - ever MP by winning the Brighton Pavilion seat .
But while Lucas , the Green leader , said the election showed voters " want something different " , her party 's overall share of the vote actually dropped slightly nationwide , hovering near a disappointing 1 % .
While they fielded a record 300 - plus candidates , the Greens opted to concentrate most resources on just three target seats , Brighton Pavilion among them , a risky decision that seems to have left candidates elsewhere squeezed amid tough battles between the big three parties .
Lucas 's success in turning a 5,000 Labour majority into a margin of success of just over 1,200 , a swing of 8.4 % , represents a stunning coup for a relatively tiny organisation .
The 49 - year - old MEP – she will now give up her Strasbourg seat – has been the favourite in Brighton for some months , but a resurgent Labour challenge threatened to derail her momentum at the last minute .
In the end , the count was sufficiently tight that it was almost 6 am when Lucas was finally declared the winner , to shouts of joy and disbelief from supporters in the room .
" For once , the word ' historic ' fits the bill , " she told the audience to loud cheers .
" Thank you so much for putting the politics of hope above the politics of fear .
This is n't just a moment when one MP out of more than 600 is elected .
It 's where a whole political party takes , for the first time , its rightful place in our parliament . "
Her victory comes down to a series of factors , including Lucas 's own profile as the face of a party which once eschewed traditional leaders , and a strong party organisation in a city with 13 Green councillors .
More than 200 Green activists were on the ground yesterday making sure supporters went to the polling stations .
Additionally , when the decision was made to focus Green efforts on Brighton 's sizeable population of students and environmentally - minded types , the party was also more ruthless than stereotype would suggest , with the 2005 candidate , Keith Taylor , dumped in favour of Lucas , despite greatly increasing the party 's vote .
He will now take her European parliament seat .
There was mixed success last night in the other two seats the Greens had talked up , albeit more speculatively , as being potentially winnable .
In Norwich South , the 28 - year - old Green deputy leader , Adrian Ramsay , increased his vote to 15 % but still came fourth as the Liberal Democrats unseated Labour 's former home secretary , Charles Clarke .
In Lewisham and Deptford , in south London , Darren Johnson saw his share of the vote fall as Labour 's Joan Ruddock won easily .
Nonetheless , Lucas claimed her election marked " the start of a new political force in Westminister " , saying she would decide which party to support in a hung parliament on a " case - by - case basis " .
As well as two MEPs , the Greens previously had representation on the London , Scottish and Northern Irish assemblies , and more than 125 councillors in England and Wales .
In last year 's European elections , the Greens won an 8.7 % share , well above yesterday 's overall support .
At this election , the Greens sought to highlight policies such as a " citizens ' pension " of £ 170 a week and heavy spending on health and education above their better - known environmental commitments .
Despite the mixed overall result , the party is clearly thrilled at gaining an MP .
Even at 7 am , a crowd of almost 200 activists waited outside the seafront Brighton Centre , where the count took place , to mob Lucas as she finally left .
" We have done something extraordinary today , " she told them as they chanted her name .
" Obviously nobody could cycle in it because it is so small .
You just have time to get in the saddle before getting off again . "
Atlanta Thrashers GM
Don Waddell recently reminded season ticket holders that the club has a favorable schedule in March with many home dates [ including three games against last place Carolina I might add ] .
On the other hand , the April schedule is just plain brutal as Atlanta faces hosts Devils ( emotionally charged Kovalchuk return game ) and then a home and home with both Pittsburgh and Washington .
To figure out which of the East playoff bubble teams had the most advantageous schedule I copied each club 's remaining games into Excel and then calculated the average number of points each opponent allows at home and on the road for each East playoff bubble team in the remaining NHL season .
For example , the Thrashers play Philadelphia at home -- where the Flyers typically allow the opponent just 0.871 standing points per game -- but when Philly is on the road the Flyers are more generous allowing opponents 1.069 standing points per game .
So in this analysis there are two key factors 1 ) total number of games remaining , 2 ) average tendency to allow points by the opposition team at home and on the road .
I make no attempt to adjust of the quality of each team 's roster or injuries , trades or any other factor .
It is intended to convey a rough sense of what we should expect given each team 's schedule , nothing more , nothing less .
And I 'm certain this will turn out to be wrong as some teams will flop and others excel down the stretch .
And now the moment you 're been waiting for .
Here are the projected final standing based on the typical number of points allowed ( home / road ) by each bubble team 's opponent the rest of the NHL season .
East Rank Team Points 7 BOS 87.0 8 ATL 84.7 9 TBL 84.3 10 MTL 84.1 11 NYR 82.4
What can we learn from this exercise ?
The Bruins have a small but significant advantage over the other bubble teams , but that advantage amounts to just 2 points or one win-- hardly insurmountable .
Atlanta , Tampa and Montreal are all basically a roll of the dice .
Each has a schedule that puts them into a logjam with Atlanta have the tinniest of advantages .
The Rangers are 3 points out -- which is also hardly insurmountable -- but they will need to play very well down the stretch given their schedule .
What we can't predict very well is who will get hot -- more on that in a future post .
For Thrashers fans who want to see how the Atlanta schedule shakes out on a game - by - game basis consult the table below to see opponent 's tendency to allow points at home and on the road .

An unusual and much - heralded program that gave poor families cash to encourage good behavior and self - sufficiency has so far had only modest effects on their lives and economic situation , according to an analysis the Bloomberg administration released on Tuesday .
The three - year - old pilot project , the first of its kind in the country , gave parents payments for things like going to the dentist ( $ 100 ) or holding down a full - time job ( $ 150 per month ) .
Children were rewarded for attending school regularly ( $ 25 to $ 50 per month ) or passing a high school Regents exam ( $ 600 ) .
When the mayor announced the program , he said it would begin with private money and , if it worked , could be transformed into an ambitious permanent government program .
But city officials said Tuesday that there were no specific plans at this time to go forward with a publicly financed version of the program .
In an announcement at BronxWorks , a nonprofit social services agency , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pointed to a few examples of success :
High school students who met basic proficiency standards before high school tended to increase their attendance , receive more class credits and perform better on standardized tests ; more families went to the dentist for regular checkups .
A survey of Australians aged under 30 shows they are increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of buying their first home .
The survey of nearly 900 people , conducted by the Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia , showed more than half those questioned said they were shelving plans to buy their first home .
That is a 10 per cent increase on the last survey , which was conducted late last year .
The association 's Phil Naylor says the scaling back of the first home owners grant is one of the main reasons for the trend .
" [ Under the previous grant scheme ] there were first home buyers actually getting into the market but that has now slowed down considerably , " he said .
" So obviously the number of people who are saying they 're having difficulties getting into the market has increased considerably . "
The survey indicated that most people were concerned about carrying a large debt .
A third of those surveyed believed they would be locked out of the property market permanently and were expecting to be life - long renters .
" Because there 's insufficient housing being developed that means rental housing as well , so it means rents will go up , " Mr Naylor said .
" So you 've got a double whammy for those people .
" They can't afford to get into the housing market because prices are too high [ and they ] will find it difficult in the rental market as well . "
Following up the recent tease that Square Enix will be bringing Final Fantasy IX to digital distribution via the Playstation Network , President Yoichi Wada has today sent news confirming the matter .
In a five second video posted on the company ’s twitter account / situation , Wada confirms that the title will be heading to the Japanese PSN .
We ’ll expect some release date and pricing info in a more official announcement , along with the suggestion that in the coming months after it will inevitably end up in additional PS3 regions .

Advertisement A new mass grave thought to hold the bodies of about 250 Kosovo Albanians has been found in Serbia , the country 's war crimes prosecutor has told the BBC .
It said the information had come from Eulex , the EU police mission in Kosovo , and Serbia was sending investigators .
The victims are believed to have been killed during the 1998 - 99 conflict , when Serbian forces fought ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo .
The grave is near the town of Raska , close to the border with Kosovo .
There had been rumours two years ago that the grave existed , but searches at that time found nothing .
' Beneath building '
The war crimes prosecutor 's office said it would be several days before exhumations could begin at the site in Rudnica , about 180 km ( 110 miles ) south of Serbia 's capital , Belgrade .
Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Serbia did not shy away from its past Officials said the remains were buried beneath a building whose foundations had been deliberately constructed to hide the site , reports the BBC's Mark Lowen in Belgrade .
The prosecutor , Vladimir Vukcevic , said the discovery was a sign that Serbia was committed to coming to terms with its history .
" This is more proof that Serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " Mr Vukcevic was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
Our correspondent says identifying the victims through DNA analysis is likely to take several more years - and prolong the painful period of reconciliation .
Serbian and Croatian leaders have not only begun to talk about the past but to act too

Balkan states facing up to the past
It is not the first time mass graves from the conflict have been found in Serbia .
The bodies of more than 800 Kosovo Albanians were found in several locations in Serbia in 2001 , including police compounds .
The bodies were moved out of Kosovo before a Nato bombing campaign forced Serbian security forces out of the region .
Other , smaller mass graves have been found containing Serbian victims of ethnic Albanians .
Researchers in Serbia and Kosovo say more than 11,000 people died in the Kosovo conflict , most of them ethnic Albanian , but at least 2,300 Serbs .
Hundreds missing A further 1,800 people are classified as missing , according to Eulex figures , but are presumed to be dead .
A former top Serbian police official , Vlastimir Djordjevic , is currently on trial at the UN's Hague - based war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslovia .
Other mass graves of Kosovo Albanians have been found in Serbia
He was allegedly involved in the murders of hundreds of ethnic Albanians and the deportation of 800,000 others from Kosovo during the conflict , when he was in charge of police forces in Serbia .
He denies charges of deportation , murder and persecution .
He was a close aide to the late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , who died in tribunal custody in 2006 before a verdict was reached in his trial for war crimes .
Belgrade withdrew forces from the Serbian province of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign , and the area was put under UN control .
Kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 has been recognised by more than 50 countries , including the US and most EU states , but not recognised by more than 100 , including Serbia and Russia .
Recent Serbian governments have been pro-Western and last year the country submitted a formal application to join the EU .
But membership negotiations cannot begin in earnest until two war crimes suspects - including the former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic - have been captured .

Are you worried about " peak oil ? "
what 's that ?
not at all a little a lot we 're hosed Vote
The death of Alan MacDonald was reported modestly , in passing : a paragraph on the social page of the Daily Mail .
I think he would have liked the idea of his death making the papers , if his death had n't been so peculiar .
But I am just guessing .
I felt sorry for the dead man , going in those circumstances .
I thought of Hilaire Belloc .
I wondered whether God has a sense of humour .
I wondered whether I am a bad person for wondering , in this context , whether God has a sense of humour .
This is not the first I 've heard of Alan MacDonald .
At Christmas 2008 , I wrote an article in this paper about the Jolley Gang .
I had heard whispers of a seedy crew , led by a convicted fraudster named Terence Jolley , who make a hobby out of gatecrashing .
They gatecrash book launches .
They gatecrash wine - tastings .
Their favourite scam ( because the food and booze are generous , and the questions few ) is to gatecrash funerals .
They applied for seats at my father 's memorial service .
Fair enough ; my father , a writer and broadcaster , was a public figure .
We did reserve some space in the church ( though not at the private reception afterwards ) for readers of his work .
But the Jolley Gang did not describe themselves as readers .
They pretended they had known him .
Their interest lay not in paying tribute to his life , but in cadging free drinks off his family .
My father having lived for nearly 70 years , I could n't prove that these people had never met him .
So , being a stubborn sort of girl , offended by their tacky cheek and the insult to my father 's memory , I set a trap .
I invented a wealthy industrialist called Sir William Ormerod , dotting his fictional life story around the internet .
I then announced his death , and ( in the guise of Sir William 's heartbroken boyfriend ) a lavish memorial for friends and family .
I immediately received emails from the gang , telling anecdotes of happy times spent in Sir William 's company , asking for the address and date .
Got 'em !
Plan A was to go ahead with an entire fake memorial service and fill all the free sandwiches with laxative .
Reluctantly putting this idea aside , I decided to write about them and hope that would be enough to end their little game .
I know , I know , the laxatives would have been more fun .
But I was trying to be grown - up about it .
Unfortunately , the Jolleys ' jollies continued .
In the 15 months since that article , they have not stopped leeching off grieving families .
If anything , their gall has grown .
In December , for example , the BBC website reported that the funeral of Coronation Street actress Maggie Jones had been " a beautiful and dignified private service for family , close friends and members of the cast " .
It was , in fact , a beautiful and dignified service for family , close friends , members of the cast , and the Jolley Gang .
Terence Jolley actually phoned ahead to ask the funeral director if food and drink would be served .
Did I expect things to be any different ?
I hoped they would .
One of the gang gave me a personal promise .
Terence Jolley , the ringleader , was the only one that I knew for certain was a thoroughly bad egg .
The others … well , maybe they were just weak .
Maybe he did all the lying and they just came along for the ride .
I hoped their consciences would be struck .
Do n't imagine daft young scallywags ; these are middle - aged , privileged people .
They are retired ( some of them disgraced ) magistrates , financiers , even diplomats .
They are not idiots .
I wrote privately to one of them , a chap who makes an income selling diary stories to newspapers .
I told him I understood he might want to attend public memorials to get these stories , but he should do it honestly , respectfully , without any lies and without Terence Jolley .
He promised that he would , so I agreed not to put his name or photo in the paper .
Do n't let me down , my friend , if you are reading this .
I know you still go .
I know you try to stand apart from the rest of the gang .
Keep it that way .
Keep even further away .
And do switch your mobile off during the service .
What about the others ?
Ronald , Ilana , I notice you two are still at it .
Will the fate of Alan MacDonald stop you , at last ?
Will you make a quiet resolution as his coffin goes by ?
I think you 'd better .
You 'll be in a church .
And we just do n't know whether God has a sense of humour .
Three weeks ago , the Jolley Gang gatecrashed a party at the Dorchester to celebrate the national day of Kuwait .
They mingled with Kuwaiti dignitaries .
They enjoyed drinks provided by the Kuwaiti ambassador .
And one of them , Alan MacDonald , choked to death on a canapé .
What a strange , strange end to a life .
You see why I thought of Hilaire Belloc .
If this is the last page of the story , it 's a poetic one .
How did you get there , Alan ?
You were 61 years old .
A retired banker from a smart family .
You had every chance .
What attracted you to a fat fraudster like Terence Jolley ?
How did you feel , mingling at parties where you were n't invited ?
What took you down that path which led to your final collapse , in a crowd of baffled strangers , on a mouthful of blagged canapé ?
You were unmarried and childless ; were you lonely ?
Your father , a vice - admiral , had been a royal aide ; did you feel an entitlement to every circle ?
Or were you just bored ?
I am grimly fascinated by this black - comic mob , without understanding their motivations .
I can't be sure that this grisly twist will stop them .
I 'm superstitious ; it would certainly stop me .
But the curious behaviour of others … it 's only ever guesswork in the dark .
Alan MacDonald 's funeral is tomorrow .
I considered going .
But I did n't know the man .

It gave me goosebumps .
That 's about the highest compliment I can pay
the upcoming iPhone adventure game Sword & Sworcery EP , and just about
all you need to know for now .
They were significant , too , for not just being the goosebumps of that media moment where all elements suddenly align — where pixel and music work in perfect concert — but for the kind you get when a game anticipates your demands and provides you with an answer to a question you had n't even asked yet .
There 's a sense in which the EP is being created just for me : not quite that literally , but it is the collective brainchild of designer Craig ' Superbrothers '
Adams ( who you 'll remember from his just - featured Less Talk , More Rock speech ) , indie studio Capy ( also featured here for their gorgeous Critter Crunch revamp and their Clash of Heroes handheld masterstroke ) , and musician Jim Guthrie , a long - time favorite both for his golden , harmonic pop solo work and his own collaborative output as Human Highway .
I managed to get my hands on Sworcery as soon as humanly possible — before the Game Developers Conference started proper , and away from the chaotic bustle of this year 's crowded Indie Games Fest pavilion .
It was a wise and fortuitous choice — playing alone on a late night Mission district rooftop — because Sworcery 's magic demands quiet and careful attention to properly cast its spell .
True to his own words in that Boing Boing feature , the game is about unspoken dialogue between itself and the player : responding to your own curiosity and whispering questions rather than shouting demands .
Case in point : just watch that video at top , where a single non-reflected mark in its waters practically evokes more mystery and wonder than most scripted turns - of - events in the majority of the triple - A fantasies the games industry has given us in the past few
years .
And while the main adventure mode showcased at top is all serenity now , Superbrothers promises higher intensity drama to follow , showcased via a combat mode against the game 's Grizzled Boor — an antagonist that pays slight homage to Another World 's dark beast in subtly leading you deeper into its world while never necessarily proving himself not exactly a threat .
Should you decide to take on the Boor , you 're presented with this minigame above where here , too , Superbrothers takes their " less talk " mantra to heart , telegraphing your opponent 's intentions with visual cues , in loving and open tribute to NES classic Punch - Out !!
( see especially that ' stunned ' star that appears overhead ) .
These two modes were as many secrets as Superbrothers was willing to publicly disclose in the GDC demo , but with months yet left in its development , there 's hints of much deeper layers of involvement ahead — onion peeled layers that Adams has been drip - feeding though ultra-vague hints through his " teletex bulletin " email updates over the past several months .
But this is one I can give away here : if you scroll back through the artwork Adams has released to date , one design element should stand out against the rest — that razor sharp crescent moon hanging behind his otherwise signature field of muted pixels .
Add that to the release schedule of those teletex updates ( February 14th and 28th , March 15th and 29th … ) and it should start to snap into focus : your adventure through its world will modify itself based on the phases of moon in the real world .
Exactly what shape this will take is another secret Superbrothers wo n't fully divulge , but there are hints that certain rare mushrooms which pepper the game 's landscape will only come out under certain circumstances .
All this adds up to an intricate ecology that rewards multiple playthroughs , rather than a linear and static adventure meant to be experienced once and set aside , and a landscape dotted with people worth meeting and vistas worth traversing .
Prior to GDC it was perhaps my most anticipated game of the event ( as I might 've hinted at myself with my iPad - feature - topping - image ) : coming away , it might just be my most anticipated game of the year .

John Marek , the former Wrexham Labour MP and AM who left the party because he said it had moved too far to the right , has joined the Conservatives .
The former Welsh assembly deputy presiding officer said Tory leader David Cameron 's " social conscience " was behind his decision .
Dr Marek , 69 , became an independent after leaving Labour , and then founded a left - wing party , Forward Wales .
Labour reacted by saying he was on a " weird and winding political journey " .
Announcing the move in Wrexham , Dr Marek said the Conservatives were the only party who could deliver change .
He became Labour MP for Wrexham in 1983 , standing down in 2001 after also being elected the area 's Labour AM at the birth of the Welsh assembly in 1999 .
His decision speaks volumes for the way in which our party has changed both in Wales and across the UK and has a broad appeal
Nick Bourne , leader , Welsh Conservatives Dr Marek , a former applied maths lecturer at Aberystwyth University , said : " David Cameron 's social conscience is at the heart of my decision to join the Conservative Party .
' Broken economy '
" He understands the difficulties faced by ordinary people and I am convinced that as Prime Minister he will govern for everybody .
" I believe it is only through a Conservative government that we can fix our broken economy , restore our civil liberties , ensure our public services meet the public 's expectations and tackle the big national and international issues facing our country today . "
Nick Bourne , leader of the Welsh Tories , said Dr Marek 's decision would bring " strength and experience " to his party .
Mr Bourne said : " I have the greatest respect for John and am extremely pleased he has today joined the Welsh Conservatives .
" His decision speaks volumes for the way in which our party has changed both in Wales and across the UK and has a broad appeal .
We 're unsure whether today 's news says more about John or the Welsh Conservatives , but in any case , ' any port in a storm ' is the phrase that springs to mind
Welsh Labour " John will add enormous strength and experience to our party .
I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead . "
Welsh Labour said : " Since John got himself excluded from the Labour Party seven years ago , we 've been watching his weird and winding political journey with increasing disinterest .
" We 're unsure whether today 's news says more about John or the Welsh Conservatives , but in any case , ' any port in a storm ' is the phrase that springs to mind . "
As an MP Dr Marek served as a Labour spokesman on Treasury matters .
In the Welsh assembly he gained a reputation as a maverick and in 2001 was elected deputy presiding officer against Labour 's preferred candidate , which led to his de-selection as the Labour candidate for the 2003 election .
At that time , Bob Crow , general secretary of the transport union RMT , said it was " an absolute shame that a committed socialist like John has been kicked out " .
He then stood as a candidate for the John Marek Independent Party , and was re-elected as an AM , defeating the Labour candidate by 973 votes .
Later that year he formed a new political party called Forward Wales ( Cymru Ymlaen ) , which also included another former Labour MP and AM , the ex-Welsh Secretary Ron Davies .
Dr Marek lost his assembly seat to Labour in 2007 .
His defection to the Conservatives follows that of former Plaid Cymru AM Mohammad Asghar in December and former Labour AM Alison Halford in 2006 .

The vast majority of economists believe the minimum wage law costs the economy thousands of jobs .
Teenagers , workers in training , college students , interns , and part - time workers all have their options and opportunities limited by the minimum wage .
A low - paying job remains an entry point for those with few marketable skills .
Abolishing the minimum wage will allow businesses to achieve greater efficiency and lower prices .
When you force American companies to pay a certain wage , you increase the likelihood that those companies will outsource jobs to foreign workers , where labor is much cheaper .
Non-profit charitable organizations are hurt by the minimum wage .
The minimum wage can drive some small companies out of business .
A minimum wage gives businesses an additional incentive to mechanize duties previously held by humans .
Cost - of - living differences in various areas of the country make a universal minimum wage difficult to set .
Elimination of the minimum wage would mean more citizens and fewer illegals would be hired for low - pay hourly jobs , leading to greater tax revenues and less incentive for illegal immigration .
The minimum wage creates a competitive advantage for foreign companies , providing yet another obstacle in the ability of American companies to compete globally .
The minimum wage law is just another example of government condescendingly controlling our actions and destroying personal choice .
Citizens do have the ability to say no to a lower wage .
Adults who currently work for minimum wage are likely to lose jobs to teenagers who will work for much less .
Workers need a minimum amount of income from their work to survive and pay the bills .
Businesses have more power to abuse the labor market .
It forces businesses to share some of the vast wealth with the people that help produce it .
Ninja and Yo- Landi of Die Antwoord sat down with me for an interview just after the South African " rap- rave " band 's first - ever US performance at the Coachella music festival .
The duo spoke about their explosive , internet - fueled burst to fame , and about the origins of their " car crash music " ( it 's disturbing , but you can't look away ) by way of District 9 and an anarchic internet and music subculture in post - Apartheid South Africa .
I 'm told this is the only interview Die Antwoord granted during their US visit .

I deleted my blog this morning .
I did n’t know what else to do .
I was minding my own business when I got a call from a good friend of mine sympathising with me about the Mail on Sunday article .
“ What Mail on Sunday Article ? ”
“ The one about you !
I had no idea – I though you were happy in your job ? ”
“ I am happy in my job – what are you talking about ? ”
“ You told the Mail on Sunday that your workmates were sexist and treated you really badly – there ’s a picture of you and everything ”
And , just like that , my day fell apart .
I do n’t really know what to do .
I did n’t know that this happened , or could happen , to people like me .
In November , I wrote a blogpost called “ Women ? In Air Traffic Control ? ” .
I wrote it in response to people on Twitter and in my life who wanted to know what it was like to do my job .
There are n’t many of us .
Most people do n’t meet many Air Traffic Controllers , and it has , in films , media , and most portrayals , been depicted as a job done mainly by men .
You can read the post for yourself , it ’s below .
I tried to talk in it about what it was like for me , nearly a decade ago , being one of the first women to do my job in Ireland .
I did n’t then , and do not now , think my work colleagues are “ Male Chauvinist Pigs ” , as the Mail headlined their article .
I love my job , and the people I work with .
I was talking about how I felt years ago , starting out , slightly scared and intimidated by the responsibilities that people who do my job hold in our hands .
Yes , back then , some things bemused me .
For example , I wrote in that post that two women were n’t allowed to work together .
That was then , and things have changed , and my original post makes that clear in the very next line .
For the Mail to quote that line in order to make it appear that I am unhappy in my job , that my colleagues are sexist , or that I ever felt or feel unwanted , is disgusting .
The Mail never told me they were writing a piece about my blog .
The journalist who wrote it never sent me an email asking me questions about my blog .
I wo n’t do to his professional reputation what he has done to mine , but let ’s just say that I wonder whether he would have expected me to answer his questions the way he wanted .
As it is , in the middle of an incredibly trying time for my colleagues , an article has appeared in a Sunday Newspaper that says I feel abused by the people I work with .
It gives me opinions that I do not have , and uses words I have never said .
It does so to attack my profession , impugn my employers , and portray me as a victim of my friends .
I feel sick .
Any future employer could fairly read what Luke Byrne has written about me and conclude that I am a disloyal , untrustworthy person .
The people I work with today could , and probably have , read it and decided that I am not on their side , and that I think that they are sexist , nasty , bullies .
None of this is true .
I do n’t “ do ” media .
Other than friends who happen to work in the media , or people given tours of where I work , I ’ve never dealt with a journalist .
This blog was supposed to be an account of my life , what I do , and how I got here .
Today it has been transformed into a weapon to be used by an unscrupulous , nasty person against some of the people I care most about .
My first reaction was to delete everything .
I wiped it all away .
Then I realised it was the only monument to my actual opinions that exists for people to read .
If it ’s gone , then all that is left is an article that turns me into somebody else who thinks things that never did or would cross my mind .
I do n’t know whether I have a cause of action .
I ’m not a lawyer .
Maybe twisting my words and my ideas into something perverse is totally legal .
Maybe not giving me a right to respond is totally legal .
Maybe not even telling me there was going to be an article is totally legal .
Publishing my photograph without my knowledge or consent probably is totally legal .
But I do n’t know how it could be .
I ’ve never ever felt this low .
All I have ever tried to do is do a good job for the people I serve and the people I work with .
I want to be thought well of , to be happy , and to be respected .
How anybody who works with me could read that article and either respect or think well of me , I do n’t know .
I ’m sure this happens to other people all the time .
Probably people who are far more famous than me .
I ’ve probably read and formed opinions of other people based on things that are just not true .
I ’ve probably talked about other people ’s lives based on things I ’ve read that were hurtful to them .
I just ca n’t get my head around it .
I could never , ever , ever do this to somebody else .
I do n’t understand how they could n’t ask me for a comment .
Or for my actual opinion .
Instead , there ’s a whole page of a national newspaper devoted to what I think of the people I work with , when in fact I think pretty much the exact opposite .
I do n’t know what I ’m going to do – or what I can do .
But I know that I ’m not going to leave it at this .
Advice would be gratefully recieved .
To my work colleagues , I ’m so , so , so , sorry .
The person in that article is not me .
It ’s a twisted version of me , built to suit the nasty agenda of a journalist who does n’t know me , and has never met me .
I do n’t know what more to say .
–UPDATE
–
Due to the overwhelming support I have received , I am unable to keep track of the comments and have decided to close the comments sections for now .
I would like to thank everybody for their support , it has been a tremendous help during this difficult period .
You can find me on Twitter ( @mrs_schregardus ) where I can better keep track and respond .
Your taste in baby names is shaped by many factors .
If I had to point to just one , though -- one force that drives your opinions , that 's impossible to escape -- it would be your generation .
That 's obvious on the face of it .
We all know that name styles change dramatically over time .
When it comes to our own personal taste , though , it 's hard to feel the generational influence .
Here 's how I usually describe it : the names of your own generation sound too ordinary , your parents ' too boring , your grandparents ' too old .
But by the time you make it back to your great - grandparents ' names , things start to perk up .
You 've never known a young Vivian or Julius , so those names sound fresh to you .
That places a style " sweet spot " at naming generations roughly 60 - 90 years older than you .
But it also points to a second sweet spot at names 20 - 40 years younger than you .
Those are the names that you and your friends name your children .
Meanwhile you 're turned off by names in middle , particularly your own age and 10 - 20 years older .
So if you were born in the 1970s , you probably did n't consider ' 60s names like Sheila or Kent for your kids .
Now here 's the kicker .
That same generation of names that marks your style nadir is your parents ' sweet spot .
And those charming antiques you love ?
They 're your parents ' stodgy grandma names .
Let 's overlay some hypothetical curves :
Call the areas in green " argument zones . "
Parents , this explains why your mother - in - law keeps suggesting names like Karen and Steve .
Grandparents , this explains how your daughter could possibly consider a name like Julius ( or Genesis ) for a little baby .
And to our youngest readers , prepare for your parents to totally miss the appeal of Conrad and Joyce .
They do n't have bad taste , honest .
They 're just products of their generation .
Russian honey - trap may have affected aircraft carrier deal with India
April 20 , 2010 by intelNews
By JOSEPH FITSANAKIS | intelNews.org |
The recent court disclosure of an Indian engineer ’s affair with a Russian woman has added fresh controversy in a multi-billion dollar deal gone sour between Russia and India , over the purchase of an aircraft carrier .
In 2004 , India purchased Admiral Gorshkov , a Soviet - built , 45,000 - ton warship , for $ 974 million .
But the negotiations between the two countries over the refit and repair project quickly deteriorated , with Sevmash Enterprise , the Russian shipyard in charge of the project , hiking the price twice in less than three years .
At the end of fierce negotiations that scarred the bilateral defense relationship between the two countries , the Indian Navy was forced to pay in excess of $ 2.3 billion for the 30 - year - old warship .
In recent weeks , however , a series of explicit photographs were circulated , showing an unidentified Russian woman with Commodore Sukhjinder Singh , an Indian engineer whom the Indian Navy stationed in Russia and tasked him with overseeing Admiral Gorshkov ’s refit from 2005 to 2007 .
The Indian Navy insists that Commodore Singh ’s relationship with the woman did not “ adversely impact India ’s position ” in the negotiations with the Russians .
But there are persistent rumors in New Delhi that the unidentified woman was in fact part of a Russian military intelligence honey trap operation , which compromised Commodore Sukhjinder and weakened the Indian Navy ’s position in the negotiations .
On Friday , Singh was reportedly “ relieved ” of his engineering post , while a “ suitable punishment ” , including a possible court martial , is being considered by Indian Navy authorities .
DETROIT -- NHL history is full of goaltenders who have excelled during the regular season but failed to deliver in the playoffs .
Jimmy Howard 's performance Tuesday night will go a long way toward making sure he does n't join that dubious group .
Howard turned in his most clutch performance in the most important game of the season for the Detroit Red Wings .
He stopped 29 shots for his first career postseason shutout in a 3 - 0 victory against the Phoenix Coyotes in Game 4 of the Western Conference quarterfinals at Joe Louis Arena .
Howard rebounded from a shaky performance in
, and his teammates supported him by working hard and playing smart as they evened the series 2 - 2 heading into Game 5 on Friday in Phoenix .
Henrik Zetterberg led the way with two goals , giving him five in the series , and Pavel Datsyuk also scored .
The Red Wings killed six Phoenix power plays , including a pair that overlapped for 17 seconds in the third period , during a one - goal difference at the time .
Yet , Howard is the main reason the Red Wings have new life .
" This time of year when a goalie has a night not as good as you 're used to seeing , everybody starts questioning him , especially when you 're a rookie , " Red Wings defenseman Brad Stuart said .
" We all knew he'd come back with a good effort .
He was outstanding . "
RED WINGS 3 , COYOTES 0 Key play : Clinging to a 1 - 0 lead , the Red Wings killed consecutive penalties to Johan Franzen and Andreas Lilja in the third period .
They overlapped by 17 seconds , giving Phoenix a five - on - three that could have been the turning point .
Hero : Jimmy
Howard made 29 saves for his first career playoff shutout , rebounding nicely from a shaky performance in Game 3 .
Goat : Lee Stempniak , a late - season acquisition who provided Phoenix with an offense boost , has been silent in the series with no goals and one assist .
He posted a minus - 1 rating in 16:41 on Tuesday .
Analysis : The Red Wings answered the bell by accomplishing pretty much everything they set out to do .
They worked hard , limited their turnovers in the neutral zone and were physical on Phoenix 's defense .
Their key players ( Howard , Henrik Zetterberg , Pavel Datsyuk , Nicklas Lidstrom ) delivered , and everyone stepped up in a total team effort .
As much as Howard talked about letting go of Sunday 's 4 - 2 loss , he acknowledged it was n't easy .
" I was very upset with myself , " Howard said .
" I 'm a competitive guy and I wanted to contribute for the guys .
Coming into this game , I wanted to be mentally tough .
" I wanted to feel the puck early , and that was a key . "
The crowd showed its support late in the second period , chanting " Jimmy ! , Jimmy ! " after Howard had his mask knocked off on a blast by Keith Yandle .
" Hearing that was a great boost , " he said .
" It really got me fired up .
It 's great knowing that the fans have my back .
" Yandle has a cannon .
I was thinking I 'd probably take this one right off the teeth if I had to . "
With the Coyotes pressing for the tying goal , Datsyuk and Zetterberg scored 25 seconds apart in the waning minutes of the third period .
Datsyuk one - timed a pass from Johan Franzen past Ilya Bryzgalov at 15:53 .
Zetterberg then wrapped up the scoring at 16:18 .
The Red Wings worked much harder and were more patient in navigating through the neutral zone than they were in Game 3 .
They also were more physical than the Coyotes , who played without injured captain Shane Doan .
Detroit had 43 hits to Phoenix's 27 .
" I think we had more team speed , " Detroit captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" I did n't think the neutral zone was an obstacle for us .
We got the puck in at the right time and kept going after them and kept skating instead of trying to stick - handle through the neutral zone where they can really clog it up . "
Zetterberg snapped a scoreless tie on the power play at 15:33 of the second period , deflecting in a shot from the point by Niklas Kronwall .
A video review showed that Zetterberg 's stick was below the level of the crossbar .
The Red Wings followed that up with a solid third period , something they failed to do in their two losses .
" We definitely needed a kick in the butt , " Detroit 's Dan Cleary said .
" It was a must - win for us .
We played determined and hard .
We played patient .
We did n't give them really anything , and when we did , Howie was strong . "
Said Red Wings coach Mike Babcock : " We needed to win tonight , no question about it .
This is why you 're in sports , for games like this , you got to bring it when it counts .
That 's what Howie has to do if he 's going to be a top - notch goalie in the NHL . "
Howard knows adversity builds character .
It is what he and the team faced all season .
" That 's what I told myself , " Howard said .
" This is only going to make me better , if I can respond and attack it and not let it affect me . "
He also realizes they have a long way to go .
" I 've got to continue to step up and play big for us , " Howard said .
" I ca n't relax and I can't get comfortable out there . "
The Judi Bari Bombing Revisited
Big Timber , Public Relations and the FBI Analysis and commentary by Nicholas Wilson
BACKGROUND
on Judi Bari case Nine years ago , on May 24 , 1990 , the car bombing of Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney made headlines across the nation .
At the FBI 's instigation , Oakland Police immediately arrested the pair and charged that they were terrorists injured by the accidental explosion of their own bomb .
Events moved swiftly in the days that followed .
For seven weeks , the FBI and police held press conferences where they dribbled out false claims of evidence of the pair 's guilt to keep sensational media coverage roiling .
But there was much that the police were n't telling , such as clear evidence that she was innocent , targeted for murder because of her environmental and labor organizing .
Someone wanted to stop the two Northern California Earth First !
leaders , the organizers of Redwood Summer , the largest ever campaign of nonviolent protests against corporate liquidation logging of the redwoods .
After two months the Alameda County District Attorney refused to file any charges for lack of evidence .
There is evidence , though , from the FBI 's own files , that agents falsified evidence against Bari and Cherney , suppressed exonerating evidence , and conspired with Oakland to try to frame them .
Most disturbing , however , is that the FBI stubbornly refused to do a genuine investigation of the bombing , and failed to pursue real evidence and leads turned over to them .
Why would they refuse to investigate solid clues , like identifying fingerprints they found ?
Was it a cover - up of FBI complicity in the bombing ?
Was it because they already knew it would show involvement by the timber industry ?
And if someone wanted to get rid of her , why was Judi Bari bombed when a bullet would have been easier ?
A new analysis suggests that the key to unraveling the mystery is a timber industry public relations strategy to defeat a logging reform initiative in the fall election .
Evidence of Judi and Darryl 's innocence hidden in FBI files
After a year with no progress in the official investigation , and with the FBI still saying there were no other suspects but Judi and Darryl , the two filed a federal civil rights suit against the FBI and Oakland Police , charging them with conspiring " to suppress , chill and ' neutralize ' their constitutionally protected activities in defense of the environment . "
It also charges false arrest and unlawful search and seizure .
Judi's last work in her life was to oversee a crucial phase of her ongoing lawsuit so that her legal team could take the case to trial on behalf of her children , to clear her name , and to secure the rights of all activists to be free from police interference with their constitutional rights .
Although she died of cancer on March 2 , 1997 , the suit is continued by Judi's estate and by Darryl Cherney , aided by the Redwood Summer Justice Project , the nonprofit organization set up by her to organize political and financial support for the suit .
By filing the suit they could investigate the bombing themselves using the court 's power to compel the FBI and police to turn over files and evidence and to submit to questioning under oath .
To date , their charges are supported by over 14,000 pages of evidence , including the testimony of over 50 FBI agents and police officers .
The evidence of police misconduct is strong enough that the suit has survived repeated attempts by the FBI and Oakland to get the courts to dismiss it .
FBI files contained evidence of Judi and Darryl 's innocence , but not until three years after the bombing , and then only under court order , did the FBI begin ( grudgingly ) to disclose evidence .
They discovered that police crime scene photos clearly showed the bomb ripped a hole in the floorboard centered directly under the driver 's seat .
Documents revealed the FBI 's chief bomb expert , David R. Williams , showed the San Francisco agents and Oakland Police that without any doubt the bomb had been completely hidden under the driver 's seat , that the bomb had a motion trigger as well as a timer .
He told them the bomb had functioned as designed rather than exploding accidentally .
That put the lie to FBI statements , made soon after the explosion , that the bomb was on the back seat floorboard where they would have seen it -- the principal claim used to justify arresting Judi and Darryl for possession and transportation of an explosive device .
But while the authorities knew that Judi and Darryl were innocent victims , the FBI and Oakland police continued to tell the media they had evidence Judi and Darryl were the culprits .
As the FBI refused to investigate prior death threats and focused exclusively on Judi , Darryl and other Earth First !
activists as suspects , they allowed the real bomber to go free .
Why would they do that ?
Whose interests were served ?
" If you turn up dead then we 'll investigate " Judi felt sure as soon as it happened that timber interests were behind the bombing .
She told investigating officers in the hospital that she began receiving death threats soon after she had announced plans for Redwood Summer .
They found copies of written ones in her bombed car .
There were many signs of an orchestrated campaign of harassment and intimidation against Judi and other environmentalists in the weeks before the bombing .
The timber companies knowingly distributed fake Earth First !
flyers and press releases advocating violence and sabotage to workers , community members and media in a move calculated to whip up fear and hatred against environmentalists .
Judi said she never received death threats before or since , except one when she moved to her rural cabin near Willits near the end of that summer .
When Judi reported the death threats to local police , they told her they did n't have the manpower to investigate .
" If you turn up dead then we 'll investigate , " she was told .
Bari was also making connections with timber workers .
Perhaps the key incident that made her the target of the bomb attack was her appearance together with Louisiana Pacific workers before Mendocino County 's Board of Supervisors .
She demanded the county use its eminent domain power to seize LP Corporation timberlands and manage them in the public interest .
That demand certainly focused LP executives ' attention on her , and the local newspaper gave it prominent coverage , including a large photo of Judi from the board meeting .
A copy of that photo with the circle and cross hairs of a rifle scope drawn over her face was the most frightening death threat Judi received , she said .
The photo was stapled to the door of the Mendocino Environmental Center along with a yellow ribbon , the symbol of timber industry support groups opposed to Redwood Summer and the Forests Forever Initiative on the November ballot .
A pile of excrement was left below the threat .
Big Timber and Big PR If Proposition 130 , the Forests Forever initiative , had passed in the fall 1990 election , it would have put an end to unsustainable liquidation logging and clearcutting .
The three big logging corporations of the redwood region -- Georgia Pacific , Louisiana Pacific and Pacific Lumber -- would have lost hundreds of millions of dollars ( billions , if their propaganda is believed ) .
With an enormous financial motive to defeat the initiative , they hired public relations firms including Hill & Knowlton to manage a multimillion - dollar PR campaign to turn public opinion against the initiative .
They targeted and demonized environmental activists .
They made sure the public associated the ballot initative with Earth First !.
After the Bari bombing as the FBI and police were smearing Bari and Cherney as terrorists , they quickly labeled Prop. 130 " the Earth First ! initiative , " and said it was " too extreme . "
An important part of that PR campaign was to derail Redwood Summer .
It was linked to Forests Forever and it was drawing major media attention to the accelerated logging the companies were doing .
When Judi and Darryl first announced their plans for the summer - long series of nonviolent demonstrations , they said on TV their goal was to slow the logging until Forests Forever could be passed in November .
" ( Redwood Summer ) is not a symbolic act .
We hope to literally slow down the logging by using our bodies nonviolently this summer , and we hope to do that so that there 'll be something left to save by the time any legislation can be passed to regulate them , " Bari told NPR in a radio interview after the bombing .
An anti-environmentalist " Wise Use " group cooked up phony EF !
flyers and press releases calling for violence and sabotage during Redwood Summer , and Pacific Lumber and Louisiana Pacific knowingly distributed the fakes to deceive people about EF !'s nonviolent intentions and create an atmosphere of hatred and violence toward environmentalists .
Although local media , including the Santa Rosa Press Democrat , reported the fakes as real and speculated they were from a violence - prone " splinter group " of EF ! , some metropolitan papers saw through the hoax .
San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse wrote April 29 , 1990 that he had received a press kit from H&K on behalf of " Earth First ! 's nemesis , Pacific Lumber Co . "
Morse wrote :
The kit included a press release on the Earth First !
letterhead , but not written in the usual careful , sweet style of Earth First !
It read like a bad Hollywood version of what radicals talk like ...
At the bottom of this ridiculous flyer was the name of Earth First !
leader Darryl Cherney , with his first name misspelled ....
Not only are trees being clear - cut , but dirty tricksters are turning them into fake press releases .
By September 20 , 1990 , the timber industry had contributed $ 5,723,843 to defeat Prop. 130 in officially reported campaign contributions .
That figure does not include company funds spent for direct advertising and PR against the initiative , nor the money paid to set up and support " Community Solidarity Coalition " yellow - ribbon groups working to defeat it .
The FBI 's Campaign to Discredit Earth First !
There is also good reason to believe the FBI was actively ( or passively ) involved in the bombing .
FBI records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show that the FBI infiltrated and spied on Earth First !
almost from its beginning in 1980 , with the earliest known FBI report on it dated 1981 .
Heavily censored FBI documents obtained through Bari 's suit indicate weekly meetings in spring 1990 between an FBI agent and a secret informant in Northern California .
Deposition testimony by Oakland Police Department officers and FBI agents states the FBI had an informant on EF !
leaders , and the FBI told OPD that Darryl and Judi were already " the subjects of an investigation in the terrorist field " when they were bombed .
Were they under surveillance when the bomb was placed ?
Just before the bombing , the FBI was wrapping up Operation Thermcon in Arizona , a 3 - year sting operation employing over 50 FBI agents designed to entrap and discredit EF !
and its co-founder Dave Foreman as explosive - using terrorists .
The FBI infiltrated a tiny Arizona EF !
group with an undercover agent provocateur , won their trust over a couple of years , and tried to con them into using thermite , an explosive incendiary , to take down a power line .
The activists declined the infiltrator 's offer to provide explosives , and he settled for providing them with a cutting torch instead .
The FBI provocateur provided the equipment , trained the activists in its use , chose the target , drove them to the site , and joined an FBI strike team in busting them in the act on May 31 , 1989 .
Foreman was not directly involved , but was charged with conspiracy for providing $ 100 to the group .
The resulting " Arizona Five " trial ended in plea bargains in August , 1991 , with prison sentences for two of the activists .
Thermcon was the FBI 's code name for " thermite conspiracy , " but there was no thermite involved except in the FBI plot to tie EF !
to explosives despite the fact they have never advocated or used explosives in their 19 - year history .
The FBI 's goal in Thermcon was basically public relations , to trick the public into believing EF !
were violent extremists so as to neutralize their effectiveness and isolate them from public support .
Michael Fain , the FBI 's undercover agent provocateur in the Arizona case , accidentally recorded his conversation with other agents .
It revealed that the FBI 's true goal was to discredit Earth First ! and radical environmentalism in the public mind .
On the tape , Fain is heard to say , " I do n't really look for them to be doing a lot of hurting people .
( Foreman ) is n't really the guy we need to pop -- I mean in terms of an actual perpetrator .
This is the guy we need to pop to send a message .
And that 's all we 're really doing .
. . .
Uh-oh !
We do n't need that on tape !
Hoo boy ! "
Some of the same San Francisco FBI terrorist squad agents who worked the Thermcon case were assigned to the Bari bomb case .
The FBI tried for years to keep their Thermcon files secret from Bari 's lawyers , claiming there was no connection , but they were finally ordered by the court to furnish copies in 1996 , three years after the FBI 's first release of files in the case .
But the FBI is apparently hiding sixteen crucial documents they claim are " missing " from the Thermcon file .
They span a period from just after Redwood Summer was announced , in March , 1990 , to a month after the bombing .
Bari lawyer Dennis Cunningham wrote in a brief : " Plaintiffs are of the opinion that the missing ( documents ) showed political surveillance and other illicit operations against Earth First ! in California , and Redwood Summer , having nothing to do with THERMCON ; as such , given the charges herein , they were too hot to handle , and so were simply iced .... "
The FBI - Timber Connection The Bari - Cherney lawsuit also turned up several connections between the timber industry and the FBI , including a chummy " Dear Bill " letter sent to FBI Director William Sessions by a board member of Maxxam , which owns Pacific Lumber .
Other associations are more disturbing because they involve bombs and bomb - making .
Just a month before the bomb exploded in Bari 's car , the FBI conducted a bomb investigator school in Humboldt County .
As part of the training , lead instructor and FBI bomb expert Special Agent Frank Doyle blew up cars with pipe bombs on a Louisiana Pacific logging site , then his students practiced investigating the results .
Louisiana Pacific , remember , was the company whose timberlands Judi asked Mendocino County to seize , after which she immediately began receiving death threats .
LP cooperated with the FBI in providing the bomb school location .
Although the FBI claims it has lost the documents that show the names of participants -- another suspicious claim -- it is known that the chief of LP 's private security force , based in Humboldt County , was a former deputy sheriff and an FBI - certified bomb expert .
It would be reasonable to expect him to be present at the FBI bomb school on the company 's land .
Then there 's the mystery of the dud bomb in the LP sawmill in Cloverdale .
Two weeks after the bomb school ( and two weeks before Bari 's car exploded ) , a partly - exploded firebomb was found .
The Cloverdale bomb failed to fully explode or to ignite the can of gasoline it included , and it was likely designed to fail , as part of an overall plan to set Judi up for blame after being killed by the Oakland bomb two weeks later .
A cardboard sign near the firebomb bore the words , " LP screws millworkers . "
This was the message Judi used in outreach to workers .
Records indicate investigators found a usable fingerprint on the sign , but there is no record that the FBI ever tried to match the print to Judi or Darryl .
The FBI lab confirmed that components of that and Oakland bombs matched exactly in components and construction method , and were built by the same person (s ) .
Another suspicious point about the Cloverdale bomb : this exact type of firebomb , a pipe bomb strapped to a can of gasoline , was studied at the FBI bomb school two weeks earlier , according to testimony of an Oakland officer who attended .
FBI Lied About the Evidence Within an hour of the Oakland explosion , none other than Special Agent Doyle , the bomb school instructor , was taking charge of the bomb scene investigation .
Since he was the FBI 's top Bay Area bomb expert , the other FBI and Oakland bomb investigators first at the scene , some of whom had been his students , deferred to his assertions about the evidence .
It was Doyle who allegedly overruled the Oakland sergeant on the scene who said the bomb was under the driver 's seat and that he could see the pavement under the car through the hole in the seat .
It was Doyle who falsely said the bomb was on the floor behind the driver 's seat where it would have been easily seen .
It was also Doyle who falsely claimed that two bags of nails found in the back of Judi 's car matched nails taped to the bomb for shrapnel effect , when in fact they were not even the same type , and were clearly different to the naked eye .
Other officers on the scene testified that Doyle argued with them , and quoted him saying , " I 've been looking at bomb scenes for 20 years , and I 'm looking at this one , and I 'm telling you you can rely on it .
This bomb was visible to the people who loaded the back seat of this car . "
Was it an honest mistake ?
Not likely , the judge ruled in denying Doyle immunity from the lawsuit .
Dennis Cunningham argued in a court brief , " In sum , there was no way such an experienced bomb technician as Frank Doyle , ... or the other investigators -- or Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder -- would not have known that the bomb was under the seat when it blew up . "
Exactly three weeks later , when Supervisory Special Agent David R. Williams -- the FBI crime laboratory 's top explosives expert -- inspected the bombed car , he pointed out to Doyle that impact marks left by the pipe bomb 's end caps on the transmission tunnel and driver 's door , combined with the location of the hole in the floorboard and the damage to the seat cushion , clearly proved the bomb was under the driver 's seat , not in the back where Doyle had said .
Williams had said earlier , from evidence sent to the crime lab , that the bomb had a motion trigger , and that it had functioned as designed rather than being an accidental explosion .
Despite this clear evidence that Judi was the target of attempted murder , the FBI and Oakland PD continued for another four weeks telling the media and the court that Judi and Darryl were their only suspects , and cooking up other stories about nails from the bomb matching nails found in Judi 's house .
There can be no doubt that the FBI was knowingly lying about evidence .
But why ?
Some think there was a determined effort to hide exonerating evidence and to smear Judi and EF !
according to plan , even though the bomb did n't kill her as intended .
The Mysterious Letter
The days following the explosion in Judi's car were already weird enough :
The media were belatedly told about the dud bomb at the Cloverdale LP sawmill with Judi 's slogan posted nearby , and there were almost daily statements from the Oakland Police and FBI insisting that Bari was a clumsy bomber .
But then came a mysterious letter that made everyone 's head spin -- an anonymous anti-abortion extremist took credit for the bombing .
The so - called " Lord 's Avenger " letter was mailed to the regional daily newspaper , the Santa Rosa Press Democrat .
The author said Judi was targeted because she organized opposition to an anti-abortion demonstration some 16 months earlier .
The writer , who used biblical - sounding language and proclaimed , " I am the Lord 's Avenger , " said he had also built and placed the Cloverdale sawmill bomb in an effort to " bring infamy down on Judi Bari . "
The letter accurately described details of the construction of both bombs , including that the Oakland bomb was motion triggered .
The letter is seen by all sides as a hoax -- but who was the hoaxer and what was the motive ?
Because the letter said that Judi was the target and not the bomber , the FBI claimed it must have been written by a confederate of Judi's and Darryl 's that knew how the bomb was made .
It became an excuse for the FBI to investigate Earth First !
Judi realized that that the details of the bomb construction included in the letter were known to the FBI , and believed the letter was a red herring tactic by the FBI or the timber industry to throw suspicion away from themselves once they realized that she would survive the bombing and the plan to blame her was unraveling .
The physical evidence , if it came to light , would reveal she was not the bomber .
Suspicion of a timber industry connection would be obvious because of the death threats she received as their leading opponent .
The Avenger letter provided a plausible lone assassin theory unconnected to either timber or FBI .
Indeed , the FBI resisted mightily against releasing the exonerating evidence .
Judi's enemies have seized on the Avenger letter and tried to tie it to her ex-husband , but that theory does n't wash -- a topic to be covered in a later Monitor story .
FBI Domestic Covert Operations - COINTELPRO
One of the big questions remains : Would the FBI actually try to frame Judi Bari ?
The act of blaming Judi and Darryl for the bombing that nearly killed them , and their repeated lies to the media about evidence in the case , are classic " COINTELPRO " tactics .
Until it was exposed in 1971 , COINTELPRO was the FBI 's code name for its Top Secret " counterintelligence " program to undermine leftist and other radical movements .
FBI founder and longtime Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered FBI agents to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize " the activities of various " subversive " organizations and their members and individuals whom he categorized as opposed to the national interests .
Under Hoover the Bureau placed itself above the law and used fraud , deception , dirty tricks and force to sabotage constitutionally - protected political activity .
Its methods were the domestic counterpart of covert action tactics used by the CIA throughout the world .
A mid-seventies Congressional investigation declared the FBI 's covert operations against political dissenters unlawful , unconstitutional and un-American .
In 1975 , Congressman Don Edwards commented : Regardless of the unattractiveness or noisy militancy of some private citizens or organizations , the Constitution does not permit federal interference with their activities except through the criminal justice system , armed with its ancient safeguards .
There are no exceptions .
No federal agency , the CIA , the IRS , or the FBI , can be at the same time policeman , prosecutor , judge and jury .
That is what constitutionally guaranteed due process is all about .
It may sometimes be disorderly and unsatisfactory to some , but it is the essence of freedom ...
I suggest that the philosophy supporting COINTELPRO is the subversive notion that any public official , the President or a policeman , possesses a kind of inherent power to set aside the Constitution whenever he thinks the public interest , or " national security " warrants it .
That notion is postulate of tyranny .
[ emphasis added ]
As a result of those hearings , new rules were put in place barring FBI investigations of political groups in the absence of any reasonable indication that crimes were being planned or committed .
But in the ' 80s the FBI used the same old tactics against opponents of U. S. policy in El Salvador and Nicaragua -- they just stopped calling it COINTELPRO .
At the end of the 1980s the FBI conducted a three - year secret operation against Earth First ! in Arizona , described above .
M. Wesley Swearingen , a retired career FBI agent with first - hand inside knowledge of COINTELPRO wrote about it in his book " FBI Secrets -- An Agent 's Expose : " COINTELPRO is the FBI code word for an unconscionable program that was officially in operation and documented on paper from August 1956 to April 1971 .
The program is still in operation today , but under a different code name .
The operation is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the release of documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ( emphasis added )
Swearingen wrote that as an FBI agent he was told not to discuss COINTELPRO with anyone outside the FBI , including his wife or relatives .
He reviewed files showing Hoover ordered the mailing of anonymous letters to the parents of college - student daughters alerting them to the sexual activities of Students for a Democratic Society .
After seeing that and far more egregious tactics in the files , including assassinations and framing people for life sentences , he wrote : I knew that the FBI had gone off the deep end and had become a secret police state .
I did not know the extent to which J. Edgar Hoover and his agents had gone to control the average citizen 's mind , thoughts , and actions until I had read the files .
Very few citizens know the extent to which the FBI has gone to control our society .
The FBI thinks it knows what is best for the country . "
( Links to a half hour radio interview with Swearingen , as well as many other sources of information on the Bari case and COINTELPRO cases described below , can be found on our related RESOURCES PAGE . )
Oakland Police Collaborated with the FBI Among the old COINTELPRO pals of the FBI was the Oakland police , who have a long history of cooperating with the Bureau in spying on the Black Panther Party .
In fact , Oakland could n't have been a more convenient location for the FBI if they had planned it themselves .
The media coverage of the Bari bombing was far greater , and was far more easily manipulated by the FBI , because of happening in the Bay Area , rather than in Mendocino or Humboldt Counties where Judi spent most of her time .
Because of the motion trigger , the bomber knew the explosion would occur soon after Judi started driving her car , and that she would n't get far from where she spent the night .
It was only a question of when she would start off .
The FBI was on the scene of the Bari bombing so quickly that it suggests they were waiting nearby " with their fingers in their ears , " as Judi quipped .
But were the Oakland Police working with the FBI to set her up ?
Encouraging and tapping into political spying operations run by local police like Oakland 's was one of the key ways the FBI got around the Attorney General 's restrictions that barred strictly political spying after COINTELPRO was exposed .
In deposition , OPD intelligence division chief Kevin Griswold admitted that his department keeps files on over 300 political groups and individuals in the Bay Area .
Griswold said the Oakland Police have spied on EF !
since 1984 , and had their own informant inside EF !
who reported back to Griswold on plans for upcoming demonstrations .
EF ! is not based in Oakland and had little activity there prior to the Bari bombing .
Griswold said he shares information from his spies with the FBI .
Richard Held , COINTELPRO master
The special agent in charge of the FBI 's San Francisco office at the time of the bombing was Richard W. Held , a 26 - year veteran of the FBI 's COINTELPRO " dirty tricks " campaigns against the Black Panthers , American Indian Movement and Puerto Rican independence activists .
In the late '60s , Held was part of a COINTELPRO operation resulting in the directed murders of two Black Panther leaders by FBI informers .
Wesley Swearingen says
Held also directed the framing and conviction of L.A. Panther leader Elmer " Geronimo " Pratt for murder , and that he was also guilty of perjury and destroying evidence .
Swearingen also wrote , " A clear example of the FBI 's continued COINTELPRO is in the FBI 's alleged involvement in the 1990 bombing of the vehicle occupied by Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney ... which was an effort to neutralize Judi Bari . "
During his deposition under oath in the Bari case , Held claimed he was personally unaware of much about the Bari - Cherney case , and implied that it was not important enough to merit his attention .
But files in the office contained a memo from Washington ordering his office to provide weekly reports on the case so that Headquarters could respond to the " numerous inquiries " they were getting from the media .
His testimony was contradicted by FBI agents under his command who said in their depositions that they briefed him regularly on the case .
Mistakes in the Bari case under his command may have brought an early end to Held 's twenty - five - year FBI career .
He abruptly announced his resignation from the FBI in 1993 -- the day before Judi went public with the newly released Oakland Police crime scene photos which proved the FBI lied about the location of the bomb .
Held said he resigned because he expected reassignment to a new post and did n't want to move his family .
Was that the real reason ?
His father , also a COINTELPRO master , had risen to the high post of Deputy Director of the FBI , and Held 's career track was headed for the top as well .
He said his mother cried when he told her he was resigning .
Other FBI bombings
Two cases came to light where the FBI allegedly used bombs to frame radicals twenty years before the Bari bombing .
One plot did n't work when the FBI 's agent provocateur rebelled and blew the whistle :
In Seattle , FBI agent Louis Harris recruited David Sannes in 1970 , a patriotic veteran who was willing to help them catch some bombers .
Sannes worked with explosives expert Jeffrey Paul Desmond and FBI agent Bert Carter .
Their instructions were to find people interested in bombing .
...
When Carter made it clear that he planned to have one bomber die in a booby - trapped explosion , Sannes dropped his FBI work and went public .
" My own knowledge is that the FBI along with other Federal law enforcement agencies has been involved in a campaign of bombing , arson and terrorism in order to create in the mass public mind a connection between political dissidence of whatever stripe and revolutionaries of whatever violent tendencies , " Sannes reported in an interview on WBAI radio .
( emphasis added )
In an unsettling parallel to the Bari case , Ralph Featherstone , a black Student National Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) leader from Washington , DC , was killed by a bomb explosion in his car on the night of March 9 , 1970 .
Police recovered a letter supposedly found on his body which they believed came from Cuba along with a " revolutionary poem . "
They suspected that Featherstone was connected to communist activity .
SNCC was a COINTELPRO target starting in 1967 .
Rabbi Arthur Waskow , another COINTELPRO target who sued the FBI and won , wrote : " The FBI claimed ( Featherstone ) had been transporting a bomb , but SNCC said that was nonsense .
Since he was dead there was no further exploration of what happened .
I 've been remembering that in the light of the Bari bombing .
And wondering .
A lot .
A LOT . "
( See also Waskow 's letter about his own case in the March 1997 Monitor ) Judi Bari pointed out that if she had been killed by the bomb as intended , as in the Featherstone case , the evidence exonerating her would never have come out .
Only because she survived and was able to file suit and gain subpoena power was she able to wrest the evidence loose from the grim , white - knuckled grip of the FBI .
The FBI has stonewalled at every turn Until the Bari - Cherney suit finally has its day in court , many questions will lie unanswered .
But it seems far more rational than paranoid to believe there was an FBI and corporate timber connection to the bombing of Judi Bari .
Both timber and the FBI had ample motives , history , means and opportunity to bomb Judi .
There are also FBI connections to both Maxxam / Pacific Lumber and Louisiana Pacific -- even involving bombs , in LP 's case .
Both of those corporations were led by ruthless , robber - baron CEOs who were looting the redwoods at an unsustainable rate and reaping enormous profits .
Judi was an outspoken leader of the opposition to that looting , and she was drawing unwanted public attention to it during the prelude to the Prop.
130 campaign , which if successful would have curtailed their rape and run tactics .
The FBI has obviously obstructed justice by refusing to disclose evidence as ordered by the court , forcing Judi 's attorneys to go back to the court to get further orders to compel compliance , and even then " losing " key pages and groups of pages from the files .
It hides behind secrecy , covering up its own wrongdoing , and possibly covering for the industry as well .
Even after the Alameda DA refused on July 12 , 1990 , to file charges due to lack of evidence , the FBI never corrected its lies to the media , and it maintains even now -- when the evidence to the contrary is damning -- that there are no other suspects in the case but Judi and Darryl .
The FBI has stonewalled at every turn .
Many of the released file pages are heavily censored , some with " national security " indicated as the reason .
What does the Bari bombing have to do with national security ?
Could it be the FBI 's conceit that revealing its own culpability in the bombing would harm national security ?
The FBI and Oakland claimed Bari and her supporters would not cooperate in the bombing investigation -- although they had the right to question Judi under oath at any time once discovery began in 1993 in her lawsuit .
But they never called her for a deposition .
Is n't it odd that the FBI maintains Judi was guilty , yet had no interest in questioning her ?
On her own initiative , Judi gave her sworn deposition just four weeks before she died , and the FBI and Oakland attorneys chose not to ask her a single question in the two - day session .
FBI attorney Joe Sher even tried to block the deposition from happening at all .
He had already delayed it for a month with a procedural objection , then threatened to delay it for another month unless Judi agreed that her testimony could not be released to the public unless it became part of the court record .
Judi was forced to agree , or she would have died without getting her testimony on the record in a form usable in court .
Does n't this look like the FBI is simply determined to cover up the facts ?
The Bari / Cherney legal team has conducted about fifty depositions of witnesses from the FBI and Oakland police over the past several years , while the other side has not done a single one .
Ever .
Joe Sher boasted to Judi that he would drag the case out for twenty years or longer , as he did in the suit filed against the FBI by the Socialist Workers Party .
Sher knows that he has the power , wealth and institutional stamina of the U.S. government behind him , while Bari and Cherney rely upon community support and donations to keep their lawsuit alive on a shoestring budget .
By filing every possible procedural challenge and appealing every ruling that goes against them , the FBI and Oakland have delayed the suit from coming to trial after eight years .
Surely if
Sher thought they would win he would have rushed it to trial quickly , rather than delaying in the hopes that the plaintiffs will run out of assets and give up -- or die before the case comes to trial .

PHILADELPHIA – Some 1500 nurses and professional and technical workers struck at Temple University Hospital Wednesday morning after working without a contract for seven months .
A spirited crowd of Temple workers and their allies filled Broad Street in front of the north Philadelphia hospital for a noontime rally as the strike gathered strength and support during its first day .
The rally impressively displayed the preparation and high consciousness of the striking workers .
Speakers expressed their anger at the Temple hospital and university administration for their repeated and long standing failure to address issues of staffing levels , patient care , working conditions and compensation .
Many expressed their pride in their work and their length of service .
Respiratory therapist Lorenzo Glover told the crowd , “ You guys built this house ; Temple forced our hand .
We are here today and we are here to stay ! ”
Francine Fregeehi , Vice President of TUHNA , the Temple University Hospital Nurses Association , took the microphone to express her anger at media accounts describing the strikers as “ angry Black workers . ”
She said , “ They must not know that we have a diverse work force .
I am an angry Black worker , but I also see angry white workers and angry Asian workers here . ”
The strikers were buoyed by the presence of the national paresident of the Hospital Workers Local 1199c Henry Nicholas and other union leaders who expressed support .
Jim Savage , President of United Steel Workers Local 10 - 1 , said , “ The Philadelphia labor movement supports you ; we ’ll be here .
You just have to last one day longer than they do ! ” Paul Prescott of the Student Labor Action Project ( SLAP ) told the strikers that Temple students were in support and had delivered a petition with 1300 student signatures saying so to university President Anne Weaver Hart .
The striking workers are members of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professional ( PASNAP ) .
They include 1000 members of TUHNA and 500 professional and technical employees such as social workers and laboratory workers who are members of Temple Allied Professionals ( TAP ) .
The workers say that the Temple administration is taking union busting to new levels in this strike .
Their contract expired last September 1 and the administration has refused to bargain since that time .
An issue that generated special anger was an attempt to insert in the contract a clause that would legally bar employees from publicly criticizing administration practices at the hospital .
Speakers pointed out the irony of management ’s attempting to deny workers their Constitutional rights in the city where the Constitution was written .
PASNAP President Patricia Eakin told the World that this “ gag order ” amounted to a “ global screw job ” that the members would not tolerate .
The spirit and determination of the strikers was all the more impressive in light of the protracted management campaign to have its way in this contract .
The strike focuses attention on key national issues of labor rights , affordable health care , and privatization .
The union notes that Temple has gone into the healthcare business with disastrous results .
Thirteen years ago Temple bought an additional healthcare facility , Northeastern Hospital which , for decades , had served the northeast Philadelphia community and was a busy facility until Temple closed it in April of 2009 .
The University now is putting all its effort into breaking the union at its remaining facility near the north Philadelphia campus .
The union says that the University has hired outside firms to bring in 800 strikebreakers who are being paid $ 10,000 a week and housed at expensive downtown hotels .

This is n't a new idea , and it 's not limited to Massachusetts .
( When I first read about it , it was called " tiered " coverage . )
I expect we 're going to see it spread , though , because the just - passed federal legislation does n't actually reform the health care system , and much of the much - vaunted " access " is in name only .
Which means the fight is n't over .
Because if you have a serious health problem and your coverage will send you to the facility that does n't have such a great track record , you 're out of luck :
Health insurers are starting to sell policies that largely bar consumers from receiving medical care at popular but expensive hospitals such as Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women ’s — a once radical idea that is gaining traction as a way to control soaring health care costs .
Governor Deval Patrick and Senate President Therese Murray have included such restricted provider networks in their recent legislative proposals to control rising insurance rates .
And the state this month began offering limited - network plans to 300,000 state employees , retirees , and their families , promising 20 percent discounts on premiums if they are willing to give up access to some of the Boston area ’s most renowned hospitals .
Dolores Mitchell , executive director of the agency that oversees health insurance for state employees , said she wants “ to send a message to the more expensive [ provider ] organizations that , ‘ Hey , we ’re not going to just sit still and do nothing ’ " as medical costs climb year after year .
But even as state officials promote the idea , there are obstacles to its wide adoption .
Some of the state ’s largest insurers have contracts with powerful teaching hospitals and doctors ’ groups that could make it difficult to exclude them .
And Massachusetts consumers and employers have long cherished choosing from a broad range of providers .
In a yearlong investigation into rising health care costs completed last month , Attorney General Martha Coakley cited " distorted " contracting practices as one factor .
She found that providers with market clout have negotiated clauses in their contracts that prohibit or inhibit insurers from creating plans intended to steer patients away from them .
She did not name the companies involved , but said regulators and lawmakers should move to discourage or forbid these practices .
Certain providers “ are strong enough to dictate which products get into the market , " agreed Rick Weisblatt , senior vice president for health services at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care , the state ’s second largest insurer .
Tagines , the slow - cooked , deeply aromatic stews of North Africa , are traditionally made and served in distinctive clay pots , often with lamb , and usually over couscous .
This is n’t a traditional version :
It ’s fairly quick , and it relies on a heavy - bottomed saucepan rather than a tagine .
With chicken thighs , bulgur , chickpeas and dried apricots , it comes together to produce an Americanized version that is a super one - pot dinner , fast enough for a weeknight despite the long ingredient list , and infinitely variable .

A few days ago the Illinois EPA released its latest Annual Landfill Capacity Report .
Now that you 've recovered from the excitement of this news , I 'll explain : that 's a document detailing how much waste residents and businesses in the state are generating each year , how much of it 's being recycled or composted , and how much is being trucked to landfills .
And the latest edition , covering 2008 , shows that the state continues to produce garbage at a rate that 's dangerous to the environment and costly to the economy .
Our way of doing business in Chicago is mostly to blame .
The good news , if that 's what you call it , is that the recession has actually led to a reduction in the amount of waste produced in Chicago — when people have less to spend , they tend to have less to throw into the trash .
In addition , as the pace of development in Chicago has slowed , so has the amount of debris generated by construction and demolition .
Plus , thanks to laws requiring that C&D debris be recycled , waste companies have developed new facilities to keep that concrete , wood , and metal refuse from being trucked to landfills .
The result is that Chicago residents and businesses produced 8,155,086 tons of waste in 2008 , about 35 percent of the statewide total .
That was down from the record - high of 10,361,381 in 2006 .
But it still means that the average Chicagoan produced a whopping 15.4 pounds of trash a day .
By comparison , the average for everyone in Illinois was 9.9 pounds a day .
City officials still have n't developed a comprehensive plan for household and business recycling , resulting in thousands of tons of reusable metal , plastic , glass , and paper being unnecessarily thrown away every year .
In 2008 , even after most heavy C&D waste was recycled , 3,686,131 tons of Chicago garbage were trucked to landfills in other parts of Illinois or nearby states .
Since then , the Daley administration has stalled expansion of its Blue Cart program for homes and small apartment buildings , leaving thousands without a convenient way to recycle .
There are a long list of environmental disadvantages to landfilling garbage : it 's a waste of space in the ground , many of the materials do n't ever decompose , there 's a potential for toxic leaks , the gas burned from trucking garbage hundreds of miles adds to our air pollution and climate change problems , and it pushes up prices for consumers , since the prices we pay for goods include the costs of landfill fees and producing virgin materials .
Recycling can cut costs ; producing less garbage works even better .
Unfortunately , we 're going in the wrong direction : Chicago 's waste output is now more than 300 percent what it was in the early 1980s .
Across the U.S. it 's gone up about 65 percent .
That does n't mean we 're in danger of running out of landfill space — waste companies keep buying more land for it , and the state estimates we 're more than 20 years away from using our current capacity .
But landfills are getting farther and farther away from the city .
" There is a moratorium against landfills within Chicago ’s city limits , " the state report notes .
" Land prices are high in Chicago .
Waste generated by Chicago Metropolitan region ’s population may become problematic for other Illinois counties and nearby states .
Capacity available at landfills in at least two adjacent states , Indiana and Wisconsin , may also be affected . "
Which of course means that the cost of getting rid of our trash will probably keep rising too .

BHP Billiton yesterday joined Rio Tinto in battling graft allegations , saying it had uncovered evidence of possible corruption by employees on an overseas project .
The Australian understands the conduct , now under investigation by the powerful Securities and Exchange Commission in the US , relates to a bauxite exploration project in Cambodia .
BHP has admitted making a $ US2.5 million ( $ 2.7 million ) payment to the community near the bauxite project , in the northeastern Cambodian province of Mondulkiri , near the Vietnamese border .
A Cambodian government minister described the payment as " tea money " , a local term for unofficial payments to government officials .
BHP has rejected this , saying the money was put into a development fund investing in local social welfare programs .
The company said it had paid $ US1 m in September 2006 to the Cambodia government for bauxite exploration rights .
BHP yesterday declined to reveal where the alleged corruption occurred , stressing only that it was not China .
It would not comment on what the behaviour involved and whether employees had stood down or been fired but it said the activities involved mineral exploration , not marketing its products .
Last month , Rio sacked four workers , including Australian Stern
Hu , after they were convicted of bribery and stealing commercial secrets related to deals to sell iron ore to Chinese steel mills .
Yesterday , BHP said the alleged corruption was uncovered after the SEC queried it during an investigation into mineral exploration projects .
According to a report in
The Cambodia Daily
in July 2007 , the nation 's National Assembly was told BHP had paid $ US2.5 million to the government to secure exploration rights to a bauxite deposit in Mondulkiri with Japanese industrial giant Mitsubishi .
The claim was made by the then water minister , who described the payment as " tea money " .
The minister 's comments informed a report into Cambodian corruption by the non-government organisation Global Witness .
The report , Country for Sale , details the claims and BHP 's rejection of them .
Read more about the BHP corruption claims at The Australian .
P Chidambaram , the Indian Home Minster , said he was shocked by the scale of the attack .
" Something went drastically wrong , they seem to have walked into a trap laid by Naxals .
Causalities are very high and I am deeply shocked and sorry for the loss of lives .
This shows the savage nature of the Naxals , " he said .
For some people , the Internet is the killer app -- literally .
From newspapers and the yellow pages to personal privacy and personal contact , the Net has been accused of murdering , eviscerating , ruining , and obliterating more things than the Amazing Hulk .
Some claims are more true than others , but the Net certainly has claimed its share of scalps .
Here are ten things the Net is making virtually extinct , plus five that have flourished .
1. Trust in Encyclopedias
When I was a kid , if something was in the Encyclopedia Britannica ( or even Grolier 's ) , it was true .
Now -- thanks to Wikipedia -- having " encyclopedic knowledge " of a topic is n't as impressive when there 's a good chance most of what you think you know was concocted by a 12 - year - old .
After a 2005 study by the British journal Nature showed Britannica and Wikipedia to be equally inaccurate , faith in all encyclopedias plummeted .
Britannica attacked that study 's methodology as " fatally flawed , " but it was too late .
Also dead : trust in studies of encyclopedias .
2. Barroom Arguments
It used to be you could kill many hours and even more brain cells drinking beer and arguing over arcane trivia .
Who was a more fearsome slugger , Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron ?
Who'd win a one - on - one match between Kobe Bryant and Doctor J? ( Sorry Kobe -- we love ya man , but in 1972 the Doc was unstoppable . )
Now whenever there 's a question of fact , somebody just whips out a smartphone and does a search on Google or dials up Wolfram Alpha and runs a statistical analysis .
Where 's the fun in that ?
3. Your Old Flame
No matter the state of your current relationship , it used to be possible to escape for a few minutes by pining for the one (s ) that got away .
In your mind , they 're just as hot as they were decades ago when they were captain of the football team or homecoming queen .
But now they 're on Facebook .
Guess what ?
Assuming their pictures are current , they 're just as old and fat as you are .
The good news ?
You might not care .
There 's a reason Facebook was named as a contributing cause in 20 percent of divorces last year .
And be careful whom you poke ; British researchers noted a rise in sexually transmitted diseases due in part , they said , to people hooking up on social networks .
4. Civil Discourse
The niceties of polite disagreement are mostly dead , thanks to the Internet .
Rudeness and name - calling have devolved into forms of entertainment ; entire sites are devoted just to cataloging flame wars .
Artist Mike Reed has caricatured the various breeds of online forum jerks for this very Website .
And though you may find some some discussion boards and community sites that still encourage good manners and penalize offenders , they are becoming increasingly rare .
Disagree ?
See me in the Comments ( below ) and we 'll fight about it , *** clown .
5. Listening to Albums
Remember putting " Dark Side of the Moon " on the turntable or slipping " Graceland " into your CD tray ?
Your kids wo n't .
Not only will the concept of music delivered via molecules -- hard media -- seem totally 20th century , but the entire concept of an album ( let alone a " concept album " ) will be lost on them .
Over the past decade , sales of complete albums -- even the nonmolecular versions -- declined 55 percent to less than 400 million in 2009 , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
During roughly the same period , sales of individual digital tracks have soared from zero to nearly 1.2 billion .
Apple iTunes and file - sharing networks have nearly obliterated the notion of listening to more than one song by one artist in a row .
" Gee Dad , what did you do before Apple invented ' shuffle ' ?
God , you 're so old . "
6. Expertise
Before the Web , if you wanted call yourself an expert , you usually needed expertise in some field .
Now all you need is a blog and sufficient quantities of chutzpah .
For example , in a recent survey by PR Week , 52 percent of bloggers call themselves " journalists . "
Because calling yourself a " typist " is n't nearly as impressive .
Next : Gud spellng , Nigeria 's reputation , and more .

A plume of volcanic ash from Iceland has led to flights across the UK being grounded .
The events around one British Airways flight in 1982 reveal the potential dangers of this sort of dust .
The passenger jet effectively turned into a glider
When all four engines on the Boeing 747 being flown by Captain Eric Moody shut down at 37,000 ft , he had n't a clue why .
It was n't until later , when Capt Moody , his crew and the 247 passengers on board the flight , were safely back on the ground , that he discovered the cause of the narrowly averted catastrophe - volcanic ash .
Airports are being closed across the UK after dust which spewed from a volcano in Iceland , began drifting southwards .
The experience of Capt Moody , almost 30 years ago , shows the potential danger clouds of volcanic ash present to modern jet aircraft .
There had been no hint of trouble when flight BA 009 took off from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on the evening of 24 June , 1982 .
Heading for Perth , Australia , the weather forecast for the five - hour journey was good and the crew were anticipating an uneventful flight .
It 's not unusual [ too see fire like that ] in high wispy cloud .
But it developed into something more than we 'd ever seen before
Capt Eric moody
Volcanic ash halts all UK flights
The first sign of trouble came as the plane , which had hit cruising height , headed past Java over the south - eastern Indian Ocean .
Capt Moody , who had left the cockpit for a stroll , was summoned back to the flight deck .
As he climbed the stairs of the Jumbo he noticed puffs of " smoke " billowing from the vents in the floor and detected an acrid smell .
When he opened the door to the cockpit he saw the windscreen ablaze with a St Elmo 's fire - a discharge of static electricity .
But that alone was n't enough to cause alarm , Capt Moody says , recalling the events when he spoke to BBC's Good Morning Scotland on Thursday .
" That 's not unusual in high wispy cloud .
But it developed into something more than we 'd ever seen before . "
Looking out the side windows of the cockpit , the crew noticed the front of the engines were glowing as if lit inside .
Then Capt Moody 's flight engineer detailed the impact the dust was having on the aircraft itself .
" Engine failure number four ... engine failure number two , " he said .
Capt Moody accepting an award after his safe handling of the crisis " Three 's gone They 've all gone . "
Within a few moments , a passenger jet powered by four Rolls Royce engines had become a glider .
Needing time to calmly consider his options , Capt Moody used autopilot to put the plane into a gentle descent , and instructed his first officer to issue a mayday call .
While the crew on the flight deck were frantically trying to figure out the cause of this freak failure , many passengers were largely unaware that anything was wrong .
But eventually , when the passenger oxygen masks dropped as the plane steepened its descent , the news had to be announced .
" Good evening ladies and gentlemen .
This is your captain speaking .
We have a small problem .
All four engines have stopped .
We are all doing our damnedest to get them going again .
I trust you are not in too much distress . "
Eventually , after quarter of an hour without any power , the engines were brought back to life .
Ash had clogged the engines , which only restarted when enough of the molten ash solidified and broke off .
" We glided from 37,000 ft to 12,000 ft before we got [ the engines ] going again , " recalls Capt Moody .
The plane headed back to Jakarta where it landed safely , though even then one of the engines had failed again .
Clare Wickett , a flight attendant on BA 009
It was two days before investigators confirmed that volcanic ash had been responsible for the near disaster .
The plane had flown into a cloud of dust spewed out by an eruption of Mount Galunggung , 110 miles south east of Jakarta .
A close examination of the plane revealed the damage a plume of these tiny particles can do to an engine - the tips of the turbine blades had been ground away .
The findings were eventually incorporated into a report on the dangers of volcanic ash to aircraft .
Reflecting on the chilling events of that flight 28 years later , Capt Moody , who lives in Camberley in Surrey , shows the sort of understatement characteristic of those in his profession .
" It was , yeah , a little bit frightening . "

The rich are like you and me -- but so much richer
NPR 's Planet Money posts some IRS data that allows us to compare the 400 richest Americans ' income and tax payment :
" The Top 400 are considerably more talented than the rest of us , " writes Matt Yglesias .
" And this decline in their tax rates has created exciting new incentives for them to apply their talents .
And that , in turn , is why the 2000s were a so much more economically successful decade than the 1990s , not just for the Top 400 but for the rest of us as well .
Thanks to their skyrocketing incomes and falling tax rates , we ’re currently all enjoying the fruits of prosperity , rapid growth and low unemployment . "
I 'd only add that while it 's true that we can't solve all our fiscal problems by taxing the rich , we can solve more of them than people realize , as inequality has made the rich a lot richer than people realize .
In 2007 , the top 1 percent of households accounted for 23.5 percent of the nation 's income .
That is to say , for every dollar of income in America , the top 1 percent got about a quarter and the rest of us split the other 76 cents .
An Ancient Alternative to Oil
By Zed B. Starkovich
The ONLY way our past foreign policy , and present war , can be justified is if we accept the fundamental premise that WE NEED OIL TO SURVIVE .
We must believe that oil is our only source of energy and without it civilization as we know it would collapse .
In order to justify our more “ precision bombing ” must believe that protecting our oil - based economy is the same as protecting the people of America .
But its all a lie .
WE DON ’T NEED PETROLEUM AND NEVER HAVE .

Pot Shrinks Tumors ; Government Knew in ’ 74
By Raymond Cushing , AlterNet – May 31 , 2000
The term medical marijuana took on dramatic new meaning in February , 2000 when researchers in Madrid announced they had destroyed incurable brain tumors in rats by injecting them with THC , the active ingredient in cannabis .
The Madrid study marks only the second time that THC has been administered to tumor - bearing animals ; the first was a Virginia investigation 26 years ago .
In both studies , the THC shrank or destroyed tumors in a majority of the test subjects .
Hydrocarbons vs Carbohydrates :
The continuing battle in the United States

Vegetable matter and minerals have competed with each other to become the dominant industrial input for almost 200 years .
For the first 150 years , significant advances occurred in the use of both types of material .
Then , for a quarter of a century after World War II , hydrocarbons took over almost completely but since the 1980s , carbohydrate - derived industrial products have been sweeping back as a result of technological and political developments .
Hemp , The Great Green Hope
Global Research , June 10 , 2011
Industrialists were like scarab beetles , rolling around this giant ball of profit protection , and they ran right over the domestic hemp industry .
Hemp presented way too much competition , too much threat to entrenched and entrenching profits .
Took a pretty big ball of dung , but the scarabs rolled it expertly , professionals .
Except for several years of heavy production during WWII , under the feds ’
“ Hemp for Victory ” campaign — which told the truth about hemp and helped us win the war …not a single acre of hemp has been legally grown in America since 1937 .
Seventy - four years and counting .
That was one enormous ball of dung .
The entire hemp - prohibition infamy could be called a dung deal , especially as related to the common good .

We 've been waiting for tightening measures to hit the Beijing property market , especially after the city 's real estate association itself said the situation was a bubble .
It looks like the government 's clampdown is starting to bite , hard .
Average Beijing transaction prices collapsed 31 % month on month :
Capital Vue :
The average transaction price of commercial residential properties in Beijing for the week ended May 9 fell 1,790 yuan per square meter or 9.6 percent week - on - week to 16,898 yuan per square meter , reports The Beijing News , citing statistics released by Beijing Real Estate Information Network .
Compared with the week ended April 11 , the average transaction price of commercial residential properties in Beijing plunged 31.43 percent to 7,744 yuan per square meter .
In the last weeks of April , the transaction volume of commercial residential properties in Beijing decreased by 10.34 percent , 11.39 percent and 30.82 percent respectively .
Average transaction price was flat at between 22,000 yuan to 23,000 yuan per square meter .

Posted : Sun Apr 04 10 1:56 am Post subject : Hi -Speed Brisket - long & tons of Pron
Success !
The secret comes from moisture control , fire control and resting .
In the face of a number of requests , I thought I 'd throw up a thread explaining my method of getting quality brisket without the agonizing wait times .
I used to do them low & slow , and doubted the hot & fast method , but after a class and a taking what I learned and incorporating it into my way , I have run through a bunch of briskets since and this way works for me .
It 's a bit more prep work - some counter - intuitive - but it all pays off in final product .
I will tell you that this method does n't produce a nice .
thick bark .
Not an issue for me , as I 'm more of a meat guy than a bark guy .
As always , YMMV .
We had our Pastor over for dinner a couple of weeks ago , and as you can imagine , he probably eats other people 's food a lot in his line of work .
He kinda looked at me funny when I served the brisket meal without a knife , but I said " trust me " .
He was amazed at the tenderness .
Unfortunately , he 's mentioned it to others at church several times since , so it looks like I might have to expand my production scale soon .
1. Picking the right brisket
Start out with a good brisket , not the cheapest you can find .
A side - by - side comparison smoke session convinced me of this .
Always pick a choice over a select grade packer brisket .
Certified Angus beef ( CAB ) is nice too , but not as important .
I have n't tried either Prime or Wagyu briskets , mostly due to cost , but I do n't know if the return on your money is there .
Below , you see a 13.92 lb.
Choice brisket I picked up from Costco .
The brisket was nice and flexible , and did n't have as large a fat clod on it as some of the others did .
The end of the flat was also a pretty even thickness , which will allow for more even slices when done .
Sometimes you have to go through a number of briskets until you find a good one , and the meat guys should n't mind as long as you are n't making a mess of their displays .
Here 's a closeup of the label on the cryovac bag , for those that may be interested .
2. Trimming the meat
Now , I did n't take any pictures of the fat trimming operation or separating the point from the flat .
I figure that 's something that anyone can get through on their own .
Below are pictures of both sides of the flat after I have removed the fat cap and most all the other fat deposits .
I know all about the " fat makes flavor " and " fat bastes the meat " arguments , but they do n't turn out to be necessary with this method , and I do n't have to worry about the fat after the cook this way .
Plus , removing it all now allows you to season ALL of the meat - any fat you season does n't help at all .
One side of the trimmed flat :
Other side of the trimmed flat :
Here are the pictures of the point after I separated it from the flat and removed all of the surface fat .
You 'll see that there is still a lot of intramuscular fat , which is what gives the point it 's particular flavor and texture as compared to the flat .
One side of the trimmed point :
Other side of the trimmed point :
After I was done , it turned out that I removed right at six pounds of fat from the 14 lb. brisket .
It may seem a lot of loss , but consider what your yield is when smoking one the conventional way , and you 'll see all this does is let you lose it earlier .
Without all this fat , you 'll have to learn to cook without the annoying " stall " , too .
Darn .
Here 's the pile o' waste :
3 . Seasoning the meat
I used a brisket rub that I 've developed over a period of time .
It 's still in flux , but it 's pretty close to just what I am looking for .
Here you see a medium coating on both pieces - the undersides and edges are done as well .
4. Meat and Fire monitoring
Thought I 'd toss a clock in the pictures so all can see the time frame throughout the cook .
Yes , that 's AM ...
Started with a full Weber chimney of Kingsford comp .
charcoal , lit with 4 paper towels loaded with vegetable oil .
Unlike newspaper , there are no funky inks to get in there , and there are absolutely NO ashes left behind .
The WSM fire ring was filled with 10 lb.s of lump and 5 lbs. of the Kingsford mentioned above .
On top of that went 4 chunks of mesquite .
Once ready , I added the chimney coals on top of that and spread it around a bit to get a hotter fire faster .
Maybe a pseudo - Minion method .
Here I have placed the pans of meat in smoker .
An hour later I flipped the meat for a bit of smoke ring on the bottom side .
Note the temp in the pic below !
Also notice that I had to " adjust " the corners of the foil pan so that it would fit into the WSM 22 .
One nice benefit of doing this is that you can slide the pan partway out the door for temp checking and liquid management !
Here it is five minutes later , cruising along back at 325 degrees .
I foiled the pans 40 minutes later , and added a little water and other liquids to the pans .
Forty - five minutes later after that , the pans were pulled and set in my oven to rest .
I preheated the oven to 200 then turned it off .
This is where you could sauce the point , cut it up and return it to the smoker for some for burnt ends .
5. Wrapping it up
Here is part of the finished flat , sliced against the grain with a little pan juices .
Here 's a closeup of one slice , showing the pull - apart tenderness of the flat .
The point is even better !
6. Review
Here 's the time line for this morning 's brisket blitz .
All times are AM .
06:45 - Start the chimney and load the WSM with charcoal
06:55 - Empty the chimney in the WSM and distribute the coals .
Add center section with 2 gallons of warm water .
07:25 - Load the pans into the WSM .
07:30 - Button up the smoker and add 2 small oak splits to the charcoal .
08:00 - WSM cruising along at 325 .
08:30 - Flipped meat for a bit of smoke ring on the other side
09:35 - Foiled the pans and added liquids .
10:10 - Cooking 's done .
Pans were pulled and taken inside to rest .
11:45 - Brisket rested for 90 minutes .
Started slicing it , and it was as tender as ever .
There you have it - five hours ( including resting ) from starting the fire to eating the goodies .
I think from now on , I 'll use the offset for low & slow just for show - if company 's coming , that is .
Thanks for watching !
_________________
Visit my Okay , I 'm taking one for the team .
I 've pushed the envelope on the hot - fast brisket idea , and the result ... Success !
The secret comes from moisture control , fire control and resting .
In the face of a number of requests , I thought I 'd throw up a thread explaining my method of getting quality brisket without the agonizing wait times .
I used to do them low & slow , and doubted the hot & fast method , but after a class and a taking what I learned and incorporating it into my way , I have run through a bunch of briskets since and this way works for me .
It 's a bit more prep work - some counter - intuitive - but it all pays off in final product .
I will tell you that this method does n't produce a nice .
thick bark .
Not an issue for me , as I 'm more of a meat guy than a bark guy .
As always , YMMV .
We had our Pastor over for dinner a couple of weeks ago , and as you can imagine , he probably eats other people 's food a lot in his line of work .
He kinda looked at me funny when I served the brisket meal without a knife , but I said " trust me " .
He was amazed at the tenderness .
Unfortunately , he 's mentioned it to others at church several times since , so it looks like I might have to expand my production scale soon .
1 . Picking the right brisketStart out with a good brisket , not the cheapest you can find .
A side - by - side comparison smoke session convinced me of this .
Always pick a choice over a select grade packer brisket .
Certified Angus beef ( CAB ) is nice too , but not as important .
I have n't tried either Prime or Wagyu briskets , mostly due to cost , but I do n't know if the return on your money is there .
Below , you see a 13.92 lb.
Choice brisket I picked up from Costco .
The brisket was nice and flexible , and did n't have as large a fat clod on it as some of the others did .
The end of the flat was also a pretty even thickness , which will allow for more even slices when done .
Sometimes you have to go through a number of briskets until you find a good one , and the meat guys should n't mind as long as you are n't making a mess of their displays .
Here 's a closeup of the label on the cryovac bag , for those that may be interested .
2. Trimming the meatNow , I did n't take any pictures of the fat trimming operation or separating the point from the flat .
I figure that 's something that anyone can get through on their own .
Below are pictures of both sides of the flat after I have removed the fat cap and most all the other fat deposits .
I know all about the " fat makes flavor " and " fat bastes the meat " arguments , but they do n't turn out to be necessary with this method , and I do n't have to worry about the fat after the cook this way .
Plus , removing it all now allows you to season ALL of the meat - any fat you season does n't help at all .
One side of the trimmed flat :
Other side of the trimmed flat :
Here are the pictures of the point after I separated it from the flat and removed all of the surface fat .
You 'll see that there is still a lot of intramuscular fat , which is what gives the point it 's particular flavor and texture as compared to the flat .

Proposed reorganization of Drosophila fruitfly genus might throw out its most celebrated member .
Drosophila melanogaster faces genus reassignment .
INDIANA UNIV .
The star subject of genetic research — the Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly — may lose its name .
This is an anticipated repercussion of a decision last week by the London - based International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature .
It had spent more than two years debating a petition that would have protected the hallowed name while opening the way to a major reorganization of the Drosophila genus , which includes at least 1,450 species .
The commission , which oversees the naming of all species , rejected the petition , setting the stage for a likely renaming of D. melanogaster and hundreds of related species .
Among biologists who study various fruitfly species to link genes to traits , the 1 April ruling was no joke .
" Oh my God , " says Therese Markow , a geneticist at the University of California , San Diego , who was reached in the Sonoran Desert , where she was collecting fruitflies .
Markow , who is director of the university 's Drosophila Species Stock Center , added that extensive name changes could " wreak havoc " in the Drosophila literature and databases .
The naming debate began when a US scientist filed a petition with the commission to designate D. melanogaster as the Drosophila type species — the accepted standard of the genus ( see Nature 457 , 368 ; 2009 ) .
Kim van der Linde , an ecologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee , wanted to ensure that the name D. melanogaster would not change if the genus were divided , as she and other scientists advocate .
The genus is extremely large , and genetic data suggest that some of its member species are more closely related to flies outside the genus than they are to other Drosophila species .
In the end , the commission voted 23 to 4 to reject van der Linde 's petition .
The designated type species will continue to be Drosophila funebris , described in 1787 by Johann Fabricius .
But the proposal forced the taxonomic world to face the possibility that the genus in its present form may be untenable .
In their written opinions , commission members gave several reasons for voting against the new proposal .
Many called it premature because the science about the organization of the Drosophila genus remains unsettled .
Others sought to limit the naming disruptions that would occur if the genus were split .
Drosophila melanogaster fits within a subgenus called Sophophora , which includes some 350 members .
Splitting this group off to form a new genus would require fewer renamings than would be needed if D. melanogaster became the type species for Drosophila .
In that case , roughly 1,100 species would be pushed off into new genera .
" It was very difficult for the commissioners , " says Ellinor Michel , the commission 's executive secretary .
" It was a question of celebrity , as everyone knows D. melanogaster . "

If a researcher were to use current data to publish a revision of the Drosophila genus , D. melanogaster would probably become Sophophora melanogaster .
Van der Linde says that if she and her co-authors from the petition can agree , they may present the case for the change .
" Something needs to happen , " she says .
But even if the celebrity fly is renamed , Michel noted , it may still be referred to by its original name .
A FAMILY is in mourning after their toddler unexpectedly died less than 12 hours after receiving a seasonal flu vaccination .
Two - year - old twin Ashley Jade Epapara had been " perfectly fine " before dying at her Upper Mt Gravatt home , on Brisbane 's southside , on April 9 .
Parents David and Nicole are shattered by the mysterious death of their baby girl .
" It 's dreadful , it 's a very hard time , " Mr Epapara said yesterday .
National health authorities have ordered doctors to stop giving seasonal influenza vaccinations to children under five after dozens of serious reactions , including convulsions .
Ashley 's death is being investigated by police and the office of the coroner .
A spokesman for Brisbane coroner John Lock confirmed yesterday that a report was being prepared .
Mrs Epapara told The Sunday Mail that " tests are being carried out " on her little girl .
But the young mother did n't want to comment further as she began shaking and her eyes welled with tears .
Ashley 's twin sister , Jaime , also received the flu jab at the same time and is believed to have been vomiting the night before her sister died .
Asked whether he or his wife thought the influenza vaccine had anything to do with their child 's death , Mr Epapara said : " It 's very coincidental . "
More than 45 children experienced convulsions and fever , with some having to be taken to hospital in intensive care after receiving the vaccine in Western Australia .
Australia 's chief medical officer Professor Jim Bishop said in a statement that the West Australian events were being " urgently investigated by health experts and the Therapeutic Goods Administration " .
The World Health Organisation last year said a " small number of deaths " had occurred in people vaccinated for influenza , with 65 million people vaccinated globally .
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette
Young today said she is unaware of any toddler dying as a direct result of receiving a 2010 seasonal flu vaccination .
Dr Young has responded via a statement and dismisses any knowledge of a death related to flu vaccinations .
``Until now , neither Queensland Health nor the relevant national body had been advised of , or were aware of any death allegedly related to a 2010 seasonal flu vaccination in Queensland , '' Dr Young said in a statement issued today .
`` Our deepest sympathies go out to this family at this time .
``Queensland Health is working closely with the Coroner on this matter . ''
Getty photographer John Moore , a favorite here at BN , scores the photo of the day , if not the week , or month — as far as guilty corporate portraiture goes .
Although there are various elements in the photo worth discussing , which I hope BAGreaders will , the most revealing element here , considering Mr. Hayward ’s over - the - top “ I feel your pain ” PR exercise yesterday , is : at all cost , do whatever you can to keep from getting any of the sh*t on yourself .
( caption : BP CEO Tony Hayward ’s ( C ) shoes are checked for oil after he walked an oil - stained beach on May 24 , 2010 at Port Fourchon , Louisiana .
Hayward said that BP is doing everything possible to clean up the massive oil spill still gushing into the Gulf of Mexico .
Officials now say , however , that it may be impossible to clean the hundreds of miles of coastal wetlands and islands affected . )
After almost nine months since we first laid eyes on a pre-production model of the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila , I finally got my feet in a pair thanks to a gracious source out of Boston .
And as far as first impressions go , I ’m happy to report that the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila — the first running specific Vibram Five Fingers model ever to be released — is worth the wait .
What follows is not an unboxing — the pairs that made it “ out in the wild ” did n’t come in boxes — they are that fresh !
I can only surmise that Vibram was so rushed to get some Bikilas out ( in a sort of mini- release that was confined to only a few select Boston retailers ) in conjunction with last weekend ’s All - Star Barefoot Running Clinic ( sponsored by Vibram ) and the Boston Marathon Expo , that they just said , “ Hey , who needs boxes ? ”
So in the event I ever get a boxed version ( maybe in the electric blue / yellow combination ! ) , I ’ll see about doing a true unboxing .
The Vibram Five Fingers Bikila
Below are my first impressions on the new Vibram Five Fingers Bikila — not a review , of course !
On first sight , the Bikila is striking in its look — the Bikila looks fast — and not unlike it ’s bigger cousin the KSO Trek which looks simultaneously rugged and svelte ( capable on the trail but also nice looking in slacks ! ) , the Bikila has a distinctly nice , high - quality build .
It actually looks more like an expensive [ five - toed ] running shoe and less like a glove for your foot .
On the flipside of Vibram models , if you compare the Bikila to the KSO , the KSO comes off as simple and unrefined .
The Bikila is the highest - quality Vibram Five Fingers model released yet .
The materials , like those used for the grey strap and lower , rear casing are thick and seem durable .
The inner sock - liner and footbed is very soft , and I ’m assuming made from cotton drilex .
The sock - liner upper of the Bikila goes around the ankle and forward on the top of the foot to the upper “ swoop ” seam line you see and then follows the path of the strap on the left and right of the foot .
Forward of that line there is only the thin , single piece upper fabric .
The difference the sock - liner makes as far as feel on your foot — both on the top and bottom — is hard to describe , but flat - out awesome .
Worn barefoot , the Bikila is the best feeling VFF I ’ve put on — I prefer it ’s feel on the bottom of my foot over even the leather - clad Moc .
Could I get this feel on a Classic ( Maybe with smartwool ) ?.
The upper of the Bikila is constructed in such a way that it minimizes seams wherever possible .
For that matter , the only seams left are in the toes ( See also here ) , though the leftmost top and rightmost top seams have been eliminated , as has the swooping seam you get with the KSO ( where the mesh terminates ) — no swooping seam here !
In combination , the Bikila should drastically reduce the incidence of blistering from seams — time and testing will tell , of course , but what my feet tell me when wearing the Bikila me is this , “ This feels smooth and nice ! ”
And I ’ve come to trust the sensations of my feet !
Vibram really paid attention to styling and detail on the Bikila .
The slight shimmer you see on the toes is the upper TPU toe protection , which should help prevent the dreaded toe - snag - asphalt - scrape - instant - hole some have experienced with other Vibram models — like little toenails for your VFFs !
Also , the addition of an Achilles notch and front and back reflective material introduce standard running shoe features to Vibram Five Fingers .
One other difference on the Bikila is that ankle opening is larger , exposing a bit more of the top of your foot — for reference , note the openings in this comparative photo of the Flow , KSO , Trek , and Bikila .
This makes the Bikila easier to put on than the KSO and aesthetically makes the Bikila look more normal — per my biased eyes , that is , though my wife likes the look , too .
One more note on the entry - point shift : it does push the strap forward over the foot and since the Bikila is using what amounts to being a single piece of fabric covering most of the top of the foot , the upper is stretch - limited , a consideration for individuals with high insteps ( the top part of the foot ) .
If you ’re wondering if this is you , basically , if your KSOs feel particularly tight on top of the foot , you might find the Bikilas tight — perhaps tighter .
There also is no rear , heel strap with the Bikila .
In conjunction with the shifted ankle hole and top strap , my heel did feel less snug than in other models — almost too loose or free .
That said , the lack of rear pull on the heel did not bother me while running or sprinting ( I simply did n’t notice it ) and I ’m starting to think this may be a welcome change .
After all , why should my Achilles tendon be pushed on ?
As far as sizing goes , the Bikila sizes similarly to the KSO .
I ’m a 43 in both Bikila and KSO .
So what about that complex sole ?
Is n’t the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila getting away from being minimalist and getting closer to being that dreaded four letter word — “ shoe ? ”
Yes and no .
Between barefoot and shod - in - Nikes there is a lot of wiggle room .
Truthfully , how much shoe any person can tolerate is unique to the individual .
Will the stiffer ( as compared to the KSO , for example ) forefoot of the Bikila be “ too much ” shoe for your running form ?
I ca n’t answer that question .
What I can tell you is this : using skin - fold calipers at the middle of the forefoot of the Bikila yields a total thickness of 7 mm .
For the KSO that measurement reads 6 mm — 9 mm for the KSO Trek and 4 mm for the Classic ( Same as my “ Invisible Shoes ” or Huaraches ) .
Even the ultra- minimalist Moc is 2 mm at this point .
I point out these numbers to say that we are speaking in shades of grey and “ How much shoe can I tolerate and still run naturally ? ” is n’t a simple question .
If there ’s anything we should have learned from the emergence of the barefoot or minimalist running movement it ’s that human beings are complex , nuanced , and not one - size - fits all .
So the question for any would - be Bikila runner is if they ’ve dialed in their form enough to handle 7 mm of thickness in their forefoot .
I ’m guessing that many will find that extra millimeter ( over the KSO ) a welcome change .
Others may find it too much .
It ’s necessarily a case - by - case thing .
For me , in my short run in the Bikilas , my form felt light and comfortable .
And when I sprinted down the street I felt like I was flying ( A VFF experience not limited to the Bikilas , mind you ) !
I ’ve previously discussed that I had given up on running up until about a year ago , and even in VFFs I can experience some knee discomfort — my form being so bad that it ’s helpful for me to interject barefoot running into my training .
My typical run is only a couple miles at this point and my last run outside in the indoor - only Moc ( For testing purposes only ! )
I actually had to take them off after a mile when my knee started acting up — I ran the second barefoot .
I say this because in my single - and - only mile I ran in the Bikilas I felt fine — no knee irritation at all .
This is only one trial and not enough to draw conclusions , but it ’s encouraging , at least , that the extra 5 mm ( as compared to the Moc ) did n’t seem to negatively affect my form .
As far as the actual “ podding ” of the sole , what this means as far as design is concerned is that there is a thin , light - grey rubber base ( a measurement at the light - grey , non-podded part is only 5 mm thick ) that is interjected with the ovoid “ pods ” or “ platforms ” that are thicker .
This mixed - base - and - platform is a compromise between providing a protective base and maintaining the flexibility of the sole .
In testing toe flex in the Bikilas , upward flex ( pointing your toes skyward ) is on par with other Vibram models .
Downward flex , however , is less — even less than the KSO Trek , and it almost seems as though this was a specific design consideration — note how close together the two rows of black toe pods come at the big toe .
Left to speculate , I ’d say this is to prevent toes from bending under the shoe in the event they snag on the ground or other objects .
The white arch of the sole with the golf - ball - like divots is a separate piece from the rubber sole of the Bikila that is made of EVA polyurethane .
At least one or two initial testers described this as arch support ; however , per my assessment , the polyurethane arch is not much different than the Vibram rubber arch you get with standard soled Vibram Five Fingers and is similarly thick to KSO at the same point .
Since polyurethane is a foam material and most foam tends to lose it ’s strength over time , I ’m also wondering how this “ arch ” will break - in .
Time will tell .
Overall , the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila has a more engineered sole than tehe standard Vibram line .
Indeed , it was a bold move by Vibram to take a stab at improving something that many VFF fans already love — the flat , siped standard sole .
It will be interesting to discover how the podded design of the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila impacts ( or reduces impact ? ) longer runs .
And really , that goes for the entire design of the Bikila — it ’s untried at this point .
Rest assured that I ’ll be putting it through the ropes ( as a novice runner ) and as you experts put it to the test and tell me your experiences — positive , negative , neutral or whatever — we ’ll be documenting it all here on BirthdayShoes .
First impressions of the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila wrap - up
If first impressions are any indication , the Vibram Five Fingers Bikila is the most well - built , stylish , and daring model to be produced by Vibram yet .
I did n’t know what I ’d think of the Bikila , but I really , really like it so far .
For the time being I will be putting it through the ropes and can’t wait for it to hit the shelves and become widely available — though I just about guarantee it wo n’t hit them for long at $ 100 I think the Bikila is priced to perfection .
I think I have a new favorite pair of Vibram Five Fingers .
And when will that happen ?
It ’s just a guess , but hopefully the Bikila giveaway contest will end sometime in the next week or two ( Meaning the Bikila will be available at a local or online Five Fingers retailer ) .
Cross your toes !

Photo by MJCdetroitWhat stands out about Innospec ’s FCPA guilty plea yesterday is the hands - on role former top managers had in the criminal activity .
For nearly a decade they used bribery as just another sales tool , a manipulative and cynical revenue spinner , and did what they could to cover it up .
By 2000 , the company ’s flagship product , TEL , an additive used only in leaded gasoline , was in trouble .
The market was drying up after the U.S. and other countries ordered the switch to cleaner , healthier unleaded fuels .
But under their go - team bosses , Innospec ’s salesmen and agents began paying bribes to move TEL into mainly third - world markets .
The SEC ’s complaint said “ Innospec ’s former management did nothing to stop the bribery , and in fact authorized and encouraged it . ”
An email from a former agent in October 2005 to Innospec ’s then business director and another executive said Iraqi officials were demanding a 2 % kickback on sales .
The e-mail said : “ We are sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials .
Otherwise , our business will stop and we will lose the market .
We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get the rewards . ”
The Business Director authorized over $ 195,000 in bribes , and in an e-mail discussing the wording of the invoice , said : “ The fewer words the better ! ”
Innospec acted like a classic corrupter .
According to the SEC complaint , it paid lavish travel and entertainment expenses for Iraqi officials , including a seven day honeymoon .
It handed out mobile phone cards and cameras and paid thousands in cash for “ pocket money . ”
It even paid bribes to ensure the failure of a 2006 field test of MMT , a fuel product manufactured by a competitor .
In Indonesia , the bribes to push TEL sales came when the country was planning to go unleaded .
At government - linked BP Migas , Innospec paid “ special commissions ” to a Swiss account and a “ one off payment ” of $ 300,000 .
The greed was mutual .
The SEC said one Indonesian official indicated he would assist Innospec in landing TEL sales but he wanted more than just “ cents ” in return .
The case is far from over .
The DOJ said as part of its guilty plea , the company “ agreed to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice and other U.S. and foreign authorities in ongoing investigations of corrupt payments by Innospec employees and agents . ”

A nationwide Alfred Hitchcock retrospective featuring nine of the celebrated director 's rare silent films , made at the start of his career , will be staged in 2012 in a series of public screenings .
The often forgotten collection of silent features made by the young Hitchcock and seen by almost nobody for decades , are said to display the stylistic features , camera work and suspense - filled plots developed in his later Hollywood works .
In 2012 , the public will be able to see the footage for themselves .
The surviving silent films are expected to be aired as part of the Cultural Olympiad – the arts programme running alongside the Olympic Games – although this is yet to be officially confirmed .
Some will be screened at the British Film Institute ( BFI ) , while others may be set to live music by experimental modern bands on temporary stages and at musical festivals .
Objects relating to the films will also go on display .
Eddie Berg , artistic director of the BFI , said it was appropriate to stage a Hitchcock retrospective in the Olympic year , not least because the film - maker was born in Leytonstone , near the Olympic Park in east London .
" One of the things we are trying to get off the ground is to restore the silent films .
Most of the visual tropes in these titles appear in his later works .
We want to look at his influence on the contemporary world .
The season will look at his huge body of work and his influence in different ways , " said Mr Berg .
The silent titles will form the heart of the retrospective , but the exhibition may also include the music of the American composer Bernard Herrmann , who collaborated with Hitchcock on the scores for Psycho , North by Northwest , The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo .
A staging of Douglas Gordon 's 24 - Hour Psycho , a 1993 artwork featuring a slowed - down version of the horror film , will also feature .
Amanda Neville , director of the BFI , said the initiative would " resurrect the [ Hitchcock ] films that are not on the tips of everybody 's tongues " .
Some of the films need critical restoration work , she said , and " three of them cannot go through a film projector – the level of damage to them is phenomenal . "
Robin Baker , the BFI 's head curator , said he was keen to discover the whereabouts of Hitchcock 's silent movie The Mountain Eagle , which he called the " holy grail " of lost British films .
" It was made in 1926 and was his last silent film featuring a sexually vulnerable young woman and a case of miscarriage of justice , " he said .
Hitchcock began his career in Britain as a designer of film title cards before directing a dozen silent films , including The Lodger , in 1926 and which the BFI hopes to restore and screen .
His first " talkie " film Blackmail , released in 1929 , was shot as a silent feature and later converted to sound .
Early Signs : His Silent Gems
The Pleasure Garden ( 1925 )
Hitchcock 's debut as a director features elements that characterise his later work .
The plot focuses on the lives of two dancers , one who ascends to great heights and another who ends up in a marriage with a dangerous womaniser .
It also features Hitchcock 's handwritten signature in the opening credits .
The Lodger ( 1926 )
His third silent feature and first suspense thriller is about a mysterious lodger who might be a serial killer .
Visually , it was deemed highly imaginative for its time , most notably in a scene in which Hitchcock installed a glass floor so he could show the lodger pacing up and down his room from below .
The Farmer 's Wife ( 1927 )
For some reason , I ’ve always been quite picky when it comes to meat , so much so that I have two golden rules about meat :
1 . I have to be able to identify what animal it came from
2 . I have to be able to identify what part of the animal it came from
… which meant that in my younger years , late night visits to the local kebab van ( a popular eating destination after a night out drinking in Britain , usually around 2 - 3 am ) for me consisted of a bag of chips .
It ’s true ; I would rather eat raw lobster body meat from a crustacean that is sitting on a plate right in front of me with his antennae flexing , than a kebab ( I ’ll save that story for another time ) .
My pickiness somewhat extends to chicken .
I ’ve been known to eat the odd leg or wing now and then , but I am definitely a breast / white meat person .
For my British reader (s ) , the US distinguish different chicken cuts as white meat ( aka : the breast ) vs. dark meat ( aka : leg , wings , thigh etc ) .
My parents on the other hand disagree with me , of course .
They always told me that the breast is dry and flavorless and that the legs and wings are much more tasty cuts .
But this is coming from people who like to eat the bum and the feet .
Hmm …
Anyway , today I ventured outside of my comfort zone and tried chicken legs on the grill .
I ’ve never cooked anything other than the breast before , so this was a first for me .
For the Honey Mustard Marinade :
6 large chicken legs
1/2 cup honey
4 tbsp dijon mustard
4 tbsp wholegrain mustard
4 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and Pepper
The marinade smelled absolutely divine , so much so that I had to stop myself from just gulping it down the hatchet .
Instead , I was good and poured it over the chicken legs leaving it to marinade in the fridge for one hour .
After an hour I nervously fired up the grill to about 350 , and continued to baste the legs , until they looked like this …
They looked more or less done after 35 minutes , so I took them off the grill and @ TheSkivvy and I sat down for some serious munching .
It smelled absolutely delicious and the marinade had caramelized beautifully .
The honey mustard flavor was to die for , but what about the chicken ?
Now I know the chicken was cooked ( because my trusty Weber wand told me so , and because the meat was white and not pink ) , but there was something about the texture of the meat that was a bit odd .
Was it because I ’m more used to eating breast ?
Or maybe because when I do eat legs they have been cooked to hell , and as dry as the Sahara ?
To be honest , I ’m not exactly sure , but they seemed a little undercooked for my liking .
Plus I get REALLY paranoid when it comes to cooking chicken properly … food poisoning from chicken is the worst ( even more so than Flatulence Beans ) .
So not wanting to poison us again , I battled the leg off @ TheSkivvy ’s plate and put them back on the grill for another 10 minutes …
This time , much better .
So after my first chicken leg experience , the jury is still out on legs .
When I was eating , all that I could think about was how great this honey mustard marinade would taste on a nice breast , or chicken kabob .
Lessons Learned :
Breast is best
This honey mustard marinade should be made into a drink

A 10 - year - old Australian girl who survived being stung by the world 's most venomous creature , the deadly box jellyfish , may have rewritten medical history , an expert says .
Schoolgirl Rachael Shardlow lost consciousness after being badly stung by the jellyfish while swimming in a river in Queensland with her brother in December , but lived to tell the tale .
Raechel Shardlow ... survived multiple stings from a deadly box jellyfish .

" When I first saw the pictures of the injuries I just went : ' You know to be honest , this kid should not be alive , ' " said Jamie Seymour , professor of zoology and tropical ecology at James Cook University .
" I mean they are horrific .
Usually when you see people who have been stung by box jellyfish with that number of the tentacle contacts on their body , it 's usually in a morgue , " he told the ABC .
Trey Parker and Matt Stone laid the foundations for an animated empire with " The Spirit of Christmas " , an incredibly crude animated short they made with pieces of cut - out construction paper in 1995 .
Out of that came the Comedy Central show " South Park " , which debuted in 1997 and which is now the longest - running and highest - rated show in the history of Comedy Central .
Even more remarkable than the show 's ratings success has been its durability ; in 14 seasons , it 's never fallen off .
A huge part of the show 's success has always been the music .
Parker and Stone have written insane numbers of songs for " South Park " , and their songs almost always achieve three very difficult things :
They 're consistently crudely and absurdly funny , they 're almost always catchy enough to get stuck in your head , and they always move the plots of their episodes forward .
Pitchfork recently spoke with Stone about his favorite musical moments in the show 's history , as well as what it was like to work with Radiohead , Isaac Hayes , and Primus .
Pitchfork :
Do you know how many songs you 've written for the show over the years ?
Matt Stone :
We 've had musical stuff in the show forever .
That 's mostly because Trey 's a big musical fan , and he 's a great songwriter .
He 's been writing songs his whole life .
So since the beginning , we 've always put a lot of musical moments .
The movie [ South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut ] is a good example of taking it and making a whole musical .
Pitchfork :
What are some of your favorite songs from the course of the show ?
MS : [ Laughs ]
Man , that is hard .
There are so many .
One of my favorites we did recently was from last season .
Ido n't know if yousaw the pee in the water park episode , but " Not My Water Park " is so fucking great .
It has the perfect tone ; it 's kind of sarcastic but kind of not .
I think Trey writes that really well .
The best musical moments are when , like " Not My Water Park " , it really is n't just a joke of a song ; it really pushes the story forward .
That 's a deeply emotionally significant moment for Cartman , the death of his water park and all these minorities coming in .
So I like that one .
Man , I should 've looked beforehand .
I know there 's so many .
One I really like is at the end of Team America .
[ At ] the very end , if you watch the entire credits , we did a song called " You Are Worthless , Alec Baldwin " .
It 's sung by Kim Jong - Il , and it was this last - minute addition to the movie .
A lot of people do n't know about it because you have to stick to the end , but it 's this crazy song that fills you in on the entire backstory of Kim Jong - Il 's relationship with Alec Baldwin .
I think it 's pretty funny , and we recorded it at 4 a .m .
We might have been ... we were n't high on any illicit drugs , but it was like we were high on DayQuil and coffee and everything else we were taking to stay up .
But let 's get back to " South Park " .
Probably the best one from the early years , one good enough to be in a real musical , was " The Lonely Jew on Christmas " .
Trey can write songs you can't dismiss out of hand , [ and this ] was n't a spoof .
It was a real song about a real little kid , and it just had a great concept .
That was one of those early songs that pointed out to us that , " Oh , wow , there can actually be quality songs on this kind of show . "
It 's a really touching song , and I kind of know how it was because I was a Jewish boy growing up in Colorado [ laughs ] .
Pitchfork :
And if you had n't had that song , it would 've been tough to get that sentiment across at the beginning of the episode in a way that was n't trite .
MS : Having a character get driven to an emotional point where they have to open their mouths and actually sing something ... it kind of lands in a way that a film moment does n't .
That 's one of the things that I 've learned throughout this process , that I love to musicalize things .
You do employ a whole level of gravity .
You use the emotional heft of music .
We did an episode about this Mormon family that moves to town .
And through them telling the story of Joseph Smith and the first Mormons , we flash back , and the whole thing is musicalized , [ sings ]
" Joseph Smith he lived in New York / Dum dum dum dum dum ! "
And Trey actually sings , " dum dum dum dum dum . "
So the whole thing is telling the story , like [ sings ]
" He said God did speak to him now / Dum dum dum dum dum ! "
And you just sit there and go , " These stories from the beginning of the Mormon church are just dumb !
They 're just on their face dumb . "
And it 's not even saying that they 're not true or questioning the veracity of them ; they 're just not very good stories .
There 's one part at the end [ when Lucy Harris ] decides to pull one on Joseph Smith .
This is what the Mormons say happened :
He comes home with the plates he said God gave him -- he looked at these shitty plates and translated them into something .
And [ Harris ] said , " If these are really from God " -- she takes his translation and hides it , and she said -- " You should be able to translate it word for word again . "
And so then it goes , [ sings ]
" Lucy Harris , she hid them from him / Smart smart smart smart smart ! "
It goes on this whole other trip where she 's smart and he 's dumb .
You could n't do it any other way than with music .
Pitchfork :
You got Primus to do the show 's theme song , and that 's probably by far the most - heard song they 've ever done now .
How did you decide to give it to them ?
It made Primus ' song the sort of equivalent of the Danny Elfman " Simpsons " theme .
MS : It was n't that well thought out .
We got the pilot , I was probably 25 years old , and I was a humongous Primus fan in college .
I went to see them every time they went to Colorado and thought they were great .
We literally got a copy of Frizzle Fry or one of their albums , opened it up , looked in the back , and saw " David Lefkowitz Management . "
We looked up David Lefkowitz Management in the San Francisco Yellow Pages , because we knew they were Bay Area .
We got a number and an address and typed out a letter on a typewriter , and put it in a white envelope .
We sent " The Spirit of Christmas " , the original tape we did , with it .
And we said , " We 're doing a pilot for Comedy Central , and we 'd love for you to do the song . "
Two or three weeks later , I get this call .
We 're in the office , cutting out our stupid little construction paper and trying to do the show , and I get this call .
It was like , " Matt , Les Claypool 's on line one . "
He was my hero at the time .
I was so into the guy .
And he was on the phone like , " What are you guys looking for ?
What do you guys need ? "
He was looking for some direction , and my direction was idiotic .
It was like , " Oh just do whatever you want to do , do whatever you want to do .
It 's a small town in Colorado . "
That 's about how much I gave him .
And he came back with that song .
It 's great .
It 's such a perfect encapsulation of " South Park " .
Pitchfork :
Along the same lines , things eventually fell apart between you , but you got Isaac Hayes to play a huge role on the show early on .
And you not only got him , but you got him to lampoon this persona that he'd been building up for decades .
MS : He was game !
He was game right off the bat .
Look , Isaac had been through the real shit -- racial stuff [ in ] the 1960s , the Black Power movement , Stax Records .
That character just does n't fit in a white Colorado town , and we were having fun with that .
He was never offended by anything we ever did in the slightest until we did the thing about Scientology .
The first time we met him , we were more nervous than he was .
We were going to tell him what we wanted him to do .
That first conversation : " OK , the only black guy in this town " [ laughs ] .
And he was like [ Isaac Hayes voice ] " OK , that sounds good . "
" And you 'll sing soul songs . "
And he was like [ Isaac Hayes voice ] " OK . "
He thought it was funny .
We always got along .
Even after we did the Scientology thing , he came over and asked us to take it off the air , and we had this very direct but not uncivil conversation about it .
We always got along fine .
We always had a good time .
I feel like maybe one day we would 've been able to make amends , but then unfortunately he died .
Pitchfork :
And you kind of gave him a late career lift .
He had a hit with " Chocolate Salty Balls " .
MS : That went to # 1 in England .
I think he appreciated that , too .
Honestly , when we first approached him to do the show , I do n't think he was in the best financial shape .
The first time we got him to do the voice , I think he did it for the cash , to tell you the truth .
But I think he got into it after a while .
That first time he showed up , he was doing it well .
Did n't he lose all of his publishing rights ?
He was one of those dudes who bought houses and cars , went broke , and then had to climb his way back .
Pitchfork : You had Radiohead guest star on " Scott Tenorman Must Die " .
What was it like , first off , to wrangle them onto the show ?
They were this mysterious band that never did anything that they did n't feel like doing .
MS : I do n't know how we did that .
I can't remember .
I think I met a couple of them at a party , and we just started talking and hanging out .
The idea just came up , and we said , " Yeah , let 's do the show . "
I mean , what 's great is that they were in one of the most notorious episodes .
It was one of our better episodes .
I hope they like the show .
What 's funny is they 're not really even the point of the episode .
If you 're working with a band and you really want to work them into the episode , you 've got to say to them , " Look , we need you around every day and on Tuesday night all night because we need you to do voices as we 're changing stuff . "
We do the show so quickly , and you just can't get bands to do that .
It 's not really fair .
So we worked them in at a point where you can make it so they 're in the show but not where you have to produce the show around them .
We recorded them in Santa Barbara .
They were on tour , and I drove up to Santa Barbara to direct them .
Again , in this adventure of making " South Park " , there 's these moments , and one was telling Isaac , " You 're the only black guy in this white town . "
Trey made me do it , and Trey went to the bathroom conspicuously at that point because he did n't want to be in the room when I told him this .
Then the other one was when I drove up to Santa Barbara to direct Radiohead .
Voice - acting in animation , you know , you can't just talk normally .
Even the way we 're talking now , everything has to be kind of exaggerated .
It just does n't work to talk normally .
There 's been a few cartoons that try it , and it just does n't work .
Pitchfork : Like " Dr. Katz " ?
MS : With " Dr. Katz " , that was the whole concept behind it , so maybe it worked a little better in that .
But even in something like " King of the Hill " , where it seems more normal , they really are kind of over - emoting and overacting .
And I remember having to sit there while Thom Yorke 's in a booth .
I 'm like , " OK , say this line , " and he starts to talk .
And I kind of had to say , " No , man , you need to , like , really emote . "
It 's such a funny line to give some guy who 's such a brilliant singer and who 's so brilliant at emoting perfectly , exactly , in such a complex and beautiful way .
I 'm just trying to get him to do this dumb line , and I have to say , " Hey man , you 've got to put some feeling into it ! "
Pitchfork : Did they know , at the time , what exactly was going on in that episode ?
Did they know the kid in the episode was eating his parents ?
MS : Probably not .
I do n't think so .
I do n't think we 'd come up with that yet .
We did n't not tell them ; we told them everything .
We just were n't done with the episode .
Pitchfork : Did you ever hear back from them after they saw it ?
MS : Oh yeah , I talked to them after .
They liked it .
Pitchfork :
You 've done a few shows where music is the central part of the plotline .
The one I think the most interesting and the funniest was the Moop episode , where Cartman becomes a Christian rock star .
It also becomes about music downloading and how that debate was taking over conversations around music at the time .
And you practically came out and said , " No , you guys are being greedy .
Be happy that people want to hear your songs . "
Is that still how you feel about it ?
MS : It 's a really complicated issue .
In " South Park " , for one thing , we 've got to be funny .
So it 's not like we 're being prescriptive , like " Hey , this is the way it should work . "
We have to be funny , and we 're working at the emotions behind the stuff .
Yeah , the funny scene of them going , " Look , Britney Spears only has one jet " -- it 's like you 're making fun of rich people suffering from downloading .
But on the other hand , it 's not just the rich celebrities who are hurt .
There 's a full industry , all sorts of people , affected by downloading .
And eventually there will be new business models and new kinds of ways to make money , but no one wants to be Lars Ulrich again .
No celebrity or rock star , anybody , wants to come out again and take the beating that that guy took , because he sounded very selfish .
But I think an underlying point he was trying to make -- or maybe he was just being selfish -- but there is an entire industry of people .
That 's what you see with , for instance , the WGA strike in film and TV .
That was all about the Internet money .
Pitchfork :
You also skewered that .
MS : We skewered that , too , but that internet money is going to be there someday .
There 's new business architecture , and the music industry 's actually gotten decimated .
But in a way , it 's kind of starting over .
There are new institutions and new magazines that are going to take over the old ones .
There 'll be a transitional period .
But I do n't think people should n't care about how to make money off of music .
You have to not be so tone - deaf when you talk about it .
You have to keep it in perspective .
For us , as artists , we always like when people see our stuff .
But at the same time , I 've got a house payment and a car payment and so does everybody who works for me at " South Park " .
There has to be a way to make money off of it .
I feel like the Internet trolls , the Internet goblins , all these people demand -- like it's a civil right -- that they be able to get everything for free without watching any ads .
It 's like , " OK dude , you might be able to do that with your favorite show now .
But you wo n't have any favorite shows in five years . "
The person who does that and thinks they should be able to download everything they want for free with no ads without any repercussions are being as unreasonable and tone - deaf as Lars Ulrich .
Pitchfork : Lars Ulrich just made himself a huge target , too .
He was almost daring you to make that episode .
MS : He really went out .
Conceptually , there 's a conversation there , though .
It 's not an open - and - shut case , but you have to know what you sound like when you 're saying that stuff .
Some basketball star-- Latrell Sprewell , I think -- they offered him $ 30 million .
And literally , without trying to be funny , he said , " $ 30 million ?
But I have to try and feed my kids . "
You know , it was one of those quotes .
It 's like , " OK dude , you 've got to know what the fuck is going on when you talk about this stuff . "
Pitchfork : You also did the Kanye episode .
MS : The Kanye episode has a great song in it !
The end song , the " Gay Fish " one !
Pitchfork :
That 's a really great parody of what Kanye was doing musically at that moment .
MS : [ laughs ]
That 's funny .
Trey kind of had to learn how to sing in Auto - Tune .
The thing is that Trey is actually a pretty good singer and can hold a tune .
If you do that , it does n't do quite what you want it to do with those step - ups where it jumps from note to note robotically .
Sometimes it can be pretty cool - sounding , but if you 're actually a good singer , you can't get it to do that .
So Trey had to learn how to sing kind of shitty to make it sound right [ laughs ] .
I love that song .
It 's so funny .
And it does really sound like stuff that Kanye would do .
It sounds pretty authentic .
Pitchfork : Did you see Kanye 's response on his blog after the episode aired ?
MS : Yeah , I did .
[ laughs ]
His all - caps response ?
That was the last thing we expected .
These days , we rip on people on " South Park " , and they send us letters of thanks .
And Kanye 's like , " Yeah , I 've got to work on myself and be a better person . "
It 's such a weird reaction people are having lately .
Maybe it 's like we 're losing our sting , but maybe people have realized that you should just say , " Yeah , yeah , you 're right , " and move on .
Pitchfork : I think it 's because you 're an institution at this point .
You 're kind of untouchable .
If somebody 's going to bitch about how they come across on " South Park " , they 're just going to seem ridiculous .
And a lot of the time , the things you 're lampooning about these people are pretty clear - cut .
MS : Right .
I mean we 're like , " Kanye , you are humorless .
You do need to grow a sense of humor . "
Yeah , so that was not what we expected to have happen , to have him thank us . [ laughs ]
I thought we were going to need a bodyguard , you know ?
Pitchfork :
In one interview , you said you thought that was the moment where you would start getting death threats .
MS : Yeah .
I mean , I do n't think about that stuff that much .
But I was like , " Oh dude , these hip - hop guys , they do n't like to fuck around .
Especially with homophobia . "
I think Kanye 's actually been on the right side of that .
He 's been pretty open - minded about gay stuff .
But hip - hop 's not super gay friendly in general .
So the idea that you 'd call a guy a gay fish and he'd be like , " Thank you " -- it 's pretty weird .
Pitchfork :
The only time you guys have done an episode with a billion guest stars was " Chef Aid " .
Did you achieve what you were going for there ?
Did you really want to do the " Simpsons " thing where you would try to get as many famous people as possible ?
MS : I do n't know .
I can't remember the thought process behind it -- that was so long ago .
A little bit was to launch the album , to come up with a concept .
Because we did The South Park Album and everyone wanted to be on The South Park Album , but we wanted to do more as just a Chef album .
But of course it was n't going to sell any records ; people wanted to hear Kid Rock and Ozzy and Puffy and shit .
Again , this sounds like kind of ancient history because that 's the way the record industry was in 1998 .
We were getting a lot of pressure , " Dude , South Park Album .
' South Park ' is big ; you 've got to do the big thing . "
I think the " Chef Aid " episode came from us trying to come up with a concept that at least would look like we had a greater thought process behind having a lot of stars on the record .
We came up with the concept of a Chef Aid , to help him and his taxes or whatever .
Pitchfork :
Who was your favorite person to work with for that episode ?
MS : We watched Elton John record , which was a total dream for Trey because he grew up and learned to play piano listening to Elton John .
That was amazing .
We worked with Ween , with Primus , all these great bands .
The one I completely remember being blown away with was Perry Farrell , who came in and did " Hot Lava " .
Perry , I live in the same part of L.A. as he does , and we'd met a few times .
So I 'd actually known him enough to say hi .
And I went over and asked him if he wanted to be on the album , and he said , " Yeah , I 'll do it . "
But he did n't know what song it was ; he had no idea what he was doing when he showed up to the studio .
" So you 're going to sing ' Hot Lava ' .
We want you to sing it . "
Trey had sung a scratch track : " Well , it 's kind of like this , and here are the lyrics . "
We had the lyrics printed out .
Perry listened to it a couple of times .
And you know that stereotype ; you 're thinking , " Oh , he 's going to be fucked up .
We 'll have to do a hundred takes , and he 'll make us put it together on Pro-Tools . "
That was what I thought was going to happen , and Perry is really nice and soft - spoken and cool and stuff .
And then he gets into the booth , and then he just unleashes , like fucking ...
You should listen to the tapes .
He did two takes .
I think we only recorded the second take .
The first take was great , we were just like , " Let 's just get another one , just because you 're here . "
And he belted out another take , and then we just mixed those two takes together , in and out of each other a couple times .
Watching somebody just instantly , completely inhabit the song -- I do n't know how else to say it .
It was really stunning .
It was really an amazing moment .
It 's not the best song in the world .
We wrote it ; it was based on a stupid fucking song on " South Park " .
But the performance itself and how quickly he did it -- I was blown away .
Goddamn , that guy is really fucking talented .
Just the emotion of going from nothing , just sitting in a studio at 3 p.m. in the Valley , to just full - bore , instantly -- he just fucking did it .
Pitchfork : Every once in a while you have Cartman singing actual popular songs .
I do n't know how that 's still funny after however many years it 's been since he did " O Holy Night " , but it 's still funny every single time .
MS : With the Lady Gaga thing , you mean ?
Pitchfork : Yeah .
MS : Cartman is just a great character .
You bring a lot of that emotional baggage about him to the song .
And frankly , Trey 's a fucking great singer and performer himself , and he 's really great when he 's disguising himself as a character because he 's not as vulnerable as a personal singer .
And I do n't know .
We had to hear him do Lady Gaga .
Pitchfork :
When a new song comes on the radio , do you imagine how it would sound if Cartman sang it ?
MS : No , really not very often .
That was kind of a one - off .
It 's always weird songs like " Come Sail Away " or " O Holy Night " .
But I think we could pretty much just do a Cartman song every couple of months , and I would like to listen to it .

Limited Liability Investing
The Crisis in Europe
Financial panics are an integral part of capitalism .
So are economic recessions .
The system generates them and it becomes stronger because of them .
Like forest fires , they are painful when they occur , yet without them , the forest could not survive .
They impose discipline , punishing the reckless , rewarding the cautious .
They do so imperfectly , of course , as at times the reckless are rewarded and the cautious penalized .
Political crises — as opposed to normal financial panics — emerge when the reckless appear to be the beneficiaries of the crisis they have caused , while the rest of society bears the burdens of their recklessness .
At that point , the crisis ceases to be financial or economic .
It becomes political .
The financial and economic systems are subsystems of the broader political system .
More precisely , think of nations as consisting of three basic systems : political , economic and military .
Each of these systems has elites that manage it .
The three systems are constantly interacting — and in a healthy polity , balancing each other , compensating for failures in one as well as taking advantage of success .
Every nation has a different configuration within and between these systems .
The relative weight of each system differs , as does the importance of its elites .
But each nation contains these systems , and no system exists without the other two .
Consider the capitalist economic system .
The concept of the corporation provides its modern foundation .
The corporation is built around the idea of limited liability for investors , the notion that if you buy part or all of a company , you yourself are not liable for its debts or the harm that it might do ; your risk is limited to your investment .
In other words , you may own all or part of a company , but you are not responsible for what it does beyond your investment .
Whereas supply and demand exist in all times and places , the notion of limited liability investing is unique to modern capitalism and reshapes the dynamic of supply and demand .
It is also a political invention and not an economic one .
The decision to create corporations that limit liability flows from political decisions implemented through the legal subsystem of politics .
The corporation dominates even in China ; though the rules of liability and the definition of control vary , the principle that the state and politics define the structure of corporate risk remains constant .
In a more natural organization of the marketplace , the owners are entirely responsible for the debts and liabilities of the entity they own .
That , of course , would create excessive risk , suppressing economic activity .
So the political system over time has reallocated risk away from the owners of companies to the companies ' creditors and customers by allowing corporations to become bankrupt without pulling in the owners .
The precise distribution of risk within an economic system is a political matter expressed through the law ; it differs from nation to nation and over time .
But contrary to the idea that there is a tension between the political and economic systems , the modern economic system is unthinkable except for the eccentric but indispensible political - legal contrivance of the limited liability corporation .
In the precise and complex allocation of risk and immunity , we find the origins of the modern market .
Among other reasons , this is why classical economists never spoke of " economics " but always of " political economy . "
The state both invents the principle of the corporation and defines the conditions in which the corporation is able to arise .
The state defines the structure of risk and liabilities and assures that the laws are enforced .
Emerging out of this complexity — and justifying it — is a moral regime .
Protection from liability comes with a burden :
Poor decisions will be penalized by losses , while wise decisions are rewarded by greater wealth .
Because of this , society as a whole will benefit .
The entire scheme is designed to increase , in Adam Smith 's words , " The Wealth of Nations " by limiting liability , increasing the willingness to take risk and imposing penalties for poor judgment and rewards for wise judgment .
But the measure of the system is not whether individuals benefit , but whether in benefiting they enhance the wealth of the nation .
The greatest systemic risk , therefore , is not an economic concept but a political one .
Systemic risk emerges when it appears that the political and legal protections given to economic actors , and particularly to members of the economic elite , have been used to subvert the intent of the system .
In other words , the crisis occurs when it appears that the economic elite used the law 's allocation of risk to enrich themselves in ways that undermined the wealth of the nation .
Put another way , the crisis occurs when it appears that the financial elite used the politico - legal structure to enrich themselves through systematically imprudent behavior while those engaged in prudent behavior were harmed , with the political elite apparently taking no action to protect the victims .
In the modern public corporation , shareholders — the corporation 's owners — rarely control management .
A board of directors technically oversees management on behalf of the shareholders .
In the crisis of 2008 , we saw behavior that devastated shareholder value while appearing to enrich the management — the corporation 's employees .
In this case , the protections given to shareholders of corporations were turned against them when they were forced to pay for the imprudence of their employees — the managers , whose interests did not align with those of the shareholders .
The managers in many cases profited personally through their compensation system for actions inimical to shareholder interests .
We now have a political , not an economic , crisis for two reasons .
First , the crisis qualitatively has moved beyond the boundaries of a cyclical event .
Second , the crisis is rooted in the political - legal definitions of the distribution of corporate risk and the legally defined relations between management and shareholder .
In leaving the shareholder liable for actions by management , but without giving shareholders controls to limit managerial risk taking , the problem lies not with the market but with the political system that invented and presides over the limited liability corporation .
Financial panics that appear natural and harm the financial elite do not necessarily create political crises .
Financial panics that appear to be the result of deliberate manipulation of the allocation of risk under the law , and from which the financial elite as a whole appears to have profited even while shareholders and the public were harmed , inevitably create political crises .
In the case of 2008 and the events that followed , we have a paradox .
The 2008 crisis was not unprecedented , nor was the federal bailout .
We saw similar things in the municipal bond crisis of the 1970s , and the Third World Debt Crisis and Savings and Loan Crisis in the 1980s .
Nor was the recession that followed anomalous .
It came seven years after the previous one , and compared to the 1970s and early 1980s , when unemployment stood at more than 10 percent and inflation and mortgages were at more than 20 percent , the new one was painful but well within the bounds of expected behavior .
The crisis was rooted in the appearance that it was triggered by the behavior not of small town banks or third world countries , but of the global financial elite , who took advantage of the complexities of law to enrich themselves instead of the shareholders and clients to whom it was thought they had prior fiduciary responsibility .
This is a political crisis then , not an economic one .
The political elite is responsible for the corporate elite in a unique fashion :
The corporation was a political invention , so by definition , its behavior depends on the political system .
But in a deeper sense , the crisis is one of both political and corporate elites , and the perception that by omission or commission they acted together — knowingly engineering the outcome .
In a sense , it does not matter whether this is what happened .
That it is widely believed that this is what happened alone is the origin of the crisis .
This generates a political crisis that in turn is translated into an attack on the economic system .
The public , which is cynical about such things , expects elites to work to benefit themselves .
But at the same time , there are limits to the behavior the public will tolerate .
That limit might be defined , with Adam Smith in mind , as the point when the wealth of the nation itself is endangered , i.e. , when the system is generating outcomes that harm the nation .
In extreme form , these crises can delegitimize regimes .
In the most extreme form — and we are nowhere near this point — the military elite typically steps in to take control of the system .
This is not something that is confined to the United States by any means , although part of this analysis is designed to explain why the Obama administration must go after Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers and others .
The symbol of Goldman Sachs profiting from actions that devastate national wealth , or of the management of Lehman wiping out shareholder value while they themselves did well , creates a crisis of confidence in the political and financial systems .
With the crisis of legitimacy still not settling down after nearly two years , the reaction of the political system is predictable .
It will both anoint symbolic miscreants , and redefine the structure of risk and liability in financial corporations .
The goal is not so much to achieve something as to create the impression that it is achieving something , in other words , to demonstrate that the political system is prepared to control the entities it created .
We see a similar crisis in Europe .
The financial institutions in Europe were fully complicit in the global financial crisis .
They bought and sold derivatives whose value they knew to be other than stated , the same as Americans .
Though the European financial institutions have asserted they were the hapless victims of unscrupulous American firms , the Europeans were as sophisticated as their American counterparts .
Their elites knew what they were doing .
Complicating the European position was the creation of the economic union and the euro by the economic and political elite .
There has always been a great deal of ambiguity concerning the powers and authority of the European Union , but its intentions were always clear : to harmonize Europe and to create European - wide solutions to economic problems .
This goal always created unease in Europe .
There were those who were concerned that a united Europe would exist to benefit the elites , rather than the broader public .
There were also those who believed it was designed to benefit the Franco - German core of Europe rather than Europe as a whole .
Overall , this reflected minority sentiment , but it was a substantial minority .
The financial crisis came at Europe in three phases .
The first was part of the American subprime crisis .
The second wave was a uniquely European crisis .
European banks had taken massive positions in the Eastern European banking systems .
For example , the Czech system was almost entirely foreign ( Austrian and Italian ) owned .
These banks began lending to Eastern European homebuyers , with mortgages denominated in euros , Swiss francs or yen rather than in the currencies of the countries involved ( none yet included in the eurozone ) .
Doing this allowed banks to reduce interest rates , as the risk of currency fluctuation was pushed over to the borrower .
But when the zlotys and forints began to plunge , these monthly mortgage payments began to soar , as did defaults .
The European core , led by Germany , refused a European bailout of the borrowers or lenders even though the lenders who created this crisis were based in eurozone countries .
Instead , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) was called in to use funds that included American and Chinese , as well as European , money to solve the problem .
This raised the political question in Eastern Europe as to what it meant to be part of the European Union .
The third wave is represented by crisis in sovereign debt in countries that are part of the eurozone but not in the core of Europe — Greece , of course , but also Portugal and possibly Spain .
In the Greek case , the Germans in particular hesitated to intervene until it could draw the IMF — and non-European money and guarantees — into the mix .
This obviously raised questions in the periphery about what membership in the eurozone meant , just as it created questions in Eastern Europe about what EU membership meant .
But a much deeper crisis of legitimacy arose .
In Germany , elite sentiment accepted that some sort of intervention in Greece was inevitable .
Public sentiment overwhelmingly opposed intervention , however .
The political elite moved into tension with the financial elite under public pressure .
In Greece , a similar crisis emerged between an elite that accepted that foreign discipline would have to be introduced and a public that saw this discipline as a betrayal of its interests and national sovereignty .
Europe thus has a double crisis .
As in the United States , there is a crisis between the financial and political systems .
This crisis is not as intense as in the United States because of a deeper tradition of integration between the two systems in Europe .
But the tension between masses and elites is every bit as intense .
The second part of the crisis is the crisis of the European Union and growing sense that the European Union is the problem and not the solution .
As in the United States , there is a growing movement to distrust not only national arrangements but also multinational arrangements .
The United States and Europe are far from the only areas of the world facing crises of legitimacy .
In China , for example , the growing suppression of all dissent derives from serious questions as to whom the financial expansion of the past 30 years benefits , and who will pay for the downturns .
It is also interesting to note that Russia is suffering much less from this crisis , having lived through its own crisis before .
The global crisis of legitimacy has many aspects worth considering at some point .
But for now , the important thing is to understand that both Europe and the United States are facing fundamental challenges to the legitimacy of , if not the regime , then at least the manner in which the regime has handled itself .
The geopolitical significance of this crisis is obvious .
If the Americans and Europeans both enter a period in which managing the internal balance becomes more pressing than managing the global balance , then other powers will have enhanced windows of opportunities to redefine their regional balances .
In the United States , we see a predictable process .
With the unease over elites intensifying , the political elite is trying to stabilize the situation by attacking the financial elite .
It is doing this to both demonstrate that the political elite is distinct from the financial elite and to impose the consequences on the financial elite that the impersonal system was unable to do .
There is precedent for this , and it will likely achieve its desired end : greater control over the financial system by the state and an acceptable moral tale for the public .
The European process is much less clear .
The lack of clarity comes from the fact that this is a test for the European Union .
This is not simply a crisis within national elites , but within the multinational elite that created the European Union .
If this leads to the de-legitimization of the EU , then we are really in uncharted territory .
But the most important point is that almost two years since a normal financial panic , the polity has still not managed to absorb the consequences of that event .
The politically contrived corporation , and particularly the financial corporations , stands accused of undermining the wealth of nations .
As Adam Smith understood , markets are not natural entities but the result of political decisions , as is the political system that creates the allocation of risk that allows markets to function .
When that system appears to fail , the consequences go far beyond the particular financials of that event .
They have political consequences and , in due course , geopolitical consequences .

Advertisement Europe 's next space truck is nearly ready to be shipped to its launch site .
Dubbed " Johannes Kepler " after the famous German scientist , the vehicle is expected to fly to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in November .
It will take more than six tonnes of fuel , air , food and equipment to the orbiting outpost , acting as a temporary store room on the back of the platform .
The unmanned spacecraft will also use its thrusters to push the ISS higher into the sky .
The freighter - also known by its generic name of Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) - will be the second such craft sent to the ISS .
The first , " Jules Verne " , had a near - flawless flight to the station in 2008 .
ATV - EUROPE'S SPACE TRUCK
The robotic ship provides critical logistics support to the ISS , especially post - shuttle
It will have the biggest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the space station ATV will push the ISS higher into the sky once the shuttle 's height limitations no longer matter
It is the only vehicle on the current timeline able to de-orbit the ISS when it is retired The European Space Agency ( Esa ) trucks are now coming off the end of what could be described as a production line at prime contractor EADS Astrium 's Bremen facility in Germany .
ATV - 3 is already part built , and as soon as Johannes Kepler goes out the door in May , integration of ATV - 4 will begin .
" I 'm not sure Henry Ford was talking about the same cadence as we have it here because we are delivering [ just ] one ATV per year , but considering the huge dimension of the vehicle , it 's a production line , yes , " observed Michael Menking , Astrium 's head of orbital systems and space exploration .
The freighter is part of the barter arrangement Esa has with its international partners on the ISS project .
Instead of handing over cash to cover station running costs , Europe has taken on the major responsibility of resupplying the platform ; and in return it gets residency rights for its astronauts .
Five freighters have already been ordered to fulfil the commitment through 2013 ; and with the ISS now expected to fly until at least 2020 , discussions will soon begin on procuring ATV - 6 and ATV - 7 .
And there could be even more to follow if space station operations are extended deep into the 2020s .
What is for sure is that at least one additional ATV will have to be built just to de-orbit the space station at the end of its life .
Only the European freighter has the fuel capacity , combined with the propulsive might , to carry out such a task .
In two parts : Solar panels and thermals blankets are yet to be attached
Johannes Kepler currently stands into two parts at Bremen - one end contains its propulsion and avionics units ; the other end is the pressurised module which will hold the cargo .
The two sections will only be joined once they are at the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana prior to their attachment to an Ariane 5 rocket .
Engineers and mission managers are working to a timeline that would see a launch in perhaps late November with a docking at the ISS in mid-December .
The astronauts will certainly be very pleased to see another ATV visit .
The additional room in 2008 proved very popular , not least because its position on the end of the station made it a very quiet place .
" I believe it 's true that two Russian crewmembers slept in the ATV , however it 's not qualified for that , " observed Nico Dettmann , Esa 's ATV - 2 mission manager .
One of the major aspects for the future is to see how far we can advance the capabilities of ATV
Michael Menking , EADS Astrium Please turn on JavaScript .

" In order to have a real sleeping module , you have to fulfil certain requirements on radiation and those radiation requirements are different for a module that you spontaneously just ingress and egress to load and unload cargo . "
Making the modifications to give the ship added radiation protection has not been carried out on Johannes Kepler .
Indeed , very few changes have been made to the vessel , such was the smoothness of Jules Verne 's mission .
The board which reviewed ATV - 1 made some 130 recommendations , of which about 30 were picked up for implementation .
A number affected the spacecraft , others related to the operation of its ground control segment .
There were only two significant hardware issues on the ATV 's maiden voyage .
One , early in the flight , saw the vehicle 's propulsion system switch to a back - up chain when anomalous pressure readings were detected in the complex network of pipes and valves that feed the engines .
The other saw segments of thermal blanket on the exterior of the craft lift away from their Velcro fittings .
Both issues have been addressed and neither event is expected to repeat itself .
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission flew lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters Development cost : 1.1 bn euros ; Mission cost : 400- 450 m euros
Esa wants Johannes Kepler to be viewed as part of a " reliable recurring service " .
This means the ship 's voyage to the ISS will be much shorter this time .
" For Johannes Kepler , the mission profile will be very different , " explained Olivier de la Bourdonnaye , Astrium 's ATV programme manager .
" For ATV Jules Verne , it was a kind of qualification flight , which meant that before docking ATV had to demonstrate in flight its capabilities .
There were a series of ' demo days ' .
For Johannes Kepler , nothing like that will occur .
We will join the vicinity of the station and then dock directly . "
The robotic truck 's sophisticated capabilities - it can find its own way to the ISS and attach itself without any human intervention - have prompted Europe to consider upgrading the freighter into an astronaut crew ship .

Esa has asked Astrium to scope out the design of a return capsule that could be fitted to the ATV 's propulsion and avionics section instead of the present pressurised unit .
It is envisaged this Advanced Return Vehicle ( ARV ) would be used in the first instance to bring just cargo safely back to Earth from the ISS .
However , the capsule would be developed in such a way that life support systems for astronauts could be incorporated at a later stage if European member - states decided to pursue the option .
" One of the major aspects for the future is to see how far we can advance the capabilities of ATV .
Currently , it is filled full of waste and then burnt up through re-entry .
To bring cargo back to Earth , it has to have a capsule , " said Dr Menking .
To go to the next level would be a big step for Europe .
" The ability to transport crew is first , let 's say , a political decision , " the Astrium boss observed .
ATV could be fitted eventually with a return capsule

At long last , the feds have said the needs of pedestrians and cyclists must be placed alongside , not behind , those of motorists .
In what amounts to a sea change for the Department of Transportation , the automobile will no longer be the prime consideration in federal transportation planning .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says the needs of pedestrians and cyclists will be considered along with those of motorists , and he makes it clear that walking and riding are " an important component for livable communities . "
" People across America who value bicycling should have a voice when it comes to transportation planning , " LaHood wrote on his blog .
" This is the end of favoring motorized transportation at the expense of non-motorized . ”
He goes on :
We are integrating the needs of bicyclists in federally - funded road projects .
We are discouraging transportation investments that negatively affect cyclists and pedestrians .
And we are encouraging investments that go beyond the minimum requirements and provide facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians of all ages and abilities .
LaHood 's announcement came on the heels of his appearance at the National Bike Summit , where he was greeted like a rock star and told the crowd , " Our mission is the same as your mission , " and " I think we 're beginning to put our money where our mouth is on these issues . "
And how .
The new policy falls in line with changes the Obama Administration has enacted in the past year .
In June , the Department of Transportation , the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency announced the Interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities .
The partnership will coordinate polices to " help improve access to affordable housing , more transportation options , and lower transportation costs while protecting the environment in communities nationwide . "
LaHood 's announcement is a step toward that goal .
What his policy statement effectively says is multimodal transportation ( meaning pedestrians and cyclists ) will be an " equal " part of all new infrastructure projects getting funding from Washington .
" Walking and bicycling foster safer , more livable , family - friendly communities ; promote physical activity and health ; and reduce vehicle emissions and fuel use , " reads the introduction to the policy statement .
" Legislation and regulations exist that require inclusion of bicycle and pedestrian policies and projects into transportation plans and project development .
Accordingly , transportation agencies should plan , fund , and implement improvements to their walking and bicycling networks , including linkages to transit . "
Does this mean every new project will have to consider bicycles and pedestrians as equals to automobiles ?
Not exactly .
States and local governments can , of course , create infrastructure outside the policy if they are n't using federal funds .
That said , when it comes to doling out federal transportation funds , projects that adhere to the new policy statement will be given a higher priority , so it is within the best interests of cities and states to adhere to it .
With a new transportation bill looming that could reach a half trillion dollars , anyone wanting a piece of the pie will have to take pedestrians and cyclists into account .
Call it a carrot - and - stick approach .
This does n't mean you ''ll see bike lanes on that new expressway through town .
The feds are still going to bankroll conventional roads and highways and so forth .
But you 'll see bicycle connection points to these roads , such as trails and shared use pathways to create multimodal transportation .
Beyond making it easier for cyclists and pedestrians to get around , the move is intended to make it safer for them to get around .
A report released late last year by Transportation for America and the Surface Transportation Policy Partnership found more than 43,000 pedestrians nationwide have died since 2000 on roads the authors complain do n’t provide adequate crosswalks and other safety features .
The authors say states are n't spending enough to make roads safer for people who are on foot , on a bike or in a wheelchair .
" This is an issue that has been ignored far too long , even as thousands have died or been injured unnecessarily just by doing something as simple as trying to cross the street , " James Corless , director of Transportation for America , said in the T4A blog .
" We thank Secretary Lahood for his leadership at DOT and for elevating this urgent issue to the level of prominence that it deserves . "
To that end , the Department of Transportation establishes general recommended actions local governments and transportation agencies should follow to create transportation parity for pedestrians and cyclists .
What 's more , the projects must be accessible to all , and they must plan for future growth and demand .
" It is more effective to plan for increased usage than to retrofit an older facility , " the policy states .
Some of LaHood 's specific recommendations include integrating bicycle and pedestrian accommodation on new , rehabilitated and limited - access bridges .
Secretary LaHood also wants more tracking of non-motorized transportation , long - term maintenance and snow removal on existing infrastructure and improved transportation arrangements for bicycles and pedestrians during the construction and rehabilitation of projects .
Given that building highways costs 10 times more ( . pdf ) more than shared - use pathways , cities could see significant savings .
LaHood summed up the outcome of the new policy best when he said it will promote " cleaner , healthier air ; less congested roadways ; and more livable , safe , cost - efficient communities . "

The convictions were a " badge of honour " Mr Nasrallah said
The leader of the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah has strongly criticised the Egyptian courts for jailing men accused of working for the group .
Hassan Nasrallah said the judgement by the Security Court in Cairo was " unjust and politicised " in an interview with an Arabic TV station .
He said he would seek " political and diplomatic means " to get their release .
The 26 men were sentenced by the court for planning terrorist attacks on ships and tourist sites .
Hezbollah says it was working to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip .
" The verdicts that were issued ... against the mujahideen who were providing support for the mujahideen in Gaza are political and unjust ... against these honourable mujahideen , " he was quoted as saying .
Mr Nasrallah said the convictions were a " badge of honour " for the men .
Muslims should consider it a " source of pride " that members of Hezbollah were jailed helping Palestinians , he told al - Rai TV .
Hard labour
One of the men is Lebanese citizen Sami Shihab , last year Mr Nasrallah confirmed he was a Hezbollah operative .
He was given a life sentence which cannot be appealed against .
The others , 18 Egyptians , five Palestinians , a Sudanese man and another Lebanese man , were given sentences that ranged from six months to 25 years , some with hard labour .
Four of those sentenced are still on the run , including the alleged Lebanese ringleader , and were convicted in absentia .
Prosecutors said Hezbollah had told the men to collect intelligence from villages along the Egypt - Gaza border , tourist sites and the Suez Canal .
The group had received equipment from Hezbollah , and had also been tasked with spreading Shia ideology in the predominantly Sunni country , the Egyptian government said .
At the start of the trial it was reported that at least one of the accused said he had been tortured while in Egyptian custody .
Hezbollah has said the charges are politically motivated and in revenge for the movement 's stance on Egypt 's support for the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
Hezbollah supports Hamas - the Islamic movement which controls the coastal enclave - and has strongly criticised Egypt for not opening its border with Gaza to relieve the Israeli - imposed blockade on the territory .

Note :
This is Part 1 , click here for Part 2 !
What I am about to present is not a new paradigm , or revolutionary approach to diet .
Nor is it the end - all , be - all to dieting ; there are many viable approaches .
This diet is , on the other hand , an easy ( relatively speaking ) approach to diet that is physiologically and psychologically rewarding .
Moreover , it is rather malleable and also forgiving , yet effective .
For these reasons , I am astounded that it has not caught on to a greater extent ( in some form or another ) , and played a bigger role in the dieting revolution .
This is the first installment of a multi-part article .
Here , we will briefly discuss my background ( as it relates to this diet ) , its genesis ( in the form I present ) , the basic tenets of the diet , as well as the basic diet structure .
We will also discuss , briefly , its psychological benefits , as well as its physiological strengths and underpinnings .
Psychology and physiology , as you will see ( and as Par Deus has propounded ) are inextricably intertwined , in the world of diet and food .
Or , " food and mood , " as Par is so fond of saying .
However , this installment will address theory and science only minimally , out of necessity .
Not only would this article be way too long , but more importantly , I 'd be going well beyond my strengths , and I know my limits .
For those seeking a deeper understanding , Dawza , who is far more apt than I in these regards , will provide a more in depth analysis in the final article in this series .
Also in future installments we will discuss synergistic supplementation , variations based on one 's phenotype , tweaks for continued fat loss ( should they prove necessary ) , variations for bulking or a steady recomposition , and other variations for those losing too quickly ( we should all have that problem should n't we ? ) , those not losing quickly enough , and for those looking for a more manageable " lifestyle " approach .
Actually , in its most basic form , as presented here , Carbohydrate Cycling will be a rather quick fat loss plan for most .
Basic Definitions
First , let 's get some definitions out of the way .
This is not a glossary but rather an explanation of a few terms that are often used in a variety of manners .
If the definition of a word or term used can be found objectively , I expect that you know it , or you 'll look it up , or you do n't give a rat 's ass .
Diet : A way of eating .
Period .
Unlike in common usage , it does not refer to the goal of " weight loss . "
Cut or Cutting : A hypo-caloric diet where the goal is to decrease overall body fat , while concomitantly maintaining or even gaining muscle mass .
Often , a small amount of muscle loss is expected and acceptable .
Mass Phase , Bulk or Bulking : A hyper -caloric diet where the goal is to increase overall muscle mass , while concomitantly maintaining or even losing body fat .
Some such diets indeed allow for , or even plan on , fat gain , albeit minimal ( hopefully ) .
Recomposition : Coining a new phrase , Avant Labs style , the concept of a recomposition was previously unheard of .
But essentially , it is a slow , yet steady body transformation whereby you seek to both lose body fat and gain lean body mass , concomitantly .
Beyond " newbie gains , " rapid changes in the extremely obese or with the use of androgens , it is widely believed that a recomposition is highly inefficient , or even impossible .
It is not .
Utilizing numerous nutrient - partitioning techniques related to training style , and proper supplementation , recomposition can be accomplished rather effectively .
In The Beginning
Carbohydrate cycling is something I stumbled on when I trained for my first bodybuilding contest in 1996 .
It was not something I heard or read about , specifically .
While I am certain I did not invent this concept , and others probably had used it in some shape or form , I devised it of my own accord based on the " little " that I knew back then .
How ?
Why ?
Well , I had struggled my whole life with being over - fat .
Indeed prior to cutting for the show I was probably at around 20 % body fat , and this was " thin " for me .
I doubt I had ever been below 15 % , and yet I committed to being on stage in posing trunks — in 16 weeks .
Why ?
I had finally accumulated a decent amount of muscle mass , and well , why not .
I " knew " then that I " needed " to keep my fat content low , and protein high ( the quotes reflect that I have a generally different view now , though this certainly is not a high - fat diet ) .
I also " knew " that I needed some carbs , but that my calorie reduction must come from this macronutrient ( as I always kept fat low , and was n't about to reduce protein intake ) , and I knew I needed ( as a genetic endomorph ) to keep insulin under control .
I also knew that I hated calorie restriction , that I never stuck to a diet long term , and that I hated dieting monotony .
I also hated ( and still hate ) counting calories — I admit it , I am lazy .
And despite this , and poor genetics with a high body fat setpoint , I needed to get to sub 5 % body fat .
Oh , for some context , back then I thought Hot Stuff was the bomb — so except for protein , I did n't use any supplements ; the point being , with the exception of a protein powder , no supplements are necessary to make this diet work .
On the other hand , supplements have come a long way since the mid to late 90s , and so has my knowledge on this topic .
Today , there are many effective products that will contribute to the success of the diet ( or the speed at which you will achieve it ) , depending on your goals , your phenotype , and your wallet , of course .
Again , we 'll get to this in future installments , but for now , the diet beckons .
So how could I , with my knowledge , genes , and personality traits , devise a plan that would be effective , and so user - friendly that even I would stick to it long enough that I could stand on stage , practically naked ?
Oh , and while 16 weeks may seem like a long cut , this time - frame did not allow any weeks to pass where I could simply maintain body fat .
There was no margin for error .
Nope , I needed to lose a steady 1 - 2 pounds of fat per week to attain my goal .
The answer - at least the one I came up with - was " Carbohydrate Cycling . "
My plan was that if I cycled my carb intake , I would have some days that were unusually strict .
This was not a problem for me ( being super - strict for short period of times ) , especially if I had a reward .
Enter , the high carb day , where I allowed myself to eat as much as I wanted .
What 's the catch ?
Well , we will get to that soon enough .
But in the end , I would average out to a low carb intake level sufficient to remain hypocaloric , for the week .
Or , at least , that was the plan .
So yes , basically this was designed , originally , to meet my psychological needs .
Oh , I also thought it a good idea to " keep the body guessing . "
Though I really did n't know what this meant .
I had never heard of a refeed , and especially not of leptin .
Hell , leptin was just being discovered back then .
So many of the positive physiological benefits of cycling carbohydrates were unknown to me then , except that it " kept the body guessing . "
You see , while knowing very little about biochemistry and physiology , I had the general sense that we bodybuilders were always battling homeostasis .
Other than this general belief , I had no idea why in 16 weeks I never got stuck or hit a wall .
The Concept : Cycling 101
There are three types of days while on this diet :
High Carb
Low Carb
No Carb Days
Generally , the three days are rotated , or cycled , equally .
Again , I will stress that this can , and should , betweaked , based on the individual 's goals , geno and pheno - types , and dieting history .
Indeed , much of this will be discussed in future installments .
Here , we will lay out the basic plan , which is designed for relatively rapid fat loss for most individuals and the one that got me into contest ready condition , twice .
Carbohydrate manipulation is the key here , but we will back into this by discussing our protein and fat intake , which each remain constant .
Bear in mind the multitude of goals and assumptions this diet balances .
Nuts and Bolts : the Basic Plan
Generally :
This plan is based on eating six times per day .
An acceptable alternative is five meals daily , and if you so choose , be sure to keep the daily ratios consistent , as each meal will require more food .
Protein Consumption : Protein — the easy part .
Actually , protein is the foundation of this diet .
It is not to be skipped , skimped upon , taken lightly , or otherwise reduced simply because the diet does not focus on it .
The significance of protein cannot be overstated , though such details are beyond the scope of this article .
We shall not get into the minimum requirements for a bodybuilder , which types of proteins are superior to others , and the numerous other issues that have perplexed the scholars and been debated ad nauseam .
Suffice it to say , that one gram per pound of bodyweight is the absolute minimum , and there is no maximum on this diet .
In other words , at each and every meal , of each and every day , you can feel free to dig in to as much protein as you wish .
Though there are some rules .
Beyond these rules , and for simplicity 's sake , I will assume you are eating a sufficient quantity at each and every meal and leave it at that .
Assuming you are eating six meals each day , regardless of which type of day , you will eat a minimum of 1/ 6 of your total daily minimum requirement for protein at each meal .
Thus , a 200 - pound individual should eat at least 33 grams of protein at each and every meal .
If five meals is the necessary course , the same individual should eat a minimum of 40 grams of protein per meal .
You can eat more , but to overindulge at one meal , does not excuse a deficient amount at another .
In other words , do not shortchange your protein consumption at any meal .
Again , this is the minimum , so if you are still hungry eat up .
Of course , like any other macronutrient , too much protein can hinder fat loss or even promote fat gain .
This is another instance where I am putting some faith in the body 's sense of self - regulation .
For the few of you who eat too much protein and fat loss stalls , you will want to limit total daily consumption to no more than 1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight .
Most of your protein requirements must be satisfied from very lean protein sources .
Indeed , four of your meals must use lean protein sources , while the remaining one or two may come from a higher - fat source .
For our purposes , a " lean source " is one that has no more than 10 % of its calories from fat .
It is important that you look at the calorie breakdown here , as a product may say " 10 % Fat " but refer to the fact that 10 % of its macronutrients are fat .
And because fat is more than twice as calorically dense as carbs or protein , it will derive more than 10 % of its calories from fat .
Now , as I have stated , this is a simple diet , so if you do n't want to figure out what you can and cannot eat , I have provided a list of generally acceptable lean protein choices .
In addition , one or two meals should contain a higher - fat protein choice .
Again , I have provided a list for easy reference , but for those of you with peculiar tastes , you can choose any protein that derives about 20 - 25 % of its calories from fat .
If , however , you 'd rather eat a lean protein , then for that meal you should add about 10 - 15 grams of fat from the " Fat List " below , in the fat consumption section .
For example , if you have six meals , and four have protein sources from list A and two from list B , you are fine .
You cannot have more than two from list B .
And if you have none from list B , and all six from list A , then two meals must have an added fat source from the list below .
Approved Lean Protein Sources ( A ) :
Chicken ( white meat )
Turkey ( white meat )
Tuna Fish ( can )
Fish ( flounder , tuna ( fatty or not ) , salmon , shark , etc . )
Shellfish ( all types )
Protein ( preferably whey post workout , and casein before bed ; MRPs must be low - carb )
Lean beef ( including lean cuts of steak )
Cottage Cheese ( 0 or 1 % fat )
Egg whites ( egg beaters )
Approved Higher - Fat Protein Sources ( B ) :
Chicken ( dark meat )
Turkey ( dark meat )
Eggs ( half whites , half whole eggs )
Steak and other meats ( not exceptionally high fat cuts )
Cottage Cheese ( Whole Milk )
Fat Consumption
As for fats , this diet does not worry too much about them .
Nor will we discuss them much , save for this brief discussion here .
While this is not a high fat ( or Ketogenic ) diet , it certainly is not a low fat diet .
When I first started cycling carbs , I kept fats to probably less than twenty grams a day .
Here , I recommend keeping dietary fats on the low side , with the majority of fats coming from supplemented EFAs ( essential fatty acids ) - specifically fish oil ( high in long chain omega 3 fatty acids — EPA / DHA ) .
Why fish oil ?
There are so many good reasons that a detailed discussion can be an article unto itself .
For our purposes , it is sufficient to know that it has all the benefits of other EFA sources ( such as flax and hemp oil ) and in addition , has been shown to increase leptin sensitivity and exert positive effects on body composition much more efficiently than other EFAs ( this is one of the important nutrient partitioning " tricks " one must employ for a successful recomposition ) .
Now , on to the practicality of it .
First , you will be getting some fats in your lean protein sources ( probably between 10 and 20 grams of fat ) and a few grams from the carb sources ( another 10 to 20 grams on high carb day ) .
Second , at least two meals per day will include protein of the higher - fat variety .
And if not , then you should add a fat source from the list below .
Fat Sources ( an amount equal to 10 to 15 grams of fat ) :
( Natural ) Peanut Butter
Flax Oil
Heavy Whipping Cream
Mayonnaise
Hemp Seed Oil
Olive Oil
Third , you will be supplementing with fish oil at 10 to 20 grams a day -- the more the better .
This assumes you are using a standard fish oil supplement which , on average , contains one gram of oil and is 30 % EPA / DHA .
Should you choose the superior version , you may consume a bit less .
I recommend you either split it up equally across all meals , or split it in half , and consume it with two meals .
If you absolutely refuse to take fish oil , despite my pleas that you should ( and the evidence that will be provided in the third installment ) , add in one to two servings of flaxseed or hempseed oil daily .
Carbohydrate Consumption and the Cycling Process
Ah , the carbohydrate .
By now ( if you have n't skipped ahead , and I know some of you have - shame on you ) you are saying , " its about time ! "
Well , the protein and fat portions of this diet are relatively easy to follow , but that does not mean they are unimportant .
To the contrary , they are critical .
This diet is one , however , that focuses on daily manipulation of carbohydrate consumption .
First , we will discuss how we do this ; then we will discuss additional concerns important to this diet .
As previously mentioned , in a future installment , we will discuss in greater depth the theoretical and scientific underpinnings of the carbohydrate manipulation .
As mentioned , we have three types of days in the diet , and they vary only by the amount of carbohydrate that is consumed .
They are the high carbohydrate day ( high carb ) , the low carbohydrate day ( low carb ) , and the no ( approaching zero ) carbohydrate day ( no carb ) .
Again , we are assuming six meals per day , so you will need to adjust if you follow a 5 - meal plan .
High Carb Day
On your high carb day , four of the meals ( three if you are only eating 5 meals ) can have as much carbohydrates ( yes , they must also be from the approved list - we love lists ) as you like .
But remember , you must eat the minimum amount of protein at each meal as discussed above .
So for you carb gluttons out there , you might want to make sure you eat your protein source before truly loading up on those carbs first .
Also , each one of those meals must include a small piece of fruit ( again , a requirement before downing enough other carbs to the point of no return ) .
Almost any fruit will do ( save bananas , kiwis , avocado , and other very high calorie or high fat fruits ) .
We are looking for a small serving of fresh fruit , say between 50 and 100 calories worth .
The fructose from fruit will help keep liver glycogen stores full and keep your body in the fed state as opposed to starvation - mode .
And , if only consumed in small amounts , is not likely to spill over into adipose .
Also -- and this is important -- you can choose which meals ( 3 of 5 or 4 of 6 ) will have carbs and which do n't , but the meal preceding and following your workouts must be a carbohydrate meal .
Obviously , make sure you leave sufficient time between your pre-workout meal and your workout , or limit the quantity of carbs at this meal , lest your body succumb to reverse peristalsis .
Other than that , it 's up to you , as I do n't want to bog you down with too many " rules " ( we have plenty already ) .
The other two meals will be made up of protein only , and , while there is a minimum amount , as always , there is no maximum .
So to sum up , all but two of your meals will have a small piece of fruit , and as much carbohydrate from the approved list as you like .
The goal is to eat until complete physical , emotional , and thus , physiological satiety .
You are not expected to gorge yourself , nor are you expected to exercise the usual strict self - restraint .
As I said previously , I am a big believer in self - regulation by the mind and body .
You are not to worry or stress about whether you are eating too much , or too little .
If you eat too many carbs one meal , you will probably eat less the next , as you 'll still be full ( just make sure you get the protein in ) .
The beauty of this plan is its simplicity - you are not " aiming " for any number .
Rather , you are aiming for the subjective feelings that I just discussed , a satisfied stomach and mental state .
You should not " want " more .
Nor should you eat more than you want .
Relax and go with the flow ; it is quite hard to mess up the high carb day , if you stick to the right carbs .
And you will learn your body 's response as you go on .
Increase your carbohydrate consumption if you are not " satisfied . "
You want a constant feeling of fullness , all day , such that you do n't want to eat further .
You need to be in tune to your body , and this comes with practice .
Most people find themselves looking forward to , if not salivating at the thought of , the upcoming high carb day .
This is no surprise .
Indeed , it is by design , and how I came up with the plan for myself .
It is a psychological reward , satisfying your emotional need to eat .
It makes the very strict part of the diet ( which we will get to ) bearable .
It is a small but frequent reward to hang on to that also has these profound psychological and , equally as important , physiological benefits .
However , some of you will have a difficult time with the high carb day .
Stress and concerns of eating too much will plague you .
Not counting every gram of carb , and every calorie consumed , will haunt you .
For those of you with such concerns I remind you that first , you are supposed to eat a lot of food on this day , to make sure that your weekly caloric deficit is not too low , and second , that no one should ever dread high carb day .
The point is to eat as much as you want ; not stuff yourself like a Thanksgiving turkey .
Low Carb Day
The low carb day is a bit trickier .
Actually , it 's the most difficult of the bunch .
The anal group out there will love it though , as there are specific macronutrient goals .
For those of you who , like me , deplore counting , fret not .
There is a way around it ( we 'll discuss this privately later my lazy brethren ) .
Here , three meals ( two if you are only eating five meals ) may contain carbs .
Again , one rule is that at least the meal following your workout must be a carb meal .
The others you can schedule as you see fit .
Here , carb amounts are limited , however .
We are seeking to eat approximately one gram of carbohydrate ( from the list ) per pound of bodyweight each low carb day .
So our hypothetical 200 pound dieter would eat about 66 grams of carbs in each of three meals of the day , and the others would be just protein .
Oh , and do n't forget your small piece of fruit , at these carb meals , as well .
Now , recall that this plan is designed for simplicity .
So it is best if you simply learn general portions of the carbohydrates you choose to eat .
I 'd prefer that you do n't measure out your carbs strictly ; but for the exceptionally anal , this is your chance to shine .
For those like me , the goal is a satisfied , but not full stomach .
The subjective feeling to strive for is where you 'd like to have more , but know you do n't need it .
No Carb Day
The no carb day is the simplest , yet most physically challenging day .
For most , the cyclical nature of the diet will make this day a relatively easy emotional challenge , however .
It also , I am willing to bet , will be the most controversial day , among the dieting community .
Yes , I am prepared to be tarred and feathered .
Hell , I may enjoy it .
Regardless , it is the key to this diet .
And it involves , quite literally , no carbohydrates .
Okay I lied : a few sneak in with your green veggies ; as with any good rule , there is an exception .
Here , you will stick to your six ( or five ) meals , and only consume protein ( and some fats ) ; again from the list , and again , at least meeting the prescribed minimum .
Unless " masticatory boredom " sets in , however , I doubt you will have any trouble eating your minimums , and you likely will eat far more .
However , do not be surprised if you eat less than you expect , since eating protein alone can cause one to feel satiated more rapidly .
This may seem like a painful or difficult day , but in practice it 's not that bad .
Trust me .
And remember , a high carb day is just around the corner .
Veggies
No , I did not forget .
You wo n't find veggies ( except the truly calorically dense ones ) on the carb list .
And here , I am referring to green leafy , low calorie , fibrous vegetables .
Things like salad ( no dressing ) , cabbages , escarole , broccoli , spinach , zucchini , squash , and kale are appropriate .
Generally , any vegetable that contains less than 50 calories per cup will suffice .
Each and every day , whether it be a high , low , or no carb day , at least three meals , each and every day should include one cup of green veggies .
It can be with or without your carb meals .
I do n't care , though you may find it more pleasing to the palate to consume your vegetables with your no carb meals .
Now , on to the good stuff : the lists .
Do n't get overly excited because you are n't going to see most of your favorite goodies on here .
Indeed , it is a relatively sparse list , given the plethora of carb sources found in grocery stores .
Approved Carbohydrates :
Brown rice
Oats ( Slow Cooked Preferred )
Sweet potatoes or Yams
Fiber One ( All Bran ) Cereal
Starchy Veggies ( corn , peas , etc. )
Beans / Legumes
Approved Yet Limited Carbohydrates **
Whole - wheat pasta
Whole grain breads , pitas , etc .
These may only be consumed on high carb days , and only for one meal per high carb day .
Additional Yet Important Concerns
Measuring Success
The old dieting adage that one should not weigh ( or take measurements ) oneself daily is perhaps never truer than on this diet .
This is especially important for those of you fixated on the scale .
Wild weight fluctuations will occur , as you deplete , and replete , glycogen stores daily .
And remember that for every gram of glycogen stored ( or lost ) , three grams of water are also retained ( or lost ) .
As well , you are likely to look and feel bloated at the end of , and the day after , your high carbohydrate days .
This is normal and not an indication of lack of progress ( as many an individual who were skeptical , yet tried the diet can attest to ) .
To the contrary , it is an indication that things are moving along swimmingly .
As well , if you try to measure progress in this manner , you will become frustrated after your high carb day .
You may then come to the " epiphany " that the no carb days are doing wonders , and you will start adding in extra no carb days .
Next , you will skimp on your high carb days , and all this will speed progress correct ?
Wrong .
Rather , you will speed up your inevitable metabolic crash , as well as emotional and physiological discomfort and you will spiral into a pattern that 's end is failure .
Melodramatic ?
Perhaps , but I think I made my point .
So , we resolve this by always taking measurements , and charting weight after the same type of day .
Whether it is the morning after a high carb day , or the end of a no carb day , or whatever , consistency is key .
Personally , for psychological reasons , I prefer the morning after a high carb day , but the choice is yours .
Moreover , you should not be weighing in after a single three - day cycle .
Weighing yourself once every other cycle is more than sufficient ; so you are tracking progress every six to eight days , depending on your cycle length .
Cooking and Food Preparation
Ah , cooking .
Before I get a zillion questions on this , let me try to head this off at the pass .
This diet does not allow for calories ( whether they be fat , sugar , or what - have - you ) added at the preparation or cooking stage .
Thus , you cannot fry , add butter , or oil .
You cannot add salad dressing or breadcrumbs .
You can not add sauces or glazes .
You cannot , well , you get the point , I hope .
You can use no -cal or very low - cal substitutes .
So vinegar , soy sauce , and mustard are fine .
No calorie dressing works if you can stand it .
You can get away with some keto products , or even a small amount of balsamic vinegar .
Pam is your friend , as are most spices , grilling , broiling , boiling , and baking .
While I do n't necessarily recommend them , I do n't shun things like sugarless gum , diet soda , coffee or tea ( black or with an artificial sweetener only ) , sugar free jello , and crystal light , and other things containing artificial sweeteners while on this diet .
With that said , one must be careful that an excessive amount of calories is not consumed regularly with such " low calorie " items .
Likewise , one should be particularly careful on No Carb day with these items .
Post - workout Nutrition
While bodybuilders and non-bodybuilders can use this diet , most of us reading this perform some form of resistance training .
For those that do , I assume you have a " typical " post - workout protocol , so I 'll just give some basics .
In conjunction with the Basic Plan ( with fat loss being the goal ) , I recommend , at a minimum , between 30 and 50 grams of whey protein .
This can be a protein only meal , and then followed by a carb meal on carb days , or can be taken with oatmeal ( or another carb from the list ) on carb days .
On no carb days , obviously you 'd just be having the whey .
When using this diet to cut , we are not looking to create a post - workout insulin spike .
However , a pure ectomorph looking to cut should probably consider it ( by adding 30 - 50 grams of dextrose and / or maltodextrin ) .
Water Consumption
In short , you can never have enough .
The ten 8 - ounce glasses per day recommendation is easily a minimum .
I recommend at least a gallon per day .
A Word On Cardio
Briefly : cardio sucks .
Or , and perhaps more accurately , cardio is overrated .
And , hence , it is over - utilized , to the detriment of the dieter - especially the muscular dieter .
I expect this will be the second most controversial aspect of this article .
Perhaps I 'll add a section on religion , to take some heat of my views here .
So for most people , unless " skinny " ( as opposed to lean ) is the look you are going for , or you just love your cardio , I 'd suggest dropping it .
Period .
Resistance training can provide most , if not all , of the physical benefits of cardio , and can do so more efficiently .
Benefits such as improved heart rate , reduced blood pressure and cholesterol levels , increased metabolism , and nutrient partitioning are generally more efficiently achieved with resistance training , and of course , resistance training carries the added benefit of muscle growth .
With that out of the way , cardio does have its use .
If you have been dieting for an extraordinarily long period of time , it may be beneficial .
If you are already very lean , and still seeking to get freaky lean , that would be a good situation to add controlled amounts .
A thorough discussion of different types of cardiovascular activity is well beyond the scope of this article .
Generally , however , adding in a weekly session or two of high intensity interval training at the appropriate time is a good idea .
Tweaking , Generally
As alluded to above , this diet is rather malleable .
It can be tailored to the individual 's goals , genetics , preferences , lifestyle , or all of the above .
We have already taken up much of your time today , so the next installment will discuss in greater detail how to apply the basic plan to a bulk , how to optimize it in relation to one 's training , how to optimize it in relation to ones supplementation regimen , and how to arrange it to fit one 's lifestyle ( if you have a specific idea in mind , be sure to email me , and perhaps I 'll include it ) .
Here , I will state briefly , that the three - day basic plan will ( or should ) provide for rapid , steady fat loss .
You can easily self regulate this .
Should fat loss prove too rapid make no adjustments until at least three weeks or approximately 7 mini-cycles to attain a baseline ( and know that you are losing weight as opposed to water ) .
Then simply add in an additional high carb day .
So the rotation can be , High , Low , High , No , and it is a four - day rotation .
Conversely , if you are still not shedding fat quickly enough , you should add an extra no carb day , as such : Low , No , High , No .
And , of course , this is not the only way to do this .
Who can use this diet ?
Well , frankly , anyone .
With any goals .
With any genetics .
As I said , the diet is malleable — such is its nature , by design .
Who has used the diet successfully ?
Me ( a meso / endomorph by nature ) for two pre-contest preparations .
I successfully got down to around 5 % body fat each time , retained a substantial amount of muscle , and needed no tweaking of the basic plan , and no supplements , though I did do cardio .
This was also the low - fat variety , which I no longer condone .
I also did a " lifestyle version " just over a year ago simply to get " beach ready . "
I got down to about 10 % body fat , retained all of my muscle , and did zero cardio .
This time the diet was of the current moderate fat variety .
In 1998 , my training partner ( a pure mesomorph , the bastard ) used my original , low - fat variety of cycling to prepare for his first bodybuilding show .
He won .
My training program helped immensely , as he gained 15 pounds of muscle , I 'd wager , drug and supplement free , in the six months he trained with me prior to cutting .
He retained nearly all of it , while cycling carbs .
In 2002 , a new training partner ( an endomorph with slight mesomorph tendencies ) used a lifestyle variety of the diet , and went from a bodyweight of 228 pounds to 192 in ten weeks , without losing any significant muscle - mass ; indeed , his strength increased in that time .
Several females , in 2002 , on - line , successfully used a third generation of the Basic Plan to drop a few pounds for summer .
There progress has helped me tweak the Cycle to what it is today .
A male personal trainer , who I coached on - line , used this diet both to cut and bulk .
He was so pleased with his progress that he has spawned off many other on - line cutters to do the same .
Most recently , a female figure competitor , who I trained on - line , used the Basic Plan " Plus " ( we tweaked it regularly as she progressed , mostly for her psychological comfort ) to prepare for her second show ever .
She was more muscular this time around before the diet , and she successfully retained that size , while simultaneously coming in leaner .
Of course , I am referring to Avant 's very own , Leslie .
That show was a springboard into another , where she seeks to maintain her leanness , and improve her lagging body - parts .
While not technically using the cycle as a bulk , and with the most advanced supplements at her disposal , she is maintaining and improving her leanness , while simultaneously increasing strength , and improving her physique .
Finally , as this article is being written , another female bodybuilder turned fitness competitor ( and long time cutter who has never achieved the elusive " six - pack " ) has embraced Carb Cycling whole - heartedly .
Because she is venturing into the competition foray for her first ever figure competition in a short preparation time ( and we do n't know exactly how her body will respond , though early reports show that the term " favorable " would be an understatement ) she is on an aggressive version of the Basic Plan .
Despite this , though again using a variety of synergistic supplements , she has been increasing strength during the cut .
I also have two more tests I 'll be running soon , on myself .
The first is a cut .
It will be a lifestyle variety , which I will discuss in detail next time .
The goal is to lean out , while retaining muscle , while I am rehabbing .
Once I am fully rehabbed , I will be using it to bulk , for the very first time .
I will be pulling out all the stops , and we will see how she goes .
The point is , with the proper guidance almost anyone can use this diet successfully .
Indeed , I do believe almost anyone can use the Basic Plan successfully ( for cutting ) , just perhaps not optimally , which of course is our goal .
As an exception , I 'd not recommend that a pure ectomorph ( and perhaps even a pure meso ) use this diet , or any variation thereof , while in a pure mass phase .
Next time we will explore variations of the diet for different goals and body types , as well as discuss supplementation and advanced versions of the diet that can be achieved with supplementation .

One Thursday last month , during the lunch hour at H.D. Woodson Senior High School , half a dozen teenage boys have gathered to eat pizza and talk about hollering at women .
“ From where I come from , you holler at a girl , ” one student tells the group .
“ A girl ca n’t be too upset when a guy is paying attention to her . ”
“ It depends on the type of girl and whether she has respect for herself , ” another says .
“ Some girls will say , stop .
But they like it , for real . ”
“ If she ’s wearing short shorts , booty shorts , short skirt , with the thong showing , she wants it , ” another guy says .
“ Ca n’t blame it on the boy .
She knows what she ’s doing . ”
“ But what if it ’s hot out ? ” This is Kedrick Griffin .
He ’s here to play the 37 - year - old devil ’s advocate on a subject that ’s generally considered normal behavior for a teenage boy in the District of Columbia .
“ What if all her other shorts are dirty ?
What if it ’s 2 a .m. in a dark alley ?
What if it ’s your girlfriend who ’s wearing the short shorts ? ”
Along with the targeted line of questioning , Griffin has also brought three boxes of Pizza Boli ’s and an 18 - pack of Sierra Mist .
These Woodson students have been eating Griffin ’s pizza since September .
By now , they know full well that it ’s wrong to blame a woman for rape based on what she ’s wearing — now , they ’re just struggling through the street harassment piece .
This exercise has come almost at the end of a year - long District program called the “ Men of Strength ” club — MOST Club , for short .
The same pattern is repeated with groups of boys in public middle and high schools across the District : Come for the pizza , stay for the deconstructions of masculinity .
Getting teenage boys to engage in gender theory can require a soft approach .
The vague title of the clubs — “ Men of Strength ” — dodges the activist implications of the D.C. - based organization that runs them : Men Can Stop Rape .
At the beginning of each school year , MOST facilitators arrive on campus and lure in participants .
“ Last year , we were hanging out outside school , and some people were like , ‘ we need some males over here to eat some free pizza , ’ ” says Eugene , a 16 - year - old junior at Foggy Bottom ’s School Without Walls .
At that first MOST meeting , Eugene and a dozen other guys were fed pizza and offered free movie tickets ; over the next school year , they came back each Tuesday for the pizza , and gradually advancing conversations on gender .
Now , “ I kind of like to keep the MOST club secret from other dudes , ” says Eugene .
“ We all have this strong connection with each other . . .
But also , if you bring more people in , then there are fewer slices . ”
Griffin facilitates two MOST club meetings a day at nine different DCPS schools .
Every week , he spends less than an hour with each group .
But that ’s enough time , he hopes , to challenge traditional masculinity and push his young charges to respect their female peers .
Thus Griffin has become accustomed to addressing thorny concepts in abbreviated time frames .
At one middle school MOST club , he says he knocked out a discussion on prison rape in the time it takes to travel between classes .
“ One of the guys said , ‘ When you go to jail . . . you get raped and when you come out you ’re gay , ’ ” Griffin says .
“ I said , ‘ Oh really ?
Well , I ’ve got ten minutes .
That ’s enough time for me . ’”
So he moderated a discussion with seventh and eighth grade boys about why a man ’s sexual orientation and history with sexual assault make society see him as less of a man .
“ I was n’t prepared for that discussion .
It was n’t even on my radar , ” says Griffin .
“ But if a young person brings up a topic for discussion , I ca n’t just ignore it . ”
Griffin does n’t just stroll into D.C. public schools with a pizza and start engaging boys on topics like rape .
Each MOST meeting begins with a slow wind - up : a weekly “ check - in ” in which each student updates the group on his recent life developments .
Stuff like how he can’t find a ride to football practice , or how he only slept in one class today , or how he ’s starting to look at colleges , or how he put his rap video on YouTube but then he took it down .
These personal conversations are meant to transition into headier discussion topics like understanding rape culture and questioning the patriarchy .
As a short - cut , MOST has chosen a phrase that Griffin employs more than once in each meeting : “ The Dominant Story of Masculinity . ”
In order to illustrate what that means , Griffin performs an exercise he calls “ The Real Man . ” Griffin shows students photographs of male celebrities — from Lebron James to Barack Obama to 50 Cent to Johnny Depp — and asks students to comment on “ who they think society says is a real man and why . ”
The exercise is meant to reveal how society ’s idea of ‘ manhood ’ is threaded with negative attributes .
While it ’s reasonable to want to be president and dunk a basketball , do you really want to get shot nine times in order to prove you ’re a man ?
“ When we talk about what a ‘ real man ’ is , we think of stuff like : Strong .
Lifts weights .
Spike TV . Prison .
Explosions , ” explains Eugene .
“ When we start talking about men in our lives and what we want from them , we think : Nice .
Fun .
Cares about us .
Respects his family . ”
By the time the exercise is finished , a few students at each D.C. public school have at least a taste of looking at gender expectations from a different perspective .
When they leave the club , the theory goes , the students will tell their friends , and gender relations in the District will slowly begin shifting .
Woodrow Wilson Senior High ’s MOST club , facilitator Nate Cole says , averages from between two to eight students every meeting — but five are members of the school ’s basketball team .
In “ the hierarchy or food chain of high school , they ’re at the top , ” says Cole , 23 .
“ When they start challenging their friends and the people they come in contact with , that has a huge effect on the school . ”
But even with these high - status students , an hour is not always enough time to tease out all the complexities of gender relations .
At a recent Woodson MOST meeting , Griffin starts off the discussion by raising the murder of University of Virginia lacrosse student Yeardley Love .
“ She got killed , she was on the lacrosse team .
I think they said her boyfriend did it , ” one student says .
Griffin explains that the man charged with her murder is George Huguely , a male lacrosse player who allegedly sent Love death threats — and then violently beat her head against the wall — when she tried to break up with him .
“ Remember , in the dominant story of masculinity , the only emotions we are taught to show are anger and rage , ” says Griffin .
They nod .
“ If a girl broke up with me , I ’m like alright .
Oh well , ” says one student .
“ You can be mad but you do n’t have to kill somebody . ”
Time to move on :
In the last ten minutes , Griffin mounts a quick discussion of the murder of D.C. principal Brian Betts , who was allegedly targeted on a gay chat line .
In order to illustrate the social dynamics behind the killing , Griffin constructs a social ladder with his hands .
“ If a heterosexual man is on this level , ” he says , raising his hand to his nose — “ and a woman is at this level ” — his hand descends to his chin — “ then a homosexual man is on this level ” — his hand drops down to his chest .
“ No , no , women are at the top , ” one student says .
“ Fags .

Washington : President Barack Obama says the United States will continue to " ratchet up the pressure " on Iran to reveal its nuclear intentions to the rest of the world .
In an interview broadcast Friday on CBS`s " The Early Show , " Obama said " all the evidence " indicates that Tehran is trying to get a nuclear weapons capacity .
With such a capability , Obama said that Iran could " destabilize " life in the Mideast and trigger an arms race in the region .
Obama said , " I think the idea here is to keep on turning up the pressure . "
He had said earlier this week he wanted new , stronger UN sanctions to be in place by late spring .
The president also said he believes the country has become " further isolated " from the rest of the world since he took office .
Earlier , US President Barack Obama urged Chinese President Hu Jintao to work together on the Iranian nuclear standoff , the White House said , as Hu appealed for " healthy and stable " relations between the two nations .
Obama also welcomed Hu`s attendance at the international summit on nuclear security to be held in the US capital later this month , saying it would be an " important opportunity for them to address their shared interest in stopping nuclear proliferation and protecting against nuclear terrorism ” .
Earlier on Thursday , the White House said it was pleased China agreed to join talks at the United Nations on toughening sanctions on Iran .
White House spokesman Bill Burton said the move proved that despite lingering " disagreements we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation ” .
The rare hour - long telephone conversation late Thursday between the leaders came as the powers seek to overcome deep strains in their ties on multiple fronts , included the valuation of Chinese currency , US arms sales to Taiwan and two countries` relationship over Tibet .
The pair discussed the importance of a " positive bilateral relationship ” , the White House said in statement following the phone call from Air Force One .
Hu told Obama that both sides should " respect each other`s core interests and major concerns and properly handle differences and sensitive issues , " the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
He also called on the two nations to make " unremitting efforts towards cooperative , positive and comprehensive " ties , Bejiing said .
China has previously opposed the imposition of tough new UN sanctions on the Islamic republic , and said on Thursday it was working for a " peaceful resolution " of the Iranian nuclear standoff .
Iran , which sent its top nuclear negotiator to Beijing , described the talk of new international action as an empty threat .
The presence of Tehran`s chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili on a visit to Beijing meanwhile highlighted China`s role in the tense UN Security Council debate on Iran`s uranium enrichment .
The United States and its allies suspect the programme is part of a drive to develop a nuclear bomb , while Tehran insist its activities are geared toward a civilian energy program .
Obama said on Tuesday he wants a fourth round of UN sanctions agreed upon within weeks .
China , which has a close diplomatic and trade relationship with Iran , and is one of five veto - wielding members of the Security Council , has repeatedly called for a negotiated settlement rather than new punitive action .
Hu`s announced appearance at the nuclear security summit in Washington on April 12 - 13 and the lengthy conversation between him and Obama Thursday appeared to mark a slight easing of tensions after months of frayed relations between Washington and the rising Asian giant .
Chief among bilateral irritants is currency , with some 130 US lawmakers calling on Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to accuse China of manipulation of its yuan`s value for trade advantage -- and threatening legislation if he does not .
Tensions have risen on a number of other fronts , including the arms sales to Taiwan and Beijing`s angry protests earlier this year over Obama`s meeting with Tibet`s exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama .
Other disputes include human rights , climate change and Internet freedom after Google reported cyberattacks by China .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was earlier this week upbeat over the possibility of slapping new sanctions on Tehran , saying the P5+1 group -- permanent council members Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States , plus Germany -- " continues to be unified ” .
" There will be a great deal of further consultation , not only among the P5+1 , but with other members of the Security Council and other nations " in the coming weeks , Hillary said .

Eighteen year - old Kayla Gerdes , high on Oxycontin and driving a van , struck and killed a 69 year - old retired doctor on Long Island Tuesday .
That 's bad enough .
Kayla , however , made it worse , by saying the very worst possible things .
According to the New York Post ( standard disclaimer ) , Kayla said the following things following her deadly accident :
1 . " The thing that made me not feel so bad was , she was old . "
2 . She told police she wanted " to see a newspaper of the news , to see what I look like . "
3 . After running over the victim and crashing into her house , Gerdes allegedly got out the van and told a passerby , " I 'm late for court .
You have to take me to court ! "
She was expected in court to deal with a charge of stealing her mom 's jewelry .
Teens : never say anything in public , under any circumstances .
The US secretary of state says her country is working hard to avoid an escalation after a report blamed North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean warship .
After talks in China , Hillary Clinton urged countries in the region to contain " the highly precarious situation created by North Korea " .
Earlier , South Korean President Lee Myung - bak froze trade with Pyongyang , vowing to punish those who carried out the attack , which killed 46 sailors .
Meanwhile , the Pentagon announced the US was planning to start joint anti-submarine and other naval exercises with South Korea " in the near future " .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the decision to start the exercises was " a result of the findings of this recent incident " .
' Unequivocal support '
North Korea has said it would retaliate for any action taken against it .
The country 's main newspaper called the investigation an " intolerable , grave provocation " .
President Lee addressed the nation on television to announce Seoul would no longer tolerate " any provocative act by the North and will maintain a principle of proactive deterrence " .
ANALYSIS
The problem is that South Korean economic measures , US condemnation and even possible action at the UN are unlikely to change the mindset in Pyongyang .
China is the only country with any real leverage over North Korea .
Behind the scenes
Beijing is going to be the crucial player if tensions are not to spill out of control .
The weeks ahead are punctuated with opportunities for further tensions - not least a joint US - South Korean anti-submarine exercise .
The US administration endorsed the move .
" US support for South Korea 's defence is unequivocal , and the president has directed his military commanders to co-ordinate closely with their Republic of Korea counterparts to ensure readiness and to deter future aggression , " a White House statement said .
South Korea says it will refer the North to the UN Security Council in response to the sinking of the Cheonan in March .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he expected serious measures to be taken by the Security Council once Seoul brought the matter to its attention .
He said the evidence that North Korea was responsible for the torpedo attack was " overwhelming and deeply troubling " , and urged prompt action to revive six - party peace talks .
China - North Korea 's closest trading partner and a permanent member of the Security Council - has urged " calm and restraint " .
Japan said it was contemplating its own sanctions on Pyongyang .
The North depends on South Korea and China for up to 80 % of its trade and 35 % of its GDP .
In 2009 , inter -Korean trade stood at $ 1.68 bn ( £ 1.11 bn ) - 13 % of the North 's GDP .
Resolute ?
The measures announced by South Korea included :
Stopping inter-Korean trade
Banning North Korean ships from using South Korean waterways or shortcuts
Resuming " psychological warfare "
Referring the case to the UN

The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says the measures are about as tough a response as the South could take , short of military action .
But South Korean Unification Minister Hyun
In - taek said Seoul would still maintain the joint economic project in Kaesong , even though it would " respond with resolute measures " to possible attempts by the North to undermine the safety of its workers .
The measures came less than a week after experts from the US , the UK , Australia and Sweden said in a report that a torpedo had hit the Cheonan .
They reported that parts of the torpedo retrieved from the sea floor had lettering that matched a North Korean design .

How the ship was sunk Timeline : North Korean attacks Q&A : Cheonan sinking
North Korea denies any involvement in the sinking , calling the investigation results a " fabrication " and threatening war if sanctions are imposed .
The South 's new measures included resuming " psychological warfare " against North Korea , which was stopped in 2004 .
The resumption prompted an angry response from Pyongyang .
" If [ South Korea ] sets up new tools for psychological warfare such as loudspeakers and leaves slogans for psychological warfare intact , ignoring our demands , we will directly aim and open fire to destroy them , " a statement by the military said on Monday .
" More powerful physical strikes will be taken to eradicate the root of provocation if [ South Korea ] challenges to our fair response , " said a commander , according to official news agency KCNA .
IF YOU are a youngish man who sits on a European corporate board , you should worry : the chances are that your chairman wants to give your seat to a woman .
In January the lower house of France 's parliament approved a new law which would force companies to lift the proportion of women on their boards to 40 % by 2016 .
The law would oblige France 's 40 biggest listed firms to put women into 169 seats currently occupied by men .
Spain has also introduced a quota at 40 % , to be reached by 2015 .
Italy and the Netherlands are contemplating similar measures .
This week Britain 's government threatened to make companies report formally on their recruitment of female directors .
Compared with America , where women held 15 % of board seats at Fortune 500 companies in 2009 according to Catalyst , a lobbying organisation , European countries have relatively few female board members .
Britain is not too far behind at 12 % , according to a survey of Europe 's 300 biggest firms by the European Professional Women 's Network ( EPWN ) .
Spain , Italy , France and Germany , however , all lag behind the European average of 10 % .
The exception is Scandinavia , and in particular , Norway , where quotas for women on boards originated .
In 2005 the government gave listed firms two years to put women in 40 % of board seats on pain of liquidation .
Businessmen howled .
Riulf Rustad , a professional investor with stakes in several Norwegian companies , said 70 % of the new recruits would fail .
In fact , there have been no obvious disasters .
But a close look at Norway nonetheless suggests that imposing high gender quotas with tight deadlines can be bad for companies .
The Norwegian government was interested in social justice ; it made no claims that putting women on boards would improve corporate performance or governance .
Finding qualified women in a country where only 9 % of board seats were held by women in 2003 and the vast majority of senior corporate jobs are filled by men proved challenging .
According to a study by the University of Michigan , Norwegian firms have lost lots of boardroom experience : the new , younger women directors have spent less time running companies on average , are less likely to sit on other boards and are more likely to come from middle management .
DNO International , a Norwegian oil firm , appointed two new female directors in 2007 .
The three men on DNO 's board have a combined 66 years of experience in the oil business , but the new women directors have none ; instead they have backgrounds in accounting and human resources .
Schibsted , an international media group based in Oslo , selected all three of its new female directors from Sweden , one of its main markets .
“ If we had n't had the Swedish pool to draw from , the law would have been far more difficult for us , ” says a senior executive at the firm .
The usual arguments for adding women directors are that diverse boards are more creative and innovative , less inclined to “ groupthink ” and likely to be more independent from senior management .
Numerous studies show that high proportions of women directors coincide with superior corporate performance .
But there is little academically accepted evidence of a causal relationship .
It may be that thriving firms allow themselves the luxury of attending to social issues such as board diversity , whereas poorly performing ones batten down the hatches .
Women do seem to be particularly effective board members at companies where things are going wrong .
A 2008 paper on the impact of female directors by Renée Adams and Daniel Ferreira of the University of Queensland and the London School of Economics found that bosses of American firms whose shares perform poorly are more likely to be fired if the firm has a relatively high number of women directors .
On average , however , the paper concluded that firms perform worse as the proportion of women on the board increases .
There is certainly no shortage of companies capable of producing stellar results with few or no women on the board .
LVMH , a successful French luxury - goods group whose customers are mostly women , has had just one female director over the past ten years : Delphine Arnault , daughter of the firm 's chief executive and controlling shareholder .
Nor is there any doubt that in many cases low female representation also reflects a broader lack of meritocracy in corporate culture .
In France , for instance , interlocking board memberships are common .
Women , and many other deserving businesspeople , are excluded from the system .
Emma Marcegaglia , head of Confindustria , Italy 's main business lobby , says the dearth of women on boards and in management mainly reflects a controlling male elite at the top of business , the members of which have hardly changed for the past 30 years .
( Silvio Berlusconi , Italy 's prime minister and a prominent tycoon , last year referred to Ms Marcegaglia as a “ velina ” or showgirl . )
Core mission
But what most prevents women from reaching the boardroom , say bosses and headhunters , is lack of hands - on experience of a firm 's core business .
Too many women go into functional roles such as accounting , marketing or human resources early in their careers rather than staying in the mainstream , driving profits .
Some do so by choice , but others fear they will not get ahead in more chauvinist parts of a business .
Getting men to show up at every board meeting — another effect of having more women on boards — is all very well , but what firms really need is savvy business advice .
Yet according to EPWN , the pipeline of female executives is “ almost empty ” : women occupy only 3 % of executive roles on boards , compared with 12 % of non-executive ones .
That suggests that the best way to increase the number of women on boards is to ensure that more women gain the right experience further down the corporate hierarchy .
That may be a slower process than imposing a quota , but it is also likely to be a more meaningful and effective one .
Leonard Nimoy said that he shed some tears while watching the new " Star Trek " movie , where he reprises his role as an older Spock who enlightens his younger self .
COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo . --
Famous fictional Vulcan Leonard Nimoy says he 's excited about what 's to come in the world of real - life space exploration .
Nimoy , who became famous playing Spock in the original Star Trek series , spoke Thursday here at the 26th National Space Symposium , where he was accepting the 2010 Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award .
The actor said he 's a big fan of real - world spaceflight , as well as the fictionalized version , and had watched President Barack Obama 's major space policy speech that afternoon .
" I do believe that President Obama means it when he says that he is 100 percent interested in space , " Nimoy told reporters .
" I know for sure he 's a Star Trek fan , " he said , because the first time the two men met , President Obama made Spock 's traditional V - shaped finger spread .
Nimoy said he did n't feel qualified to speak to the merits of the president 's new plan for space , but that it sounded like a positive direction .
" All - in - all I 'm looking forward , " he said .
" I hope it 's going to work out for the best . "
Nimoy said he has followed space exploration throughout his career , and remembers driving to work on the set of Star Trek when he heard the news of the Challenger accident .
" Those pictures will never go away , " he said of his memories of the explosion replays .
It 's just beginning to sink in that the space shuttle era is ending , Nimoy said .
" I think people will be grieving , " he said .
" I will .
I 'll be sad to see it go .
It 's been a very important part of our image of NASA and space for the last number of years . "
He even credits real - life space exploration for the success of his Star Trek show .
When it was first run , the program was n't that successful , he said , but began to pick up in reruns after the Apollo moon missions .
" In 1969 Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon , and I think that had a great impact on Star Trek reruns , " Nimoy said .
" The show began to find a tremendous new audience . "
Who is St George ?
Of course he 's England 's patron saint , you wally , representing all those romantic notions of Englishness , a defiant spirit , dragon slaying and a jolly large red cross .
But hold a minute , we 're not even sure that he existed .
The Catholic encyclopaedia claims there is little doubt of his being a real person , but forgive me if I take their assertions of what is true with a sprinkle of seasoning .
He might have been a Palestinian Christian soldier .
He might have defied the Roman emperor by standing up for Christ .
He might have been beheaded for that act too .
George is most famous for slaying a dragon , also not helping the whole " is he real ? " question .
He certainly was n't English .
Wikipedia tells me that on the patron saint stakes , he 's a bit of a whore , being claimed for ( deep breath ) : Aragon , Catalonia , England , Ethiopia , Georgia , Greece , Lithuania , Palestine , Portugal , and Russia .
So George also represents the spirits of those regions too ?
Maybe George is a partial Thomas Painesque saint in that his country is ( large chunks of ) the world .
He is also a Christian , so one hopes that his religion is to do good .
There 's a fine line between being patriotic and jingoism , the former being a good thing .
But patriotism still needs justification , rather than blindly following the cosmic happenstance of birthplace .
Leave that to sports fans : I bear that cross with simultaneous pride and anguish as I was ejected into the world in time for the all too brief Bobby Robson - era Ipswich .
But I do love these islands .
I love how liberal and confident we are as a people .
I love pubs , Wodehouse and sarcasm .
I love that we created two of the best things in the world , the NHS and cricket .
Apart from wishing winter to be just a bit shorter , I even like the weather .
And believe it or not , I like the cultural trappings of the Church of England , low key , mostly private religion concerned with charity , singing and , as Eddie Izzard said , cake and death .
But what of St George ?
What does his legend actually say about any of those things ?
Although narratives play an important role in cultural membership , national icons are often fatuous and irrelevant .
St George is a symbol about whom we know almost nothing and whose own narrative represents almost nothing .
St George is a third of the reasons for Henry V's rousing battle cry , which is now mostly appropriated by adverts for sporting events .
Other than that , and our crusade - inspired flag , George has not much to do with being English in the 21st century .
So I suggest a new one : The Doctor , the shape - shifting time - travelling guardian of humanity from Doctor Who .
In fact , the Doctor shares many striking similarities with St George .
Both are dragon - slaying outsiders , fighting on foreign shores to protect their adopted people .
But we know so much more about the Doctor , and thus can proudly and sensibly sing his praises .
If we as a people demand collective narrative from legend , we might as well make it a ripping yarn .
The Doctor possesses so many traits of Englishness to which we should all aspire : defiance and good humour in the face of adversity ; a sense of style that is at once individual , traditional and contemporary ; a special brand of cheeky conservative rebelliousness ; a humbling reliance on hot companions .
Follow your spirit and upon this charge cry God for Harry , England and the Doctor !
An Australian - led team of scientists may have found a way of creating a cheap and abundant source of clean energy through nuclear fusion .
The process could generate no radioactivity and produce little pollution .
The scientists have used computer models to simulate nuclear fusion without the extreme temperatures currently needed for other fusion methods .
Emeritus Professor Heinrich Hora , of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the University of New South Wales , is leading the research effort , and says the process relies on a new generation of extremely powerful and very fast lasers being developed .
" The key is a very carefully controlled extremely short laser pulse essential for ignition .
The pulse would ignite a fuel made of ordinary hydrogen and boron - 11 , " Professor Hora said .
" The idea of a hydrogen and boron fusion reaction is interesting because it would n't cause neutron production .
Neutrons are a problem because they generate radioactivity . "
The team 's findings appear in the journal Energy and Environmental Science .
Professor Hora says his team was originally developing computer models using next generation lasers to duplicate the work being done at the new $ 4.34 billion National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States .
The US scientists are developing what is currently the world 's largest laser to ignite highly compressed spheres of deuterium - tritium fuel in a nuclear fusion reaction .
Fast and furious
The laser can produce a pulse of a few billionths of a second duration which produces 500 times more power than all US power stations combined .
Professor Hora 's team originally rejected the idea of a hydrogen - boron fuel for their simulations " because the higher temperatures and compression needed made it 100,000 times more difficult than the Lawrence Livermore approach , making it just about impossible " .
" But when we ran computer simulations using these next generation petawatt [ quadrillion watt ] strength lasers with a hydrogen - boron fuel , we were shocked to find that it 's only 10 times more difficult than deuterium - tritium , " he said .
" It makes this all within the reach of current technology in a relatively short time .
In fact these types of lasers are already in early testing at the Los Alamos National Laboratory . "
Professor Hora says the key is to ensure the laser pulse is " extremely clean " , lasting no more than a millionth of a millionth of a second .
" This allows conversion of optical energy to mechanical energy without heating , " he says .
Professor Hora says the hydrogen - boron fuel has a numberof advantages over deuterium - tritium .
" It would be largely free of radioactive emissions producing less radiation than that emitted by current power stations that burn coal , which contains trace amounts of uranium , " he says .
According to Professor Hora , hydrogen and boron are plentiful and readily accessible , and the waste product of ignition would be clean helium gas .
" The hydrogen - boron fuel would not have to be compressed .
This means it needs far less energy to start the ignition , " he said .
But Professor Hora warns the study only demonstrates the potential of the new process and much work needs to be done to demonstrate it in practice .

Team Plan B realized that having options made their motivation to succeed the first time drop .
While it is good to think ahead , keeping those plans vague first could make you be more successful .
Fear is an actually good feeling if you are not really in danger .
There are people who love scary movies and there are those who do not , and the difference might be in their hormones .
Such activities give you adrenaline , dopamine , and endorphins from a fight - or - flight response .
However , your brain knows that you are not in real danger , so you still get that natural high despite how scared you feel .
You tend to care more about a single person rather than about massive tragedies .
Another one from the University of Pennsylvania , this study had one group learn about a starving little girl , another group learn about starving millions and a third group who learned about both situations .
The results showed that people who heard about the little girl donated more than twice the amount than when they heard the statistics .
Psychologists believe that although you would willingly help a person , you would conclude that your little part could not do much when a problem seems too big .
You would prefer anticipating something bad over not knowing what to expect .
Researchers found that something negative that is about to happen is less stressful to grasp than not knowing how things will end up .
The consequences - predicting part of your brain becomes more active when you have no idea what to expect .
Returning a favor is in your nature .
Good manners could not take credit over the ‘ rule of reciprocity . ’
This brain command programs you to want to help someone who helped you .
It might have developed with the goal of keeping the smooth flow of society .
Being tested on things help you remember them better .
Some psychology facts for the kids : testing is an efficient tool for learning .
A study discovered that information could last longer in the memory of a person tested for it than when only studied without the need to remember immediately .
You obsess over things which you feel you lack .
Take money for example .
The human brain is scarcity - sensitive ; it constantly feels that you are missing things that you need .
Farmers , for instance , come up with better plans when the cash flow is good than when money is tight .
You are in a constant search for human faces in inanimate objects .
This sensation is called ‘ pareidolia ’ which scientists think came from the notion that face recognition is an important part of social life .
It entails how your brain tends to find a face where there is none rather than missing a real one .
You always find a problem .
It is psychologically normal for you to find another problem upon resolving one .
One research demonstrated that volunteers who are asked to select computer - generated faces that look threatening eventually resorted to faces that do not .
It turns out that as the volunteers ran out of threatening - looking faces , they started turning to faces that they would usually call harmless .
People would rather alter facts than change their opinions about people .
As much as ‘ cognitive dissonance ’ normal , you hate it when reality contradicts your beliefs .
It explains why you undermine a loved one ’s wrongdoings despite how bad it is .
High expectations incline people to rise to it while low ones have no such effects .
The Pygmalion effect holds the explanation as to why you do better when other people believe you would .
On the contrary , you could not do well when someone expects you to fail .
Crying has benefits .
Doing so could make you feel a lot better , reduce stress , and could even help in keeping your body healthy .
It is possible to feel certain about something without facts or reasoning .
Undergoing electric simulation over that specific part of your brain could trigger a feeling of certainty despite the absence of evidence or logic .
Some people are afraid of feeling too much happiness .
It is due to the fear of the pattern that something tragic might happen next .
There is a reason why that song is your favorite .
It is not just about the lyrics or the tune , it is because you link that song with an emotional event in your life .
Smart people tend to depreciate themselves .
On the other hand , ignorant people think they are excellent .
This psychology fact would make you take a second look at the people that you know and how they present themselves .
The pain from being ignored is not an overreaction .
This feeling has similar chemical effects as to that of a physical injury .
Hence , your brain handles rejection like it would with physical pain .
Being lonely is worse for your health than you actually think .
A Harvard University study found a connection between extreme loneliness and the very same levels of the blood - clotting protein responsible for stroke and heart attacks .
In other words , not having friends could have the same deadly effect as smoking .
Psychology facts proved that power lessens a person ’s care for others .
Aside from the Stanford Prison Experiment , other studies found that people who are in the position of power become worse at assessing another ’s feelings .
It shows in their lack of facial expression which is a major indicator of loss of empathy .
Receiving rewards could convince you that a boring task was fun .
A study paid volunteers to convince someone that a boring task was actually interesting .
Those who lied yet still find the activity boring got paid $ 20 .
On the other hand , those who did not have a genuine reason to lie and convinced themselves that the task was truly fun were only paid $ 1 .
Your brain gives less importance to long - term deadlines .
Yes , you are a procrastinator for a psychological reason .
The brain makes you prioritize urgent tasks , regardless of its importance , because it knows that you could complete them .
Optimism could be taught .
What ’s more , is that researchers also observed that you could teach it to yourself .
Psychologically speaking , there is more behind an internet troll .
Scientists claim that most of them are naturally psychopathic , narcissistic and sadistic .
What considered normal anxiety levels has increased over the years .
The average 1950s psychiatric patients demonstrated the same level of anxiety that could be found in today ’s average high school kid .
People aged between 18 and 33 carry the most amount of stress in the world .
The stress levels only tend to reduce after the border age of 33 .
France is the most depressed country in the world .
For every 5 people , 1 suffers from depression .
Above ⅓ of Europeans overall have a mental health disorder .
Artists from creative fields have an 8 % greater chance to suffer from bipolar disorder than those from less creative ones .
Studies have found a connection between bipolar disorder and a person ’s creativity .
But this definitely does not mean all creative people have bipolar disorder , and not everyone with bipolar disorder are creative .
A broken heart could be a legitimate cause of death .
The broken heart syndrome is also called stress cardiomyopathy , and it could lead to critical , short - term heart muscle malfunction .
The influence of power could have the same effect on a person as that of a traumatic brain injury .
Victims become more unpredictable , less concerned about risks , and less proficient at being sympathetic and emphatic .
Your addiction to social media is the result of its psychological scheme .
This formula is the real reason why you continue to scroll Facebook despite only going there to check some notifications .
Being able to stay on the site regardless of interaction and activity is relevant to the infinite scroll where your brain does not get any stop cue .
There is a psychological reason why you felt that your phone vibrated when there is actually no notifications .
This condition is called the Phantom Vibration Syndrome , and a whopping 68 % of the population suffers from it .
If you think that your idol is in love with you , there is a huge chance that you are suffering from a mental illness .
A psychological disorder named ‘ erotomania ’ occurs when a person who believes that a famous identity is in love with them .
Some people live their life as if they are in a reality TV show .
They suffer from what is called the Truman Syndrome .
Patients with this psychological disorder believe that they are , indeed , stars in a reality TV show .
Getting your hopes too high for Paris could give you a mental health disorder .
Mainly Japanese people suffer from Paris Syndrome , a psychological disorder caused by disappointment from realizing that Paris is not what they expected it to be .
Local culture is one of the factors that affect hallucinatory voices .
For one , voices in the U.S. sound harsh and aggressive .
Whereas schizophrenics in India and Africa hear more mild and playful voices .
Hikikomori is a common mental health condition in Japanese males .
Approximately a million of this population lock themselves in their bedrooms for years .
Subsequently , they generate social and health problems thus called the hikikomori .
Narcissistic Personality Disorder occurs in about 6 % of the population .
This condition shows symptoms of having a sharp sense of self - importance and an apparent lack of empathy .
A person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder often also suffers from depression or anxiety .
However , this coexistence is usually the sole reason why a narcissist would opt for therapy .
Tylenol a.k.a.
acetaminophen is not only good for physical aches , pains , and fever .
It is also known to alleviate psychological conditions like social rejection .
Antidepressant drugs carry more than just sexual side effects .
It could also suppress any human emotions relevant to love and romance .
There is a psychological reason behind your urge to go to the beach when you need a vacation .
The sight of water has that soothing effect that makes people who witness it happier , calmer and even more creative .
Hence , living in such a view is a good idea .
Paranoia has its opposite disposition .
Known as the pronoia , this delusion makes you think that people have secret plans for building your success .
People tend to value objects more when they assembled it by themselves , even just partially .
Primarily named after furniture from the famous store , the ‘ IKEA effect ’ is the cause of the irrationally high value on such objects in spite of the end result ’s quality .
Leonardo Dicaprio ’s movie ‘ Inception ’ highlighted ideas from psychological scientists .
Beyond the special effects and great actors of the movie lies a deep storyline .
It lowkey demonstrated how ideas could be instilled into a person ’s mind and integrated into its memory , as per the Association for Psychological Science .
A man named Billy Milligan had 24 personalities .
He was born in Florida in 1955 , but that ‘ he ’ only pertains to his core personality named William Stanley Milligan .
Aside from him , 23 others reside in his head , 2 of whom committed crimes such as robberies and rapes .
However , Billy did not serve jail time and instead got sent to the Athens Mental Health Center due to ‘ insanity ’ .
Groggier than usual ?
No surprise there : Americans set their clocks ahead by an hour yesterday and lost an hour of sleep .
" Springing forward " creates another hour of sunlight in the evening .
It also has some effects on health and public safety that many people are unaware of .
Interesting facts about daylight saving time include :
1. Officially , it 's " daylight saving time , " not " daylight savings time . "
But do n't feel bad if you thought there was a final " s " on " saving " ; far more people Google the incorrect phrase than the correct one .
2. Daylight saving time has mixed effects on people 's health .
Transitions into and out of DST can disturb people 's sleeping patterns , for example , and make them more restless at night .
Night owls tend to be more bothered by the time changes than people who like mornings , Finnish researchers concluded in 2008 .
3 . There 's a spike in heart attacks during the first week of daylight saving time , according to another study published in 2008 .
The loss of an hour 's sleep may make people more susceptible to an attack , some experts say .
When daylight saving time ends in the fall , heart attacks briefly become less frequent than usual .
4 . People are safer drivers during daylight hours , and researchers have found that DST reduces lethal car crashes and pedestrian strikes .
In fact , a study concluded that observing DST year - round would annually prevent about 195 deaths of motor vehicle occupants and about 171 pedestrian fatalities .
5 . The Energy Policy Act of 2005 , signed into law by President George W. Bush , extended the length of daylight saving time by four weeks .
It now begins at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday in March .
It ends on the first Sunday in November .
6 . Also in 2005 , Kazakhstan abolished daylight saving time , citing negative health effects .
The country 's government reportedly calculated that 51.6 percent of Kazakhs responded badly to the time change .
7 . Many other countries observe daylight saving time , but not all do so on the same day .
That can create confusion for international travelers , business communications , and more .
8. Daylight saving can also cause confusion close to home .
In March 2007 , a Pennsylvania honor student was mistakenly accused of threatening his school with a bomb .
He had actually called an automated line to get info about scheduled classes .
Someone else made the bomb threat an hour later .
9 . Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — and four U.S. territories — American Samoa , Guam , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands — do n't observe daylight saving time .
Indiana adopted DST in 2006 .
10 . Daylight saving time was first used during World War I , as part of an effort in the United States and other warring countries to conserve fuel .
In theory , using daylight more efficiently saves fuel and energy because it reduces the nation 's need for artificial light .
11 . The first American to advocate for daylight saving was Benjamin Franklin .
He realized in 1784 that many people burned candles at night yet slept past dawn in the summer , wasting early - morning sunlight .
12 . The effect of DST on energy use has changed over time and varies from place to place .
Experts even disagree on whether DST still saves the nation energy .
But so many people like to " spring forward " that it might be hard for officials to end the tradition , even if they determined it 's wasteful .
Dashing valiantly through the shadowed streets of the crime - strewn metropolitan steel jungles taking on the vile scum of the urban night , defending the homeless , and protecting the neighborhoods , these stalwart crime fighters do more than just take justice into their own hands .
Every night holds not only a patrol to bring law to the lawless , but a chance to help those in need , keep the streets clean , raise money for charities , and inspire every person they happen to meet .
As a society they call themselves the Real Life Superheroes ( RLSH ) , and they ’ve banded together just like their comic book inspirations in the goal of making the world ( well at least their part of it ) a safer place to live .

Each with their own chevron emblazoned upon their costume , brilliantly shining in the night , these heroes do n’t just talk the talk , they walk the walk every night in their hometowns .
They ensure the safety of the weak , education of the youth , and the future of not only society but of their families and loved ones too .
To many observers they are just a bunch of wannabe do - gooders who could n’t make it as cops , dressing up and running around at night with pipe - dreams of glory and fame , metallic symbols glittering in the street lights .
Truth be told , if they wanted fame , they probably would n’t be putting themselves in harms way , risking life and limb , night - in and night out .
All to make their homes better places for not only themselves , but others .
Most importantly , for those who cannot .
Yeah the costumes may be a little goofy , but the truth is they have put their lives on the line .
Some having even been shot at and forced to defend themselves on a regular basis .

5 Fantastic Notebooks and Sketchbooks for Designers
This article will briefly examine 5 physical notebooks that are perfectly suited for a number of designer workflows .
Before we get started , let ’s take a brief look at some reasons you should be using a notebook as an integral part of your design process .
Why Do I Need a Notebook ?
Those readers not particularly strong in the area of sketching are no doubt wondering what benefit a good notebook could possibly bring .
After all , have n’t we reached a point in history where pencil and paper is an outdated and dying method of producing commercial art ?
We purchase ( or pirate ) $ 1,000 application suites for this very purpose so why should we then run out and spend more money on a good notebook ?
To answer this question for you particularly , consider how and when you come up with design ideas .
Is it merely while hashing out a site in Photoshop or reading an Abduzeedo daily inspiration post ?
If it is , then I submit that you ’re not fully embracing your talents .
Inspiration is everywhere , whether you ’re at Denny ’s eating breakfast or sitting on the couch watching TV before bed .
Constantly thinking of work can lead to a stress overload but that does n’t mean that you ca n’t simply enjoy good design in all its forms .
Once you learn the art of design it has a way of latching onto the way you think and screaming out its input whenever possible .
Carrying a notebook , or simply keeping one beside your mousepad if you prefer , can help you immediately capture those fleeting bits of inspiration or unique thought processes .
If you ’re not much of an artist , do n’t worry about it .
This process need not lead to detailed drawings .
Your notes can be words , doodles , and scribbles of any kind .
The point is to have something handy for capturing these ideas as they come and nothing can touch the simplicity and convenience of ye olde pen and paper .
Finally , beyond capturing inspiration , a notebook is an excellent “ step 1 ” in the design process .
When it ’s just you and some paper , the flow of ideas has a tendency to be more unique and fluid .
Try making yourself come up with at least three to five completely different wireframe sketches ( also known as thumbnails ) for each design you tackle .
If you really apply yourself , I can almost guarantee that you ’ll be surprised at the diversity and quality of your ideas .
Now that I ’ve hopefully convinced you to consider picking up a notebook , let ’s take a look at a few that really shine in getting the job done .
Moleskine makes some of the best notebooks around for a variety of uses .
They ’re compact , stylish , well - made and quite useful .
Moleskine has notebooks for everything from journaling to music notation , but the one that I think can really be useful for designers is the Storyboard Notebook .
This notebook comes in two varieties : large and pocket .
Obviously the principal difference is size , the larger having much more room for notes .
Both versions feature a hard black cover and pages with rounded corner boxes for sketching out ideas .
The boxes can help you keep ideas separate and easier to find when you go back to search and encourage you to think visually as if you ’re laying out a storyboard .
You can easily find a wide variety of moleskine notebooks at major bookstores like Barnes and Noble for anywhere from $ 12 - $ 20 depending on which size you go with .
A good alternative to Moleskine , Piccadilly notebooks come in three sizes : 3.5 x 5.5 in , 5 x 8.25 in , and 7.5 x 10 in .
They also come in ruled , plain , graph and soft cover varieties ( the default is hard ) .
All versions contain 192 pages and are very affordable .
The small version is $ 6.95 , the medium is $ 9.95 and the large is $ 12.95 .
Field notes are little 3.5 ″ by 5.5 ″ tall soft cover , three staple booklets that come in graph paper , ruled paper , plain or mixed packs .
They ’re cheap , stylish and can easily fit in your back pocket or laptop case .
You can snag a three pack of any notebook ( or a mix ) for $ 9.95 , a one - year supply ( 24 notebooks ) of limited editions colored books for $ 129 , or just grab the excellent starter kit above for $ 34.95 .
As you can see , this kit gives you six notebooks , six pens , six pencils , and an 18 month calendar ; definitely enough to show some serious patronage for the Field Notes brand !
The Web Design Sketchbook features multiple tools for getting you started on a design project .
There are several sections including empty browser templates with gridlines , content planning questions , and sitemap pages .
You can choose between a Single Project Book for $ 12 or a Full Sketchbook for $ 19.88 .
The single project book is “ 30 pages of 8.5 x 11 ″ high quality paper ” and the full sketchbook is “ 104 pages , of 8.5 ″ x 11 ″ , coil binding , on 60 # weight paper . ”
As a bonus , there ’s a complete and free downloadable version that you can print yourself !
This pad features 50 8.5 ″ by 11 , tear - off pages of of graph paper with browser chrome and a chip board back .
You can pick one up on the UI Stencils site for just $ 9.95 .
The pad is designed to work with the website stencil kit , which makes it super easy to sketch out quick UI elements for a mockup .
Print Your Own !
Do n’t want to bother with paying for notebooks when you ’ve got a stack of perfectly good printer paper ?
No problem .
In addition to the Designer Sketchbook template mentioned above , here are a couple of printable web design templates .
“ The goal was simple — To create a wireframe tool that would enable designers to have that perspective .
Providing you an actual viewing resolution of your potential user .
Looking your site on what the user sees .
Paper Browser does n’t only provide you with that perspective but adapt on how you work .
Enabling you to focus on what you do best – Design . ”
Keep an eye on the site because Paper Browser will also soon be available as two purchasable notebooks !
A simple webpage template with browser frame available in four versions : blank , lines , web 10 px , and grid 100 px .
A simple two - up iPad template with dotted grid lines .
A nice six - up view of browser windows perfect for quickly hashing out multiple ideas .

( Newser ) – Belgium is expected today to become the first nation to ban face - covering Muslim veils in public .
Supporters of the bill say they 're motivated by concerns about security as well as taking action to protect women 's rights .
" We think all people in public must show their face , " Belgium lawmaker Denis Ducarme tells CNN .
In addition , " we must defend our values " concerning " the freedom and dignity of the woman . "
The law is n't a sign of religious intolerance , he added , because Islam does not require that women hide their faces , though one Muslim leader said the bill smacked of " colonialism . "
Only some 400 of the 280,000 Muslims who live in Belgium wear face - covering veils , Ducarme estimates .
France is also preparing a final bill to ban the veils that President Nicolas Sarkozy has called " an assault on women 's dignity , " even though legal advisers warn that such a law may be unconstitutional , notes the Telegraph .
Both bills would ban any veil that covers a woman 's face , including the niqab and burka .
Polls have revealed that a majority of Europeans favor such a ban , but Muslim leaders warn the actions will trigger a backlash .

FBI Bases Iowa ALF Case on Facebook , Speaking Event , YouTube
An FBI affidavit has just been released in the investigation of the 2004 Animal Liberation Front break - in at the University of Iowa .
It shows the stream - of - consciousness approach the FBIâ€™s Joint Terrorism Task Force took to the investigation , including surfing MySpace and Facebook and using an informant to identify activists on YouTube .
The affidavit from October , 2009 , also shows the shaky pretext used to justify charging Scott DeMuth with Animal Enterprise Terrorism , jailing Carrie Feldman in a grand jury witch hunt , and raiding the home of Peter Young .
For example :
A confidential informant was used to identify individuals in a YouTube spoof video created prior to the Republican National Convention in the Twin Cities .
The video , like many others that have been made for mass protests , shows faux â€ œBlack Blocâ€ activists getting ready for the RNC .
( The joke is that they are sipping coffee and reading the newspaper while wearing black masks . )
The informant reportedly identified Carrie Feldman and Scott DeMuth as cast members in the skit .
When the video came out , I posted about it on this site , and jokingly called it a “ Homegrown Terrorist ” training video .
Months later , the government is calling it exactly that .

The video , like many others that have been made for mass protests , shows faux â€ œBlack Blocâ€ activists getting ready for the RNC .
( The joke is that they are sipping coffee and reading the newspaper while wearing black masks . )
The informant reportedly identified Carrie Feldman and Scott DeMuth as cast members in the skit .
The government says Scott DeMuth wrote in his diary about the ongoing political crackdown on environmental activists .
For example , one alleged entry includes , â€ œFuck the Fedsâ€ and â€œTurns out the Feds have shit on Pâ€ ( who the government claims is Peter Young ) .
DeMuth also allegedly wrote â€ œItâ€™s almost been a year since Iowa , â€  which the FBI agents typed in bold font , implying that DeMuth must have been involved in the ALF raid .
DeMuth allegedly wrote , â€ œAnd the ABC [ Anarchist Black Cross , a group that supports political prisoners ] has gotten a fair amount of attention from the FBI .
I donâ€™t think I am at too much risk.â€ 
For example , one alleged entry includes , â€ œFuck the Fedsâ€ and â€œTurns out the Feds have shit on Pâ€ ( who the government claims is Peter Young ) .
DeMuth also allegedly wrote â€ œItâ€™s almost been a year since Iowa , â€  which the FBI agents typed in bold font , implying that DeMuth must have been involved in the ALF raid .
DeMuthâ€™s Facebook , Livejournal and Myspace all â€œidentify him with his interests of animal rights , anarchy and ecological extremist groups , â€ the FBI says .

An FBI agent reviewed a MySpace photo of Carrie Feldman , posing with a white rat on her shoulder .
Rats were removed during the Animal Liberation Front raid at the University of Iowa .

Rats were removed during the Animal Liberation Front raid at the University of Iowa .
Activists organized a Dangerous Media Tour , also known as â€ œThe Steal This Film Fest.â€ 
This public event , open to everyone ( including the FBI , who were there taking photos ) included information on making free phone calls and other hacks to resist â€œcorporate rule.â€ 
The affidavit paints this is a covert terrorist gathering , but to anyone familiar with CrimethInc. , Evasion , and the like , there is an entire punk subculture built up around similar petty scams .
I spoke with Lauren Regan of the Civil Liberties Defense Center to help me put this affidavit in context .
â€
œThis is just an incredible example of how extremely flimsy the actual fact evidence is in these cases , â€ she said .
â€ œIf they had stronger evidence against this kid [ DeMuth ] , they would have used it.â€ 
It does n’t seem that the government has anything else to go on .
When prosecutors filed an emergency motion to keep DeMuth locked up , they based it on labeling him an anarchist .
This is an important point to underscore .
The date of this affidavit , October , 2009 , places it before the Utah raid of Peter Young ’s home , and before the grand jury .
In other words , it is very likely that the entire case for the indictment of Scott DeMuth was based on this flimsy string of information , including lawful speaking events , Facebook , and YouTube .
Only 3 % of the CEOs of the 500 biggest American companies are women , and they 're paid less than their male counterparts .
Experts tell Forbes that 's partly because women tend to choose salary and bonus packages over stocks and options .

I deal with superginormously ridiculous energies , velocities , and sizes all the time as an astronomer .
You get used to it after a while ... then something like this 'll slap you upside the head : a star that exploded more than 5000 years ago launched two epic bullets .
One is a cloud of gas screaming away at thousands of kilometers per second , and the other is the cinder of the star itself , an octillion - ton cannonball blasting through space in a totally different direction .
This is a composite picture of the supernova remnant N49 : an expanding lumpy sphere of gas about 30 light years across ( 300 trillion kilometers , or 180 trillion miles ) * , located in the Large Magellanic Cloud , a satellite galaxy to our Milky Way .
The blue in the picture is the emission from gas heated to millions of degrees , and shows X - rays detected by the Chandra observatory .
The yellow and purple are from Hubble data , showing gas being whipped and beaten by shock waves slamming around insides the remnant .
Turn your attention to the little blue blob to the right , marked by the red arrow .
It 's outside the main bubble of the nebula , meaning that it must be moving faster than the gas in general .
This is seen sometimes in supernovae remnants : a bullet or focused blob of gas screaming away .
It may be caused by magnetic fields in the expanding gas just after the star explodes , launching the octillions of tons of matter away in all directions , or it may be due to focusing from shock waves , which can sculpt the gas and create little pockets of denser knots .
Either way , this bullet is moving away from the nebula at speeds of more than 2200 km / sec ( 1300 miles per second ) -- fast enough to cross the United States in less than 3 seconds .
The mass of the blob is unclear , but to give you an idea of the energies involved , it emits 10 times the Sun 's total energy in just X - rays alone .
Incredible .
Now focus your attention to the star - like point source indicated by the other red arrow , near the top of the remnant .
The astronomers took a good look at that object , which was previously known to be an object called SGR 0526−66 .
SGR stands for Soft Gamma ray Repeater , an object that periodically blasts out flashes of super - high - energy gamma rays .
SGRs are neutron stars , the ultra -compact and überdense ( I know , I 'm running out of adjectives .. but just you wait ... ) leftover cores of stars that have exploded .
They can have more than the mass of the Sun compressed down into a ball just a few kilometers across !
A cubic centimeter of neutron star material ( usually called neutronium , a word I love love love ) weighs about as much as the combined weight of all the cars in the United States .
So there 's that .
The astronomers found the age of the SGR to be a few thousand years , which matches the age of the nebula !
That means it 's very likely this is the leftover core of the star that exploded and created N49 itself .
But what 's it doing way off center ?
Astronomers think that sometimes the explosion can be off - center in the star , so that things do n't quite expand the same in all directions .
Given the energies involved ( hint : a LOT ) this can give the neutron star a kick , sending it caroming through space at high velocity .
If SGR 0526 - 66 is indeed the leftover cinder from the explosion , to get where it is in the time since the explosion it has to be moving at a velocity of at least 790 km / sec ( 490 miles / second ) .
Think about that : this is an object with the mass of the Sun and it got kicked so hard it went shooting off hundreds of times faster than a rifle bullet .
Yeah , you might want to sit for a moment and soak that in .
It gets worse !
Since it 's seen in the Chandra data , that means it 's hot .
Glowing at several million degrees , the energy it gives off in just X - rays is a hundred times the Sun 's total energy production !
If you replaced the Sun with SGR 0526 - 66 , you 'd barely be able to see it since it 's so small , but it would hardly matter : the X - rays it gives off would cook the Earth like a marshmallow in a furnace .
If that 's not enough awesome for you , the magnetic field at the surface of the neutron star is about 100 trillion times stronger than the Earth's !
Neutron stars are small in stature , but nothing else about them is .
Studying supernovae remnants is interesting scientifically for lots of reasons , not the least of which is that they create the heavy elements in the Universe , so we literally owe our lives to them .
That would be enough ... but I know that secretly , astronomers study them because they are simply so frakkin ' cool .
Or maybe it 's not so secret .
^* A lot of these remnants look like mammograms to me .
Make of that what you will .

Banks , Investment Managers , Mutual Fund Companies and Plan Sponsors often need the services of an Independent Fiduciary to monitor and exercise discretion over ERISA funds or portfolios .
HFG is a DC industry expert that can bring clarity , transparency and prudence to this process … all on behalf of plan participants .
The DC plan management business is a huge complex industry with many layers and fees .
Defined Benefit Plans
Investment strategies and products continue to grow in complexity .
Yet many Plan Sponsors are reducing their in - house professional staffs in an attempt to cut corporate overhead .
HFG can empower the professional staff and will even sign - off on plan investment decisions as a fiduciary .
I will be adding some quotes from this video in updates .
I wanted to get this video published fast , because I think this is a matter of utmost importance .
Are we looking at a Huge Scam ? ~ Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT )
The American people have a right to know where TRILLIONS of dollars of their tax payer dollars are going !
~ Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT )
Why did the Fed argue that this information must be kept secret as a matter of National Security ?
~ Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT )
Congress required the Treasury Department to disclose who received TARP money , why is it wrong to demand the same of the Federal Reserve ?
President Obama might veto Financial Reform if it includes the Sanders " Audit the Fed " Amendment .
This would be a defining moment for his Presidency , and a massive betrayal of the public 's interests .
Should Obama veto Financial Reform because it demands transparency from the Federal Reserve he will be sending the message that BANKS deserve more protection than people , that what the public wants is NOT what it will get no matter who is in charge if it threatens big money and Big Business , it will take the words spoken by Senator Dick Durbin that the banks " own the place " regarding Capital Hill , and it will make it true of the Presidency too , no matter if that President is Republican George W. Bush or Democrat Barack Obama .
For Hope and Change to survive in American politics , you MUST NOT DO THIS , President Obama .
We already know that the banks totally OWN the Republican party and many " Conservative " and moderate Democrats .
If the banks obviously own the President who ran on " changing " the corruption and Corporatism of the Draconian Republican governance under George W. Bush , than hope is dead , Democracy is damned near over , and we literally have a Government for the Banks , by the Banks and of the Special Interests .
I can't say this enough .
Dear President Obama , do n't veto this bill .
Give us transparency !
Because I stand with Bernie Sanders more than any other politician . . .
" Am I concerned that some of the most powerful and wealthiest people in the world are in opposition to my amendment , people who have run the United States Congress for decades ? "
Sanders asked reporters rhetorically before a caucus meeting today .
" Do I have any worry about that ?
Yeah .
I do . "
" Do I think we 're going to get a vote ?
Yes .
Do I think we have a chance to get 60 votes ?
Yes . "
When I asked , though , whether he worried that the White House might succeed in peeling away Democratic support for his amendment -- just as they did during the health care debate vis-a - vis a popular drug reimportation amendment -- Sanders acknowledged it was a real possibility .
talkingpointsmemo.com
The fact that transparency at the Federal Reserve is this hard to achieve is proof in and of itself that the Banks do OWN our Government .
That is a tragedy , and as good of a reason as any of why we need to shine a light on what goes on in the dark at the Federal Reserve .
UPDATE : The White House is hoping to cobble together a separate proposal , to be offered as an alternative to Sanders ' backers .
The so called " side - by - side " would give them cover to vote down the Fed audit amendment , by offering them them a weaker plan to support .
But Sanders had to read about this plan in the newspaper .
" I read it in the New York Times , " Sanders said this morning , after a floor vote on a separate amendment .
Quoth the Times : " [ T ] he White House and the banking committee chairman , Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut [ are ] scrounging for ideas for a so - called side - by - side amendment -- an alternate proposal on the Fed that would give senators something to support while offering them cover to vote down the Sanders measure . " talkingpointsmemo.com
Bold text added by the diarist
Why not back the Sanders Amendment ?
Because we can pass a watered down , toothless version of it that Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke can believe in !
Worse , Senator Sanders had to learn about it from the New York Times !
So , how about that Change we can water down until Wall St owned Senators can believe in it ?
Or , we can push for real transparency .
If this is not proof that the Federal Reserve has something to hide , I do n't know what is .
Sunlight is the greatest disinfectant .
I think the Federal Reserve could use a big dose of sunlight , do n't you ?

Update , May 11 , 2010 : The Senate adopted the Sanders amendment , 96 - 0 , which does not indicate its meaningless .
In these weird times , senators do n’t want to stand for the Fed if they can avoid it .
Ad Policy
The weirdness of this political system is reflected in the fact that it takes a Socialist senator from Vermont , Bernie Sanders , and a libertarian Republican from Texas , Rep. Ron Paul , to beat the banking lobby .
The Democrats are making a show of " Wall Street reform " but choking on the tough issues .
Republicans are in the tank , as expected , though nervous about the public fury .
Sanders and Paul , however , found an opening with their bill to force a GAO audit of the sacrosanct Federal Reserve .
This is a big deal , much bigger than most imagine .
Congress has sputtered for years about the Fed ’s imperious secrecy but never found the nerve to do anything .
The Sanders - Paul audit bill , if it passes , will only be a first breach in the wall , but it promises to keep alive popular demands for more fundamental reforms .
Rep . Alan Grayson , the first - term Florida Democrat who partnered with Paul to pass the House version , has a distinctive way of explaining things with brutal clarity .
" Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke does n’t want an audit because Ben Bernanke does n’t want to be audited , " Grayson said .
" Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , the former head of the New York Fed , does n’t want an audit because Tim Geithner does n’t want to be audited . "
Forget all the official blabber about " Fed independence . "
The central bank has never been independent from the most powerful bankers it is supposed to regulate .
The everyday relationship is incestuous .
What the Fed and its main constituency of Wall Street power houses really fear is that people will get a better look at their corrupt private dealings .
During the financial crisis , the central bank handed out something like $ 2 trillion in emergency loans and other goodies .
All efforts by Grayson and others to find out who exactly got this money were rebuffed by the Fed governors .
Bloomberg sued for disclosure and won in Federal court .
The Fed is appealing the ruling .
If Sanders - Paul prevails , the GAO will audit case - by - case and the facts are sure to reveal new scandals of cozy deal - making .
The Fed did a backdoor bailout of its own without official approval from Congress or anyone — three or four times larger than the TARP bailout approved by Congress .
Grayson flavorfully explained : " When we finally see what the Federal Reserve has been up to , the public will be outraged , " he said .
" The Federal Reserve ’s arguments for secrecy are — and always have been — a ruse to cover up the handing out of billions of dollars like party favors to the Wall Street institutions who brought the American economy to the brink of ruin . "
When the audit bill passed the House last year , I am sure administration officials assumed they could snuff it the Senate .
Senator Sanders instead played a shrewd hand , skillfully building right - left support .
But this measure is actually not an ideological issue nor even " populist " revolt .
It ’s " good government reform " that every senator would support if a lot of them were not in tank to the bank lobby or intimidated by the mystique of the Fed / .
When Sanders had clearly developed majority support , Senator Chris Dodd , the banking chair , sued for compromise .
Sanders gave up some ground ( and was instantly denounced as a " sellout ’ by rightwing blogger ) but the limited compromise was not fatal ( and might still be repaired in conference negotiations with the House ) .
The most important thing Sanders gave up was authorization for ongoing audits every year .
Now it will be one time only .
But Sanders did get agreement the Federal Reserve would immediately post its " party favors " on the web for all to investigate .
This victory — if and when it ’s complete — is a major marker on the road to much deeper reform of the central bank — its sheltered monetary policy , the concentrated power of the financial system and the cowardly habits of Congress .
This year ’s reform , in other words , is only the beginning .
More facts will insure that the public does not lose its anger but instead raises its demands .
I did a post a couple days back about my mixed reactions to the iPad .
I also started writing about AT&T but it ran so long that I realized it was really a new post .
The upshot is that I am both bewildered and fascinated by AT&T 's suicidal tendencies .
I suspect that the people who run that company have not quite come to grips with the deadly mix of their horrible system and the brilliantly managed Apple stores -- where so many people are forced to purchase their services .
I wonder if they realize that each Apple store appears to serve as a grass roots organization for providing people with bad experiences with AT&T , watching others have bad experiences with AT&T , and an arena for telling and listening to horror stories about AT&T among customers and Apple employees .
If a panel of experts tried to design a system to destroy AT&T 's reputation among its most valuable customers and salespeople , I am not sure they could do a better job than what seems to be happening in Apple stores throughout the country .
Rather than buying a new iPad last week , I thought about waiting for the iPad that allows you to connect to the web anywhere through an AT&T account ( not just via wifi as my model does ) .
But I have had so many experiences with that deeply defective organization that I do whatever I can to avoid entanglements with AT&T .
I have had multiple lousy experiences with AT&T in recent months , and based on my experience at least , I suggest you never believe any of their promises and always assume they are up selling you .
They do n't care about you , they just want to squeeze every cent out of you .
I also found that when they up , they often are n't trained well - enough to explain the strings attached and limitations .
My worst and most intriguing experience in recent months happened one Friday in March when my wife , two teenage daughters , and I were trapped in the Apple store in downtown Palo Alto .
Our salesperson there spent a full four hours trying to get something done for us with AT&T .
I thought it would be pretty easy but turned out to be absurdly complicated -- we were buying one new iPhone and replacing another that had been stolen from my daughter .
The Apple guy ultimately succeeded despite dozens of obstacles put up by AT&T 's people , system , and rules ( which were interpreted differently by just about every employee he and we dealt with , by the way ) .
Our Apple guy succeeded only through his raw persistence and because , as he explained , he had learned that such a high percentage of the AT&T people are so incompetent , that sometimes the best thing to do is to just hang - up and start from scratch ( in hopes the next one will be competent ) .
I believe that , in the process of making this happen , at least 10 different phone calls were made to At&T , some by him and some by us .
During this time , we talked to virtually every employee and manager in the place , and each assured us that our salesperson was among their best people .
The problem , they explained , was that AT&T can be impossible and time - consuming to deal with -- and their system meshes very poorly with Apple 's in many ways .
An added problem is that the AT&T people are apparently on a flawed incentive system .
So rather than actually trying to what was best for us as customers or relationships with Apple , there was constant up selling directly to us and through our Apple person -- which he resisted and advised us to ignore .
He also reported that , on multiple occasions , AT&T employees resisted doing what was needed to get our phones working because it meant they would get no incentive pay ( I never quite understood this , but I heard him say many times to AT&T employees something like " I know this will mean you do n't get your incentive , but this is how what we have to do it to serve the customer . " )
I was amazed to find that AT&T does not have a dedicated hot line that enables Apple salespeople and " Geniuses " to connect directly to AT&T people who are especially trained to deal with Apple stores as Apple sells so many AT&T accounts -- but apparently that is n't the case .
I would give At&T a solid " F " on customer service , relationships with a key vendor , incentive system , and organization based on my recent experiences with them .
I would love to have a film of our experience in the Apple store to show to AT&T executives .
We were there so long that virtually every employee in the place at one time or another came up to us and told us there favorite story about how much AT&T sucked and how lucky we were to have the most skilled and persistent person in the place helping us .
Also , quite a few customers overheard the stories or asked us what was going on , and jumped into the conversation with their own bad experiences .
This was a busy Friday night at the store closest to Steve Jobs ' house , and in fact , it was the store where he made a surprise appearance the day the iPad was released .
Perhaps AT&T ought to spend less money advertising and brag less about wonderful they are and devote more attention to fixing their defective system and improving their training .
I especially believe that they do n't quite fathom how much damage their incentive system does because it focuses their people away from helping customers and toward getting as much money as possible out of them .
Perhaps they should read Steve Kerr 's classic " On The Folly of Rewarding A , While Hoping for B . "
In any event , for better worse , the effect of all this is that tens of thousands of customers a day get to experience Apple 's competence and AT&T 's incompetence side - by - side in a public arena .
This contrast not only affects the particular employees and customers involved in a given transaction , it often spreads to many others in the setting -- especially when it is a long ugly one like ours .
If you are an AT&T executive , you do n't need a fancy survey , you do n't need a marketing consultant , just walk into a few Apple stores and ask employees and customers what they think of your company and why .
And stand around awhile and watch the dynamics surrounding the especially bad customer experiences .
Apple stores create experiences that teach customers and key opinion leaders to despise your company and see it as greedy , incompetent , and out of touch .
As always , I assume I am biased and my experiences are not representative .
Am I being unfair to AT&T ?
Have others had good experiences with them , especially in Apple stores ?
Note that I had good experiences when I simply bought my iPhone , but whenever anything at all complicated has happened , it has been awful .
There are now a number of books and courses available relating to how we might deal with the challenges of peak oil in the future .
I 'll mention a few I have run across , and ask that you mention ones that you want to recommend .
If you could give a little information on the approach the person takes , that might be helpful , because different folks have different approaches , and some of us like one approach better than another .
In the books department , one that comes to mind is Dmitry Orlov 's book Reinventing Collapse : The Soviet Example and American Prospects .
Dmitry Orlav experienced the Russian collapse , so comes with his own perspective on how things will work out , and what will be important .
It seems to me he would stress flexibility above all - - perhaps moving often , fitting in with the new system .
He also does presentations -- this is a link to a recent one .
A recent book I ran across is Oil Dusk : A Peak Oil Story by John Cape and Laura Buckner .
This is the fictional story about the challenges a family faces when a drop in the value of the dollar leads to a steep rise in the price of oil .
The book is well done , and not overly scary , because while the high price of oil has some moderately bad consequences , somehow , the family seems to fare pretty well -- in part because of preparations made by the grandfather , who has since passed on .
The back of the book mentions a number of peak oil resources , including The Oil Drum .
This is a link to the book 's web site .
Many of you know that Andre Angelantoni ( known as aangel on The Oil Drum ) has a website called PostPeakLiving that features sustainability courses .
I recently attended his uncrash course .
Jason Bradford of our staff presents the foods portion of the class .
Andre and Jason do a good job .
I would describe the focus as somewhat on peak oil education and somewhat on preparation for a downslope - - buying electric bicycles ; making copies of records governments may not have the staff to provide later ; and having a buffer of some food in storage , for example .
Besides his regular courses , Andre has a new course taught by Carolyn Baker that will be starting April 24 that has to do with dealing with the psychological aspects of peak oil .
The course is called Navigating the Coming Chaos of Unprecedented Transitions .
Dr. Baker is a former psychotherapist .
Some of the topics her course will cover include " Healing through the dark emotions , " " Mirth - making amid crumbling and chaos , " and " Bringing back the world " .
I do n't there is any " One Size Fits All " when it comes to post peak books and courses .
Each of us will have different needs at different times .
Since we do n't really know for certain what the future will hold , we can't say for sure that one course or book is more correct in its view than another .
What books or courses would you like to mention ?
It might be helpful if you can tell a little about them , to help us distinguish one from another .
We do n't run ads , and I am not aware of peak oil websites that do , so it makes it somewhat difficult for people to get the " word out " about what they are doing .
Indigenous tribes say the Belo Monte dam poses a threat to their way of life Bidding for contracts to build a huge hydroelectric dam on a tributary of the Amazon in Brazil has been stopped for a second time .
A court granted an injunction halting the auction due later in the day .
The government says the Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River is crucial for economic development .
Indigenous groups and environmentalists oppose the dam , saying thousands of people will be displaced and a sensitive ecosystem damaged .
The latest development came just a day before Tuesday 's planned auction and it is highly likely there will be further legal wrangling .
A spokesman for Brazil 's electric energy agency , Aneel , indicated that the auction would go ahead if the injunction was lifted at the last minute .
Last week , a judge ruled bidding could proceed , overturning an earlier order to halt .
The proposal to build a hydro-electric dam on the Xingu river , a tributary of the Amazon in the northern state of Para , has long been a source of controversy .
The initial project was abandoned in the 1990s amid widespread protests both in Brazil and around the world .
Environmental groups say the Belo Monte dam will threaten the survival of indigenous groups , and the lives of up to 40,000 people could be affected as 500 sq km of land would be flooded .
The government says whoever is awarded the project will have to pay $ 800 m to protect the environment .
Belo Monte would be third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu , which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay .
It is expected to provide electricity to 23 million Brazilian homes .
With Brazil 's economy continuing to show signs of growth , ministers say hydro- electric plants are a vital way to ensure power supplies over the next decade - and at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region .
Critics say the Belo Monte plant will be hugely inefficient , generating less than 10 % of its capacity during the three to four months of the low - water season .

Workers walk outside the London Stock Exchange October 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andrew Winning
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Women might be on a more even footing at work but at home their careers tend to take a backseat to their husband ’s job with women most likely to quit when both are working long hours , according to a U.S. study .
Researcher Youngjoo Cha , from Cornell University , found that working women with a husband who worked 50 hours or more a week found themselves still doing most of the housework and the care giving and were more likely to end up quitting their job .
An analysis of 8,484 professional workers and 17,648 nonprofessionals from dual - earner families showed that if women had a husband who worked 60 hours or more per week it increased the woman ’s odds of quitting her paid job by 42 percent .
Cha said the odds of quitting increased to 51 percent for professional women whose husbands work 60 hours or more per week , and for professional mothers the odds they would quit their jobs jumped 112 percent .
However , it did not significantly affect a man ’s odds of quitting his job if his wife worked 60 hours or more per week , according to the study published in the American Sociological Review in April .
For professional men , both parents and non-parents , the effects of a wife working long hours were negligible , according to the study called “ Reinforcing Separate Spheres : The Effect of Spousal Overwork on Men ’s and Women ’s Employment in Dual - Earner Households . ”
“ As long work - hours introduce conflict between work and family into many dual - earner families , couples often resolve conflict in ways that prioritize husbands ’ careers , ” Cha , who used data from the U.S. Census Bureau , said in a statement .
“ This effect is magnified among workers in professional and managerial occupations , where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting tend to be strongest .
The findings suggest that the prevalence of overwork may lead many dual - earner couples to return to a separate spheres arrangement -- breadwinning men and homemaking women . ”
I met Ernest Logan Bell , a 25 - year - old Marine Corps veteran , as he walked along Route 12 in upstate New York with a large American flag strapped to the side of his green backpack .
There was a light drizzle and he was wearing a green Army poncho .
Bell was on a six - day , 90 - mile - long self - styled “ Liberty Walk ” from Binghamton to Utica in a quixotic campaign to challenge Democratic incumbent Rep. Michael Arcuri in the 24th Congressional District .
He camped out along the road for three nights and stayed in cheap motels the other nights and was accompanied by Kevin Barlow , an unemployed welder .
Bell opposes the health care law , calls for an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , advocates the abolishment of the Federal Reserve , is against the bailouts for Wall Street and wants to see immediate government relief for workers trapped in prolonged unemployment , including his own .
He carried a handwritten sign : “ End the Fed . ”
In his backpack he had a copy of “ The U.S. Constitution for Dummies ” and a book on the Federal Reserve by Ron Paul that he planned to deliver to Arcuri ’s office in Utica .
Bell , who lives in Lansing , N.Y. , is the new face of resistance .
He is young , at home in the culture of the military , deeply suspicious of the federal government , disgusted by the liberal elite , unable to find work and angry .
He swings between right - wing and left - wing populism , expressing admiration for Reps .
Paul and Dennis Kucinich and the tea party movement .
He started out as a supporter of John McCain in the last presidential election but soured on the Arizona senator and the Republican Party ’s ties to Wall Street .
He did not vote in that election .
He has raised about $ 1,000 from neighbors and friends for his own campaign .
He is adept at martial arts and made it to the semifinals of the 2010 Army National Guard Combative Championship at Fort Benning in Georgia , in which , in his last bout , he suffered a broken nose , bruised his opponent ’s ribs and thighs and lost in a split decision .
Bell grew up in Oakwood , Texas , a small town in East Texas between Dallas and Houston .
His father was an alcoholic , and his parents frequently separated and reunited .
They divorced when he was 13 .
His mother raised Bell , his younger brother , who is currently in the Army ’s 82nd Airborne , and his younger sister in a tiny one - bedroom apartment .
There was little money , and his mother worked off and on at odd jobs .
There were 18 people in his high school graduating class and , with no real jobs in Oakwood , Bell , along with a few of his classmates , joined the military .
“ You could n’t stay in Oakwood , Texas , and have a job , ” he said flatly .
“ I got out of the Marine Corps and went back to Texas for 10 months and was involved in the John McCain campaign , ” he said .
“ I really got disillusioned with the neoconservatism .
I had never been involved in politics .
The idea that we needed all these troops all around the world defending freedom , as they called it , when we were actually engaged in nation - building and supporting special interests that drive these wars , was something I began to understand .
As far as foreign and economic policy , I could see there was no difference between the two main political parties .
There is a false left - right paradigm which diverts the working class from the real reasons for their hardships . ”
“ I just walked through the town of Norwich , ” he told me as a car passed and the driver honked his support for Bell , “ and there is a strong tea party movement there .
The tea party movement , for the most part , is just a bunch of disgruntled Americans .
They know something is wrong and they are ready to be engaged .
A lot of the people in my area who are in the tea party are Democrats .
People are confused .
They are shellshocked .
They do n’t know what to think .
But acting like these problems started Jan. 20 [ the date of the presidential inauguration ] is absurd .
To single out the current president and not the presidents before him is not productive for trying to figure out what is going on . ”
Bell ’s own employment struggle mirrors that of many of his neighbors .
He moved to upstate New York two years ago after leaving the Marine Corps to be near Shianne , his 3 - year - old daughter .
He and the girl ’s mother are separated .
Bell found work as a carpenter with a traveling construction crew .
He earned $ 14.50 an hour and could sometimes make as much as $ 800 a week .
Then the financial meltdown knocked the wind out of the local economy .
“ Everybody in my apartment building has had their hours cut , are unemployed or have taken minimum - wage jobs , ” he said .
“ I was laid off last year .
I try to find work as an independent carpenter .
I do n’t have health insurance . ”
The dearth of work , which left him attempting to survive at times on $ 600 a month , saw him enlist last year in the New York National Guard , even though it means almost certain deployment to Afghanistan .
The enticement of a $ 20,000 signing bonus was too lucrative to pass up .
The National Guard unit he joined recently returned from a tour in Afghanistan .
“ We are training to go back to Afghanistan , ” he said .
“ The fact that they are still using Army National Guard , state - level troops , to police the streets of Afghanistan is not good .
These units are really overstretched .
We do not get the benefits .
We do n’t get health insurance like active - duty military .
But the guard gets deployed just as much .
Some of these guys have been on three and four tours .
”
“ The winters [ in New York state ] are really hard , ” Bell said .
“ There are less jobs and the heating costs are high .
I pay about $ 200 a month for electric and gas .
I live really cheaply .
I do n’t have cable .
I do n’t go out or spend money that is not necessary .
It is a struggle .
But at least I have not had to devote 40 hours a week to a minimum - wage job that does not pay me a living wage .
People here are really hurting .
The real underemployment rate must be at least 20 percent .
A lot of people are working part - time jobs when they want full - time jobs .
There are many people like me , independent contractors and small business owners , who ca n’t file for unemployment insurance .
Unemployment [ coverage ] is not available to me because I worked as a ‘ 1099 , ’ a self - employed contractor , even when I worked for the construction company . ”
“ People are scared , ” he said .
“ They want to live their lives , raise their children and be happy .
This is not possible .
They do n’t know if they can make their next mortgage payment .
They see their standard of living going down . ”
Bell said that he and those around him were being pushed off the edge .
He said he feared that the social and political repercussions would be unpleasant .
“ I hope there is a populist revolution , ” he said .
“ We have to take the corporate bailouts and the money we are sending overseas and use that money in our communities .
If this does not happen there will be more anger and eventually violence .
When people lose everything they start to ‘ lose it . ’
When you ca n’t find a job , even though you look repeatedly , it leads to things like random shootings and suicides .
We will see acts of domestic terrorism .
The state will erode more of our civil liberties to control mass protests .
We are seeing some student protests , but we will see these on a wider scale .
I hope the protests will be constructive .
I hope people will not resort to extreme measures .
But people will do what they have to do to survive .
This may mean things like food riots .
The political establishment better work very fast to take the pressure off . ”
The Nation 's Christopher Hayes has a curious piece up .
This excerpt just about covers the narrative arc :
Last September , I was at some off - the - record Washington dinner and happened to be at the table of a Democratic Congressman .
He 'd just gotten back from recess in his district , where he'd been subjected to the full Tea Party treatment .
As he described the rage he'd witnessed , it was clear he was spooked .
I remember thinking he was more scared of voting for the healthcare bill than he was of voting against it , and that was going to be a problem .
I thought about that Congressman this past Sunday as I watched more than 700 protesters from National People 's Action gather on the front lawn at the home of Gregory Baer , deputy counsel for the Bank Regulatory and Public Policy Group at Bank of America . [… ]
I 'm dispositionally inclined to cringe at actions like this : I do n't like conflict ; I feel bad for the dude who 's having his Sunday ruined .
But I got over that real quick when Trenda Kennedy of Springfield , Illinois , took the bullhorn on Baer 's steps .
" In America , every seven seconds one of our homes goes into foreclosure , " she said .
" My home is one of those ! " [… ]
All of this is part of a nationwide series of direct actions called " Showdown in America , " spearheaded by NPA , the People Improving Communities through Organizing ( PICO ) network and the Service Employees International ( SEIU ) .
The campaign aims to dismantle the entire Wall Street–Washington corporatist axis , which gave us the financial crisis , the bailouts and 7 million foreclosures since 2008 , a million of which have ended in repossession .
It 's about damn time .
We have witnessed the greatest implosion of American capitalism in nearly a century , and the only grassroots movement the cataclysm seems to have birthed is a right - wing populist backlash . [… ]
If we 're going to get reform on the scale we need , bank lobbyists and members of Congress alike have to be confronted with the terrifying thought that the system from which they profit might just be run over — that 700 angry protesters might show up on their lawn any given Sunday .
On September 22 , 1969 ,
The Band
released the great
self - titled album
that includes what became one of their most famous songs , “ The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down . ”
Like many of The Band ’s songs , it was primarily written by lead guitarist Robbie Robertson . , with creative contributions from the other Band members : Levon Helm , Rick Danko , Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel .
The haunting lyrics tell a tale about the end of the American Civil War , as recalled by a common Confederate soldier and farmer .
It opens with the plaintive voice of Helm , singing the now well - known words of the first verse .
Other Band members added harmonies on the chorus , which begins with the line that gave the name its title .
“ Virgil Caine is the name , and I served on the Danville train ,
‘ Til Stoneman ’s cavalry came and tore up the tracks again .
In the winter of ‘ 65 , we were hungry , just barely alive .
By May the 10th , Richmond had fell , it ’s a time I remember oh so well .
The night they drove Old Dixie down ... ”
On The Band ’s website , there ’s an interesting in - depth article about the song ’s lyrics , compiled by teacher , author and music historian Peter Viney .
As it notes , Richmond had indeed already fallen by “ May the 10th . ”
But that ’s not the date when Richmond fell .
Richmond , Virginia — the capital of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War — actually fell to Union troops on the night of April 2 , 1865 .
That night was , in many ways , the death knell for the Confederacy and the metaphorical “ night they drove Old Dixie down . ”
The fall of Richmond came after a long siege that started in 1864 .
During those months , Union Army troops led by Gen. George Stoneman repeatedly tore up the Danville tracks and other railroad lines into the city to keep supplies from reaching Confederate soldiers and civilians .
Meanwhile , as ordered by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant , the top Union commander , Gen. Phil Sheridan laid waste to the farmland surrounding Richmond .
In The Penguin Book of The American Civil War , historian Bruce Catton wrote :
“ A Federal army trying to take Richmond could never be entirely secure until the Confederates were deprived of all use of the ( fertile and productive ) Shenandoah Valley , and it was up to Sheridan to deprive them of it .
Grant ’s instructions were grimly specific .
He wanted the rich farmlands so thoroughly despoiled that the place could no longer support a Confederate army ; he told Sheridan to devastate the whole area so thoroughly that a crow flying across the Valley would have to carry its own rations .
This Sheridan set out to do …
Few campaigns in the war aroused more bitterness than this one . ”
By late March of 1865 , Confederate troops and citizens in Richmond were literally starving .
It was clear the city would soon fall .
So , on April 2 , 1865 , Confederate President Jefferson Davis , his Cabinet , and most of the remaining Confederate troops and civilians abandoned Richmond and fled south .
At the time , people called it “ Evacuation Sunday . ”
Robbie Robertson gave it the more poignant name , “ the night they drove Old Dixie down . ”
That day , Confederate soldiers were ordered to set fire to the armories and warehouses they left behind .
The fires spread , setting Richmond ablaze and devastating large areas of the city .
The “ Fall of Richmond ” led to a rapidly unfolding downward spiral for the South .
By April 9 , Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse .
On May 5 , the Confederate Government was dissolved .
The Civil War was officially over .
However , two final war - related events did occur on the May 10th date noted in The Band ’s song .
On May 10 , 1865 , Union troops captured Jefferson Davis in Georgia .
By then , most Confederate troops had laid down their arms and accepted the amnesty terms offered by President Abraham Lincoln .
But there were a few die - hards , like the notorious “ Bushwhacker ” William Quantrill , who kept up a guerrilla - style fight .
On May 10 , 1865 , Quantrill was ambushed by Union troops in Kentucky and fatally wounded .
He lingered for almost a month before he finally died on June 6 .

Satire alert .
Time magazine ’s publicists inform me that there is a duke - out going on between Lady Gaga fans and those of Iranian Green Movement leader Mir Hosain Mousavi .
So , below , I offer the top ten differences between the two .
First the announcement :
‘ Lady Gaga fans are protesting the results of TIME .
com ’s TIME 100 online poll , where readers have been casting their votes for the person they think merits a spot on this year ’s TIME 100 list of the 100 most influential people in the world .
Gaga fans are accusing supporters of the winner , Iranian opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi , of fraud by stuffing the online ballot box .
Gaga was leading the poll and was then toppled by Mousavi .
“ We ’re not voting or supporting this until Mir-Hossein Mousavi is disqualified , ” exclaimed an outraged Gaga fansite webmaster in an email to TIME.com , who continued “ They were cheating and we have proof . ”
Note : no improprieties have been discovered in the polling smackdown .
. .
This year , Mousavi came in first place with more than 830,000 votes to Lady Gaga ’s third place showing with about 412,000 votes .
. . .
The TIME 100 issue with the actual TIME 100 list chosen by TIME editors , which will include Mousavi , will be released online on Thursday , April 29th . ‘
Top Ten Differences between Lady Gaga and Mir Hosain Mousavi :
1. Mousavi , a reformist , favors women being able to show their faces .
Lady Gaga favors wearing masks .
2. Mousavi ‘ sat poker - faced through each sarcastic onslaught ’ of his presidential debate opponent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Lady Gaga merely sang a song , “ Poker Face . ”
3 . In those presidential debates of May , 2009 , Mousavi rejected Ahmadinejad on the grounds that the incumbent is a drama queen who had made Iran a laughingstock with his histrionics .
In contrast , in her song , “ Bad Romance , ” Lady Gaga says “ I want your ugly / I want your disease . . . I want your drama . ”
4 . The Iranian government tried to stop Mousavi ’s ‘ Facebook revolution , ’ so called because demonstrators used the social networking site to organize their massive demonstrations .
On the other hand , Lady Gaga was among the most mentioned names on Facebook during 2009 .
5. Mousavi on several occasions was prevented from receiving phone calls from his followers , who were trying to arrange demonstrations , because the fearful regime turned off cellphone service in the capital .
Lady Gaga sings in a duet with Beyoncé entitled “ Telephone ” that she does not want to receive phone calls .
6 . Demonstrators against the theocratic government in Iran often tried to conceal their faces so that the secret police could not photograph them and track them down .
In her song “ Paparrazzi , Lady Gaga speaks of being eager to be photographed with her friend .
7. Zahra Rahnevard , Mousavi ’s ‘ Islamic feminist ’ wife , aimed to be first lady of Iran .
Little known fact : Gaga Ahmadinejad is presently first lady of Iran , according to sarcastic Gossip Girl staff .
8. Many of Mir Hosain Mousavi ’s student supporters on college campuses were expelled .
Only one of Lady Gaga ’s ‘ little monster ’ fans was sent home from school– for wearing a controversial t- shirt .
9 . Mousavi disagrees with superstitious clerical leaders , one of whom says that unveiled women cause extramarital affairs , which cause earthquakes .
Lady Gaga dressed provocatively while pledging earthquake relief aid .
10 . Mir Hosain Mousavi clearly has cojones , to challenge the entire Iranian government .
Lady Gaga in contrast is only falsely rumored to have cojones .
Satire alert .
Disclosing MI5 files about the July 7 suicide bombers to the families of those killed in the London attacks would be " impossible " , counsel for the Security Service and the home secretary said today .
Investigating claims that MI5 could have prevented the 2005 atrocities would involve " handing over the keys " to MI5's Thames House headquarters , Neil Garnham QC told a hearing to decide the scope of the inquests into the bombings .
He said sensitive intelligence could be seen by the coroner and counsel to the inquests .
However , any jurors would be subjected to intrusive vetting , he said , and neither the bereaved families nor their lawyers would be allowed to see it .
He said two reports by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee ( ISC ) had adequately investigated MI5 's involvement .
He admitted the committee was not " institutionally independent " because it was appointed by and reported to the prime minister , but he said it was operationally independent .
Last year , the committee emphasised MI5 's lack of resources before 2005 .
Even if MI5 had had more resources , it would not have made a difference , a report said , because its action was " directed by the assessment of the threat " .
Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer had appeared on MI5 's radar but were not identified .
There was nothing to suggest they warranted attention above other targets , the committee said .
The coroner , Lady Justice Hallett , asked whether it would be possible to restrict material to the July 7 attacks .
" The families want to know why the decisions were taken in the way they were , and to put questions , " she said .
The problem was , said Garnham , how to isolate the July 7 decision from all the other investigations MI5 was carrying out .
" It is difficult to see how that can be done without , metaphorically speaking , handing over the keys to Thames House . "
Patrick O'Connor QC , representing families of the victims , told the hearing on Tuesday that there were flaws in MI5 's assessment policy , record - keeping and co-operation with other agencies .
“ The financial difficulties of local governments in consequence both of the inflation and deflation of real estate values demonstrates strikingly the unwisdom of a revenue system concentrated so heavily upon real estate … . ”
– Herbert D. Simpson , Meeting of the American Economic Association , 1933
On March 10 , 2010 , the Kansas City Missouri School Board voted to close nearly half its schools ( 28 of 58 ) .
On the same day , Illinois Governor Pat Quinn warned that if the state income tax is not raised by 1 % , education will face “ draconian cuts . ”
To employ the most hackneyed metaphor of the recent financial meltdown , we are only in the first inning of municipal deflation in the United States .
This has not gained much attention in the recovery vs. recession debate .
Yet , states and municipalities spend around twice as much money as the federal government .
( Since only the federal government can print money , this comparison may have changed in the last year . )
The gap between tax receipts and spending is forcing big changes in Missouri and Illinois , though it is probable these cuts are miniscule in comparison to what is ahead .
A recovery is expected in tax receipts by those who think the economy is rebounding , but in fact the broad swath of municipalities will suffer deeper reductions in tax receipts for a long time to come .
( Municipalities – cities and towns – receive most of their revenue from real estate taxes .
State revenues are skewed towards income , corporate , and sales taxes . )
The Great Depression taught this lesson but it was tossed in some ash heap of history .
Revered economists are particularly immune to events that contradict their theories .
In the 1938 Alfred Hitchcock movie , The Lady Vanishes , the mistaken psychiatrist is told : “ You must think of a fresh theory . ”
Doctor Hartz responds : “ It is not necessary .
My theory was perfectly good .
The facts were misleading . ”
Doctor Hartz had a sound reason not to change his theory since reconsideration may have precluded his intent to murder his victim .
In a similar vein , intended or not , Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin espoused a murderous theory that has claimed many victims :
“ To begin with , the bursting of asset price bubbles often does not lead to financial instability … .
There are even stronger reasons to believe that a bursting of a bubble in house prices is unlikely to produce financial instability … .
In the absence of financial instability , monetary policy should be effective in countering the effects of a burst bubble . ”
This prediction was made in January 2007 before the Forecaster ’s Club of New York .
( Novelists shy from such parody . )
Current theories and books written about the Depression do not dwell on the 1920s real estate boom .
Real estate lending in the 1920s might rival the recent debacle , in form if not degree .
There was a flight to the suburbs .
The building balloon included houses , roads , sewers , schools , skyscrapers , and highways that crossed the country for the first time .
When Treasury “ Secretary Mellon endeavored to cut back federal spending , state and local governments stepped up spending at a rate that more than offset the Mellon program … . ”
This was speculative building on a grand scale , as Professor Herbert D. Simpson of Northwestern University informed the Forty - Fifth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association in 1933 : “ Throughout this period there was another form of real estate speculation , not commonly classified as such , but one that has had disastrous consequences .
This is the real estate ‘ speculation ’ carried on by municipal governments , in the sense of basing approximately 80 per cent of their revenues upon real estate and then proceeding to erect a structure of public expenditure and public debt whose security depended largely on a continuance on the rate of profits and appreciation that had characterized the period from 1922 - 29 . ”
In The Crash and Its Aftermath , A History of Securities Markets in the United States , 1929 - 1933 , Barrie Wigmore wrote :
“ Municipal governments were expected to be an active countervailing force in the anticipated business downturn after the Crash .
However , many municipalities were not in a position financially to bear the twin burdens of unemployment relief and capital construction … . ”
It is easy to see why .
Municipalities were spending because tax receipts rose .
Since tax receipts rose , local governments could leverage growth through bond issues .
Outstanding municipal bond debt doubled in the 1920s .
Over the same period , federal government debt fell by 30 % .
With nothing learned , states and municipalities borrowed $ 23 billion in 2000 and $ 215 billion in 2007 .
One reason credit rained on bubbly school committees was the ever - rising revenue stream from real estate taxes : receipts increased from $ 254 billion in 2000 to $ 421 billion in 2008 .
Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin dismissed the body blows of real - estate bubbles , but A.M. Hillhouse , author of Municipal Bonds : A Century of Experience , wrote in 1936 :
“ [ T ] he major portion of overbonding by municipalities arises out of real estate booms … .
The prize crop of boom bond troubles of all time came with the collapse of the Florida real estate speculation in 1926 . ”
In consequence , the property tax in West Palm Beach , Florida was raised to 42.5 % of assessed value .
This effort to balance the books failed .
At the 1933 meeting of the American Economic Association , Simpson was not a happy professor :
“ During this period of prosperity , real estate taxes were paid with little complaint … .
[ U ] nder these conditions , public expenditures expanded and taxes were increased without protest … .
The result has been a structure of public expenditure which has been difficult to curtail , and a volume of indebtedness whose solvency is now jeopardized on a large scale . ”
Simpson delivered his paper at the bottom of the Depression but the number of beleaguered municipalities kept rising until 1935 , when there were at least 3,252 municipal issues in default .
There are at least three reasons to think current municipal problems will be worse .
First , the latest real estate bubble has probably been much bigger and more leveraged than in the 1920s .
Second , expenses are not as easy to cut .
The earlier retrenchment was not hamstrung by bloated government retiree pension and health benefits .
Third , property assessments lag current prices .
This promises to be a fierce battle .
Towns want to hold the status quo so are in no hurry to tax properties at falling market values ; residents do not want to fund comfortable teacher retirements when they are wondering what happened to their own pension plans .
At the One Hundred Twenty - First Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association in 2009 , Professor Frederic Mishkin ( who has departed the Fed and returned to Columbia University ) contributed a paper , “ Is Monetary Policy Effective During Financial Crises ? ”
Whatever he had to say , may it gather dust as the world learns the lessons taught and discarded by Professor Herbert D. Simpson .

Chocolate or vanilla ?
Red or white wine ?
Kindle or iPad ?
For those who can't make up their minds , there 's always a combo option : choco - vanilla swirl , Rosé and — now — the Entourage eDGe , an e-reader that doubles as a tablet .
This quirky device contains two screens that fold together like a book , letting you read a Malcolm Gladwell book on the black - and - white E Ink screen while you update your Facebook status on the adjacent color LCD display .
You 'd think this mash - up would be fabulous .
It 's not .
Despite our initial enthusiasm , after testing the eDGe we found it to be a Frankenstein - ish monster that 's hobbled by a slow processor , some puzzling design choices and touchscreen technology that seems like it was cooked up during the Clinton administration .
At three pounds , the eDGe is five times as heavy as a Kindle and nearly twice the heft of the upcoming iPad .
It 's comparable in weight to the average netbook , but since you almost always have to cradle the eDGe in your arms , it gets irritating to tote it around for more than an hour .
A hinge allows the eDGe 's screens to pivot around into several different configurations : tablet , notebook - like clamshell or , with the hinge in a vertical position , book .
It 's fun and adds versatility .
Unfortunately , the eDGe lacks an accelerometer , so you need to manually click a button whenever you change orientations .
What really hobbles the eDGe is its processor : a Marvell Armada PXA168 1.2 GHz .
( Software limitations further cripple the chip by limiting it to just 800 MHz ) .
Performance feels sluggish .
Just booting up the machine can take up to 30 seconds .
Web browsing or opening up documents is not zippy and for those who are used to increasingly powerful smartphones , this slowness can be rather annoying .
Screen input is another frustrating area .
On the E Ink side , you can make handwritten notes and annotations ( or write in the included " Digital Diary " ) using the provided stylus .
On the LCD side , resistive touchscreen technology means you can use the stylus or your finger .
But the eDGe 's display requires hard pressure , long fingernails or the stylus to make it work .
That 's particularly a problem when it comes to the device 's virtual keyboard , which you need to use frequently .
To its credit , the E Ink screen is beautiful in its simplicity and readability , even in bright sunlight .
At 9.7 inches , it 's also much larger than the 6 - inch screen found on most e-readers .
Entourage has an online bookstore that has a much smaller selection than Amazon.com , but it 's neatly designed and easy to use .
The eDGe supports ePub and PDF file formats , and you can load your own documents .
On the LCD side , the eDGe has an Android user interface that 's almost identical to that seen in most smartphones .
Though there 's no access to the Android Market for apps , Entourage says it will let developers create apps just for the device .
The 10.1 - inch screen is decent .
The browser , while not blazingly fast , is functional enough to check e-mail , surf the internet and even watch some online video .
It does support Adobe Flash Lite but we had trouble loading many YouTube videos — though it was n't clear if that 's the fault of the device or the Wi-Fi connectivity .
The lack of a 3G wireless data option and the surprising omission of an Ethernet port means the eDGe can only get internet connectivity via Wi -Fi .
But the company says a 3G model could be available in the future .
Entourage also promises a firmware update that , they say , will fix the eDGe 's poor battery life : just about two hours of active use in our tests , and a mere eight hours on standby .
If there 's a reason for being decisive ( even though choco - vanilla swirl is ever so delish ) the eDGe offers one .
The 50:50 option of the eDGe leaves you wishing you had n't compromised .
Our advice : Make up your mind , and get either a Kindle or an iPad .
I can't say the thought ever occurred to me , but apparently enough people think it 's a good idea to get high , film themselves and post the results to YouTube that psychologists at San Diego State University were able to use the crowd - created video archive to do one of the first studies of the drug 's behavioral impacts .
Why study how people act when they 're high on Salvia ?
Despite carrying a lot of the same cultural trappings as pot , Salvia is actually pretty unique , from a chemical standpoint .
In fact , that was part of why it was legal in so much of the U.S. for so long — the chemical structure was n't close enough to any already - outlawed drugs to be automatically covered as an analog under the same bans .
Not surprisingly , Salvia 's effects on the human brain are also very different , and science does n't know much about those effects , says Mind Hacks ' Vaughan Bell .
Pharmacologically , it is fascinating as it seems to have its major effect on kappa opioid receptors .
These are not the same opioid receptors that drugs like heroin and morphine work on , so the effects are very different , but it is a completely different mechanism to virtually all other hallucinogenic drugs ( only ibogaine is known to have a similar effect on the brain ) .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A rising star on the Christian music scene is returning to the public eye with a new identity after a mysterious seven - year absence spent mostly on the other side of the world .
Jennifer Knapp is not only coming out with a new album , she is also “ coming out , ” a term the Grammy - nominated singer / songwriter considers “ very bizarre ” as she nervously relaunches her career .
The 36 - year - old Kansas native , who dated men during her college days , is braced for a backlash from religious fans who faithfully shot down whispered rumors about her sexuality over the years .
On the other hand , she said in a recent interview with Reuters , “ I ’m definitely getting a lot more friendly winks from the girls ( at her concerts ) than I have in the past ! ”
No other singer of Knapp ’s renown in the Christian music genre is openly gay .
In the past , the industry looked dimly on those who deviated from the straight and narrow .
Radio stations and retailers quickly dropped Sandi Patty and Michael English after they admitted to ( separate ) extra-marital affairs during the 1990s .
Amy Grant was also blacklisted when she went through a divorce later that decade .
All have since been forgiven to varying degrees .
Knapp is taking a preemptive stand anyway .
She has recorded a mainstream album , and is not specifically targeting Christian radio stations and retailers .
“ I just would n’t find it respectful at all to say , ‘ Hey , this is something that you want in your store next to your Jesus statue , ’ ” she said .
“ It would just be disingenuous to try and convince someone that they needed to do that . ”
BORN AGAIN , AGAIN ?
Still , Knapp considers herself a “ person of faith ” and recoils at the suggestion that she is turning her back on the church , an accusation that dogged the likes of Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin when they left gospel for pop stardom .
As a mainstream act targeting the adult album alternative niche -- alongside the likes of U2 and fellow lesbian Melissa Etheridge -- it is suggested to Knapp that she is now born again , again .
“ Maybe that ’s what I should have called the record , ” she said .
Instead , Knapp opted for the equally forthright “ Letting Go , ” which will be released May 11 through Sony Music - owned independent distributor RED .
It will mark her fourth album and first release since 2001 ’s “ The Way I Am , ” which received a Grammy nomination for best rock gospel album .
Knapp has sold about a million albums since releasing her 1998 debut “ Kansas . ”
She toured relentlessly , and was part of the lineup of the 1999 Lilith Fair tour .
She also won four Dove Awards , the gospel music industry ’s top honors .
But increasingly exhausted and dispirited , Knapp lived the fantasy of many working stiffs by dropping out and traveling the world .
She ended up in Australia , became a citizen , and now drops the friendly appellation “ mate ” into the conversation .
She plans to spend most of her personal time Down Under .
But Knapp ’s time in the wilderness was not all about shrimps on the barbie and Vegemite sandwiches .
She underwent an early midlife crisis of sorts as she reexamined her faith , sexuality and career .
Making music was the furthest thing from her mind .
Before Knapp met her girlfriend in the United States , she was celibate for 10 years , which she says is in line with the general expectation for unmarried members of the evangelical community .
“ Anyone who has a decade of celibacy has ‘ complete loser ’ written on their back , ” she joked , although she still respects those who do abstain .
Knapp ’s new sexual identity is clearly a major talking point , but she does not view herself as a crusader in the gay community .
She jealously guards her privacy and that of her girlfriend , who “ does n’t want to be famous in any way whatsoever at all . ”
While fans will inevitably scour the songs for clues about her new love life , Knapp says she never writes songs about specific people .
But she pulls no punches in the first line of the track “ Inside , ” singing : “ I know they ’ll bury me before they hear the whole story . ”
“ I hope that the defiance does come across as humble , ” she explained .
“ If there ’s any frustration , it ’s trying to politely break the yoke of being asked to be something that I just ca n’t be , and with all humility go : ‘ Just please be kind when you discover the truth . ’
It ’s kinda all you can do . ”

WITH President Obama and Congressional Democrats intent on one last push for health care reform , the main Republican talking point is outrage over the likely use of the reconciliation process to pass a separate House - Senate compromise .
The Republicans ’ best hopes of killing health reform rest on the use of a filibuster in the Senate .
But bills considered under reconciliation cannot be filibustered and therefore can pass the Senate by a simple majority vote .
Bill Frist , a former Senate majority leader , called reconciliation an “ arcane ” procedure that Congress has “ never used ... to adopt major , substantive policy change . ”
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee asserted that this parliamentary tactic was unprecedented for a bill like health reform .
Senator John McCain of Arizona said that the use of reconciliation would have “ cataclysmic effects . ”
So , would reconciliation represent an anomalous and dangerous power grab ?
The accompanying chart , which lists 15 major reconciliation bills passed by Congress since the process was first used in 1980 , provides evidence for assessing that charge .
Reconciliation was intended to be a narrow procedure to bring revenues and spending into conformity with the levels set in the annual budget resolution .
But it quickly became much more .
The 22 reconciliation bills so far passed by Congress ( three of which were vetoed by President Bill Clinton ) have included all manner of budgetary and policy measures : deficit reductions and increases ; social policy bills like welfare reform ; major changes in Medicare and Medicaid ; large tax cuts ; and small adjustments in existing law .
Neither party has been shy about using this process to avoid dilatory tactics in the Senate ; Republicans have in fact been more willing to do so than Democrats .
While serving international adventure tourists in what often appears to be a support role , the Sherpa guides of Nepal are unparalleled models of true leadership .
Perhaps the most exceptional and renowned among them is Apa Sherpa , who holds 13 world records for summiting Mount Everest 21 times , four of those without supplemental oxygen .
In his captivating keynote address , Apa shares a perspective on leadership gained from his 25 years of leading expeditions and his 21 ascents of the world ’s highest peak .
Using images and anecdotes from his many climbs , Apa is able to breathe new life into the concepts surrounding leadership – on being mission - focused , on risk - taking and decision - making , on logistics and teamwork , on sacrifice and setbacks , and , of course , on victory .
With his delightful manner and his gripping stories , Apa Sherpa wows his audiences as he leaves them with new insights and food for thought on the topic of leadership .
Words for Women
1/09/10 Examine , if you will , the following three sentences .
First : “ In some ways all human beings are the same . ”
There is nothing objectionable about this sentence .
In fact , quite to the contrary , if anything the sentiment is reassuring and smacks of hope for the future ; the sort of thing you expect to hear people say at Christmastime .
Second : “ In some ways all men are the same . ”
Once again , no - one would be bent out of shape .
Yes , in the English language we ’ve got that confusion about whether men here means humans or males , but even if it were specified that the sentence concerns males , there ’s nothing inherently insulting about it .
Virtually everyone is inclined to agree with the sentiment , and instantly and involuntarily starts making a mental list of the ways in which all males are indeed the same , most of which are harmless and amusing .
Finally : “ In some ways all women are the same . ”
As you knew right away upon reading it , all of a sudden this sentence is objectionable .
But why ?
Logically , it is a subset of the first sentence , and so must be true if the first sentence is .
Forgetting even the first sentence , it is also logically implied by the second sentence : if all males , and only males , are similar in ways XYZ , then all females are ipso facto similar insofar as they are not males .
Furthermore , it is ( as are the first two sentences ) inarguably true in hundreds of ways no - one can dispute : all women breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide , all women are warm - blooded , all women lack prehensile tails , and so forth .
But of course , these are not the traits to which we assume the sentence refers .
So what are ?
Presumably , in the mind of someone who finds the sentence objectionable , it is being spoken by a man and the traits being referenced are harmful or silly stereotypes : all women are addicted to shopping , all women are obsessed with marriage , all women are bad at telling jokes , etc .
Sure , the sentence could be Oprah talking about how all women have ESP or something , but this is not the first context that pops into our heads .
And even someone who does not find the sentence objectionable personally will still recognize it as something it would be better not to say , because many others will find it so .
The question , then , is why , when all three sentences are presented out of context , do people assume malice where the third sentence is concerned , but not the others ?
Absolutely , malice is possible , but it is possible in the other cases as well .
The sentence about men being the same could be coming from a radical feminist or pissed - off stand - up comedienne and setting up comments that are quite critical , even damning — but this is not the first context we assume .
The sentence about human beings could be setting up a derogatory slam about Earthlings from a speciesist Martian — but ( obviously ) this is again not the first context we assume .
So the problem is that , unless we have first received explicit specifications to the contrary , our default interpretation is that all statements about women are insulting and motivated by a desire to belittle or wound .
Conversely , ambiguous statements about men ( or humans generally ) are given the benefit of the doubt .
The goes not only for statements about women , but even applies to mere terms for women , designed simply to refer to human females as a category and nothing else .
“ Chicks ” is just an Anglicization of the Spanish chiquita , or “ young woman . ”
Why is it offensive again ?
“ Skirts ” is an example of metonymy , identifying women via an article of their clothing ; if we called men “ pants , ” would anyone care ?
A “ dame ” is the female equivalent of an English knight , and the word itself is just Old English for mother — how in the hell did an honorific title become offensive ?
I have even known people to be upbraided from time to time for using “ ladies . ”
What is the problem with any of these words — is it just that we imagine them being spoken by smarmy assholes ?
Fine .
But you could imagine the words “ spoon , ” “ microscope , ” and “ giraffe ” being spoken by a smarmy asshole if you wanted to .
… Or , you could not .
An NYC slam poetess from a few years back had a poem about how a word besides “ wet ” needed to be invented to refer to the state of female sexual arousal .
“ Wet , ” she argued , was offensive because “ that ’s what umbrellas and dogs are . ”
Okay .
Well , men could decide that the term “ hard ” is offensive because “ that ’s what stale cheese and calculus tests are , ” if we wanted to .
… Or , you know , not .
“ Wet ” and “ hard ” are both merely the simplest literally denotative terms for the female and male states of arousal , respectively .
There is no conceivable reason why one should be seen as “ offensive ” and the other not .
None .
Unless people choose to insist that one is offensive purely for the sake of doing so .
The common appraisal is that men are not offended by words for man things because those terms are not offensive .
In actuality , the reverse is true : terms for man things are not offensive because men do not choose to see them as such .
“ Baseball bat ...?!
Are you implying that all men are vampires ...?! ” Think about the male distaffs of terms like “ chicks . ”
The two most common , as far as I can tell , are guys and dudes .
As everyone knows , neither of these is offensive .
But what most people do n’t realize is that both of these terms were actually originally insults .
Guy was once the French proper name pronounced “ ghee , ” and then caught on as an English proper name with a different pronunciation .
The most famous traitor in English history , Guy Fawkes , happened to have this name , and so in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot the name began to be used as slang for a creepy or suspicious person , as well as for the stuffed effigies of Fawkes traditionally burned on the 5th of November .
Dude was coined over two centuries later , and originally referred to a foppish or ostentatiously well - dressed man ( probably derived from duds , slang for “ clothes ” ) , as in “ Dude Ranch , ” a cowboy - role - play vacation spot for soft city slickers .
It continued to mean something along the lines of “ dandy ” for several decades , and was n’t used to refer categorically to all males until it was absorbed into the surfing slang of the 1960s .
So , far from being inherently inoffensive , the two most common contemporary casual terms for men are words that basically used to mean “ criminal ” and “ fag . ”
Why are they so completely unobjectionable now ?
Because men do n’t give a shit , that ’s why .
Conversely , words for women that were originally not only inoffensive but actually titles of honor , like “ dame , ” become offensive over time .
Why ?
Because women choose to be upset by them .
Now , I am certainly not saying that no objectionable words are actually objectionable .
Only a fool would try to argue that the nasty character of a term like , say , “ nigger ” is merely an arbitrary illusion .
That word has a history that plainly demonstrates why it is considered so hateful .
My point , rather , is that some words — particularly those used to refer to women — have histories that are legitimately the opposite , and somehow still ended up being considered objectionable , apparently merely because of the fact that they refer to women at all .
Everyone knows that “ bitch , ” yet another pejorative term , originally meant “ female canine , ” and so we can easily see why this term is considered insulting .
Until we stop and think about the fact that — once again — the male equivalent , “ dog , ” which was once also an insult used for cowardly or groveling men , is now a common form of address for males , equivalent to “ dude . ”
( We are used to the sentence “ a bitch is a female dog , ” but how weird does the sentence “ a dog is a male bitch ” sound ? )
Yes , women sometimes playfully address one another as “ bitch , ” but like with the n-word , this is an ironic reclamation , accompanied by an eternally open dialogue about who is allowed to say it and when it should or should n’t be said .
Can you imagine a conversation about who is “ allowed ” to say dude ?
“ I feel you , bitch ! ”
“ … wait , that does n’t work as well for some reason . ”
I realize “ bitch ” was traditionally used as an insult .
But my point is , so were “ guy , ” “ dude , ” and “ dog . ”
In fact , “ dog ” is still regularly used as an insult for men by women , not only contemporaneously with its friendly usage by men for other men , but in fact for the same reasons : a “ dog ” is a lifelong player ( like , say , Tramp in Lady and the Tramp , which is yet another term that ’s insulting when you say it about a woman ) , a “ pussy hound ” if you will .
And this is a compliment when a man says it about another man , but a reproach when a woman calls a man out on it .
Some would point out that “ bitch ” is technically an insult about a certain type of woman ( or was , before rap usage generalized it ) .
But what type ?
We are familiar with the feminist complaint about “ assertive ” women being called bitches , but is this actually how men use it ?
Maybe it was in the ’50s or something , but I was n’t alive then , and even my freaking parents were little kids .
In my lifetime , I have exclusively heard people use it about women who are acting mean or obnoxious in ways that would also be considered mean or obnoxious if a man acted thus — i.e. , as the female distaff of “ asshole , ” because it sounds weird to call a woman an asshole .
Although I ’m not sure why , since both men and women have assholes , so it ’s not like saying “ dick . ” “ Hussy ” was originally just short for husewif , “ housewife ” or wife .
“ Minx ” was a shortening of the Dutch minnekijn , “ beloved . ”
Both were pet names used specifically for women in relationships by their partners .
And they both eventually ended up meaning “ slut . ”
Huh ?
There are hundreds of different words for “ penis ” in English .
Although many are considered impolite language generally , none of them is offensive to men — e.g. , “ dick ” is a word for the penis that is an insult when used about a person , but is simply “ normal ” as a term for the penis .
It is considered a “ curse word , ” but not offensive to men specifically — in fact , like most “ curse words , ” it is more frequently thought objectionable by women than by men .
Someone who tried to come up with an offensive term for “ penis ” might very well find that it is actually impossible .
Similarly , there are countless different words for “ vagina ” in English — and all of them are considered offensive to women .
Even , to some , “ vagina ” itself , which is just the normal “ doctor word ” for it .
But actually , women who find the “ doctor words ” more offensive have a point : vagina is from the Latin for “ scabbard , ” vulva means “ wrapper , ” and the most clinical and most objectionable of all , pudendum , means “ thing that must be ashamed . ”
Gash and slice are violent , implying castration , i.e. , the absence of the “ normal ” penis .
More importantly , neither word is the least bit sexy , unless you are the type of guy who decorates his room with empty liquor bottles and wears shorts and a baseball cap with a jacket and tie .
And not that anybody knows this , but twat comes from Old Norse thvita , meaning “ to cut off , ” so it ’s the same deal .
Pussy , the most common non-doctor term , is usually argued as offensive on the “ it ’s a word for an animal ” basis .
First of all , so is cock , and men do n’t care ( plus cats are higher animals than roosters anyway ) .
And secondly , that ’s not actually the etymology of pussy .
It comes from the Old Norse puss , meaning “ pouch . ”
So it ’s no better than the literal meanings of the Latin terms , but also certainly no worse .
Poontang is from French putain or Greek / Italian putana , “ whore , ” so that one is legitimately offensive .
But it ’s also a moot point , because no - one has actually said poontang since October of 1991 when the coolest guy in my eighth - grade class attempted to teach the rest of us that word at a sleepover party , only he was mistakenly saying Bhutan , which is a tiny Himalayan nation in which television was banned until eleven years ago .
Pictured : the flag of Poontang , according to Jay Cooch / coochie is more complicated .
Traditionally , it ’s thought to derive from coucher , the French verb for “ to lie down / go to bed , ” which gave rise to couchee , a noun for “ bed meeting , ” i.e. , act of intercourse , and the rest is obvious .
A plausible alternate explanation points out that cwtch is Welsh for “ cuddle ” ( it ’s this term that is almost certainly the origin of saying “ coochie - coo ” to babies , which would certainly be bizarre if it meant “ fuckie - vagina ” ) .
But I ’m skeptical of how long coochie has really meant “ vagina , ” or even “ sexual intercourse ” in American English .
Until mid-century , there do n’t appear to be instances of its appearing separate from hoochie , as in hoochie - coochie , a style of dance that , although naughty in its day , still had a name innocent enough to be mentioned in the lyrics to “ Meet Me in St. Louis , Louis ” in 1904 .
Cab Calloway ’s “ Minnie the Moocher ” was “ a red - hot hoochie - coocher ” in 1931 , and once again , though the dance itself is salacious , the name of the dance is not vulgar .
Even cooch by itself was evidently still innocent enough in 1949 for Vera - Ellen ’s character in On the Town to refer to herself ( repeatedly and hilariously ) as a “ cooch dancer . ”
If the Hays Code folks made them change “ hell of a town ” to “ wonderful town , ” probably they would n’t have let a term that meant “ vagina dancer ” slide .
Hooch did then , as it does now , mean “ liquor , ” apparently by way of the powerful stuff brewed by the Hoochinoo , an indigenous people of Alaska .
Since one tends to find liquor and salacious dancing in the same places , the coochie part of hoochie - coochie may have just come about as a cute rhyme .
Then is the link to coucher really just a coincidence ?
Well , anybody friendly enough with Eskimos to be drinking their booze in the 1800 ’s was probably some kind of Canadian trader who likely also spoke French , so it may have been a dirty joke that bilingual partygoers played on the ones who only knew English .
But nonsense rhymes like that are also frequently non-speaker corruptions of foreign phrases that still roughly capture the original sense ( as in how , fittingly enough , hocus - pocus is a play on hoc est corpus , “ this is [ Christ ’s ] body , ” from the communion of the Latin Mass ) .
It may derive from a longer French phrase ending in coucher , or even some approximation of Arabic , as the hoochie - coochie of the 1890s was a form of bellydancing .
A connection to Creole or Haitian French , with voodoo overtones , is also possible .
By the time that Muddy Waters was your “ Hoochie - Coochie Man ” in 1954 , the term certainly did n’t read as “ slut - vagina , ” the way it does now , but rather something darkly mystical , cluster ’d around by gypsies , black cats , and the number seven .
Sexual , certainly , but more reminiscent of terms like mojo and heebie - jeebies than Parisian trysts or drunk Eskimos .
In any case , just like Jefferson ’s Democratic - Republicans , the term eventually conveniently divided , so that the first word refers to the entire slut and the second specifically to her vagina .
And of course , both terms are now offensive .
I ’ve heard some women suggest that changing the spelling to cucci , so it ’s like “ Gucci , ” makes it okay — but I honestly do n’t see why taking a supposedly offensive word and adding materialism somehow renders it inoffensive .
Cunt , universally recognized as the most offensive word for vagina , may actually have the least offensive etymology : we know that it goes back as far as the Middle English queynte used by Chaucer , but how it got into English before then is a mystery .
It seems like a no - brainer that it ’s cognate with Latin cunnus ( whence cunnilingus ) , but amazingly there is a long and complicated explanation of why it ca n’t possibly be — at least , not unless you accept the existence of a single ur - language , Proto - Indo - European ( which , coincidentally , is referred to by linguists — and not just the cunning ones — as PIE ) , in which case it ’s equally related to the Hieroglyphic ka’t , so we are really going back a ways here .
What is amazing is that all these “ cunt family ” words simply mean “ vagina ” — i.e. , they are not metaphors , metonymies , comparisons , animal words , or jokes , but are all just the normal word in their respective languages for “ vagina ” and nothing else .
So etymologically speaking , cunt should be the only word for vagina that is n’t offensive — and yet it is the most offensive by a wide margin , simply as a holdover from the days when wealthy or educated ( i.e. , “ classy ” ) people wrote in Latin and commoners in English .
( As has already been explained , the Latin words are , ironically , the ones that actually mean something insulting ) .
Yoni , the Sanskrit term sometimes used in new - agey sex manuals because it evokes mysticism and enlightenment and Eastern Philosophy and peace and harmony and the ’60s and all that good liberal stuff , is often held up as the official least offensive term .
But guess what ?
It ’s just Sanskrit for cunt .
That is , it ’s the Sanskrit variation on the root discussed in the preceding paragraph .
Once again , which terms are or are not offensive is bafflingly arbitrary , and thrown off by our equally arbitrary characterizations of other cultures .
Like how the people who would get pissed that I used unnecessarily gendered terms like comedienne and poetess earlier in this essay because they think no words should be gendered tend to be the exact same people who are obsessed with France , even though in French the words for everything are gendered , even inanimate objects .
Pictured : French gangbang
Obviously , these are not every word for “ vagina . ”
Compiling such a list would be impossible .
Hell , eight new words for “ vagina ” were probably invented in the junior high school down the block during the time I was writing this .
You know what ?
Take a moment and make up a weird sound right now , preferably of one or two syllables .
Congratulations , it means “ vagina . ”
And is also offensive .
In fact , take any real , pre-existing word and simply add –ie to it .
Looking at the objects on my desk right now , we ’ve got pennie , bookie , mousie , cellie , keysie , muggie , dishie …
All of these words so clearly mean “ vagina . ”
Outside of modemie and keyboardie , which are a bit much , it completely works with everything else on my desk .
Actually , modemie might work if someone told you it was from some Eastern European language .
And even keyboardie might work if we finessed the spelling and pretended it was Scots — say , kibburdie .
So , yes , every single word does in fact mean “ vagina ” if you just put –ie at the end .
Needless to say , all of these words are highly demeaning to women ( especially dishie ) .
There is genuinely no word for “ vagina ” that is universally , or even largely , inoffensive .
But just because there ’s no acceptable way to name something in speech , this does n’t necessarily mean the thing in question is looked down upon by that culture .
It could just as easily be a mark of the highest respect .
After all , was n’t this the case among the Ancient Hebrews when it came to referring to God ?
When a woman says , “ I love dressing like a whore for you , ” she is tapping into and evoking something as close to magical as exists : humanity ’s limitless capacity for giving itself over to the rites of sexuality .
When her man says , “ You look like a whore , and I ’m going to fuck you the way a whore should be fucked , ” he is acknowledging that her magic was successful .
Regardless of what words we use for them , sluts and whores are the most powerful entities of whose existence I have ever had evidence , and unless I am very much mistaken about the nature and origin of the universe , their record will never be broken .
No wonder it is a Magic Whore who rises up to challenge God in the Book of Revelation — who else possibly could ?
They are powerless against low Nielsen ratings , however .
Of course , to call a woman a whore in public is an insult , just as every term or phrase in English for a sexually magical woman , or her equipment , is an insult in public … and an intensely tender compliment in private .
It is , I suppose , fortunate that so many people find ( or pretend to find ) all these words so objectionable and shocking .
If this were not the case , they would not be nearly so much fun to say in bed .
And speaking of gender harmony , it is , it now occurs to me , entirely possible that , on some pre-programmed , subconscious level , women ’s proclivity for finding words offensive is in fact a courtship display .
A mating dance .
A form of flirting .
Now , certainly an academic feminist writing an essay about why a certain term is objectionable is not consciously thinking about attracting a mate .
She may not even like men .
But this is immaterial .
A football player ( who might not even like women ) is n’t thinking about attracting a mate while on the field — his mind is on the game — and yet obviously sexual display is a big part of why human civilization evolved professional sports .
Human beings dance and display largely in language .
If , for example , being funny is a traditional form of male sexual display , in the sense that it is a demonstration of social dominance ( we ’ve certainly heard about how women want “ a guy with a sense of humor ” ) , then would n’t it make sense for acting unimpressed by or resistant to male language to be the female complement ?
The sign that the man will have to work harder ?
A woman who gets offended by things other women are n’t offended by is effectively saying “ the way you talk may be good enough for these other females , but it is n’t good enough for me , because I am worth more . ”
( Dating advice aimed at women does sometimes tell them not to swear , and to act offended when others swear , even if secretly they do n’t care . )
A woman who does this too much ( i.e. , past the point that her physical attractiveness will let her get away with ) will be seen as a pain in the ass — just as a man who is too macho is a dangerous bar - brawling lunatic — but the impulse to do it at all may in fact be a key aspect of the female sex drive .
After all , how better to know when a woman is yours than the moment she lets you call her something she would n’t let anyone else call her ?
What clearer sign can a woman give that she has stopped dancing ?
But as for whether any of these words are “ really ” objectionable , someone who decides to look hard enough for a reason why a given word is objectionable is going to find one ( or failing that , make one up for others to find ) .
And if women continue to decide that every word for them , or for something to do with them , is offensive , then such words will continue to be so .
There is no way this could ever possibly stop .
Women will just have to keep thinking of new words for everything to do with women every five or ten years , for the rest of time , for no reason .
...
Or just , you know , not .

Need DIRECT RESPONSE copywriting ?
This remarkable copywriter is only £ 600 a day ...
Morning !
When I meet people for the first time they often ask me what I do .
When I tell them " I'm a copywriter " there is often a short silence before they ask what a copywriter is .
So , to avoid any embarrassment , a copywriter is the person who writes advertisements , direct mail , websites , in fact , any kind of advertising material .
However , you have probably come across this page by putting " copywriter " into Google - so hopefully you already knew that .
Now , take a look at those three big achievements at the top of this page .
Not bad ?.
I mean , adding 17 % to your turnover in six months would that come in handy ?
And these are not one - offs .
I have many examples where my copywriting has given clients , like you , better results and made you more money .
What can Bill Fryer Direct Response Copywriter do for you ?
As a copywriter , I specialise in direct response copywriting and communications like emails , direct mail , off - the - page advertising , websites , microsites , TV ads , posters , door to door leaflets and inserts .
Most of my work is for people who sell direct , people like retailers , financial services , mail order and charities .
However I also write :
I can actually write anything in any medium .
Even though most of my copywriting is designed to generate leads or sales , I regularly write press releases , content articles , video scripts , infographics , brochures , leaflets , and even point of sale materials .
Sometimes people tell me , at the start of a project , they have never found a found a direct response copywriter who can write for their industry .
In every case , I have written successful campaigns for them .
I also know how to write copy so it is easy to translate , if you sell in different language zones .
Have I worked for anyone you have ever heard of ?
Here is a selection of the better known organisations this direct response copywriter has worked for :
AC Cars - luxury car manufacturer Acorn Stairlifts - stairlift manufacturer / seller Axa Sunlife - insurance / investments Barclaycard - credit cards Book Aid - development agency / charity Castle Cover - insurance Children 's Trust - charity Dunlop - tyre manufacturer Empire Stores - mail order cataloguer Fisher Investments Inc - US investment manager Foreign & Colonial - investment trust manager Gold Reserves - gold - buying company Greenpeace - not - for - profit campaigning organisation Hidden Hearing - direct hearing aid seller HSS Tool Hire - UK 's biggest tool hire company Jewson / Saint - Gobain - building trade retailer / manufacturer LaSource - Caribbean resort hotel Longevity USA - mail order health supplements
The National Trust - heritage charity Pinnacle Insurance - insurance Post Gold For Cash - gold - buying company Reader 's Digest - direct book seller Royal Star & Garter Home - armed forces charity Skipton Building Society - building society Suttons Seeds - garden products Westminster Collection - collectibles manufacturer / direct seller
Have I worked in your SECTOR ?
I have worked in most , including : cars , properties , holidays / travel , insurances , investments , mail order , direct selling , disability and grey market , garden products , health , charities , books and media , education , security , building trade and other business to business .
This variety is important because a good copywriter generally has broad experience .
I always seem to beat industry - specialist copywriters in creative tests .
And WHERE do I work ?
I work for clients in the UK , Ireland , USA , Canada , Caribbean and Australia .
( Anywhere that speaks English )
What made Bill Fryer such an amazing copywriter ?
The best copywriters generally have a chequered past and I am no exception .
I went to Oxford University and have an MA / BA in Human Sciences - so I know about people .
I formed the UK's first bungee - jumping company , worked in a printer 's , worked as a car mechanic ( badly ) , became a charity fundraiser ( successfully ) , then an advertising manager for a multi-national manufacturer and finally started out as a freelance copywriter in 1998 .
That variety gives a copywriter perspective .
I have seen life from different angles - most have not .
I am member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing , a Fellow of the Institute of Direct Marketing and even have an Advanced Certificate in Marketing - ( I can see you 're impressed :)
Actually this last point is important because the average copywriter is often simply a wordsmith living in his head .
I have a marketing background as well , which means I see your creative work in the context of your overall strategy .
Something you should know about the way I write :
In my experience there are two types of copywriter : noisy and quiet .
The " noisy " copywriter uses lots of superlatives to try and crank up the product or service .
No one likes an obnoxious salesman .
So , in contrast , I find a quiet approach that states the facts and tells people what they want to know quickly , works best .
And my track record bears me out ...
Results :
Eleven more examples where this copywriter 's work made a difference :
For a leading CHARITY I ran my creative work against the creative work produced by their existing agency .
All three mail packs went to the same list .
Their control pulled 1.7 % .
Mine pulled 2.5 , 9.8 and 13.2 % .
Since then I have created three fundraising direct mail campaigns which have each pulled over 30 % in response .
Over a nine year period I raised them £ 70.8 million .
For a MEDICAL PRODUCT selling for £ 200 .
Media spend of £ 350,000 produced sales of £ 1,500,000 .
In addition , my creative was more effective than that given for free by a media - buying agency .
Then , after the success of the UK off - the - page business , the US arm decided to use my creative work .
They tested it against two Madison Avenue agencies , my work won and was been rolled out across the US .
However the UK is still the single most successful international territory for this Israeli company , even outselling the US .
For the UK 's largest direct seller of HEARING AIDS my pack pulled four times as many responses as their existing control .
For the UK's biggest BUILDING PRODUCTS supplier my creative work went head - to - head against three other agencies , not only did I win , the response to my mailing jammed their switchboard .
For a US WEALTH MANAGEMENT company two of my packs beat their control which no one ever beats  - not even the best American copywriters .
Recently I ran five more packs and they all beat the control , I had established , by a good 30 % .
For an EXERCISE MACHINE selling for £ 400 .
Media spend of £ 200,000 produced sales of £ 1,000,000 .
My ads were 50 % more effective than those produced by a media - buying agency offering free creative work .
For a national TELECOMS company my first creative work was three times better than what they had produced in - house .
And my subsequent attempts increased response further .
For a MOBILITY products supplier my direct response ads were 50 % , 100 % and 400 % better than the ads their existing copywriter ( a grey market specialist ) had created .
For a consumer MEDICAL MACHINE retailing for £ 150 .
Media spend of £ 300,000 produced sales of £ 1,800,000 .
In tests my initial creative work was six to eight times better than any other agency .
Without this improvement the product could not have sold off the page .
For an American MAIL ORDER health supplements company my packs doubled their response rates .
And they now use our artwork in the States .
They had used 18 other copywriters .
For a leading INSURANCE company I produced a cold recruitment pack which has never been beaten by any other agency in six years .
It has recruited one tenth of their customers and several large London agencies have had a crack at it - none have beaten it .
What else can I help you with ?
In addition to being a freelance copywriter I also run a full service direct marketing agency so I can also help you with emailings , SEO / SEM , website design and optimisation , landing pages , art direction and graphic design , media planning and buying , list rental , mailing , print and lettershop campaign planning and marketing strategy .
How much will it cost ?

Teachers are finally learning how to organize .
It took some intense provocation , because we do not rile easily .
But from Florida to Fremont High School in Los Angeles , teachers are doing what it takes to be heard .
And this is not your mother 's protest movement .
Teacher protest is alive in the digital age , and we are using the latest tools of the times .
Facebook has emerged as a tremendously powerful vehicle for organizing .
I discovered this myself when I posted my open letter to President Obama last November .
I created a Facebook group , Teachers ' Letters to Obama , the same day .
Within a few weeks it had 600 members , and now has more than 1,500 .
We used the group to collect more than 100 letters to send to Obama and Duncan , and have been actively discussing solutions to the challenges we face , and galvanizing further activism by our members , getting them to write letters to Congress and other policymakers .
One of our early members was Jesse Turner , who wrote of walking in his cold apartment as a child to stay warm , and pledged to walk to Washington , DC , this summer , to protest NCLB and Race to the Top .
Inspired anew by the March 4 protests , Jesse launched his own Facebook group , Children are more than test scores , to inform and activate others .
In less than a month he has attracted more than 4,250 members .
Another blogger , California teacher Sarah Puglisi , posted a list of her own 100 National Standards a few weeks ago .
Here are a few random examples :
6 . All children should know nature , value nature , interact within nature , and be in families that have some capacity to do the same .
19 .
All children should have adults that can cooperate , hear one another , resolve conflict , have the capacity to demonstrate love , attention , concern , solutions , turn taking , deference .
27 .
All children should enter school believing and maintaining as long as possible a joy in learning , and a belief in self as not " behind " , not labeled , not seen as less .
63 .
All children should have bandaids , both the real thing and the metaphorical kind .
To heal .
Her post has generated a Facebook group " I bet we can get 1,000,000 teachers to adopt these standards . "
Why has Facebook emerged as such a powerful vehicle ?
First of all , most teachers are women , and according to this report from istrategy labs , at least 54 % of Facebook users are female , and the largest age group is 35 to to 54 year olds .
Facebook membership has more than doubled in the past year , and more than 100 million Americans are registered users .
Facebook allows you to set up a group , host discussions , and share links and videos .
You can even announce a protest , invite people to attend , and track who says they will come .
But the best thing about it is that since this is a social platform , posts can permeate into our everyday social scene , so amidst the flurry of news from friends like " I just popped some popcorn and am going to watch Casablanca " we can get posts with the latest news about teachers protesting in Florida , or an invitation to write our congressperson about ESEA .
And since so many people belong , it is possible for important news to spread virally outward .
Florida teachers are also using Facebook very creatively .
The group Stop Senate Bill 6 -- actually started by concerned parents , now has about 22,000 fans , and is a hub of organizing activity for parents and teachers in the state .
And the teachers are taking their message to the Facebook pages of their representatives as well .
A visit to the Republican Senate Majority Office Facebook page reveals scores of notes from angry teachers raising serious questions about the future of education should this law pass .
Another outlet for teacher voices have been the blogs .
I have used my blog to spread word about the movement to save Fremont High School from a draconian reconstitution .
A group I helped found a couple of years ago , Accomplished California Teachers , has launched a new group blog , InterAct , which is carrying provocative perspectives from leading California teachers .
And the Teacher Leaders Network , to which I belong , has a strong group of teacher bloggers with great things to say .
Art teacher Rian Fike has used his diary on the Daily Kos to share news of the teacher movement against Senate Bill 6 .
Because of him , I saw these great YouTube videos of teachers confronting Republican governor Charlie Crist , pressuring him to veto the bill .
This is a great example of effective dialogue with our representatives .
The teachers are passionate , on point , and united .
YouTube is another tool teachers are beginning to use effectively .
Jesse Turner has launched a project to have teachers , parents and students post messages about NCLB and Race to the Top by June 14th - Flag Day , as a patriotic and democratic protest .
He has used Facebook to create the organizing group , and the videos will be posted to Youtube .
I still believe the most powerful ways we can confront injustice are the ones we have always used , but these new tools can serve to amplify and build these methods .
Jesse Turner will walk in protest as did many civil rights marchers decades ago .
But because of Facebook many more will know of his march and have a chance to witness it , support and even join him as he walks .
The teachers at Fremont High School are doing good old fashioned community organizing to rally parents , students and community members to support their school -- but we know about it because they are willing to share their story on my blog .
Teachers speak truth to power as the Florida teachers did last month , but many more of us can be inspired thanks to videos posted to YouTube , and bloggers like Rian Fike .
After eight long years of No Child Left Behind , teachers are finally getting organized .
It will take some real determination , clarity and action to overcome the misinformation that now dominates education policy .
But teachers are showing we know how to use the tools at our disposal , and we will use them to be heard .
Update # 1 : Rian Fike has posted again on the Daily Kos .
He writes :
We caught wind of the bill three weeks ago .
Our unions made sure we understood the dire situation .
We took the ball and we went supersonic .
Facebook groups gained thousands of members per day , and then we met together in person to protest .
We got our cause on the local news in over 30 different cities .
We followed the money trail to the Council of 100 .
We found out that Publix Supermarkets and Office Depot were part of the plot .
We are waiting for a clarification of their position , since they immediately began backpedaling .
If the bill is forced through and signed by Governor Crist , we will organize massive boycotts .
Update # 2 : Los Angeles teacher Jose Lara has just posted a YouTube video sharing teacher perspectives on their fight to save Fremont High from reconstitution .
Update # 3 : Parents and teachers in Palm Beach , Florida , really led the way with their Facebook group , Testing is Not Teaching , which has been used for the past eight months to organize their movement to stop the District 's over - reliance on standardized tests and scripted curriculum .
Once again , parents together with teachers are a force to be reckoned with !
Update # 4 : Daily Kos blogger and Florida Art teacher Rian Fike is back with another report : Florida Teachers are a Force : traction against the Jeb Bush machine .
The bill that was headed straight into law has galvanized a whole new voting block that will need to be honored in November and forevermore .
We are so powerful at this point that Jeb Bush has started robocalls against us .
We are turning Charlie Crist toward a veto , which obviously will be a big swing for the Fl - Sen seat .
Check out Crist 's reason for the turnaround .
When I read that , I just about lost my lunch .
Why ?
Because I had spoken the exact same sentence to his secretary the day before .
" Shame on any public servant who does n't listen to the people .
'' Florida Governor Charlie Crist has indicated today that he wants lawmakers to accept amendments offered by supporters of teachers before he will sign Senate Bill 6 .
Teacher protests are having a real impact !
Update # 6 : Friday , April 9 : Florida teachers and students need us !
Governor Crist 's veto is the only thing that will keep Senate Bill 6 from becoming law .
I just sent a fax .
Call his office at 850- 907- 1218 .
Fax his office at 850-487-0801 or 850-907-1219 .
Please tell him to VETO SB6 / HB7189 .
What do you think ?
Are we using the right tools to get our voices heard ?
Are there other ways we can have influence over the future of our schools ?

VANCOUVER , British Columbia -- Los Angeles Kings coach Terry Murray continually stressed over the past two days how much he liked his team 's performance in Thursday 's 3 - 2 overtime loss to the Vancouver Canucks in their playoff opener .
His " drastic " lineup changes heading into Game 2 , however , would suggest otherwise .
The Kings shook up their lineup during Saturday 's morning skate and are benching first - line winger Justin Williams , third - pair defenseman Randy Jones and fourth - line enforcer Raitis Ivanans .
Scott Parse and Rich Clune are the replacements up front with Peter Harrold substituting for Jones along the blueline .
" On the blueline I 'm going to take Jones out of the line - up and putting Peter Harold in and the reasoning applies to Jones and Justin Williams , I need them to have bigger bite on the game , " Murray said .
" Both players are veteran guys and we added players such as Williams and Jones to be important players this time of the year but for Williams , unfortunately with his severe leg injury ... it 's just not there right now . "
Murray spent much of the morning skate talking to Williams , who is one of four players on an inexperienced Kings team to have won a Stanley Cup and a player Murray said would be a key leader in the locker room prior to the series .
" It 's a drastic move I know , " Murray said .
" It 's a very hard move for a coach to make .
It 's one of the hardest things you do as a coach is to take a veteran player out of the lineup and try to get the player to understand why .
But it 's Game 2 and right now it 's about winning the game .
It 's not about the feelings .
I 'm trying to do the right thing to help the Los Angeles Kings win this second game . "
Jeff Halpern will now play alongside Parse and Clune , while Fredrik Modin moves up to the third line .
Wayne Simmonds will be Williams 's replacement on the top line with Anze Kopitar and Ryan Smyth .
" I liked Raitis ' game .
I like what he 's been doing in the last several games that he has played , " Murray said .
" I 'm looking at making a change there on the fourth line to give me an opportunity to play some more minutes from that group .
It 's four minutes , five minutes with Raitis , only , and I think I can go deeper into the game with that kind of a look . "
The Canucks may also be making a lineup change before Game 2 although head coach Alain Vigneault was n't as forthcoming as Murray in announcing his plans before the game .
Rookie Michael Grabner skated on the team 's fourth line in practice Friday and at Saturday 's morning skate , taking the place of Matt Pettinger , who had been the center between Steve Bernier and Rick Rypien .
While Vigneault would n't confirm the change , if it occurs , Rypien would likely move to center with Grabner playing wing .

HUNTSVILLE , AL -- University of Alabama in Huntsville officials have fired professor Amy Bishop , who 's accused of shooting and killing three colleagues last month .
A one - paragraph letter dated Feb. 26 was mailed to Bishop informing her the university had terminated her employment effective Feb. 12 , said UAH spokesman Ray Garner .
Bishop was suspended without pay retroactively on the day of the attack , Garner said .
Bishop has been charged with capital murder in a shooting that also injured three others in a faculty meeting on Feb.
12 .
She has been also charged with three counts of attempted murder .

Frustrated by Oracle 's delay in releasing the latest version of OpenSolaris , the OpenSolaris Governing Board ( OGB ) is growing uneasy over Oracle 's lack of communication regarding the future of the Unix OS code .
At least two members of the board have even used the divisive " F " word , saying that they would be open to forking the code base from the Oracle version .
The latest version of OpenSolaris OS , version 2010.03 , was set to be released on March 26 .
As of almost a month later , it has yet to appear .
And OGB , hounded by OpenSolaris users , can't get information from Oracle as to when it will be released .
" It is sad to watch people asking about some OpenSolaris ... release called 2010.03 when we are well
into April now , " wrote board member Dennis Clarke .
While the volunteer - led OGB organizes efforts to develop code for OpenSolaris distributions ,
Sun Microsystems retained the trademark ownership of the name OpenSolaris itself .
Oracle , which finalized its acquisition of Sun in January , makes the final decisions as what to include in the code base of its official distribution ( though the code base can be reused at any time as the basis for other distributions ) .
Since January , company officials have appeared , at least to some to be ambivalent about OpenSolaris , even as it has boosted support for its paid version of the Unix OS , Solaris .
For instance , earlier this month , the company ceased offering free OpenSolaris install CDs , although the distribution can still be downloaded .
This change in management style has made some OpenSolaris users jumpy .
In his e-mail message Clarke expressed a willingness to fork the code , as did Schilling .
" We [ should ] not ignore the current situation and thus be prepared to fork in case this is needed , " board member Joerg Schilling wrote .
Several other members of the list , who were not board members , quickly showed enthusiasm for the idea as well .
" If Oracle is NOT going to keep developing OpenSolaris as an open source project ... a fork might be
the only solution for people who care , " wrote a developer on the mailing list .
Overall , the board members urged a more cautious approach , however .
Establishing regular contact with the Oracle would be a first step , Schilling said .
OGB has no official contact within Oracle , and only one of the board members , Teresa Giacomini , works for Oracle , and not in a role related to Solaris .
" We do n't even know whom to talk with , " admitted Schilling .
Board member Simon Phipps noted that " the time to fork has n't arrived yet " and seconded another poster 's point that it would n't be a good idea to fork the code base given that Oracle still does much of the development work , and provides the supporting community Web sites .
Phipps also noted that the company may not have formulated its plan for OpenSource , which given the load on Oracle head Larry Ellison 's agenda these days , is quite understandable .
In an e-mail to IDG News Service , Phipps noted that Oracle has a different , more controlling , style of communicating with the open source world , compared to Sun 's more open approach .
This certainly can be seen in Oracle 's approach with MySQL as well .
" Given Oracle 's style , I have seen no concrete triggers for concern yet , " Phipps wrote , in the e-mail to IDG .
Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
Here 's what I think is happening in this election : what 's moving the polls , the zeitgeist , causing tabloid editors to go into Pravda mode and seasoned commentators to shrug their shoulders with incomprehension .
It goes deeper than Cleggmania - and it does , if the trends observed carry through , presage a big change in the UK 's electoral landscape .
1 ) It 's been a long time since 2005 and the conversation has changed .
In 2005 there was no Facebook , Twitter , iPhone .
Some televisions were HD ready but there was no HD .
iTunes was less than a year old .
London had not won the Olympics yet ; the 7/7 bombings and the 21/7 bombings lay in the future .
The Libdem leader was Charles Kennedy and the Tory leader , lest we forget , Michael Howard .
Why does this matter ?
Because politics is about telling , and believing , a story .
The technological revolution that we 're in the middle of is changing social life and social attitudes .
I 've just walked through London 's Soho : grown men sitting in the open air wearing giant Sennheiser headphones , sipping flat - white coffee , composing , what ?
Symphonies , club anthems , klezmer ?
In the DVD store Fopp ( saved from administration during the financial meltdown ) top titles include : The Thick of It Series 3 ; District 9 ; Pasolini's 120 Days of Sodom enjoying an ironic hip revival in the age of internet porn .
And here 's the question : does that generation capable of laughing at the Thick Of It ; that never lived through the anti-apartheid era but has watched District 9 ; that has taken control of content creation and is happy to walk around wearing ironic t- shirts categorising their own sex lives etc ... does that generation believe it is in any way represented by mainstream politics ?
Anecdotally , apart from the anoraks who are involved in politics , I would say not .
In 2005 we were about five years into the Broadband revolution ; ( I wrote my first blog for Newsnight on 16 June 2005 ) .
We are now 10 years into that revolution .
The top sites on the web traffic monitor Alexa.com are mainly social networking or self - published content sites - which were almost nowhere in 2005 .
Those who wonder whether the social media will " affect the outcome " of the election are asking the wrong question .
It is affecting the outcome of everything , from having an idea , buying a pair of jeans or going on a date .
It is not the dweeby tweets of campaigners , or the sad slanging matches between beer - fuelled political hacks that matter .
What matters is that a new conversation is out there , and the first politician to look vaguely like they knew this got a ( what may be short term ) boost from this .
2 ) The two biggest things in mainstream ideology collapsed .
First , the economic bubble burst .
Then the expenses scandal broke .
And it was not just any old bubble : the economy post 1992 was built on rising debt , rising house prices , rising real wages .
The fact that this happened alongside the tech revolution I 've described above injected an aura of success into our major institutions that has now vanished .
It all collapsed in 2008 - 9 .
The financial model that has dominated the UK economy broke down ; and then it was revealed that large numbers of MPs were using their parliamentary status to feather their nests on an unimagined scale .
I know from experience how compartmentalised this is in the minds of media and political folk .
Once the expenses scandal broke , an economic crisis story had to be really huge to get on TV .
We saw these as two events .
But in the minds of many they seem to have merged .
If you went into a pub and said " we are ruled by a corrupt elite of politicians in the pockets of corrupt bankers " about the only two places where you would get chucked out of the pub would be Westminster and Canary Wharf .
Do not mix this up with the " death of deference " narrative .
That had begun already and was nearly a generation old .
There 's been an acute and rapid collapse in trust in major institutions .
If you watch an old episode of Father Ted you will see , amazingly prefigured by 10 years , the whole story of the Catholic Church 's struggle to come to terms with the paedophile priest scandal .
It may be that , with The Thick of It , we look back to that as signalling a sea-change in British politics - chronicling in merciless detail the ludicrousness of the party machine and spin system .
The point is , I am picking up from many parts of the electoral landscape , the nostrum that " a hung parliament would be a good thing " : for some because it would signal a move to PR and the end of the two - party system ; for others because it would annoy the City of London .
3 ) Lots of other stuff has changed .
a ) Barack Obama came to power because he understood some of the changes - but seeing a black , liberal President in the Whitehouse has changed the way a lot of Brits look at both America and the world .
b ) In 2005 East European migration had only just begun .
By 2009 1.5 EE migrants had entered Britain and according to the EHRC , 700,000 were working here at any one time .
It has now entered mainstream political discourse that this has adversely impacted the living standards of lower - income British workers ( though the economic evidence for this remains contested ) .
c ) After 7/7 the whole tenor of the debate about Islam and terror changed , indeed intensified .
A real and tangible hostility to the economic and social impact of migration is there everywhere you go : the BBC 's polling , and many bloggers , validate this as the under - expressed issue in the current election .
d ) The withdrawal from Iraq and the mounting losses in Afghanistan have changed public consciousness about the role of the UK armed forces .
e ) I could go on .
Some cultural commentator somewhere probably has a full list .
Add your own bullet points .
4 ) How does this impact ?
I do n't think that with Cleggmania we have seen the last of the surprises resulting from the collision between the political class , in their suits and Blackberries , and the electorate , with its trainers and iPhones .
And do n't think I 'm being metropolitanist here : if you think the north , Scotland , Wales and working class areas in general are in some way removed from the big cultural changes the tech revolution has unleashed , stop watching Corrie and get out some - more .
The most obvious second surprise could be how this translates into support for non-mainstream parties .
Actually , and one of my City bond - analyst contacts said what 's really worrying the finance guys is a " chaotic " hung parliament where there 's maybe one Green , two Respect and one or two BNP members of the Commons , with strong showing from Plaid and the SNP .
Right now the political class is thinking Cleggmania might go away , or recede , leaving the old two - party slugging match to get back into business .
Even some Libdems fear this will happen .
What they have not even begun to plan for is if Cleggmania begins to give the electorate " permission " to just break away from the whole mainstream party circus .
I do n't predict this , but you would have to say it becomes more possible .
Managing the coming fiscal crisis :
Whether the bond vigilantes and the forex guys stage some kind of wobbly before or just after 6 May , we are still in the mother of all fiscal tightenings .
When I meet top bankers in private , the words " social unrest " are always on their lips .
They fear the electorate , having not been told the full extent of the cuts necessary , will simply reject them once they are unleashed .
It is not a question of trade unionism - though the PCS union now looks like the strongest and most militant of all the unions , and has no ties to Labour .
What they fear is something more like the fuel protest , with themselves as the target .
5 ) The big question for the politicians : do they get it ?
If you buy my analysis , then the big question for the politicians - left , right or centre - is do they get it ?
You can make your own judgements on that , but even if you were being charitable you would have to say probably not all of them do .
The tabloid editors , issuing their concocted weird propaganda stories , are proving spectacularly that they do not get it .
The more I think about this , the more I come to this conclusion .
It 's people with Blackberrys who do n't get it .
They 've had privileged access to high - speed transglobal comms for the best part of a decade but they have never downloaded an app ( my own BBC Blackberry is corporately locked down to prevent its highly limited store of fun stuff being utilised ) .
People with iPhones get it ; young people looking at very limited job prospects get it .
And they 're becoming highly interested in politics .
The more I monitor the twittersphere 's response to Newsnight the more I am convinced of this .
Our celebrated AB over - 45 audience , ( which would make us a prime target for Volvo and Stannah Stairlift adverts if we ever took commercial breaks ) is being joined by a bunch of young adults who - again much more violently than in 2005 - simply hate the sight of men in suits shouting over each other .
What 's happening is that Blackberry world is colliding with iPhone world and finding out that , in the digital age , five years is a political eon .
This is Boston Dynamics ' " LittleDog . "
Someday , far in the future , while you are hiding from the robot murder army in the rubble of your home , you will remember this video , and think , " Should I have done something ? " [ Tip via atlasfugged ]

European Debt Crisis Greek Corruption Booming , Says Transparency International
Corruption is widely regarded as one of the triggers of the Greek debt crisis threatening the euro common currency .
A new study by Transparency International suggests that corruption is part of everyday life in Greece , and claims private households paid more than 780 million euros in bribes in 2009 .
BEIJING — Full Internet service was restored to the vast western Chinese region of Xinjiang on Friday , 10 months after it was blocked following deadly ethnic rioting that convulsed the regional capital , Urumqi .
The blockage was the longest and most widespread in China since the Internet became readily available throughout the country a decade ago .
The announcement was made in the morning , and many residents in cities across Xinjiang took the day off from school or work to rush to Internet cafes , where they pored through months of unread e-mail messages or chatted via instant messaging .
Some also dived back into online gaming , one of China ’s most popular pastimes ( “ World of Warcraft ” imitators being the most played ) .
In the violence in Urumqi on July 5 , 2009 , ethnic Uighurs , a Turkic - speaking people that is the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang , rampaged through the streets after security forces tried to break up a protest over social injustices .
The government says at least 197 people were killed and 1,600 injured , most of them ethnic Han , the majority in China .
Many
Uighurs resent discrimination by the Han , who are migrating in large numbers to Xinjiang and hold the top positions of power .
The Chinese government blamed overseas Uighur groups for using the Internet to stir up hostilities , and in particular they pointed at Rebiya Kadeer , a Uighur exile living in the Washington area .
Ms. Kadeer has denied the accusations .
After the initial rioting , the government cut off Internet service and cellphone text messaging across Xinjiang , which makes up one - sixth of China ’s territory .
How dumb and lazy is George W. Bush ?
So dumb and lazy that he can't even write a real memoir !
Instead , he will write " an account of key decisions in his life . "
We have some guesses about what those are .
Oh , goody : America 's national embarrassment has finished his book , which is called Decision Points .
That is the cover , there , with Bush looking decision -y !
But it is not really a book , so much , as a listicle :
Bush has said he is not writing a traditional memoir but an account of key decisions in his life ...
According to Crown Publishers , " Decision Points " will offer " gripping , never - before - heard detail " on such historic events as the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and the 2000 presidential election along with Bush 's decision to quit drinking , his relationship with his family and other personal details .
Key decisions !
Historic events !
Personal details !
Why did n't he just call it The Top 10 Decisions of My Presidency , WITH PHOTO ?
Let us speculate , in our own small listicle , on the possible " Key Decisions " that Our Pal George will write about in his already - irritating book !
And let us intersperse those " Key Decisions " with mocking " alternate covers " that we have photoshopped in the style of those " funny " emails your aunt always forwards you !
Political humor in the internet era !
Decision Point : Should I pay attention to this memo entitled " Bin Laden determined to strike in US " ?
Key Decision : Eh .
Decision Point : Torture : Should we just let the CIA go for it ?
Key Decision : Totally .
Tell me where to sign .
Decision Point :
Is it a good idea for me to land on an aircraft carrier in a flight suit with a sign that says " Mission Accomplished " ?
Key Decision :
How is it not a good idea ?
Decision Point :
Do I really need to go to New Orleans after the big hurricane ?
Key Decision : Nahhhhh .
Decision Point : Who should I nominate for this Supreme Court vacancy ?
Key Decision : Harriet Miers , that 's who .
Decision Point :
Is it appropriate for me to attempt to massage a sitting head of government ?
Key Decision :
Who does n't love a good massage ?
Decision Point :
What should I call my memoirs ?
Key Decision : Uh , The Decider ?
Or maybe : Decision - Making : It 's What I Do . Or , no : My Story , Specifically , the Decisions Part .
Yeah , that 's good .

To the people who defend the lack of a proper off - line co-op experience in gaming where said off - line co-op would be awesome : I ’m sorry you have no friends .
Not real friends anyway .
I mean , you probably have a ridiculous number of digital buddies that you play games with while you sit alone in your empty house .
I ’m sure you ’ve mastered the use of the mute button and invite system of whatever console you gravitate towards .
And that ’s just great .
For you .
I prefer to play video games with real people .
And by “ real ” , I mean that they are in the same room , speaking without aid of a headset .
Ideally hanging out within punching distance if they decide to do something irrevocably stupid during whatever team - based game we might be playing at that given time .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself .
I ’m going to go out on a limb here .
And by that I mean I ’m going to piss someone off .
Fine .
I can live with that .
Gears of War disappointed me .
Now , I loved many aspects of the game .
I loved the enemies and the chainsaws and just about everything else .
Minus one very important feature .
A feature I find left out of games far too often ( even once counts as “ far too often ” in my book ) .
Local co-op .
Yes , the game allowed for two people to play off - line co-op on one screen .
Wow .
Two whole people .
So basically , unless you participate in online gaming culture you are limited to two people .
One on each team , fighting for dominance .
That ’s fun for a few minutes .
Then those few minutes tragically pass , and you ’re left with a game with low re-playability … unless you like playing with digital people .
I do n’t like playing games with digital people .
Well , it ’s not my first choice anyway .
But that ’s probably self - evident .
Now , I ’m not saying I universally revile the online gaming experience .
I have a long distance marriage .
One of the ways my wife and I spend time together is through online gaming .
So I recognize what a tremendous boon it can be under certain circumstances .
In fact , I will go as far as to say that when a game fails to offer up an online experience I get visibly outraged .
Take Monopoly for the Xbox .
Who in the world thought releasing one of the most loved family games of all time without online options was a good idea ?
And I do n’t mean that in a rhetorical fashion .
I really want an answer .
What the hell ?
Getting back to the point :
As a person who has invested a large amount of his income into perfecting the gaming experience , I would like to see options made available to me .
Some games have done very well at this .
Halo , I ’m looking at you .
Other games ….
Well that just brings us back to Gears of War .
The usual counter arguments :
Graphics will suffer : I suspect that a company that can craft a game as exceptional in all other aspects as Gears of War could create a protocol in the game that only dumbs graphics down for the off - line co-op mode when a certain number of players are present .
In short :
It ’s a non-issue as the rest of the game would be unaffected .
4 player split screen is too hard to see : Again , that ’s a matter of personal taste .
I spent years playing games with 4 people on a tiny screen .
Did n’t seem to be an issue .
Regardless , some of us have televisions that look like this :
So that argument is effectively moot .
If you think the gameplay is too small when split amongst 4 screens , you do n’t have to play that way .
The online gaming experience is superior : So what ?
The addition of one should not mean the subtraction of another .
The only reason to champion the lack of an off - line co-op feature is if said feature is of zero use to you .
And even that ’s not a reason , because you ’re still not affected by said features presence .
It ’s a passive aspect of gaming that is only active when you want it to be active .
So to those of you ( and I ’ve seen you online before , being asshats ) actively defending that argument , actively defending absent features simply because you love the game so much it can do no wrong , please see the two opening paragraphs of this rant .
It was written for you specifically .
The only argument I have heard that makes any sense to me is that there is a lack of incentive to allow off - line co-op in games as off - line co-op is a feature that circumvents online subscriptions .
I do n’t know if anyone anywhere is actually discouraging developers from developing said gaming experiences .
But if they were , I would be unsurprised .
And by saying that the argument makes “ sense ” , I mean that I could see this happening .
Not that I agree with the practice .
Let ’s be clear .
I ’m engaging in a hyperbolic argument .
I have to make this clear because in our modern world , the concept of exaggerating a small issue to make a larger point is an alien concept .
I ’ve already been the target of a Kotaku hatchet job .
Let ’s see if I can avoid another .
There are lots of games that offer a strong off - line co-op experience .
I just want to see that remain as fully developed rather than thrown aside like it was in the otherwise exceptional Doom 3 .
Yeah , I said it .
Doom 3 was exceptional .
That statement alone is guaranteed to make someone somewhere have a near - apocalyptic breakdown .
In summary :
If you ’re reading this and you ’re a developer , do n’t drop off - line co-op .
Some of us still enjoy it .
Also :
The original Perfect Dark is freaking awesome , and now that it ’s available for a download on Xbox Live ( complete with a new online feature ) I recommend it .
And if you ’re looking for someone to play it with , send me a friend request ( GamerTag – Kid Gravity ) .
I ’ll be sitting alone in an empty house , waiting .

B0036WT4EC :: text ::::46 ″ 3D LED model [ / amazonify ] instead of the 55 ″ for $ 2698 , Ã‚Â with free shipping .
Fewer than two weeks after Best Buy offered the first Full 3D HDTVs for sale in the US , itsÃ‚Â latest Sunday circular ( 3/21/10 ) promotes a Samsung 3D TV deal consisting of a [ amazonify ]
B0036WT4JW :: text : ::: 55 ″ 3D TV [ / amazonify ] , [ amazonify ]
B00365EVWO :: text : ::: 3D capable Blu-ray player [ / amazonify ] , 2 pairs of glasses , a Blu-ray movie and Geek Squad delivery and installation .
The ad states the service includes TV and Blu-ray player set - up , connection to your wireless network and “ sync your 3D glasses for an amazing experience ” .
The package price lists the “ geek ” services as a $ 150 value .Ã‚Â
The offerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only problem is that there is no such thing as syncing 3D glasses .
Ã‚Â
They sync automatically .
HD Guru called three Best Buy stores .
After confirming each employee received training on 3D TVs and installation services , we asked them to explain the process ofÃ‚Â “ syncing ” the 3D glasses .
We received three different but oddly similar responses .
Blue shirt one said the glasses need to be synced with the Blu-ray player .
The second geek referred to the 3D glasses needing to sync to the player via the USB port within the glasses , an impossible feat as there is no USB port on the glasses .
The third stated the need to acquire the glasses ’ IP address to sync with the Blu-ray player .
There is no IP address for 3D glasses ; they have no connectivity to the Internet or network .
The Samsung battery powered glasses “ sync ” to the 3D content wirelessly via an infra-red pulse emitted by the TV .
We contacted Best Buy ’s media relations department and asked why the company offers a fictional service .
Ã‚Â
We are still awaiting a response .
Connecting A 3D HDTV
Viewing 3D content from a Blu-ray source ( currently the only way to see movies or programming ) requires a single “ High Speed ” HDMI cable connection between the 3D capable Blu-ray player and 3D TV .
When inserting a 3D disc into the player , an on - screen prompt will ask if you want to view the disc in 3D or 2D .
You select 3D , press the remoteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s “ enter ” button , power - on the 3D glasses and then sit back and enjoy the “ amazing experience ” .
Samsung ’s 3D LED LCD HDTVs have new , unique 3D picture control options that weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll cover in our upcoming review of the set and 3D Blu-ray player .
UPDATE 3/21/10:Ã‚Â
You can order a [ amazonify ]
B001CHTJ8O :: text ::::6 Foot 3D Compatible High Speed HDMI
Cable [ / amazonify ] from Amazon for $ 6.78 with free shipping ( for total orders over $ 25 ) .
Please Note : Best Buy ’s least expensive High Speed HDMI cable ( rated 10.2 Gbps ) sells for $ 39.99

Problemene i NAV - reformen startet fra dag én .
Tirsdag ble det klart at NAV - direktør Tor Saglie går av .
Eneste grunnen til at han ikke har måttet ta sin hatt å gå tidligere , er at det har vært et samlet storting bak NAV - reformen .
Dette er en av de største reformene i norsk historie , hvor den statlige arbeids - og velferdsetaten og deler av kommunenes sosialtjenester inngår i felles lokale kontorer .
Det som skulle ble en forenkling for brukerne , har til tider vært en katastrofe .
Saksbehandlingstiden har vært svært lang , og etaten har hatt store utestående beløp .
I tillegg til dette har arbeidsmiljøet og « turnoveren » vært stor blant de ansatte .
Store data - og organisatoriske prosjekter har også slukt ressursene i NAV - reformen .
Flengende kritikk
Det hele kulminerte med at Riksrevisjonen kom med flengende kritikk mot NAV i flere omganger .
Riksrevisjonen har blant mye ikke godkjent regnskapene for 2007 eller 2008 .
I fjor høst , ble NAV - situasjonen sentral for revisjonen av statens regnskaper
- Revisjonen har identifisert en rekke tilfeller av feil i utbetaling av sykepenger , overgangsstønad og barnebidrag , skrev Riksrevisjonen .
Tor Saglie ble deretter kalt inn på teppet i Stortinget , uten at det fikk konsekvenser for jobben .
Stor utgiftspost
Presset på Saglie og NAV - reformen ble imidlertid ikke mindre , godt hjulpet av at utbetalingene til arbeids - og sosialtiltak bare øker og øker .
I Riksrevisjonens siste rapport kommer det frem at hver tredje krone over statsbudsjettet sendes gjennom NAV .
Dette tilsvarer rundt 300 milliarder kroner , og berører 600.000 nordmenn .
Samtidig er alts å etaten garantist for skattebetalerne for at de enorme summene som betales ut , er under kontroll .
Riksrevisjonens rapporter har imidlertid vist at rotet og lovbruddene i NAV har fortsatt .
Blant lovbruddene til NAV har Riksrevisjonen påpekt disse :
* Reglene sier at alle sykmeldte skal følges opp for å komme tilbake på jobb , men syv av ti får ingen slik oppfølging eller kontroll fra Nav .
* Køen av ubehandlede saker ( restanser ) har økt fra 123.000 til 193.000 saker på ett år .
« Restansene har særlig økt for ytelsene uførepensjon , barnebidrag , barnetrygd , foreldrepenger og sykepenger .
Økningen i saksbehandlingstid og restanser medfører at brukere i perioder kan bli stående uten den ytelsen de har rett til » , skrev Riksrevisjonen i fjor høst .
Når det gjelder rot viste revisjonen til svikt i internkontrollen .
Riksrevisjonen påpekte at det kunne være feil i utrolige 60 til 70 prosent av sakene .
Blant annet ble det påvist 500 konkrete saker hvor det er feil i utbetalte sykepenger eller overgangsstønad .
I 61 saker har brukeren for eksempel fått utbetalt sykepenger , selv om retten til ytelsen ikke forelå på grunn av manglende arbeidsinntekt .
Disse brukerne har fått utbetalt cirka 9,8 millioner kroner i sykepenger som de ikke har rett til .
Hodepine for flere ministere
Det var i sin tid Bjarne Håkon Hanssen som var første statsråd med ansvaret for NAV - reformen .
Arvtakerne Dag Terje Andersen og Rigmor Aasrud har også hatt NAV - reformen som en tung bør .
Selv om Saglie nå går av , står det store uløste oppgaver igjen .
Blant annet har jobben med endringen av flere gamle styringssystemer blitt igangsatt , og som igjen kan føre til mer rot for NAV - brukerne .
Anderson Cooper does a pretty good job with calling out wingnut birther Arizona State Representative Cecil Ash for his decision to support a bill that would make Arizona the first official birther state ( edited to make it safe for work ) :
Can anyone tell me exactly what the f**k is wrong with the state of Arizona ?
There are at least twenty - two rational people there .
But not enough to stop the Arizona state legislature from passing a law that , “ Would require U.S. presidential candidates who want to appear on the ballot in Arizona to submit documents proving they meet the constitutional requirements to be president . ”
In other words , Arizona is well on its way to becoming the first official birther state .
Mesa Republican Representative Cecil
Ash stated that , “ He has no reason to doubt Obama ’s citizenship but supports the measure because it could help end doubt . ”
Really ?
End the doubt , eh ?
He is apparently unaware that only the truly insane believe that sh*t in the first place .
I know that there is some doubt lingering out there in Wingnuttia .
I also know that this grim fairy tale is being deliberately propagated by people who know it to be untrue .
But they have a political agenda and wo n’t let a little thing like the truth get in the way of delegitimizing the nation ’s first black President .
He said as much to Anderson Cooper and I give Cooper credit for at least asking this guy if he should know better than to be doing this because unlike his uninformed constituents , he 's in a leadership position .
Cooper :
So why vote for something which perpetuates these false Internet rumors ?
Ash : Well Anderson
I think there ’s been a lot of controversy over the issue .
It ’s created a division among a lot of people in the United States and for better or worse many people do n’t believe he ’s a U.S. citizen .
They believe he has loyalties … ah… divided loyalties I suppose you could say .
Cooper :
But those people are wrong .
He is a U.S. citizen .
Ash : Well , you ’re telling me that he ’s wrong .
I ’ve never investigated that .
If he is then he has nothing to fear .
Cooper : But I mean , the information is out there .
It has been released .
It has been shown .
There are some people who do n’t believe it , but there are also some people who believe that the moon is made out of cheese and you can say you ’ve never investigated it but I think you would probably say to them the moon is not made out of cheese .
Ash :
Well , I certainly would but the reason I spoke up on this bill is simply because there is a lot of division in the country and I believe this would put an end to any future controversy about a President ’s qualifications .
Cooper :
You told our producer you voted for this because you get a lot of calls from constituents who have questions based on things they read on the Internet .
I mean is n’t it your job as a leader to actually lead ; to not just throw up your hands and say well who knows what ’s real or not on the Internet , to actually say well , actually Hawaii has released this information and it ’s factually correct ?
Ash : Well as I said I have n’t personally investigated that but I think that if …
Cooper :
But I mean there ’s plenty of things you believe that are not personally investigated ?
Why this you ’re holding on to ?
We know why Anderson .
The guy 's playing to the lowest denominator in the Republican base and demonizing our first black President .
Anyone else notice how he continually uses the word " qualified " instead of " eligible " .
Cooper should have called him out for that one as well .
I 'm sure this wo n't shock anyone , but guess who Cecil Ash is a fan of ?

Dans un rapport publié la semaine dernière sur la contrefaçon aux Etats - Unis , le Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , l'équivalent américain de la Cour des comptes française , jette un regard très critique sur les chiffres utilisés par les industries du divertissement et du logiciel pour calculer les pertes dues au téléchargement illégal .
Il conclut notamment qu'un chiffrage précis des pertes liées au téléchargement illégal est impossible à réaliser de manière satisfaisante , et qu'il serait important d'étudier les possibles " impacts positifs " de cette pratique .
Pour le GAO , les méthodes de calcul utilisées par les représentants de l'industrie du divertissement – Motion Picture Association of America pour les films , Recording Industry Association of America pour la musique , Business Software Alliance pour les logiciels ... – comportent toutes plusieurs failles importantes qui les discréditent .
Elles s'appuient majoritairement sur un taux de substitution de un pour un , c'est - à- dire que les organismes considèrent que tout produit téléchargé illégalement équivaut à une vente perdue .
" La plupart des experts que nous avons interrogés estiment que ce taux de substitution d'un pour un n'est pas crédible dans les cas où les biens contrefaits sont significativement moins chers que l'original " , note le GAO .
Le GAO signale également que trop peu d'études mentionnent la méthodologie utilisée et abusent par ailleurs d'extrapolations .
Le rapport pointe notamment l'utilisation généralisée du coefficient de calcul RIMS II , un outil statistique qui sert à estimer l'impact sur l'emploi , la croissance ou les salaires d'une hausse ou d'une baisse d'un secteur économique .
" Ce coefficient n'est pas adapté pour le calcul de l'impact [ de la contrefaçon ] , car il ne prend pas en compte le fait que ( ... ) l'argent économisé par l'acheteur reste au sein de l'économie américaine " , jugent les experts interrogés .
RAPPORTS INEXISTANTS
Le rapport évoque également trois études , largement citées par les industries du divertissement , mais dont le GAO n'a pu trouver trace .
Une estimation de 200 à 250 milliards de dollars de pertes annuelles dues à la contrefaçon ( téléchargement illégal et contrefaçon d'objets , de médicaments ... ) , attribuée au FBI , semble n'avoir jamais été calculée par les services fédéraux , même s'il en est fait mention dans un communiqué de presse de l'agence .
De même , une étude des douanes américaines qui estime les pertes d'emplois liées à la contrefaçon à 750 000 postes n'a pas été confirmée par les douanes .
Globalement , le GAO estime que tout calcul destiné à évaluer l'impact économique de la contrefaçon – et du téléchargement illégal – est nécessairement à prendre avec précaution .
" L'un des experts interrogés nous a expliqué que toute estimation est suspecte , vu qu'il s'agit par nature d'une économie parallèle et que les chiffres utilisés sont des estimations ' au doigt mouillé ' " .
Le rapport juge également que les possibles effets positifs de la contrefaçon sur l'économie , " qui n'ont fait l'objet d'aucune étude sérieuse " , méritent que l'on s'y intéresse , pour tenter de déterminer s'ils existent et quel est leur impact .

Back during the last presidential election , questions were raised about the Southern Baptist Convention ’s position that women are subservient to men , especially as it related to Mike Huckabee and his support for the belief that “ a wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ . ”
The issue came up again when John McCain named Sarah Palin as his running mate , with people like Tony Perkins and Richard Land saying it was perfectly acceptable for Palin to possible be VP , but not okay for a woman to serve in a leadership position within the church .
Well , the issue is coming up once more , as the Georgia Baptist Convention is considering cutting ties with a local church where a husaband and wife team have been serving as co-pastors :
A more than 95 - year - old church in Atlanta may be ousted from the Southern Baptist Convention over a woman pastor .
The Rev. Mimi Walker has been serving as co-pastor at Druid Hills Baptist Church with her husband , the Rev. Graham Walker , since 2003 .
But earlier this month , leaders of the Georgia Baptist Convention recommended cutting ties with the local congregation .
… Dr. Richard Land , president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , said the Baptist Faith and Message does not state that “ women are to be subservient to men . ”
They are of equal worth before God , he stated earlier .
And though women are gifted for service in the church , Land says the New Testament teaches that “ a woman is not to usurp authority over the man ” and thus women are not to serve as pastors .
It was just last year that Al Mohler , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , warned that the SBC risked dying out if it did not find a way to stop losing members .
Of course , that was said just weeks after the SBC had kicked out a church due to the fact that it was insufficiently hostile to gays .
It should also be noted that this would be the second time in a year that the Georgia Baptist Convention has severed ties with a local church over a female pastor .
TV viewers heard her cry " Whoa ! " before she continued , " Oh well !
So much for that .
Go on with the weather , go on ! "
After climbing back into her seat , Lawson went straight on reading the news .
In the UK , Google was forced to give its e-mail service Gmail a different name , Googlemail , because of a trademark dispute .
These disputes take a long time ( Gmail was changed into Googlemail in October 19 , 2005 ) , so Google opted to use a different ( yet recognizable ) name until the dispute was resolved .
Four and a half years later , UK users will finally get their @gmail.com addresses , as Googlemail is changing its name back to Gmail .
Users will have the choice of keeping their old @googlemail.com address or switching to a new one .
" If you already have a Google email account in the UK , you 'll soon have the option to switch your existing @googlemail.com address to the matching @gmail.com one , but you 're also free to stick with @googlemail.com , " the announcement explains .
" And starting later this week , anybody who signs up for a new account in the UK will get an @gmail.com address . "
Google jokingly estimates that the change will have a positive impact on overall energy consumption .
" Since ' gmail ' is 50 % fewer characters than ' googlemail , ' we estimate this name change will save approximately 60 million keystrokes a day .
At about 217 microjoules per keystroke , that 's about the energy of 20 bonbons saved every day , " it claims .
The transition from Googlemail to Gmail will happen over the next week .

The preferences solution does n't work for me .
When I go to searchredirect.windstream.net/prefs.php , I get this message :
" Your Preferences Are Currently Locked
The preference settings for your IP are currently locked either because you are not allowed to set preferences or because the preference server is currently offline . "
I would imagine this is because I 'm on a university 's network , so I do n't have access to my IP preferences .
Regardless , I should n't have to deal with this issue .

Luckily I 'm not having this issue so I suspect it 's because I 'm running my own bind9 caching NS .
I do n't trust the other DNS providers since it seems all to common to hijack NXDOMAIN now , which is an egregious offense .
So , Windstream , how does this deplorable search hi-jack work ?
Are you poisoning DNS queries or using layer 7 DPI and 302 redirecting ?
I 'd like to know since I 'm a customer and this was sprung on me , with technical details so I can gauge how it impacts me and take appropriate action to mitigate it outside of an " opt- out " page .
In the future the default action choice should be " opt- in " , not " out - out " .
Let me " opt - in " if I want my HTTP data mangled .

The way this " opt- out " works ( or at least use to work ) is that it places a cookie on your computer .
As soon as you close your browser , delete your cookies , clear temporary internet files , etc ... it reverts back to the same behavior which requires you to go back in and reset the preference .
This is a lot of work when you start considering that a household may have 4 or more computers , or laptops , or cell phones that can't even save cookies .
Or that it must be done every time you close your browser , or if you have multiple operating systems .
When I complained about this , they gave me special DNS servers that I could use that would n't hijack .
It has worked wonderfully .
However , now ... my Firefox searches are being hijacked even with my custom DNS .
This is ridiculous .
Please fix this .

Looking through Firefox 's cookie manager I could not find any cookies related to having this disservice enabled or disabled .
After disabling it stopped for me .
Then came back randomly and disappeared again .
Weird , huh ?
Also I should mention that when Google searches are hijacked , unlike when non-existent domains were hijacked ; I actually see the Google results page load briefly , then it hijacks me to Windstream 's ad - filled search page with all of their unrelated sponsored results .

I 'm using a m0n0 wall box with my windstream DSL .
I was using the windstream DNS servers and out of the blue , today , my google search was hijacked by windstream .
This behavior absolutely disgraceful .
Anyway my LAN hosts get my m0n0 wall IP as the the DNS server and the m0n0 wall forwards requests to either hard coded DNS servers or the WAN DHCP DNS servers .
When I changed the DNS forwarding settings in m0n0 wall from WAN DHCP servers to OpenDNS servers , the hijack was fixed .
Windows boxes that get the actual DNS servers rather than their router IP for DNS may need a couple ipconfig / flushdns commands or a reboot .
I 've seen XP machines keep old DNS servers through a reboot , so you may need more than one .
Good luck .

- BP I would say that it not behaving as a DNS redirect should .
However we are working on resolving this issue as quickly as possible .

I find it weird that I have opendns servers hard set into my router and still experienced this issue .
The only solution was to opt out .
We swear we 've seen a Motorola phone that looks like this odd square thing before , but it 's also possible we 're crazy .
Either way , it looks like Moto 's working on a new Blur set running Android 2.1 , and if you thought screen size and resolution issues differences were a big part of Android fragmentation before , well , you ain't seen nothing yet .
Oh , and as for the story that this pic came from a student who borrowed the phone from a friend whose dad works for Moto ?
We 'd be more skeptical , except that 's exactly how we 've gotten other dead - on Moto leaks .
So ... yeah .
Anyway , a square Moto slider running Blur .
Does that do anything for anyone ?
No ?
Okay .
Arsene Wenger has refused to confirm that Manuel Almunia will remain his No.1 next season .
Wenger yet to decide on long - term No.1
Arsene Wenger has refused to confirm that Manuel Almunia will remain his No.1 next season .
Some critics have suggested that Arsenal are not strong enough in the goalkeeping department and will need to strengthen in the summer .
Almunia has produced a number of impressive performances this term but his mistakes have also been highlighted , and Wenger is not yet sure who will be his man between the posts on a long - term basis .
Question marks have also been raised about Lukasz Fabianski , who has provided the back - up to Almunia but came under fire following two blunders against Porto in the UEFA Champions League .
Wenger is now set to consider his options over the remaining weeks of the campaign before speaking about the situations of individual players .
Asked if Almunia was too weak , Wenger said : " I do n't think it is the best moment to talk about that .
" I never said he will be my long - term No 1 .
" Almunia is a great keeper and is in competition with Fabianski .
I want to see how we finish so I do n't think it 's the best period to talk about individual players . "
Despite the German 's quiet start to the 2010 Formula One campaign , Fernando Alonso believes that it would be foolish for anyone to discount Michael Schumacher from their world championship considerations .
Some 28 points separate the two drivers after three races , with Alonso having won the season - opener in Bahrain , as Schumacher appears to have struggled to re-acclimatise to life in the top flight with Mercedes after three years of retirement .
The seven - time champion has a best finish of sixth from Bahrain , but managed only tenth after a first corner incident in Australia and then retired early on in Malaysia , leaving him only tenth overall .
Alonso , however , is reading little into Schumacher 's apparent woes suggesting that , despite the 41 - year old having been out - gunned by young compatriot Nico Rosberg at each round , it is too early to be writing him off .
" He is still the Michael Schumacher that we know , " the Spaniard warned German magazine Sport Bild , " I respect him in the same way I did three years ago and am sure that he will show his true qualities when the car is better .
I really believe Michael will be a serious competitor for the title this year . "
While Alonso insists that Schumacher remains a threat , however , potential title rival Mark Webber appears to have dismissed the German 's potential , claiming that the championship race will not feature a Mercedes driver .
Instead , the Australian has predicted that , with each team having taken a victory so far this season , Ferrari , McLaren and his own Red Bull squad would be the main protagonists come the end of the year .
" I think Ferrari and McLaren are very strong - clearly it's three teams already , " Webber told ESPN , " Mercedes are doing okay , but it 's Ferrari , McLaren and Red Bull who are the most consistent at the moment in terms of pace . "
After chasing team - mate Sebastian Vettel home for a RBR 1 - 2 at Sepang , Webber is hoping that the Milton Keynes outfit can now marry its undoubted pace with solid reliability for the rest of the season .
Vettel appeared poised to claim victory in each of the opening rounds , only to be slowed or sidelined by mechanical problems , while Webber 's current eighth place in the standings have resulted largely from his own errors .
" The momentum needs to start building pretty quickly , " the Aussie admitted , " The job they 've done to recover off some tough weekends is a real credit to the team .
The spirit internally in our team and the chemistry is sensational , working with Renault and Red Bull , everyone together is fighting incredibly hard .
We take on these big manufacturer teams , but our team is very unique .
So far , it has n't been the smoothest championship but to come back is a very good performance . "
Alonso , meanwhile , concluded that , while Schumacher has not enjoyed a successful return to the F1 ranks , he looks set to remain as the sport 's most decorated participant .
" Because the rules are now so tight , there will be no - one who is far superior to the others , as Ferrari was in the past , " the Spaniard , himself a double champion , reasoned , " If you ask me , Michael 's records are safe . "
Today a little more to read .
Unfortunately our editor Neveko was not online during the last week so there might be a grammatical error or weird phrase in the text of the letter .
I ’m worrying that some of you might not understand what ’s going on in the last panel , so here is an explanation :
Cloud is watching Twilight to translate its dialog into Burmese and to later send the translation to his cousin .
“ Ankles ” is a word that is mentioned during the pictured scene at the beginning of the movie .
Cloud does not know the Burmese translation for “ ankles ” so he is asking his mother for it .
When I was going to elementary school I played the great adventure game “ Indiana Jones and the the Last Crusade ” , which was completely in English , together with my mother on the Atari ST .
Reading and understanding whole English sentences was a bit 😉 above my mental capabilities at that time , so she had to translate all the dialog for me while playing .
Update [ 5 April 2010 ] :
We have now 12 comment moderators , but if you are interested and a regular comment writer you can still apply .
The more reliable moderators the better .
Ye Thuza : Cloud , you ’ve got a letter from your cousin Win Thiri Shwan !
Cloud , you ’ve got a letter from your cousin Win Thiri Shwan !
Cloud : Yay !
Letter : Hi Cloudy ,
thank you so much for your kind letter ^^ .
I ’m so happy for you that you ’re such a good student and that you have so many friends .
Sandra really seems to like you , does n’t she ?
😉
Just be nice to her or I ’ll smack you ! 😉
I ’m now going to school again too !
We ’re back in our old village .
It ’s quite a lot of work to repair all the damaged houses .
But some of them are almost finished already !
When I ’m done studying I ’m always busy helping .
It ’s soooo nice here !! 🙂
One month ago great uncle signed a ceasefire with the military .
Now the soldiers do n’t bother us anymore !
Except for you - know - who and his men .
They ’re just as mean to us as they were before .
Why are some people so evil ? :’-(
And many !
many !
thanks for all the great movies you sent us !!
The man from the post office took some of them away .
But just a few !
Uncle Myint Arun always translated everything for us when we were watching them .
I want to learn English now too !
Because I want to know exactly what Edward < 3 and Bella ^^ are saying in Twilight !
It ’s so unfair that I could see Twilight only once together with my uncle …..
When I wanted to watch it again he said that the movie was totally dumb and that he never wants to watch it again !
HE is dumb !!!
Twilight is the best movie of all time !!!!
The best part was when Edward and Bella looked at each other in the forest and Edward said “ And so the lion fell in love with the lamb … ” and Bella replied with “ What a stupid lamb … ”
Do you like Twilight so much too ?
Hugs and kisses
Win Thiri Shwan Cloud : Mom , what ’s “ ankles ” in Burmese ?
It 's the ubiquitous alarm clock feature that grants you a few more ( often around nine ) precious minutes of reprieve from the day ahead , but according to various sleep studies , your snooze button probably does more harm than good .
Photo by alancleaver_2000 .
A New York Times article from 2004 highlights the problem with the snooze button :
[ S ] leep researchers agree that short bouts of sleep are far from ideal .
The restorative value of rest is diminished , especially when the increments are short , said Dr. Edward Stepanski , who has studied sleep fragmentation at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago .
And a teeter - totter effect of dozing and waking causes shifts in the brain - wave patterns .
'' Even a subtle noise that does n't actually wake you up is disruptive enough to affect the sleep quality , '' Dr. Stepanski said .
'' That 's why someone who falls asleep with the TV on may wake up exhausted .
So , if a person is rousing themselves enough to reset a clock , there 's likely to be an even more profound effect . ''
As we are stepping in a new decade , it ’s time to give up the old , worn web designs and prepare for the new face of tomorrow .
This new emergence not only marked newer and more innovative applications of the internet and it ’s contents , it also opened up a whole new galaxy of trendy , stylish and useful designs .
We have seen many world class designers and websites predicting newer trends in the beginning of the year .
In this article 11 major trends regarding the web design are covered .
From oversize headers which are serving as new kind of splash screens to minimalism which is being supported by typography .
See what ’s to come in 2010 .
Logos / Header
This is an essential replacement of splash pages .
To make a good impression on the visitor Over - sized logos and headers would deliver important key messages to visitors .
These types of headers can take up the entire screen , but with one important note .
Visitors will not need to click anything , just scroll down .
It would necessarily target to create a visual impact easily recognized and remembered .
Typography
This trend started over the past year and will continue .
Web designers are often afraid of using new and different fonts .
The idea of mixing various font sizes together is totally new .
Usability is the main reason for this .
Fonts should be explored , twisted and molded .
With the correct placement of exciting fonts , a website that applies Typography as its capital design part will be more interesting to a reader than devastating the site with lots of photos .
Magazine Layout
As many people , going online to see the web as the source of online entertainment and real time information , many websites will be proceeding towards this type of look , where information is correctly organized on a single homepage which will give the visitor a scope to be interested .
The conventional layouts will attract anyone who ’s ever read a magazine or newspaper , but it should be easier to use .
In 2010 , the idea of magazine layout will be great , particularly in blogs .
Single Page Layouts
With single page layouts you can edit away what ’s unnecessary .
So visitors will not need to look around your website and see everything .
This is the solution to get them the info they need .
In 2010 this trend would largely be effective for personal sites .
Introduction Boxes
The upper - left area of a website is the most important block on the page , because that is the first place your eye goes when you come to the website .
If you ’re trying to make a creative About page , an intro box will be your best bet .
With an Intro box you can introduce yourself into a relatively small about space .
This spot grabs most attention from visitors .
In 2010 Intro boxes will push its own borders .
Instead of boring hello , designers will find new pick - up lines .
Therefore , this is the ideal place to get your message out and seen quickly .
Large Images / Photography
2010 will see the use of huge images as a close relative to the oversized logo / header .
These images would not be an integrated part of the website ’s branding .
It creates a visual impression that the visitor would not soon forget .
Minimalism
In 2010 websites will continue contain lots of white space but with excellent typography and color schemes .
Minimalism is by nature muted , it showcase fresh colors also .
Over the years , minimalism has become more stylish and they would sure continue .
Sketches , hand drawn style and illustrations
Hand - drawn design is not exactly new on the boundary .
We have seen this trend into existence for a while .
Designers across the globe are sure that this trend would become an elemental part in web design in the year ahead .
It stands out from traditional graphics and gives the website a unique , personalized look .
Modal Boxes
Modal boxes are a trend that ’s picking up stream .
All the big websites use them and they are becoming more popular with each passing day .
They are cleaner , more user - friendly alternative to the basic JavaScript pop up windows that have been around for years .
Modal Boxes are easy to design and easy to use , making them a great design as well as usability feature .
Clean , crisp and focuses the user on the information you ’re presenting .
This tool helps the presentation go a long way .
Icons and Visuals
Its not about clip art , but stylistically beautiful icons that represent in a small image what the entire section is about .
Easy for people to recognize and people notice them quicker than text .
Oversized Footer
Oversized footers may be everywhere already .
It ’s now yet another zone in design where contents show up .
Oversized footers with useful display of contents and designs mixed should become something to watch out for .
Look for footers that contain random information , like feed updates from various social media , daily polls etc .
Before I get stuck in , some revision is in order — notably , a re-reading of CMAP 2 : How books are made , and my mid-2007 article , Why the Commercial Ebook Market is Broken .
Then continue below for a round - up of some aspects of the ebook biz that are not immediately evident from the headlines .
I am coming to this topic from two different angles .
Firstly , I 'm an author and some of my books are published through ebook channels .
Secondly , I 've got a computer science degree — having graduated in 1990 , this makes me about as current as someone with an aeronatical engineering degree issued in 1937 — which qualification , along with several years earning my crust as a programmer and as a computer journalist , has fine - tuned my bullshit detector .
There is no topic in the publishing industry this decade that is the source of as many misconceptions , superstitions , lies , plausible untruths , and idiocies as ebooks .
Ebooks generate more email to my from my readers than just about any other topic .
And the situation is only going to get worse over the next few years , so strap your safety helmet on tight ...
The lessons I 'd like you to draw from those two earlier essays are :
1 . A manuscript is not the same thing as a book .
Just as a random sampling of 100,000 words is not a novel , so too does a finished book differ from a manuscript ( the text an author writes , which forms the core of the book ) .
In particular , about 80 - 90 % of the cover price of a book has nothing to do with the paper and ink object you buy in a shop ; indeed , using current production standards , ebook production requires nearly as much work as paper book production .
( Paper and ink are dirt cheap ; proofreaders and marketing teams are n't . )
2. Ebooks differ from paper books insofar as you need a device to read them with .
This device , which may be hardware , software , or both , I shall henceforth refer to as a platform .
Amazon 's Kindle software ( or reader ) is a platform .
The ePub file format standard is part of a platform , which may be the Sony Reader Store / Adobe Digital Editions , or Apple 's iBooks ( which is just a variant implementation of ePub ) , or Stanza .
The hardware the platform runs on has hitherto been either a PC , or a PDA , or more recently an e-ink based ebook reader , and now ( with increasing frequency ) a smartphone .
3 . The publishing industry has been starting from a doubly - handicapped position .
Firstly , publishers are used to having multiple sales channels : hardcovers , trade paperbacks , and mass market paperbacks .
( I discussed the financial and structural differences between these markets in CMAP # 5 . )
Ebooks are seen , from a publisher 's point of view , as being a new format , to stand beside paperbacks or hardbacks or audio books .
That 's because this is the way the contracts they negotiate with their authors are set up to allocate rights , and because that 's how they 're set up to handle the bookkeeping .
Selling ebooks cheaply is a threat to their other sales channels — the phrase " cannibalize our market " is commonly used — but readers see ebooks as being less valuable than physical objects because they consistently over - value the paper - and - ink ( and we in the publishing business have systematically trained them not to recognize the fact that the price on a book does n't reflect actual production costs , but a measure of availability — if you want to buy it early , we want to charge you more ) .
The second handicap hobbling the Big Six publishing multinationals is that they 're owned by multimedia conglomerates , and group level policies are set at a level above the publishers — who get very little say in said policy compared to the movie , TV , and music corporations that are also part of the conglomerates .
Consequently , dumb , idiotic , stupid policies get imposed by decree ... for example , that Digital Rights Management is mandatory .
This worked really well for the music and film industries ( not ) , but the publishers are stuck with it because at the highest level , the executives would rather miss out on a new sales channel entirely than risk destroying their existing ones .
Consequently , ebooks have been an afterthought to the publishing industry for over a decade ( even though the technology to distribute them over the internet and read them on Palm Pilots and similar PDAs has been around since the mid-1990s ) .
So it 's no surprise that it 's taken ebooks a long time to get anywhere in the market .
But 2009 was a breakthrough year .
Here 's a graph taken from the International Digital Publishing Forum , showing recent ebook sales in the US ( Click through for more meaty goodness on ebook sales ) :
US ebook sales rocketed in 2009 , growing to over $ 167M — up nearly 50 % on the previous year .
Which may sound good , until you realize that according to the Association of American Publishers , the US publishing industry reported book sales of $ 23.9 Bn in 2009 .
Yes : ebooks accounted for a gigantic 0.7 % of the publishing industry 's revenue .
( On the other hand , if the 50 % compound growth per annum is sustained , they 're going to be a major piece of the picture in five to ten years ' time . )
So how have things changed since the brokenness of 2007 ?
And what misconceptions do we need to dispel in order to have a hope of understanding what 's going on ?
Let 's take it from the top .
Publishers initially saw ebooks as merely being a different imprint .
Early - adopting readers take ebooks for a new medium .
For publishers , treating ebooks as a new imprint is the easiest ( laziest ) way to handle them , because it means they do n't have to redesign their accounting systems , which in turn are built that way because publishers do not own copyright to the books they sell — they license them from authors , and have to be able to calculate the due royalties and open their accounts if challenged .
Amazon screwed with this model when they brought out the Kindle : the contracts they pushed at the publishers defined Amazon as being a publisher , who would license subsidiary rights from the original publisher and republic the books via Kindle .
This enabled Amazon to add onerous and arguably anticompetitive contractual terms to their contracts because they were n't simply acting as consignment wholesalers , but as licensees : notably , requiring publishers not to sell ebooks for a lower price elsewhere than Amazon were selling them via their store , and allowing Amazon to pick a price point , sell at that price point , and only pay the publisher a percentage royalty , rather than a fixed discount off a ( publisher - set ) SRP .
Amazon got what they wanted at first , because they were the biggest ebook vendor ; if you 're the only game in town you can play hardball .
Apple broke this perception earlier this year when they proposed an alternative model : neither wholesaler nor publisher , but agent , taking a commission on whatever the publishers sold their books for .
The agency model is ultimately going to change the structure of the ebook market ; if ebooks become more profitable for publishers , we 're going to see more of them .
And indeed , in the past year I 've seen a startling increase in the speed with which ebook editions of my work are rolled out by my publishers .
Readers ... readers see none of this , and wonder what can possibly be so hard about recognizing this revolutionary new medium for what it is ( " a library in your pocket / information wants to be free / why are you charging so much for access to the file your authors emailed you ? " ) .
Mostly because they 've mistaken an elephant 's tail for a bell - rope .
Publishers do not develop platforms .
Platforms come from the consumer electronics industry and / or the software business .
They are virtually never invented by actual publishers , or even by folks who know what publishers do for a living .
The folks who develop platforms hope to get rich by selling software or hardware ( harnessing the publishing folks ' customers in order to gain consumers for their own product ) .
This probably explains all those " the book will be dead in five years " puff pieces in the press ( themselves no strangers to the schadenfreude that goes with some other sector of the old media collapsing in misery around them ) — they 're the effusions of software marketing drones , and signify nothing about the actual state of the publishing industry .
Although they do succeed in scaring the crap out of the dinosaurs , who repeatedly mistake the shiny in the sky for an inbound meteor .
Just contemplate , for a moment , how you 'd react to some guy from the IT sector walking into your place of work to evangelize a wonderful new piece of technology that will revolutionize your job , once everybody in the general population shells out £ 500 for a copy and you do a lot of hard work to teach them how to use it , And , on closer interrogation , you discover that he does n't actually know what you do for a living ; he 's just certain that his WNPoT is going to revolutionize it .
Now imagine that this happens ( different IT marketing guy , different WNPoT , same pack drill ) approximately once every two months for a five year period .
You 'd learn to tune him out , would n't you ?
This is how publishers have traditionally viewed ebook platforms and readers .
Authors have nothing to do with their ebook editions .
Weird but true .
When a hardcover edition comes out , I get to hear a lot about it ; reviews , a crate of comp copies , and so on .
( If I 'm lucky , a launch party . )
When a paperback comes out , ditto .
But ebooks somehow slither out the back door with no publicity and no attention ( and no mechanism to give the author a complementary copy , either ) .
They 're very much an afterthought , even in 2009 / 10 .
In many cases , ebooks were n't even issued at all until last year .
My Merchant Princes series fell between stools : books 1 - 3 saw ebook editions during an early Tor experiment with ebook publishing .
Books 5 and 6 came out in time for a formal group - wide ebook strategy at Holtzbrinck to be in effect , and thus are available as ebooks .
But book 4 fell in the gap , and is still awaiting an ebook release .
( Yes , I get email about this .
A lot . )
As often as not , my publishers do n't even tell me when a book of mine is going to appear in ebook form .
( Hint to my editors : I can't tell readers where to go to buy it if I do n't know it exists ! )
Publishers inflict DRM on their ebooks .
I should n't need to explain why DRM is bad , stupid , and doomed to failure , so I 'll leave it to cryptography guru Bruce Schneier , who in 2001 pointed out that DRM is an attempt to repeal the laws of nature .
When you get down to it , every DRM scheme relies on encrypting files , then giving them to someone else , along with the necessary decryption key for decrypting them , and trusting that the someone else is too stupid to reverse engineer the decryption algorithm and use the keys you helpfully provided .
The primary problem with DRM is not only that it does n't work , but that it irritates the hell out of law - abiding customers who only buy legal products ( with DRM ) , but does n't inconvenience pirates in the slightest .
It 's actually counterproductive .
Customers learn to stay away from vendors of DRM'd products , once they 've upgraded a device too far and discover that their old files are locked away from them and inaccessible ( because the old software or keys wo n't run on their new gadgets ) .
A secondary problem with DRM is that it fractures the market — if a consumer has to commit to a particular DRM platform in order to read their books , then they can't easily buy books by authors whose publishers picked a different platform .
So unless the publishers try to support all the DRM platforms , they 're going to be left offering their customers a tiny sub -set of the books they can buy if they wander off the street into a branch of B&N , Borders , or Waterstones .
Supporting multiple DRM platforms is expensive and time - consuming ; not providing a decent range of goods is a deterrent to building the ebook habit among your customers .
QED .
DRM does n't emerge from the publishing industry itself ; it 's those annoying IT marketing guys with their WNPoTs again .
In this case , the WNPoT in question ( each and every DRM system ) is designed to deal with a ingrowing toenail , but appears to involve leg irons and a chainsaw , if not a guillotine .
For some reason , senior management recommend it .
I 'm hopeful that the DRM nonsense will pass , if and when the music and film industries pull their heads out of their collective cloaca .
Of course , the publishing industry may be a smoking crater by then : but hey , I 'm an optimist .
( Some of you may with some justification point to Cory Doctorow and say , " how come he puts out free ebooks without DRM ? "
To which , I 'm afraid to say the answer is that Cory is a Special Snowflake with EFF superpowers and New York Times Bestseller mojo which make him immune to the normal laws of man and nature .
The rest of us still get to pay cash . )
There is now a standard ebook platform .
Well , not exactly : but we 're down to three overwhelmingly dominant file formats : MobiPocket ( prop : Amazon — it's what the Kindle runs on ) , ePub ( prop : everyone else , including Sony and Apple ) , and PDF ( horrible for reading novels on handheld devices , but nevertheless ubiquitous for things like illustrated text books , scientific papers , and role playing game manuals ) .
With fewer formats it becomes easier to produce visually appealing ebooks that run on every platform ( modulo the caveats about DRM ) .
We 're also down to a handful of competing DRM platforms .
There 's the Kindle , and there 's going to be Apple .
There 's Adobe Digital Editions , there 's MobiPocket ( waning ) and Microsoft Reader ( almost dead ) and Peanut Press eReader Barnes and Noble .
( B& N ePub dead pool : I give them less than two years before they switch . )
Finally there are the indie publishers who eschew DRM altogether , like Webscriptions .
Historically , ebook readers have been dedicated fans using eccentric niche machines or cumbersome applications on desktop PCs , trying to deal with fragmented proprietary file formats and competing DRM schemes .
( Or just going to bittorrent or usenet or IRC .
As noted : DRM does n't inconvenience pirates — indeed , over time it trains law - abiding users to become pirates out of sheer frustration . )
But now we have the iPhone / iPad / iBook combination which , with 70 million users , is going to be a major player once iPhone OS 4.0 ( and iBooks for iPhone / iPod touch ) ship this summer .
And we have the Kindle platform , which is also available on the iPad / iPhone juggernaut , as well as on PCs and Macs .
These two alternatives dwarf every other platform by at least one order of magnitude in potential size .
Which means an Apple / Amazon duopoly is on the horizon for 2011 , and if we get that far , we 're close to seeing a large , viable , barely - fragmented market .
A " market " where no platform has more than a million users is pretty much useless from a publisher 's point of view .
But a single market with 70 million possible consumers is something else again .
And in anticipation of such a market emerging , ebooks are already rocketing up the publishers ' priorities .
At the same time , something 's going to have to give on pricing .
Treating ebooks as a parallel imprint , equivalent to hardcovers or paperbacks , is insane .
Rather , we need ebooks with variable pricing — moderately cheaper than the corresponding paper edition ( to reflect the reduced cost of production ) , and dropping steadily over time .
There 's going to be a lot of experimentation and some howls of outrage as the publishers flail around , trying to square the circle of a new medium with group policy handed down in the absence of information .
The casualties
My prediction is this : ebooks will kill the mass market paperback distribution channel .
The " mass market " is not a book size , even though it 's associated with the ubiquitous C - format paperback ; rather , it is an abstraction of the magazine / periodical distribution system .
MMPBs are shipped out in the publication month .
They are sold on terms that require the booksellers to pay for sold units 90 ( or 120 ) days after receiving them — or to destroy the books and provide proof of destruction ( the stripped covers ) .
This is how magazines are sold via newsagents , albeit magazines are sold / stripped after one month , not three or four .
The strip - and - pulp thing is an artefact of the cost of returning outdated periodicals — paperbacks do n't go out of date but are costly to ship and warehouse , so it has traditionally been easier to treat them as a kind of long - duration un - dated magazine .
" Trade " paperbacks are merely paperbacks that are sold like hardbacks — if unsold , the entire book must be returned for credit .
In the UK , the mass market book distribution channel collapsed more than 20 years ago .
We still have C - format paperbacks ; they 're just treated as trade books .
In the USA , the C - format is reserved for mass market books , to avoid confusing bookstore staff ( who do not want to accidentally strip - and - pulp trade books that will then have to be paid for in full ) .
But the inefficiencies of a distribution channel that discards and destroys up to 50 % of its produce should be glaringly obvious .
I am told that the US mass market channel nearly collapsed in 2008 , with one of the major distributors entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
With high street bookstores under constant pressure and facing competition from internet sales and now ebooks , mass market paperback distribution will only be stressed further in the next few years .
Ultimately I expect the channel to disintegrate .
( But if you 're a reader who likes the C - format paperback format , do n't worry : they 'll still be around , albeit fewer of them and sold as trade books . )
Ebooks have no returns .
From a publisher 's point of view , ebooks have a couple of brilliant advantages over dead - tree books .
The first is that you do n't print the ebook and ship it to the store until a customer actually pays for it .
The fulfillment model via the iBook or Amazon store is that when a customer clicks the " pay now " button , a request is sent via the bookseller 's store database to the publisher , who encrypts a copy of the master image of the book ( for DRM ) and sends it to the customer via the store in question .
No more 90 days or 120 days of credit : the publisher can demand immediate payment from the bookseller !
Why , the accounting implications are earth - shaking .
( And for their part , the bookseller never has to worry about selling out or running short of shelf space to display their wares . )
But that 's not the best bit ...
Ebooks may in future drive surprise bestsellers .
In 2006 , when I emailed the manuscript of " Halting State " to my editor at Ace , we both thought it would do reasonably well ... but it was n't until
Ace began getting advance feedback from booksellers that they got a vibe that possibly , maybe , it would sell very well .
They took a gamble , and ordered 25 % more hardcovers from the printer than they had with my previous novel .
Then they had to go back to print for another 40 % of their initial run , in the first month , because it sold close to double the numbers of my previous book .
If they'd had the extra book blocks in the warehouse on the day of publication , it might have generated enough momentum to get into the extended bestseller lists , which in turn generates attention — reviews and news coverage — that attracts more readers .
But they did n't , because if they gambled and lost , the cost of the surplus stock would wipe out the profit on those books they succeeded in selling .
Breakthrough bestsellers ( as opposed to bestsellers by established superstars like Stephen King ) are generated by a kind of murky positive - feedback mechanism that nobody really understands .
All we really know is that the one thing that Makes Books Sell is word of mouth : your readers are your best sales team .
You can only exploit that kind of feedback loop if you 're in a position to sell books to customers who want them .
As it is , it takes 2 - 4 weeks to get a rush order to and from the printer and then into the warehouses and bookshops .
This is a woefully long response loop if you 're trying to satisfy instant demand for a novelty item .
In a market that is largely ebook - driven , we may see unexpected bestsellers : books that nobody knew would catch fire , but which — thanks to the instant - print effect of ebooks — can go exponential very rapidly .
Finally :
Ebooks do n't make typesetting , book design , and proofreading obsolete .
I get this a lot from dedicated ebook readers : " I do n't care about formatting and design in ebooks ! "
I think this is a peculiar kind of brain damage or mental scarring that mostly afflicts those who have read one too many OCR'd and badly proof - read scans of pirate copies on their Palm III with a 160x160 pixel black and white display .
To reach a mass audience , ebooks are going to have to be comparably readable to a dead tree edition : sensible use of screen fonts , layout directives , and some eyeball candy are all part of the package .
So is a cover picture , believe it or not , if only so you can spot the iconified version on your virtual bookshelf .
If you think ebooks are all about text and not layout , I encourage you to contemplate the world wide web ; the web was initially about semantics and information interchange too , with no idea about layout or pictures , but you wo n't find many designers agreeing with that thesis today .
Indeed , even a primarily - textual website such as this blog requires some eyeball candy in this day and age .
So do n't write the old skills off just yet !
The next time your girlfriend , wife , or mother complains about all the time you spend playing PS3 or online games , you can tell her that your attraction to video games may actually be a by - product of evolution .
Scientists at the University of Missouri have found that hormonal surges in men playing violent multiplayer videogames are very similar to hormonal responses males of other species experience during reproductive and territorial challenges .
These responses may be evolutionarily hard - wired to help males succeed in coalitionary combat against competitors .
For the study , 42 undergraduate subjects were randomly assigned to three - person teams and each played in two different rounds : the “ outgroup ” competition between their team and an opposing team , and the “ ingroup ” competition , in which each player was pitted against their own teammates .
Unreal Tournament 2004 , in which multiple armed players compete in an arena , was the game of choice .
In the outgroup competition , teams played in the Onslaught mode , in which each team competes to destroy the opposing team ’s power core , located at their home base .
During the ingroup competition , subjects used the Death Match mode , a free - for - all in which players compete to inflict the most damage on their competitors .
The researchers gave each team 6 hours to practice together before the actual competition began .
This practice time also gave each team the opportunity to bond and build a group identity , as social animals do when forming coalitions to compete against other groups of males .
During the actual tournament , opposing teams were separated by a partition , allowing members of the same team to see , hear , and interact with each other .
All tournaments occurred in the early afternoon , were 30 minutes long , and ended with a clear winner .
To test hormone activity , each player ’s saliva was collected at regular intervals both before and after the competitions .
Directly following the outgroup competition , men on winning teams had much higher testosterone levels than the members of the losing teams .
This effect was especially strong for the players who had contributed the most to the team ’s victory .
In animals , a similar hormonal pattern occurs : testosterone levels increase in all competitors to increase aggression and enhance competitive ability , but the most successful males often experience strong post - contest testosterone surges .
Interestingly , when playing against their own teammates in the ingroup part of the tournament , all players showed a decrease in testosterone , with the best males actually having the lowest levels .
This muted testosterone response may be an evolved mechanism to blunt the intensity of ingroup competition .
It ’s not particularly adaptive for males of any species to engage in intense competition with their allies , since they run the risk of damaging group cohesion and decreasing their success in later competitions with opposing groups .
These hormone results show that men seem to react to video games in a similar physiological way to male animals that are competing for mates or defending territory .
Multiplayer videogames such as Unreal Tournament 2004 may simulate situations in which men are naturally predisposed to work with other group members to form strategies , engage in combat , and eliminate a social threat .
Just remember , guys : it ’s only a game .

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based on the first of the popular Millennium trilogy books by Swedish author Stieg Larsson .
Already into the third film of the trilogy in Scandanavia since November 2009 , we lucky Brits are finally getting the chance to see the first film of the trilogy this week and its been well worth the wait as it ’s quite brilliant .
When I first saw the trailer for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a few months back I was instantly put off no thanks to the ridiculous American voice over man making it sound pretty corny and something completely different to what it actually is , Check it out here .
However I left the screening mesmerised by the storyline and was left emotionally battered by the darkness of it al .
The story introduces us to Swedish investigative Journalist Mikael Blomkvist who has been recently discredited due to a libel case over an article he wrote for the Millennium Magazine .
Now with plenty of time on his hands and a high profile he is hired by a wealthy member of the Wagner family , Henrik , to investigate the disappearance / unsolved murder of his niece , Problem is it happened 40 years ago .
Mikael begins an impossible search on the remote estate inhabited by the Wagner family looking through numerous police files , documents and getting to meet the varied ample members of the strange and secretive Wagner ’s asking questions of an apparent crime that took place so long ago and getting nowhere which is where our Girl with the Dragon Tattoo comes in .
Lisbeth Salandar ( Noomi Rapace ) is a disturbed and visually compelling computer hacker who can find information on anyone and similar interests gets her involved in Mikael ’s investigation into the missing Wagner girl .
We ’re introduced to her as she goes through a horrific ordeal with her new guardian , suffers rape , brutal attacks and then carrying - out a dark and horrible revenge on her guardian that is as brutal as they come ,
It ’s a great set up to her character and one that will leave you open mouthed in shock .
Without spoiling the wonderfully rich plot , Lisbeth eventually joins Mikael and together they start to unravel a wonderful and intensely gripping story of the Wagner Family history in a kind of who - dun - it murder mystery that goes deeper and deeper as our unlikely partnered heroes deduce clues that beautifully interconnect and reveal more and more of the wonderful story until we reach an incredible climatic and satisfying conclusion .
The two leads are brilliant with Noomi Rapace dominating the screen in the opening third with some pitch black story - lines and Michael Nyqvist as the investigating Mikael perfectly carrying the story onwards , both form a very watchable and unlikely team that will no doubt escalate in future films that I just cannot wait for .
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a slow burning thriller and despite the beauty of the desolate Swedish landscapes shown throughout , there ’s very little beauty in the thick complicated plot that simmers for a long time before coming to the boil as it unravels a wonderful murder mystery story whilst giving hints of a larger story that is no doubt explored more in the sequels .
The run time of about 150 minutes and subtitles will prove a stumbling block for some but I really do encourage everyone to see The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as it ’s a brilliant piece of cinema and one of the best films so far this year .
Also catch it before a remake gets well and truly into motion because just like the Swedish made Let the Right One In , GWTDT is up for a remake within in a few years of being released !.
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is out on he 12th March .

Editorial : Welcome to the human family , Neanderthals
A LONG - awaited rough draft of the Neanderthal genome has revealed that our own DNA contains clear evidence that early humans interbred with Neanderthals .
Such interminglings have been suspected in the past , but there ’s more : Neanderthals were probably not the only other Homo species early Homo sapiens mixed with .
These findings call into question the familiar story that modern humans left Africa around 100,000 years ago and swept aside all other Homo species as they made their way around the globe .

After being hired for a job in Foxborough last year , Logan Ferraro , a 19 - year - old transgendered man , received a call from his new boss .
On his application , he stated his gender as the one he identifies with : male .
However , this did n’t match his Social Security data , which indicated he was female .
His boss had questions .
After Ferraro explained his status , his boss assured him it would not be a problem .
The next contact Ferraro had with the boss , he said , was a letter with information on how to file for unemployment .
About 100 people gathered in front of the State House yesterday to hear speakers like Ferraro call for the Legislature to pass a bill protecting transgender rights that has been stuck in committee .
“ I ’m sick of being a second - class citizen , ’’ Ferraro said .
“ I may be a transgendered man , but I ’m nonetheless a man . ’’
The bill would make workplace and housing discrimination against transgendered people illegal and protect them against hate crimes .
Activists noted that it was Harvey Milk Day , which would have been the 80th birthday of the gay rights activist and the first openly gay man elected to public office in California .
“ If Harvey were alive today , he ’d be at the forefront of the effort for full rights for transgenders , ’’ said Don Gordon , an event coordinator for Join the Impact MA , the main organizers for the event .
The bill has stirred sharp opposition from critics who have dubbed it the “ bathroom bill , ’’ contending that it would make it easier for sex offenders to have access to young children in public restrooms by allowing people of both genders to use single - sex facilities such as bathrooms , gyms , and locker rooms .
Two of the three major Massachusetts gubernatorial candidates , Republican Charles Baker and independent Timothy Cahill , have said they would veto the bill if elected .
Their campaigns did n’t return messages seeking comment yesterday .
Supporters say those arguments are scare tactics designed to score political points among social conservatives .
“ When all they have to talk about is bathrooms , we know we ’ve won the argument on merits , ’’ Gordon said .
Some in the crowd represented organizations such as Equality across America , the Mass Trans Political Coalition , the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus , and other LGBT groups .
Some people took part as individuals .
After the speeches , Keegan O’Brien of the LGBT Equality Coalition at the University of Massachusetts at Boston led the crowd to Park Street , gaining marchers as they made their way to the JFK Federal Building , holding signs and chanting .
They continued drawing attention as they made their way to Downtown Crossing and through the Boston Common , where onlookers took pictures , some unsure of what they were protesting .
The march ended back at the State House , where Gordon reflected that such rallies give needed attention to LGBT issues .
“ There ’s an intensity factor , ’’ he said .

Quick : which operating system do you think is happier , Windows or OS X ?
Even if you 've already formed an opinion , you might still be wondering , " What kind of inane question is that ? "
After all , how could software possibly be happy ?
This is nonetheless one of the reactions I get when using products that are designed by Apple in Cupertino .
It 's not specifically that the product is making me happy as much as I have this vague feeling that the product itself is somehow happy .
The otherwise rational engineer in me knows this is silly , but it is perhaps nonetheless irrationally true .
If visual design speaks to the user 's aesthetics , and interactive design to the user 's cognition , then this seems to be something else .
Aside from the notable exception of Don Norman 's Emotional Design , this is an aspect of design that we do n't often think about : playing to the user 's awareness of emotion .
As humans we have a tendency to anthropomorphize inanimate objects , particularly ones we spend a lot of time with .
Perhaps any readers with a background in psychology can provide theories for why we exhibit this irrational behavior in the comments below .
But regardless of why , it 's something we as a species do .
We name our cars , we attribute gender to things that have none , and we think electrical outlets have faces ( they look sad [ 1 ] ) .
Even objects incredibly far from the depths of the uncanny valley can be a bit anthropomorphic — things like a file manager , or even a desk lamp .
In its very early days , Pixar put a lot of effort into trying to understand what properties made something appear alive .
They spent a considerable amount of time intently studying the way animals and humans moved , and they quickly picked up a few basic properties .
For instance , there are a lot of accelerations and decelerations in biological movement .
This is true even if we are trying as hard as we can to move only at a constant velocity ( e.g. , when performing a very serious dance commonly referred to as " doing the robot " ) .
If you take these properties of biological motion and apply them when animating a simple inanimate test object — say , a basic desk lamp — it magically becomes alive once you introduce acceleration and deceleration .
When the lamp looks up at you , it is suddenly looking at you ; the bulb is an eye , the shade a head .
If you get the lamp to jump up and down a bit , the next thing you know it 's the happiest lamp you 've ever encountered :
But it is n't just lamps .
Why throw up a boring dialog box in the center of the screen when you can get capture the user 's attention with a jumping icon ?
The icon does n't have much to say ( " replace the file on the server ? " ) and it looks like a tiny truck , but nonetheless the way it moves reminds us of the way a dog jumps up at you , drooling and completely happy .
Another aspect of biological motion is that we tend to decelerate before we collide with another object .
This of course makes sense as we can't move at a constant velocity even when we try to dance like a robot , and running into stuff at high velocities hurts , so it 's really best to slow down first .
This is one of the things that struck me about the design of the iPhone OS scrolling model .
It accelerates and decelerates , and if you pull something too far away , it is sure to slow down as much as possible before the collision .
And while the iPhone and iPad application icons do n't bounce , they do have a sort of wiggle dance when you move them around .
These are all just animation primitives and simple physics models .
When applied to software they are subtle , they do n't go nearly as far as to create a happy and curious lamp .
But they manifest in ways that make products simply easier for us as emotional irrational humans to love ( or at least makes it easier to occasionally forgive them ) .
Animation in software can serve a lot of important purposes .
Animation can draw the user 's attention , help the user build a mental model of navigation events , and indicate changes in state .
But beyond all of those very functional ways that UX designers can employ animation in their work , it can also impact users on an emotional level : it can make your product seem happy , and ever so slightly alive .

By this I mean the North American 15 A / 125 V grounded outlet looks sad .
Just one tiny change in the initial design to the grounding socket and the entire continent could have been filled with happy outlets .

San Francisco 's supervisors are calling for a sweeping boycott of Arizona in the wake of that state 's harsh new rules aimed at illegal immigrants .
A resolution that will go before the board Tuesday will call for San Francisco to end any and all contracts with Arizona - based companies and to stop doing business with the state .
" We want to send a message , " Supervisor David Campos told a rally on the steps of City Hall this morning .
" There are consequences when you target a whole people . "
Last Friday , Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law making it a crime for an immigrant to be in the state without proof of legal residency and requiring police to seek out and detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally .
The law , which will take effect this summer , is certain to face legal challenges .
President Obama has called the bill " misguided " and ordered the Justice Department to determine whether it violates civil rights .
There 's no way to tell yet how a boycott of Arizona would affect San Francisco .
" We 're trying to figure that out now , " Campos said .
" We do know that we wo n't be sending any city employees to conferences in Arizona . "
City Attorney Dennis Herrera also called for a wide - ranging boycott of Arizona and pledged to have attorneys in his office work with the city to identify contracts with Arizona companies and help break those contracts where possible .
The boycott resolution wo n't be the only immigration - based measure on the board 's agenda Tuesday .
The supervisors also are expected to pass a resolution condemning audits by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement designed to force local employers to fire undocumented workers .
The resolution calls for Congress to place a moratorium on " piecemeal " immigration enforcement efforts and encourages Congress and the president to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill " that prioritizes keeping families together , upholding civil and human rights and promoting economic justice .

A gay rights campaign featuring True Blood star Anna Paquin 's surprise declaration of bisexuality generated so much traffic that its website crashed .
The web - based Give a Damn campaign was launched on Thursday by Cyndi Lauper 's True Colors Fund , which aims for the advancement of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender equality .
The campaign 's video features Paquin , a Winnipeg - born Oscar - winning actor , declaring she 's bisexual .
" I'm Anna Paquin , " says the 27 - year - old actress , who is engaged to True Blood co-star Stephen Moyer .
" I 'm bisexual and I gave a damn because one hate crime is committed approximately every hour of every day in this country . "
The video also includes Lauper , Elton John , Sharon Osbourne , Whoopi Goldberg and comedien Wanda Sykes , who urge people to be more tolerant of others ' sexual orientation .
The crashed website left a message that read : " OK – we did n't expect THIS kind of traffic ! "
Its administrators told The Associated Press on Friday that it was " overwhelmed by the enormous traffic , " and has added additional servers .
Paquin was born in Winnipeg , and won an Academy Award at age 11 for best supporting actress for her first film role , in The Piano .
She made the Give a Damn announcement at a Jan. 30 taping session .

I 'm trying to get familiar with as many of the super - fast vocabulary learning techniques that I can find .
Beginning May , I want to learn about 1000 Japanese words per month for about 6 months .
I 'm going to experiment with various methods , and try to figure out what works best for me .
I 'd like this thread to be for vocabulary learning techniques of 20 + words per day , sustainable , and proven successful for at least one person .
No need to focus on Japanese ; techniques for all languages are welcome .
Hopefully this will become a thread with all the best methods ; your one stop vocabulary method shop : )

This is my advice , based on my current Japanese studies .
As you may guess lack of vocabulary is the main obstacle in a language so very far from my native one , thus my studies tend to be heavily vocabs oriented .
I remember starting with mnemonics too at the very beginning .
It stops working after you pass a certain line , let 's say after 1000 or so words .
Then I got into kanji and study of vocabulary became a pleasure and an easy thing as well .
Now I can memorize more than 50 words a day out of the 100 or so I jot down every day .
This is how I do .
words are not a casual line of letters .
They have an origin and a root .
Only the most basic of the vocab a foreigner learns may look completely unrelated , but you are well after those first few hundreds words you had to acquire at the beginning of your studies .
After that words build up like bricks .
Studying kanji this becomes very obvious and allows me not to think about a word in terms of a simple foreign sound anymore .
Thus if I come across let 's say the word " seish * tsu " which means " nature " as referred to human character , like in " a good - natured person " .
In that word " sei" stands for something you have from your birth , while " sh*tsu " is " quality " .
This way it becomes very easy to remember and develops a deeper understanding of the language from the inside rather than rote memorization .
Doing this word analisys word for word before trying to memorize it makes it stick it better in my experience .
For example : let 's say I 'm studying English and come across those words : approximately , streamline , globalization .
I would try to understand the words before memorizing them .
ap is sort of a prefix which conveys the idea of dragging something close - come to mind approach , apparatus , apparition , appear , append , applause , appoint , appraise , approve ... in a way related .
Just look at how many different words of almost completely different meanings start making more sense .
from the latin proximus you have proximal , proximity , proxy ... all convey a sense of vicinity .
then you do your language math , and while doing this your vocabulary will expand like the branches of a tree .
Streamline : stream plus line , with the same reasoning you end up understanding it very well and learn at least other 20 words in the process .
Same goes for glob , global , globe , and all the final - tion words to indicate certain phenomena .
You write a list of all this world both side and try to memorize them right afterwards .
much easier and effective .
After that you put everything in your Supermemo or Mnemosyne to make sure they come up all randomly for random review .
That 's the method I use .
It 's not as long as it looks .
Once you get better at your " language math " you start seeing inner meanings in every new word almost immediately to the point they stick without even making any attempt to memorize them .

To do this I have invented a more efficient way of using wordlists .
Earlier when I had to learn a list of words I did the usual mistake of looking at each word pair ( target - translation ) in isolation , repeating it in my head X times until I thought I knew it - but that 's wrong .
Now I look at 5 - 7 word pairs at a time .
I first write the target words in a column and run mentally through them to learn the translations .
Only when I 'm sure I know the translations for all the words I add a second column for the translations .
Then I study this short list until I 'm sure that I could write the original words from the translations , - and then I test this by covering the first column .
Only when I actually do remember all the original words I proceed to writing the third column with the original words once again .
With this method I can get through ( and learn ) around 100 new words in an hour .
Then a couple of days later I read ( and sometimes even write ) the list through once more to fixate the words in my long - term memory .
I spend 2 - 3 hours every day on word lists of the two kinds I have described , so I get through ( and learn ) at least 200- 300 words daily ( in 2 - 3 languages ) .
But the real number is far higher , partly because of derivations , but more importantly because of positive effect the memory training has on my intake of new words from reading and listening .
I may sound like a preacher man when speaking about word lists , but I know that I wasted years on inefficient rote learning methods earlier in my life because nobody taught me to use word lists efficiently .

This one is a whole reading system , which alows the learner to avoid studying isolated vocabulary completely .
Ardaschir wrote :
I generally try to avoid using a dictionary at all until I am quite advanced in a language .
As I 've written before , I get to that point either by transferring skills from other languages in the family , or by spending requisite years reading " readers , " bilingual texts , children 's literature , and with a translated text at hand .
One way or another , I eventually get to the point when I can understand at least 80 % of the words in a text , and I mean that literally , i.e. , if I take them out of the text , that is , out of their context , I can explain and actively use 4 out of 5 words .
The difference between 75 % and 80 % does n't sound great when you write them as percentages , but when you do it this way , you will find that 75 % means only 3 out of 4 , which is not enough , so you have to cross this barrier first .
If you know 4 words out of 5 , the meaning of the fifth word is generally provided by the context .
So , when you get to this point , the trick is to read as much as you can for a while , as swiftly as you can , tolerating the ambiguity of not understanding everything , fighting the impulse to look up every single word that you do not know .
If you just read , read , read like this for several hours a day , every day for a few weeks or months depending on the difficulty of the language , you will find that your vocabulary has snowballed and that you have learned many new words from context without ever needing to look them up .
It is only at this point in my enjoyment of a literature ( i.e. , when I probably already know something like 95 % of the words on a page ) that I allow myself to begin using a dictionary .
As a rule , I only look up two kinds of words : those that truly impede my understanding of a passage , and those that I call " known unknowns , " i.e. , words with whose form I have become familiar but whose meaning continues to elude me - I often find myself actively wondering whether they mean this , that , or the other thing , and perhaps musing on them in odd moments , as when I am in the shower , thinking " ... now just what the hell could that damn word possibly mean ?
It 's not ... maybe it's ... "
When I do finally look up such words , I only need to do so once , for I remember them forever without needing to write them down .
For the most part , though , I generally continue to absorb the meaning of words from their context .
As a general principle of learning , I think that you know and understand better by figuring things out for yourself than by having them explained to you .
I love dictionaries ( especially etymological ones ) and I even spent many years of my life compiling an extensive English - French - Spanish - German - Russian - Korean one that is now hopefully soon finally going to see publication , alas with only the first four .
However , I truly feel that a dictionary used too early is not a help to a language learner , it is a hinderance .

Souley , you yourself and others have already largely answered your second pointed question .
Yes , the main problem with using a dictionary to read is that it slows you down so much that the entire process becomes discouraging .
While electronic dictionaries may speed up the process to a certain degree when you are reading electronic texts , it still remains , and there is also the fact that most electronic dictionaries are not yet anywhere near as thorough and reliable as printed ones .
Guillaume also righly points out that it is not desirable to translate words into your native tongue , as a dictionary forces you to do .
Yet another reason that has not been mentioned is the fact that most words are polyvalent , and if you are so uncertain in a text that you need to use a dictionary to hack your way through it , you are probably not in a position to select the desired meaning from among the options .
Ardaschir wrote :
There is a time and a place for both monolingual and bilingual dictionaries .
For the kind of advanced reading of literature that we are talking about here , certainly a monolingual dictionary is preferable .
However , if you have to keep looking up chains of words in order to understand things , then there is no point in using one .
Bilingual pocket dictionaries are most useful when you first travel about in a land where a foreign language is spoken .
Larger bilingual dictionaries are always useful as office reference tools for checking the accuracy of translations and for those moments when you for some reason want to know how to say X in such and such a language .
Ardaschir wrote :
Czech , I am very sorry for the delayed response .
You can start with a paragraph , or even a sentence , at a time , and work up to a chapter and then a whole book .
As I wrote before , eventually you should read the translation and then rest for a while before reading the original to strenthen your memory .
Initially , however , you should read the translated paragaph or sentence , then immediately afterwards the original one .
You should definitely read the original aloud , and it may help to do this with the English as well .
Likewise , it may very likely be helpful to read with your hands as well as your voice , i.e. , by following the lines with your fingers .
I am not sure what you mean by not having any luck remembering the meaning of the words , but I do n't think you should be making any conscious effort to do this at this point .

Since you find this helpful , I will give some more details of the way that I have gone about learning to read literature in Russian and other foreign languages .
The first step is to use actual bilingual texts , with the target language on one page and a translation on the facing page .
I keep one index finger under one sentence , the other under its counterpart , and I slowly and carefully compare everything .
I am not really " reading " at this point , but rather analyzing the language using interesting reading matter .
The second step is to use " readers , " i.e. , books that contain annotated excerpts of literature with explanatory notes and , most importantly , vocabulary and an index that is specially keyed to these texts so that finding the meaning of unknown words is much easier than it is by using a regular dictionary .
I usually make enlarged photocopies of the text first and then write the meaning of all new words directly in the space underneath them .
I then read and reread these texts many times .
The third step is begin reading " easy " literature unaided , i.e. , material for native children or adolescents .
The fourth step is what I described in an earlier post , namely using not bilingual texts but an original text and a translation in tandem , reading first a portion of the translation , then the original itself .
What portion ?
If all I can handle is a paragraph or a page at a time , then it is better to keep working with actual bilingual texts .
At this stage , as I wrote before , it is initially best to read a full chapter at a time .
At first I may have to read them back to back , but I find that it is better not to do so , but rather to read the original later in the day .
Eventually , I read the entire translated work first , then the original .
I never use a dictionary at this stage , but just keep on reading .
With Russian , I went through most of Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Turgenev , and Checkov this way , as well as some Oblomov and Gogol .
I then passed the " airplane test , " as I call it , taking a novel that I had not read in translation before with me as my sole companion on an intercontinental flight , and reading it with interest , enjoyment , and understanding the whole time .
I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is to avoid using a dictionary until you have gotten past these stages .
Doing so harms you more than it helps you , for it slows you down too much and breaks your concentration .
I have always found that using a dictionary is only profitable after I have gotten past this fourth step .
Again , I generally try to look up only " known unknowns , " i.e. , words that I have seen often enough to recognize them ( " there 's that damn word again -- what the hell does it mean ? " ) or even better actually remember them and say to myself , not necessarily while reading , but simply while ruminating , " I know that I do n't know what X means -- it seems like it means such and such , but I wonder ... "
When I finally look it up , I never forget it , whereas if I use a dictionary too early , I find myself looking up the same word repeatedly .

You 're welcome , both of you .
Heartburn , your question is not at all off the mark .
Indeed , using unabridged audiobooks is an important component in this whole process -- so important that I cannot believe I have forgotten it until now .
When I have been able to obtain tapes to an accompanying text , I shadow them in exactly the same fashion that I shadow to begin learning a language ( i.e. , listen through earphones , echoing aloud the second I hear any sound , and reading the text with my eyes at the same time , all the while preferably while walking rather than while sitting down ) .
With Spanish , you should have an extremely wide range of choices .
With Russian , there are fewer , or at least there where when I was there five or six years ago .
The situation may have changed , but there were no commercially available audiobooks in the shops there and no one had heard of such a thing , so I almost left without acquiring any .
Thankfully , it dawned on me that such audiobooks were originally produced for the blind before they were put on the general market , so I found an association for the blind , and indeed was able to get a good selection -- tales of Belkin by Pushkin and the novella Kazaki by Tolstoy among others .
I am in my office right now looking at these as I write , but unfortunately they do not have any identifying address that I can pass along .

A dictionary is not a learner 's tool ; a dictionary is a means for clarity and advancement for those who already know a language .

Hm .
If you do n't mind me doing so , I 'm going to try to rewrite Iversen 's method in a bulleted list :
1. Write a short list of 5 - 7 words in your target language .
2. Read through them until you are confident you know the translation .
3 . Write a second list consisting of the translation for these words .
4. Read through it till you 're confident that you know the original words .
5. Reread the original words .
6 . To solidify the knowledge , rewrite the original words in a third column .
After this , you pick a new 5 - 7 words , I 'm guessing ?

[ digg - reddit - me ] I met 2 members of that vibrant cultural movement pretending to be a political one , the Tea Party , last night .
When I say they were members of the Tea Party , I do n’t mean one of those independents discouraged by Obama that Republican operatives always claim is the typical Tea Partier .
I do n’t mean a Republican partisan who thinks this is just a good re-branding .
I do n’t mean Greg O’Neil .
I mean 2 actual Tea Party wingnuts .
It is rare to see them outside of their home environment ( rallies involving racial epithets and mocking those damned people with Parkinson ’s disease looking to be coddled ) with their identifying characteristics full on display .
However , I was able to positively identify them by cataloguing the following characteristics which can serve as the start of a general checklist of how to identify Tea Party folk ( with prominent characteristics in bold ) :
White .
Wealthy .
Middle - aged to elderly .
Generally conspiratorial , wide - eyed , and a bit paranoid .
Claimed that Obama , Clinton , and the Democrats were “ socialists ” / ” communists ” / ” Europeans ” / ” elitists ” / ” Nazis ” with all terms used interchangeably .
“ Muslim ” or “ terrorist ” can also be added to this list .
“ Muslim ” or “ terrorist ” can also be added to this list .
Explained in meticulous detail the nefarious ( and “ anti-American ” ) views that “ liberals ” / ” socialists ” / etc have .
Were evasive when confronted with the fact that the unprecedented tax increases sought by Obama would leave the marginal tax rate historically low * and only approximately 5 % points higher than under Bush .
Had a messianic certainty about their views .
Attributed this same messianic certainty to anyone who uttered a word in support of President Obama .
Unable to understand how anyone at all could defend “ that man [ Obama ] who is destroying everything great about America . ”
When confronted with a defense of his record , replied with , “ Oooooh : we ’ll see in 5 years ! ”
Admiration for that greatest of presidents , George W. Bush .
Blamed Democrats for the fiscal crisis / recession and government in general .
Full of the inchoate of the populist right that arose after the election of every young liberal ( 1960 , 1992 , and 2008 specifically . )
Believed their views were n’t just right but obvious and that all “ real Americans ” agreed with them .
and that all “ real Americans ” agreed with them .
A sense that the “ real Americans ” needed to take their country back before it was too late .
Were unaware of any information from outside the right wing cocoon and denied its validity when presented with it .
( The much talked about epistemic closure . )
and denied its validity when presented with it .
( The much talked about epistemic closure . )
Unable to fathom how someone could read the National Review and not agree with the opinions expressed there ( except to say , “ Well , obviously you did n’t understand … ” )
Under the assumption that everyone else was brainwashed or otherwise evil “ socialists ” / ” anti- Americans ” / etc .
Explicitly compared Obama to Hitler .
Made a vague but somewhat hysterical statement that could be taken as a threat to the President .
[ “ That man can not be allowed to stay in office . ” ]
Focused on and outraged over America ’s fiscal situation .
Knew nothing about America ’s fiscal situation .
Or worse actually , knew false things .
( For example , claimed that agricultural subsidies are $ 400 billion a year .
Also , spouted various platitudes about waste that are too vague to debunk but are certainly misleading such as the idea that most government spending is deliberate waste and that we can leave the popular Social Security , Medicare , and military budgets in place while balancing the budget .
Yet in 2009 for example , if you slashed all government spending except these things , we would still have a deficit — see income of $ 2.105 trillion minus expenses for Social Security — $ 678 billion — Medicare and Medicaid — $ 676 billion — and the Department of Defense — $ 782 billion — for a total of $ 2.136 trillion . )

Told me I was n’t a “ real American . ”
Nor were North Easterners .
Nor was anyone who went to an Ivy League school .
I have a feeling I know what it ’s like to talk to Sarah Palin ( but with a Dutch accent — as these people were a rarer breed of Tea Partiers , naturalized citizens from Europe ) .
Some characteristics
I understand to be part of the Tea Party movement that these individuals did not display ( perhaps because they were n’t given the chance — I walked away when I was told I was n’t really American ) :
A feeling of reverence for Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin .
Outrage over “ Barack Obama ’s bailout ” of Wall Street in the fall of 2008 .
Allegations that Barack Obama was born in Kenya .
Hysteria over Barack Obama ’s projections of weakness abroad and sympathy for terrorists and our enemies .
So , take this checklist out into the wilds and perhaps you too can positively identify a Tea Partier !
And feel free to add more characteristics in the comments .
* This is a cartoon rather than a graph , so it should be noted it is n’t perfectly accurate — but it visually conveys the point solidly .
Reagan , for example , only had 28 % tax rate for the final year of his presidency .
The average top marginal tax rate under Reagan was 48 % .

Joanna Newsom becomes less of an enigma with each interview .
The polarizing songwriter is Under The Radar ’s spring cover girl and between the pages is an enlightening ten page spread : a far - reaching interview conducted at the Bowery Hotel in February by Chris Tinkham accompanied by photos from Crackerfarm ( example above ) .
Stereogum has covered Joanna ’s professional career with much scrutiny over the past six years .
We have been fair ( and perhaps sometimes too fawning ) .
I ’ve never met Joanna Newsom , but I admit I ’m amused when our commenters get her attention .
UTR ’s piece is not online , so I have transcribed only the most relevant excerpt .
I hope the mag understands , and that you are compelled to purchase it after reading this …
Via Under The Radar :
Ever since the release of The Milk - Eyed Mender , Newsom has been aware of how she and her work are scrutinized .
The heaps of critical praise that her debut received coincided with the mounting influence of music blogs , and while much of the attention on Newsom was incited by genuine admiration , discussion about her singing and look often overshadowed appreciation for her musicianship .
Because of her distinctive voice , her fondness for vintage dresses , and the fanciful imagery of songs with titles such as “ Bridges And Balloons ” and “ Peach , Plum , Pear , ” she was tagged with terms like “ elfin princess ” and “ wood nymph . ”
However , Newsom was more concerned about how her music was being perceived .
…
Newsom admits to being “ vulnerable to the call of the Internet ” and knew that fans were ascribing titles to the unrecorded songs that would appear on Have One On Me .
“ When I was playing new songs , people would refer to then by these titles that I had n’t referred to them by , and they would do it real authoritatively , like super know - it - all , ” she says .
“ It really annoyed me . ”
But in September 2009 , Newsom called it quits and stopped reading about herself , recognizing it as destructive and dangerous .
“ I ’m a girl , and I ’m human , and so probably the things that get to me the most are just when someone ’s like , ‘ that girl ’s ugly , ’ or ‘ stupid , ’ or really playground shit , ” she confesses .
“ Everything kind of affects me somehow if I read it , but that ’s the stuff that drains your energy the most .
Anything that engages the work is something that you somehow can step away from .
I ’ve read horrible , scathing reviews , and some of them are kind of good , kind of well - written , and occasionally they ’re even funny .
I remember with Ys , there were a few things that I read that made me laugh a lot , that were tearing it apart but making really good points .
And somehow that does n’t hurt my feelings as much .
But there ’s a class of insult that you ca n’t engage with at all , and you ca n’t defend yourself against in any way , and it just resonates with a very primal part of you .
No one wants anyone to think they ’re ugly and stupid , so somehow that ’s the stuff that gets me . ”
…
“ I might just be talking about it and someone would point out , ‘ What the hell are you doing spending one second of your time caring about what some dumbo in some far - off state has to anonymously say about you on a blog that five people read ?
It ’s just a waste of energy .
Regardless of what it was that made me realize once and for all that I needed to not read that stuff , it was one little episode that was representative of a whole larger truth , which is that no matter what I read on the Internet , whether it ’s ‘ good ’ or ‘ bad , ’ it still makes me feel weird .
It ’s counterproductive .
Even something that is a glowing review still leaves a weird taste in my mouth . ”
The piece also describes Joanna ’s formative years as a 5 - year - old (! ) songwriter in Grass Valley and later as a NoCal sk8r girl during junior high .
And , of course , the time her roommate , Golden Shoulders ’ Adam Kline , gave Joanna ’s “ demo ” to Will Oldham .
You know the rest …
Under The Radar # 31 is available for purchase right here .
One final bit of irony I have to share : in explaining her motivation to accept Ray Tintori ’s invitation to star in MGMT ’s controversial “ Kids ” video , Joanna says , “ My New Year ’s resolution [ for 2009 ] was to start being less of a hater . ”

UNITED STATES : School CP
Many people , even within the USA , think corporal punishment ( " CP " ) has long disappeared from all American public schools .
This is not so .
The US Supreme Court ruled in 1977 that the spanking or paddling of students by school officials or teachers is lawful , where it has not been explicitly outlawed by local authorities .
That decision still stands .
The incidence of CP has declined sharply in recent years , but only 31 states ( plus D.C. and Puerto Rico ) have abolished it in public schools , either de facto or de jure .
CP is still permitted in the other 19 states , and it remains a fairly widespread practice in three of them , all in the South : Alabama , Arkansas and Mississippi .
It is also routine , but only in certain ( mostly rural or small - town ) districts , in six more states : Georgia , Louisiana , Missouri , Oklahoma , Tennessee and Texas .
In the other ten paddling states , the incidence of CP is nowadays close to negligible , as a proportion of school enrollment : Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Wyoming .
The latest states to abolish were Delaware , in 2003 , after an eight - year gap in which no abolitions took place at state level ; Pennsylvania , in 2005 ; Ohio , in 2009 ; and New Mexico , in 2011 .
The number of paddlings had already fallen to a low level in these states .
On the other hand , efforts to ban school CP by legislation have failed in 2003 in Wyoming and repeatedly in Missouri , and also in North Carolina in 2007 , Louisiana in 2009 and again in 2017 , Texas in 2011 , Colorado in 2017 , and Kentucky in 2017 and again in 2018 .
Legislative attempts to reintroduce CP in California ( 1996 ) , Montana ( 1997 ) , Iowa ( 1998 ) , Oregon ( 1999 ) and Delaware ( 2006 ) were defeated .
Also rejected were a 2007 bill to make it easier to spank students in Kansas and a 2013 bill in Oklahoma to restore CP rights to individual class teachers ( as opposed to school principals or administrators , for whom it remains lawful ) .
A US Supreme Court ruling in 1975 ( Baker vs Owen ) held that schools could spank students against the wishes of their parents , subject to various conditions being met .
But in 2011 , laws were introduced in both Texas and North Carolina giving parents the right to exempt their sons or daughters from any CP provisions , typically by filling out a form provided .
It is not clear what effect , if any , these new laws have had on the incidence of paddling in Texas : many school districts had already adopted that policy anyway .
In North Carolina the number of districts retaining CP was already very small , according to this July 2011 news report .
Since then , the last district in NC still permitting CP has abolished it , amounting to de facto abolition in that state : see this Oct 2018 news item .
The above map appeared in the Chattanooga Times Free Press in October 2013 ( read the whole article here ) .
The above map of the southern States shows paddling " hotspots " by county .
( NPR Stateimpact )
In November 2016 the outgoing US Secretary of Education , John King Jr. , called upon schools across the nation to abolish CP .
It is not obvious why he waited to say this until only a couple of months before the inauguration of a new President , and sure enough King was replaced shortly afterwards ( by Betsy DeVos , a conservative who strongly believes in leaving this sort of thing to the individual States ) .
King 's remarks were not well received in Texas , where one district superintendent noted that decisions in this matter are taken based on local beliefs : " Rarely does Keene ISD take the advice of Washington politicians when deciding what 's best for our kids " .
Note that all the above refers only to public schools .
Paddling in private schools is lawful in all but two states ( Iowa and New Jersey ) , and quite prevalent in some southern schools .
The use of CP in private schools is not reported in any public statistics .
Statistics .
According to estimates from the federal Department of Education ( Office of Civil Rights ) , about 92,000 students were paddled in public schools in the 2015 / 16 school year .
This was about 13 % down from 106,000 two years previously , continuing a decades - long decline .
The following table gives estimates by state for 2015 / 16 :
State Number of students receiving CP Percentage of total students Alabama 15,804 2.1 % Arkansas 11,175 2.3 % Florida 1,597 0.1 % Georgia 5,888 0.3 % Louisiana 2,650 0.4 % Mississippi 23,690 4.8 % Missouri 3,345 0.4 % Oklahoma 5,655 0.8 % Tennessee 5,393 0.5 % Texas 16,649 0.3 %

The figures for Arizona , North and South Carolina , Colorado , Kansas , Kentucky , Idaho , Indiana and Wyoming were too small to measure in percentage terms .
Note that these are numbers of students paddled , not numbers of paddling events .
The total number of paddlings will have been higher , since some students get spanked on more than one occasion in a school year .
In percentage terms the heaviest - paddling states in 2015 / 16 were still Mississippi ( 4.8 per cent of students paddled during the year ) followed by Arkansas ( 2.3 % ) .
Alabama comes third with 2.1 % .
In all other states , the percentage was under 1 % .

Mississippi is the " world capital of paddling " in both percentage and absolute terms , having pulled ahead of Texas , which not long ago had the largest number of students spanked -- though not such a high percentage figure ; this is simply because Texas , with some 5 million school students , is so big .
The figures for Texas mask sharp differences between different areas .
The state has over 1,000 public school districts .
Many of these are very small by the standards of the rest of the world , often consisting of just one high school , one middle school and one or two elementary schools .
These are generally found in rural or small - town settlements ( of which Texas has a vast number ) , where strong community and parental support for spanking still tends to be part of the local culture .
At the other end of the scale , most major urban areas in Texas have abolished CP , including all the big cities , such as Fort Worth ( in 1999 ) , Houston ( 2001 ) , and Dallas ( 2005 ) , as well as Austin , El Paso , and San Antonio .
As a result , although over 80 % of districts use the paddle , these account for only 40 % of the students .
To put it another way , some 60 % of Texas students attend schools in the 20 % of districts where it is banned .

New !
According to one report , paddlings in Mississippi actually increased between 2006/07 and 2008/09 , from 47,727 to 57,953 , a very remarkable bucking of the trend if it is true .
These statistics come from the state 's own Department of Education and relate to the number of corporal punishment incidents , so they do not tally with those collected by the federal authorities , which count number of students paddled .
Anyway , an April 2013 news report claims that this figure declined in 2011 / 12 to 39,000 .
Such wild variations seem unlikely , and one should probably regard all these statistics with some suspicion .
Mississippi has 151 school districts , 99 of which use CP , according to the same news item .
This long Nov 2015 illustrated article gives an impressionistic overview of the current general approach to school discipline in Mississippi , and suggests that paddling might have been once again on the increase there as a result of recent ( 2014 ) federal guidelines under which schools are enjoined to reduce their reliance on suspension and expulsion .

It is made of ash wood and is 16 inches long .
( stateimpact.npr.org )
All the federal Department of Education figures , too , should be treated as estimates at best ; formerly they were extrapolated from only a proportion of districts .
But they should have become more accurate over time , as the DOE from 2011 / 12 allegedly began surveying all schools , rather than just a sample .
Note also that some observers suspect that all such data understate the real incidence of CP , citing anecdotal evidence that some , maybe many , punishments go unrecorded , though this may be less true than it once was .
There is a steady stream of news items about individual school districts within paddling states deciding to abandon CP .
Against the overall declining trend , though , there are some reports of districts which had abandoned the paddle deciding to bring it back .
Both phenomena can be seen in these examples from July 2013 .
An interesting case is Mathis school district in Texas , one of several in that state to have brought back the paddle or increased its use in the past few years .
According to this Nov 2015 news report , a particular reason in the Mathis case was that high - school students were transferring to neighboring school districts that had not abandoned CP , because behavior was better there .
This Aug 2017 news article about high - school football in Texas quotes a coach as saying that " the pendulum is swinging back toward corporal punishment " Likewise , this Feb 2019 item in a Texas local newspaper says " CP is making a comeback " , though it cites no hard evidence for this claim .
Modus operandi .
Corporal punishment in US schools is almost invariably applied with a wooden paddle across the student 's clothed posterior , after removing anything found in the back pockets .
Paddles come in many shapes and sizes -- see these pictures .
Very occasionally nowadays the implement may be of a composite plastic material , such as perspex ( Plexiglass ) or polycarbonate ( Lexan ) , sometimes wrongly described as " fiberglass " .
For an early instance of this , see this Dec 1987 news item about a Texas school district adopting Plexiglass paddles for its elementary schools but wooden ones ( maple ) at secondary level .
Oak and ash also seem to be popular woods for paddles , which are often made in a school 's own shop class .
A typical punishment nowadays consists of two or three strokes , usually referred to as " swats " or " licks " or occasionally " pops " or " cracks " .
In American English the procedure is often described as " spanking " , even though an implement is nearly always used .
( In this article , the terms " paddling " and " spanking " are used interchangeably . )
In the past it was the norm in some schools to require the culprit to present his bottom for discipline by standing clear of any furniture and bending down as low as possible , often with feet placed well apart for stability : " Grab your ankles " was a familiar command ( pictured left ) .
By all accounts , this stance has gone out of fashion .
Even the " hands on knees " position ( pictured right ) , rather less undignified , is perhaps less favored than it once was .
A slightly different version of this is shown in the posed picture at the top of this page .
Nowadays , according to informed sources , it is more usual for the offender to be asked to bend over a chair or bench ( pictured left ) .
Probably more often still , he may be required merely to put his hands on the desk , leaning forward only a few degrees from the vertical ( pictured right ) even though , and particularly with today 's fashion for loose clothing , this is clearly less effective in terms of pulling the fabric taut across the student 's seat .
This is not a particularly recent trend -- the command " Put your hands on the desk " is heard in the Butler , PA documentary from 1978 .
" Hands on the wall " is another possible method , as illustrated at left , another variant of which is seen in real life in this 1970s photograph from Texas , and this 2014 video clip from Louisiana .
Having the student bend over the BACK of a chair , with feet apart and holding on to its front for stability , is a different and more formal technique , mentioned by the principal of Booneville H.S. in Arkansas .
It is perhaps especially suitable for taller and more senior students : the following artist 's impressions show from three different angles a twelfth - grader being disciplined in the principal 's office :
Where and by whom .
Until recent years , CP was often administered in the classroom , or in the hallway outside it .
It was also an American tradition for sports coaches to do a lot of on - the - spot paddling , typically in the locker - room or even out on the field .
While all those things still happen in a few places -- see this 2013 video clip from Louisiana -- it is much more common now for the punishment to be delivered privately in an office , often by the principal or assistant principal or at least in his or her presence .
It is less likely nowadays to be done on the spur of the moment , and more likely to require formal bureaucratic procedures and specific documentation .
This affords greater legal certainty , and guards against the danger of angry teachers resorting to random violence .
The question whether ordinary classroom teachers should have the right to paddle , or only administrators , may be partly related to another issue : is CP a suitable response to low - level classroom disruption , or should it be reserved for more specific violations that may have nothing to do with classroom management , like smoking and truancy ?
In Dec 1976 it was reported that a local teachers ' union in Florida believed that " the paddle more properly belongs in the hands of classroom teachers " because it was they who , at that time in that place , were said to be directly responsible for maintaining order .
There may still be some school districts where that line is taken , but it is probably now a minority view .
It certainly is in Texas and Oklahoma , where many school districts spell out that administering the paddle is a task reserved for the administration -- typically the Principal or Vice - Principal .

Who gets paddled .
In some areas in the past , it was made explicit that only boys could be chastised , as in Cincinnati ( Ohio ) in 1898 .
Nowadays , in most places , female as well as male students may receive CP , or , at least , modern American notions about sexual equality require that they be given the opportunity to receive it wherever boys may do so .
For a relatively early mention see this Oct 1952 news item about four teenage girls paddled in Pennsylvania .
An example of the trend gathering steam can be found in this 1988 news item from Ohio about high - school girls demanding the right to be paddled .
They thought it unfair that boys were offered a choice between a spanking and detention , while girls had no option but to serve the detention .
Since then , this kind of explicit sex - discrimination has largely disappeared , in public schools at least ( some private schools do still make a distinction between the sexes in this matter ) .
A late convert to the cause of sexual equality was Sulphur Springs High School in Texas , where it was not until 2013 that a student survey asked , " Should girls be allowed to get swats ? "
The replies were positive , and female students began choosing to receive corporal discipline at the start of 2014 , according to informed sources .
In practice , though , statistics consistently show that around 75 % to 85 % of paddlings are still of male students .
That is , roughly three boys are spanked for every girl .
This might be , in part , because boys ( and their parents ) are more likely than girls to opt for CP , if given the choice .
But we should bear in mind that , according to official figures , boys much more often receive any kind of punishment than girls .
Males and females are different : over 90 % of the prison population is male .
Boys just are on average worse - behaved than girls , though this does appear to be a little less true that it once was .
Age restrictions .
In general , statistics show that the most typical recipients of corporal punishment in the USA are boys aged 13 through 17 -- much as in pretty well all other cultures since the dawn of time .
But in the majority of American school districts , there are no explicit age limits : the recipient may be any age from 4 through 19 .
Twelfth - graders , who might have been driving an automobile for three or four years , or having legal sex for two years , can be and are spanked in some high schools .
In certain places , such as Alvarado ISD in Texas ( which does not use CP at the elementary level at all ) , it has been reported that most of the district 's frequent paddlings take place in grades 9 through 12 .
Some anecdotal accounts suggest that these students , especially if male , can expect to be paddled a lot harder , stroke for stroke , than younger recipients : " It does hurt pretty bad , " says an Alvarado twelfth - grader in this video clip about visiting the office to bend over the chair for three " pops " in lieu of suspension .
Other Texas school districts which make clear that CP is used only at the secondary level include Bandera ISD , Denver City ISD , Dodd City ISD , Joaquin ISD , Lazbuddie ISD , Salado ISD and Springtown ISD .
There are several others which do not say so but for which it can be inferred from the official statistics that the same policy applies .
We do n't usually have statistics broken down by age or grade within a particular school , but we do for school year 2013 / 14 in the case of Reagan County High School in Texas :
9th grade ( age c.15 ) -- 26 students received 37 paddlings
10th grade ( age c.16 ) -- 34 students received 50 paddlings
11th grade ( age c.17 ) -- 24 students received 40 paddlings
12th grade ( age c.18 ) -- 30 students received 40 paddlings .
We might note in passing that the minimum school leaving age in Texas was increased to 18 in 1997 .
Remarkably , with effect from 2015 it has been further increased to 19 .
In most of the other paddling states , it is still 16 or 17 .

( Beaumont Enterprise )
Corporal discipline seems to be particularly prevalent in the case of 16- , 17 - and 18 - year - old high - school " athletes " ( members of sports teams ) in small - town Texas , where there is a tradition of sports coaches wielding the paddle on behalf of the school , even when the offense is not sports - related ( such as for failing grades ) , as reported in this May 2012 illustrated news item about a 17 - year - old footballer paddled at Ozen High School in Beaumont ISD .
Indeed , some school districts in Texas -- where high - school sports are a really big deal , often dominating the headlines of local newspapers -- produce an " Athletic handbook " , separate from the main student handbook .
This often states not only that sports coaches may administer CP to team members , but also that " athletes " are held to a stricter standard of behavior than other students .
They are thus more likely to be spanked than their non-athlete peers if they break the general school rules , let alone the extra rules especially laid down for their team .
The legal position relating to students who have reached the age of majority ( 18 in most states , though it is 21 in Mississippi ) seems to be a bit of a gray area .
Does the school cease at that point to be in loco parentis ?
Common sense would suggest that it should then be for the student him - or herself to accept or refuse a paddling , without reference to the parents .
( 2 )
(2) Cordell High School , Oklahoma , is one of very few schools whose handbook explicitly covers this point : " Corporal punishment may only be given when authorized by the student 's parent / guardian or authorized by a student that is 18 years or older " .
But that is not how the judges saw it in this 2005 Texas case .
Jessica Serafin was 18 years old when she was paddled for a summer school rule violation at the School of Excellence in Education , a public charter school in San Antonio .
Her hand " suffered minor , temporary injuries " when she improperly failed to keep her hands away from her bottom while being disciplined .
Ms. Serafin sued .
The three federal judges ruled unanimously in October 2007 that " having voluntarily chosen to attend classes after her eighteenth birthday and remain enrolled , she was not free to disregard school rules " .
They added that " the Texas statute governing the use of corporal punishment in schools makes no differentiation between adults and minors , stating that all students are eligible to receive corporal punishment " .
In 2008 the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal against this decision .
Accordingly , at least in Texas , by continuing in school after becoming legal adults , 18 - year - olds make themselves " eligible " to be spanked , even if they would prefer ISS or another form of discipline .
Once he or she turns 18 , can the student sign a form opting him - or herself out of paddling ?
Texas law says " parents " can sign the opt - out , so the answer is probably not .
Conversely , what if a parent of a high - school student signs a form exempting the student from paddling but then the student turns 18 and would prefer swats to ISS ; do the young adult 's wishes override those of his or her parents ?
They surely ought to do in logic , but it is unclear .
But such questions arise only very rarely , if ever .
Informed sources report that the age of majority makes no difference in practice : 18 - year - old students in Texas , legally adult , are just as likely as 16 - or 17 - year - olds to opt for a spanking in preference to some other penalty ; it happens quite frequently at some senior Texas high schools and is clearly accepted as normal by the students concerned as well as by the local community .
And in such a case their parents , if they get involved at all , hardly seem likely to protest .
It is not clear to what extent this applies in other , less well documented paddling states .
It may do in Mississippi , where in any case the age of majority is 21 .
In Louisiana and Tennessee one gets the subjective impression that school CP is more often thought of as appropriate mainly for younger students , but further research is needed into this topic .
Racial disparities .
Opponents often claim that corporal punishment is racially discriminatory because statistics show that black students are more likely to be spanked than white ones , pro rata to the population as a whole .
In fact , though , the same applies to suspensions and other kinds of punishment , so while there may be a " racial problem " in school discipline overall , it is not specifically a " corporal punishment problem " .
A long Apr 2014 article in The Nation discusses this point , with particular reference to Mississippi , where about 50 % of all public school students are black , but black students account for 64 % of those paddled .
The article notes that many black people strongly support CP , and some view it as a valued part of their cultural heritage .
But on closer inspection it turns out that Mississippi is the only really dramatic example of this phenomenon .
In some other states , notably Texas and Alabama and Tennessee , the official statistics show that black students are slightly less likely than white ones to get a paddling .
(3) So anti-CP campaigners have been dishonestly manipulating the figures on this issue , and should not keep repeating the mantra that school spanking is intrinsically racially discriminatory , unless they make clear that they are talking almost entirely about Mississippi specifically ( and to a very much smaller extent , Arkansas , Georgia and Louisiana ) .
Rules and regulations .
Many US school districts ( as well as some private schools ) nowadays lay down more or less detailed rules for the administration of CP and publish them in their school handbooks or , in some cases , in a separate " Code of conduct " .
( For a very early example , see this May 1950 news item . )
These often specify such things as the offenses for which a paddling may be meted out , the permissible dimensions of the paddle , the part of the body to be targeted ( usually " the buttocks " but sometimes " the buttocks area " , " the lower posterior " or " the seat of the pants " ) , who can administer it and where and in whose presence , what " due process " is required ( e.g. formally stating in the presence of the witness what the student is being disciplined for , and inviting the student to state his or her case ) , whether prior parental consent is necessary , and what happens if the student refuses to submit to the punishment .
Handbooks in some school districts also stipulate the maximum number of swats / licks that may be delivered .
Nowadays it is most often three , sometimes only two , occasionally four ( but five or six in some Louisiana and Mississippi districts ) .
This is normally taken to mean " swats per paddling incident " , but a few school districts lay down a separate maximum per student per day .
An occasional variation on this is to prescribe a larger number of swats divided into multiple spanking sessions spread over consecutive days , such as at Jim Ned High School in Tuscola , Texas , whereby students who reach step 5 of the " discipline ladder " receive no fewer than " 9 swats ( 3 per day for 3 days ) or 3 days of ISS " .
Similarly , in 2014 Eldorado High School in Schleicher County , Texas , increased its penalty for a sixth tardy per semester from six to no less than 10 swats , to be delivered at the rate of two swats per day for 5 days .
Getting paddled every day for five consecutive days can hardly fail to provide the student with a bright red and very sore posterior , but then it is the student who chooses that option instead of five days in ISS .
Flippin High School in Arkansas offers students incurring a third office referral the choice of 100 minutes ' detention or " ten swats with a paddle " , with the proviso that " Any total of more than five swats will be spread over two days " .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are at least a few other high schools that operate such a policy without saying so in the handbook .
Many school handbooks also lay down specific penalties for particular offenses , with different numbers of swats applicable according to how seriously each offense is regarded .
The gender issue .
It has become quite common , though it is still not universal , for the rules to stipulate that the paddling must be delivered -- or , failing that , witnessed -- by a staff member of the same sex as the student , especially at high - school level .
This probably reflects unease in some quarters about the idea of men spanking teenage girls .
For example , in 2011 the Texas Association of School Boards ( TASB ) inserted a new provision in its model school policy : " Corporal punishment shall be administered only by an employee who is the same sex as the student " .
Many school districts adopted the revised policy without paying any attention to the new provision .
This ended up embarrassing Springtown ISD when a male administrator at Springtown High School , following time - honored practice and unaware that the rules had changed , spanked two girls in September 2012 : see these illustrated news reports ( with video clips ) .
The girls ' mothers complained , and a widely publicized brouhaha ensued .
This included a lively public meeting of the school board at which other young ladies who had been disciplined at the high school with the male vice - principal 's paddle stood up and defended the practice : " I 've had swats from him before , and they hurt , but that 's why we have parental consent " , declared Ms Bartee .
Springfield ISD then rescinded the policy change so that a male administrator could again paddle a female student , provided a female staff member was present as a witness .
When it became clear that the new TASB model text was merely a suggestion and not a legal requirement , quite a few other school districts followed suit , perhaps because in a small district there might not be enough administrators of both sexes to make a same - sex requirement practical .
Thus , the Hemphill , Mineola and O'Donnell ISDs adopted the " same sex " language in 2011 but O'Donnell ISD removed it in January 2014 , Mineola ISD in March 2014 and Hemphill ISD in August 2014 .
Other districts have since done the same , including Big Spring ISD in Oct 2016 .
We are unaware of any Texas ISD that since 2014 has imposed a " same sex " restriction if it was not already included in the local policy .
By contrast , many ISDs have removed such restrictions that prior boards had adopted .
To this extent , there has been a reversal in Texas of the general national trend towards having a same - sex requirement for paddling .
In the " tardy room " at Waxahachie High School in Texas , the table is strewn with tardy slips -- and a paddle ( March 2013 ) .
Repeatedly arriving late for school or for class is a spanking offense in many districts .
Offenses .
The range of offenses that can be punished with a paddling varies very widely from one place to another .
Some handbooks spell them out in great detail , while others leave the matter vague .
It can be difficult to see why certain violations merit a spanking and others do not , especially when different school districts sometimes adopt almost diametrically opposite policies .
Often , CP is deemed appropriate for intermediate " crimes " , those that are neither very trivial nor very serious ; but some schools say it is appropriate only for relatively minor lapses , while a few make clear that , to the contrary , it is regarded as a severe punishment for serious offenses only .
Either way , it is almost never " a last resort " , despite that tired phrase still being trotted out here and there .
In general , though , it is common to find CP specified for fighting , tardiness , dress code and grooming ( 4 ) violations , misbehavior on the school bus , defiance , smoking , public display of affection , parking / driving offenses , profanity , and bullying , among many others .
A few schools operate a system whereby specific offenses attract a stated number of demerits , and a paddling is automatic upon accumulating a certain quota of demerits in a semester .
(4) " Grooming " usually refers to things like hair length and style , and forbidden piercing or jewelry .
In the case of boys , it can also include the offense of coming to school unshaven , a paddling matter in some high schools .
See also this Aug 2005 news item about 28 male students paddled at an Alabama high school for failing to get a haircut when so instructed .
In addition , CP is used by many schools to enforce student compliance with other forms of discipline .
Examples include paddling for missing detention , skipping Saturday school , or violating the detention or in - school suspension rules .
Again , see the school handbooks pages for details in various different districts .
In the modern era , in public schools at any rate , corporal punishment is usually regarded as inappropriate for poor work or academic inadequacy as opposed to behavioral or " moral " lapses .
A significant exception to this , particularly in Texas , is where sports coaches are empowered to spank athletes for failing grades , when lack of effort at school work can mean losing their hard - won place on the team .
Paddling time -- for some
Time of day .
There appears to be a growing tendency for high schools to carry out all paddlings at the start of the first school day following the offense .
For example , Alabama 's Sylacauga High School reintroduced paddling a few years ago , and its handbook now provides : " Corporal punishment will be administered at a pre-determined time and location before each school day " .
At Mildred High and Junior High School in Texas , the form sent to parents reads , " Your child has chosen to break the student code of conduct [...]
Your child has asked to receive Corporal Punishment ( swats ) in lieu of ISS ( In school Suspension ) .
With your permission I will administer corporal punishment in the morning at 8:00 a.m. " .
In school systems ( probably a minority ) like Mildred ISD that require parents to approve each CP instance individually in advance , this entails the student taking the discipline slip home at night for parental signature .
The student presents the signed slip on arrival at school the following morning and then receives his or her swats .
Whether parental approval is required separately for each punishment or not , delaying the paddling overnight in this manner might be thought to give the student time to think about what is coming and resolve to change his or her behavior .
It may also have the advantage of ensuring that all CP is given in a detached and calm manner , and doing it before lessons begin means that the student wastes no further time in the office when he or she should be in class .
A matter of choice .
To a much greater extent than in the past , paddling has become in many schools an option for either the student or the parent , or both .
Very likely , CP would not survive in as many places as it does , were this not so .
Older teens , especially , may be offered a choice between a spanking and , say , detention or ISS .
Some school handbooks , particularly at high - school level , lay down precise equivalences ( either in general or for specific offenses ) , such as " three paddle swats or four days ' after - school detention " .
After being repeatedly tardy to class , " Shorty " opted to bend over the chair in the principal 's office for a paddling at Booneville H.S. because he needed to keep his Saturday free .
Much anecdotal evidence suggests that , in these circumstances , most teens , and certainly most young men , opt for the spanking , preferring to endure a " short sharp shock " of severe physical pain for a relatively brief duration , followed by a sore backside for a day or two , rather than long , tedious hours of unhealthy incarceration .
In effect , students in these places may be seen to have been given " a right to be paddled " as well as " a right not to be paddled " .
For an illustration of this policy being put into practice in 2008 at Booneville High School in Arkansas , where the choice was between taking three paddle swats and attending Saturday school , see these video clips .
Some schools explicitly state that no student will receive corporal punishment against his or her own wish .
A few restrict the number of times per semester that a student may choose a spanking .
Many schools offer parents the opportunity to register in writing their desire that their son or daughter not be paddled ; in Texas and North Carolina , they now have to do so by law .
But they often stress that , in that case , the only alternative is suspension , so that the student loses learning time and , typically , gets a zero grade on work missed .
Where the alternative to a paddling is after - school detention , some schools discourage opting out of CP by making life difficult for the parents , for instance by spelling out that no transportation is provided for the " detainees " .
Some make stipulations such as requiring the parent to agree come to the school to pick up the student within 30 minutes of being called in a discipline situation that would otherwise have been dealt with by a spanking ( Alpine ISD , Texas ) .
Some others make the actual process of opting out inconvenient , e.g. by requiring the parent to attend at the school and meet an administrator in person in order to hand over the no-CP letter ( Dumas ISD , Texas ) .
Likewise , Biloxi Public Schools in Mississippi stipulates that parents who choose to forbid paddling may have to attend " parenting sessions " , or even attend classes with the student .
Note also that some Texas high schools ' athletic policies strongly discourage , or in a few cases even downright forbid , parents from opting their student athletes out of CP , in order not to encroach on playing and training time by requiring attendance at ISS or detention .
One district ( Newton ISD ) goes so far as to write in its Athletic Handbook , " If student or parent / guardian does not agree with any of the above disciplinary actions , students should not be involved in athletics " .
Another ( Mineola ISD ) , pointing out that " Athletes are required to be administered corporal punishment as needed " , stated until recently : " if the Campus Principal gives an athlete the option of swats instead of another form of punishment , the athlete MUST take the swats , or the Athletic Director reserves the right to administer swats along with the punishment the campus principal assigned " .
In the locker room of a Texas high school , a 17 - year - old , 6ft 2in. athlete , who has just been expertly paddled by the head football coach , lowers his jeans to show the effects to a friend 's camera ( March 2013 ) .
This school 's athletic handbook says coaches may administer swats -- no maximum number specified -- for " violation of team rules " , independently of the normal code of conduct .
Note the skill and accuracy with which all the swats ( three ? ) have been placed neatly over the lower half of the young man 's posterior , so that he will experience a sharp reminder each time he sits down , for a day or so at least .
( Screen grab from a YouTube clip that is no longer on line )
As noted , some school districts , rather than allowing parents to " opt out " , require them to explicitly " opt in " before the paddle can be used , but in most places the convention is still that a student may be spanked unless there is a parental opt - out notice already on file in the office .
Effects on the student .
The effects of a paddling can vary a lot , depending on how forcefully it is applied and also , to a degree , on the student 's size , build and physical resilience .
Paddled students tend to say that it hurts like crazy at the time , but that the pain often does not last very long .
There may be yelps and tears and red faces , as attested by numerous anecdotal eyewitness and first - person accounts .
But even a paddling of four or five hard swats will , if administered accurately , only leave the buttocks sore and red or , at worst , harmlessly bruised for several days ; it does not cause injury or bleeding .
A few school districts , such as South Iron and Winona , both in Missouri , spell out in their handbooks that the paddle may cause bruises and that this does not constitute abuse ( contrary to what overprotective mothers sometimes claim ) .
Private and charter schools .
Private schools are less constrained than public ones in matters of punishment .
Often , part of their appeal to parents is that they can boast much better - behaved pupils than public schools because they are freer to impose strict discipline .
This can involve some private schools in frequent applications of CP -- especially , but not only , Christian ( generally Protestant , e.g. Presbyterian , Baptist , fundamentalist or " born - again " ) schools , who are able to invoke biblical justifications for it .
Some boarding schools , too , have been noted for making extensive use of the paddle , particularly " historically black " ones or those with a military emphasis .
Charter schools are publicly funded but not subject to local school district rules , so that for instance in Memphis TN , where the local school board has banned the paddle in ordinary schools , public charter schools make a selling point of their ability to secure better student behavior through spanking .
Note too that there are many states -- including Alaska , California , Illinois , Michigan , Nevada , New York , Utah and Washington State -- where paddles are deployed in some private schools , even though they are banned in public ones .
There are only two states where CP in private schools is prohibited by law : Iowa and New Jersey .
History .
Much research remains to be done on the history of corporal punishment in American education .
Presumably the early settlers brought their own existing practices with them from Europe .
Whipping with a switch is much mentioned in literature in , especially , the 19th century , often making use of branches or twigs collected right outside the schoolroom .
In some districts , such as Alameda in California in 1893 , regulations specified the use of a leather strap on the palm of the hand , as in Scotland and Canada , but this does not seem to have been widespread in the USA .
However , a strap is also mentioned ( no target area specified ) in this 1880 case in New York State .
It is far from clear why , how , or exactly when the wooden paddle ( originally , it is often alleged , an implement associated with slavery ) became almost universally adopted .
The paddle has also long been a feature of American college fraternity life -- but which came first ?
At all events , anecdotal evidence suggests that paddling had become the norm for school CP in most districts by the 1930s if not the 1920s .
An early mention of the word " paddle " comes in this 1887 news item about an allegedly excessive school punishment in Iowa .
In that case , the implement is described as " a hickory club or ' paddle ' , three feet long , one - half inch thick and one and one - half inches wide " .
A newspaper editorial in 1908 opined that the paddle seemed " almost divinely appointed " for the purpose of punishing a boy , and explained why it was so suited to application to his rear end : " That area of the body which it most aptly fits is not very susceptible to mortal wounds ... the bones which it contains are so abundantly swathed about with muscular tissue that there is no danger of breaking them " .
Some commentators have surmised anecdotally that the paddle may have come to be favored over the switch because of its weight and solidity , so that , if used properly , it can be effective even through fairly thick clothing , such as denim jeans ( invented in the 1870s ) with their patch pockets over the seat .
In the past , some paddles had holes drilled in them , to reduce air resistance , as in this picture from a fictional film ( right ) .
This supposedly increases the effectiveness of the punishment , but is nowadays rare , and explicitly disallowed by some school district regulations , probably because of fears that it could increase the propensity for bruising .
There were one or two places where the rattan cane was the official instrument , notably the Boston public schools until the 1960s .
Even odder in American terms , the Boston rattan was applied to the student 's hand ( see J. Kozol , " Death at an Early Age " , The Atlantic , September 1967 ) .
Massachusetts abolished school CP in 1972 .
The rattan was also used in St Louis , Missouri , until it was abolished in 1981 .
Also a special case is New Jersey , which abolished school CP in 1867 , more than a century before any other state .
(5) An attempt to reintroduce it in Newark NJ , with parental consent only , was rejected in 1894 .
The press coverage implies that the implement used was to have been the rattan , had the legislation passed .
(5) But at least one New Jersey school got round this by requiring parents to come and spank their unruly offspring -- see this Oct 1900 news item .
Another non-standard implement once used in a few areas was a length of rubber hose , as in this 1912 case in New Mexico and this 1919 case in Vermont and this 1924 case in New York and this 1960 case in Ohio .
Some big-city school districts , especially in the urban north , abolished CP long before the states in which they are situated .
Thus , New York City first banned it in public schools in 1870 , while in New York State as a whole it was not discontinued until 1985 .
College and university .
It is surprising to discover that college students and university freshmen could at one time be paddled in some places .
See these 1922 rules for the spanking of students by campus police at Northwestern University in Chicago , and these Sep 1919 news items about punishments at the University of Missouri carried out by senior students with official approval , in a tradition said to have been started in 1905 and upheld in a vote of the student body in 1920 .
At the University of Washington in Seattle , spanking was supposedly banned in 1914 .
One could regard some of this as analogous with canings by prefects in English schools .
It seems to have been something quite different from fraternity paddling , a private unofficial activity that has more to do with hazing than punishment .
Meanwhile at Texas A & M University , paddling with an ax handle has been described by one informed source as " the traditional method of discipline at the university " until as recently as the mid-1980s -- see this picture .

Schools , black children , and corporal punishment
Statistical analysis by the Brookings Institution ( 2016 ) shows that the racial disparity " problem " is very marked in relation to student suspensions but has been overstated as far as CP is concerned .
In Texas for instance there is no difference at all between black and white students spanked pro rata to their population numbers ( although it would have been interesting to know how Hispanics fit into this , since they now make up about 40 % of the Texas population ) .

Discipline by Teachers in Loco Parentis New !
This 1957 document from Cleveland - Marshall Law School in Ohio is a short academic thesis by a second - year law student .
Now , more than 60 years later , the common - law doctrine of in loco parentis remains the legal basis for school CP , though it has become rather a theoretical one in an era when many parents do n't spank their children and especially not in a formal ceremony with a wooden paddle .
Perhaps partly as a result of this , much has changed since 1957 , notably the extent to which parents are often allowed de facto ( and now in the case of Texas de jure ) to exempt their offspring from CP on the understanding that the student will be suspended instead .
Trends in Discipline and the Decline in Use of Corporal Punishment [ DOC ]
Information note ( 2011 ) from the Florida Department of Education gives some statistics .
Students receiving CP in Florida declined from 13,900 in 1994/95 to 3,661 in 2009 / 10 .
The number of districts using the paddle had fallen to 30 ( out of 67 ) .
Figures for individual districts are given for 2009 / 10 .
The winner was Jackson , with 480 spankings recorded .
Analysis of the figures reveals that all the paddling districts were in the Florida panhandle and the inland part of the peninsula : corporal punishment had disappeared entirely from the east and west peninsular coasts .
The document notes that , as paddlings went down in the 1990s , suspensions rose sharply by a much larger amount , though they fell back somewhat in the latest five years .
In other words , the increased suspensions were not merely replacements for CP .
One might infer from this a general collapse in discipline due at least in part , perhaps , to the loss of the deterrent effect of the paddle in those districts that have abandoned it .
Alaska Administrative Code -- Corporal punishment in private schools
It is not common for CP in private schools to be officially regulated in detail , but Alaska has a go .
It requires paddling schools to adopt a written policy , including a requirement for parental consent , and description of the implement to be used .
Correlation between high rates of corporal punishment in public schools and social pathologies
This so - called " research study " takes CP figures from the top ten paddling states and attempts to match them to data about such diverse matters as the murder rate , reading proficiency levels , and unmarried mothers .
The paper then grudgingly concedes that a statistical correlation does not prove a causal relationship , and lamely attempts to meet this point by quoting various other documents .
Some of these are purely anecdotal and others are " studies " , such as those by Dr Murray Straus , which had nothing to do with school paddling but looked at the spanking of toddlers by their mothers , an entirely different subject .
Quite aside from any other considerations , several of the " top ten " paddling states in fact have very low percentages of students paddled .
In Texas , for example , the figure looks large in absolute terms , but represents less than 1 % of students .
How likely is it that something directly affecting such a small proportion of a given population is going to have , of itself , a measurable effect on the wider society in the whole of that area ?
The paper concludes with the bald assertion that " corporal punishment in public schools clearly has disastrous effects on children and communities " , having in fact wholly failed to demonstrate any such thing .
For my own explanation as to why statistical juggling exercises of this sort are invariably a waste of time , see this article on my Questions and Answers page .
Holloman v Harland and Allred and Walker County Board of Education
Full judgment of the US Court of Appeals ( 2004 ) in a case about Michael Holloman , a schoolboy in Alabama who was paddled in 2000 , aged 18 , for raising his fist in protest during the Pledge of Allegiance .
The court held that the school had violated his First Amendment rights to free speech .
Michael chose a spanking ( 3 licks by the principal in his office ) in preference to three days ' detention , which would have prevented him from graduating .
The nature of the punishment is incidental to the legal issues raised , which did not concern CP as such ; but from our point of view the interesting paragraphs in the document are 10 , 11 , 39 , 45 , 48 , 159 , 161 , 162 , 164 .

The court threw the case out on a series of technicalities .
Doe And Others v. Heck And Others
This is the US Court of Appeals full ruling ( 2003 ) in the Greendale Baptist Academy case .
It held that Wisconsin social workers , who had entered the school without a warrant and questioned students about CP , had violated the constitution .

Legitimated Violence in Schools : The Power Behind the Paddle
This " academic " essay , written in tendentious sociological jargon and published in the " Advancing Women in Leadership Journal " , attacks CP from a hardline feminist and " children 's rights " ideological perspective .
There is a lot about " hegemonic masculinity " , wherein even Desmond Morris 's ancient pseudo - anthropological fantasies about the " bent - over submissive posture " and CP as a " form of ritual copulation " are trotted out once more .
Few readers of either sex will , I suspect , be inclined to take any of this stuff seriously , but the document does include a plausible vignette of a day at a southern elementary school , including eyewitness accounts of paddlings of a girl and a boy .
The paper is mistaken , incidentally , in stating that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child " calls for a worldwide ban on corporal punishment " .
The Convention does nothing of the sort .
The words " corporal punishment " do not appear anywhere in it , and nor does it contain any references to paddling , spanking , or any similar wording .
What it does call for is the protection of children from " mental and physical violence " .
When countries signed up to the Convention ( which , in any case , the USA has not done ) , they cannot reasonably have supposed that it prohibited ordinary , moderate spanking or paddling which causes no injury .
Another error is the assertion that " every industrialized nation in the world , except the U.S. , has abolished corporal punishment in schools " .
Singapore is certainly an industrialized country , to name but one where school CP is entirely legal and in widespread use .

Omaha Lancers Named USHL Organization Of The Year
May 6 , 2010 - United States Hockey League ( USHL ) News Release
Chicago , IL - The United States Hockey League today announced that the Omaha Lancers have been named the USHL Organization of the Year for the 2009 - 10 season .
In addition , Lancers President and Managing Partner Ben Robert has been tabbed as the Dave Tyler USHL Executive of the Year .
The awards were determined by a vote of League team presidents .
" What Ben Robert and the Omaha Lancers organization have done in a single year to restore the Lancers to their rightful place at the top of Omaha 's sports culture , and to elite status in the USHL , is extraordinary , " said USHL Commissioner Skip Prince .
" These awards , voted on by the other Member Clubs and Ben 's peers , confirm the respect the Lancers have earned throughout the League . "
The Lancers completed a successful move back to Omaha for the 2009 - 10 season to play their home games at the historic Omaha Civic Auditorium .
The team had taken the ice the last seven seasons across the river at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs , Iowa .
The Lancers welcomed more than 100,000 fans at the downtown Civic Auditorium for USHL hockey this year , representing a 34 % increase in attendance from the prior season .
That total ranked the organization fourth overall in League attendance , which was up from ninth in 2008 - 09 .
Omaha fans were treated to another great season on the ice as the team finished first in the USHL West Division with a 42 - 12 - 6 record , trailing only the Anderson Cup champion Green Bay Gamblers for the best record in the League .
It was the sixth time that the Lancers have won 40 - or - more games during the regular season and the 18th consecutive campaign winning at least 30 games .
This season also marked the 21st straight time that the Lancers have qualified for the USHL Clark Cup Playoffs .
Leading the Lancers ' efforts this season was President & Managing Partner Ben Robert who has been an owner of the USHL Member Club since 2004 .
He moved his family to Omaha for the 2009 - 10 season as a long - term commitment to focus his full efforts on building a successful organization on and off the ice during the transition back to the Nebraska city and for years to come .
Robert previously had served as Vice President of Business Development for the Los Angeles Kings where he led innovative efforts to generate incremental revenue for the NHL club .
In addition to possessing more than 25 years of experience in the business world , including sales , management , and real estate development , Robert has a thorough knowledge of the hockey industry and was once a player himself having played four years at the University of New Haven where he earned bachelor 's and MBA degrees .
The Lancers were also welcomed back to Omaha with overwhelming support from the business community .
Sponsorships and partner commitments for the USHL Club more than tripled from the previous season .
The team was actively involved in the community and charitable endeavors to re-introduce themselves to the city .
One such activity was the launch of the Omaha Lancers School Program , which saw players and staff visit Omaha schools to reach out to children and promote reading .
The initiative also provided ticket vouchers so every child had the opportunity to see their Lancers take the ice .
Another season highlight was when the Lancers teamed up with another local hockey favorite , the University of Nebraska - Omaha Mavericks men's hockey team , for a special " Hockey Night in Omaha " promotion .
It marked the first time the two teams worked in unison to put on an event .
Both squads played a home game in Omaha on February 13th , 2010 and wore special jerseys for the contests .
Commemorative items from the promotion were auctioned with proceeds benefitting local charities such as Leap for a Cure for Cancer , Make - A - Wish Foundation , and Omaha area youth hockey organizations .
" Ben Robert and one hard - working team have been a model Member Club in all phases of the business - from their great season on the ice , to the fans who came back with the team to the Civic Auditorium , to the players the Lancers will send on to the NCAA and the NHL draft this year , to the team 's reputation in the grassroots and business communities as a responsible and generous corporate citizen - they 've confirmed that they 're not just a hockey team , they 're a USHL Member Club with all that entails .
All we can say is " Well done - and congratulations , " said Prince .

After Google surprised us with an earlier - than - expected roll - out of the official Froyo update for the Nexus One , we were wondering what device would be next in line to receive the upgrade to Android 2.2 .
For good reason , most people are speculating that it ’ll be the Motorola Droid , and Motorola has come out to say that that expect Droid users to receive the update “ in the near future . ”
“ We ’re excited to see Google ’s news of the next version of the Android operating system and look forward to integrating it on our Android - based devices as it ’s made available to the open source community . ”
While I can’t comment on specifics , we do expect DROID by Motorola users will receive Android 2.2 as a software upgrade in the near future . ”
One thing to note in that quote is that Motorola mentioned they ’ll be looking forward to getting Froyo on their “ devices ” .
Normally , I ’d just chock this up to bad wording , but if you know how PR works ( in any industry ) , you ’ll know each and every one of their “ official statements ” are carefully crafted word for word , and letter for letter .
Still , we wo n’t get our hopes up too soon that their MOTOBLUR devices might see the upgrade soon , but the Motorola Droid sure is a fine candidate for seeing the upgrade turn a very near corner .

Wikileaks : Collateral Murder
Video description : Wikileaks has obtained and decrypted this previously unreleased video footage from a US Apache helicopter in 2007 .
It shows Reuters journalist Namir Noor - Eldeen , driver Saeed Chmagh , and several others as the Apache shoots and kills them in a public square in Eastern Baghdad .
They are apparently assumed to be insurgents .
After the initial shooting , an unarmed group of adults and children in a minivan arrives on the scene and attempts to transport the wounded .
They are fired upon as well .
The official statement on this incident initially listed all adults as insurgents and claimed the US military did not know how the deaths ocurred .
Wikileaks released this video with transcripts and a package of supporting documents on April 5th 2010 on http://collateralmurder.com
Collateral Murder
www.collateralmurder.com
Overview
5th April 2010 10:44 EST
WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad -- including two Reuters news staff .
Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act , without success since the time of the attack .
The video , shot from an Apache helicopter gun-site , clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers .
Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded .
The military did not reveal how the Reuters staff were killed , and stated that they did not know how the children were injured .
After demands by Reuters , the incident was investigated and the U.S. military concluded that the actions of the soldiers were in accordance with the law of armed conflict and its own " Rules of Engagement " .
Consequently , WikiLeaks has released the classified Rules of Engagement for 2006 , 2007 and 2008 , revealing these rules before , during , and after the killings .
WikiLeaks has released both the original 38 minutes video and a shorter version with an initial analysis .
Subtitles have been added to both versions from the radio transmissions .
WikiLeaks obtained this video as well as supporting documents from a number of military whistleblowers .
WikiLeaks goes to great lengths to verify the authenticity of the information it receives .
We have analyzed the information about this incident from a variety of source material .
We have spoken to witnesses and journalists directly involved in the incident .
WikiLeaks wants to ensure that all the leaked information it receives gets the attention it deserves .
In this particular case , some of the people killed were journalists that were simply doing their jobs : putting their lives at risk in order to report on war .
Iraq is a very dangerous place for journalists : from 2003 - 2009 , 139 journalists were killed while doing their work .

On the morning of July 3 , 2009 , a national holiday , Sarah Palin placed a call to her communications director and told her that she wanted to hold a press conference at her Wasilla , Alaska , home .
She would n’t disclose the topic .
For Palin , the months since Election Day had been a letdown even bigger than the loss to Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
Being governor was drudgery .
“ Her life was terrible , ” one adviser says .
“ She was never home , her [ Juneau ] office was four hours from her house .
You gotta drive an hour from Wasilla to Anchorage .
And she was going broke . ”
Her sky - high approval ratings in Alaska — which had topped 80 percent before John McCain picked her — had withered to the low fifties .
She faced a hostile legislature , a barrage of ethics complaints , and frothing local bloggers who reveled in her misfortune .
All this for a salary of only $ 125,000 ?
The worst was that she had racked up $ 500,000 in legal bills to fend off the trooper scandal and other investigations .
She needed money and worried about it constantly .
“ You have to keep in mind , ” Bill McAllister , her then–press secretary , told me , “ she and Todd were middle class .
They ’re rich now , but not then . ”
And , whatever one thinks of her intelligence , she was more than shrewd enough to see that there was money to be made on her newfound national profile , and she had n’t been the one making it — this was her particular American resentment .
The tabloid - media culture began cashing in on the Palin - family drama ever since her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , and boyfriend Levi Johnston stepped on the Xcel Energy Center stage at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul .
On multiple occasions , Palin complained to campaign aides about Kaylene Johnson , an Alaska journalist , who had just published a book about her .
“ I ca n’t believe that woman is making so much money off my name , ” Palin said .
From the time of her infamous wardrobe selection , money had been an issue in Palin ’s politics .
Her relationship with the McCain campaign had been plagued by financial misunderstanding .
In her book Going Rogue , she claimed that the McCain campaign had left her on the hook for her Troopergate bills .
Palin was furious .
“ Deep down , she wanted to make money , ” a McCain adviser says .
“ There was always financial stress .
They ’re not wealthy people . ”
Palin knew there were ways to solve her money problems , and then some .
Planning quickly got under way for a book .
And just weeks after the campaign ended , reality - show producer Mark Burnett called Palin personally and pitched her on starring in her own show .
Then , in May 2009 , she signed a $ 7 million book deal with HarperCollins .
Two former Palin - campaign aides — Jason Recher and Doug McMarlin — were hired to plan a book tour with all the trappings of a national political campaign .
But there was a hitch : With Alaska ’s strict ethics rules , Palin worried that her day job would get in the way .
In March , she petitioned the Alaska attorney general ’s office , which responded with a lengthy list of conditions .
“ There was no way she could go on a book tour while being governor ” is how one member of her Alaska staff put it .
On Friday morning , July 3 , Palin called her cameraman to her house in Wasilla and asked him to be on hand to record a prepared speech .
Around noon , in front of a throng of national reporters , she announced that she was stepping down as governor .
To many , it seemed a mysterious move , defying the logic of a potential presidential candidate , and possibly reflecting some hidden scandal — but in fact the choice may have been as easy as balancing a checkbook .
Less than a year later , Sarah Palin is a singular national industry .
She did n’t invent her new role out of whole cloth .
Other politicians have cashed out , used the revolving door , doing well in business after doing good in public service .
Entertainment figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jesse Ventura , and even Ronald Reagan have worked the opposite angle , leveraging their celebrity to make their way in politics .
And family dramas have been a staple of politics from the Kennedys — or the Tudors — on down .
But no one else has rolled politics and entertainment into the same scintillating , infuriating , spectacularly lucrative package the way Palin has or marketed herself over multiple platforms with the sophistication and sheer ambitiousness that Palin has shown , all while maintaining a viable presence as a prospective presidential candidate in 2012 .
The numbers are staggering .
Over the past year , Palin has amassed a $ 12 million fortune and shows no sign of slowing down .
Her memoir has so far sold more than 2.2 million copies , and Palin is planning a second book with HarperCollins .
This January , she signed a three - year contributor deal with Fox News worth $ 1 million a year , according to people familiar with the deal .
In March , Palin and Burnett sold her cable show to TLC for a reported $ 1 million per episode , of which Palin is said to take in about $ 250,000 for each of the eight installments .
While she ’s waiting for her television career to begin in earnest , she ’s been busy on the speaker ’s circuit , having signed with the prestigious Washington Speakers Bureau .
Palin commands $ 100,000 per speech , putting her in the same league as fellow Speakers Bureau clients Colin Powell , George W. Bush , and Rudy Giuliani .
Since leaving office , she ’s scheduled speeches to the Daytona Chamber of Commerce ; the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce ; the Bowling Proprietors ’ Association of America ; the Charity of Hope fund - raiser in Hamilton , Ontario ; the Get Motivated Seminar in Beaumont , Texas ; the Complete Woman Expo ; the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America ; and the Sierra - Cascade Logging Conference .
In February , she delivered the keynote address at the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville .
Palin’s $ 100,000 contract for the tea -party event — which drew fire from rival tea-party groups angry that Palin was cashing in at their expense — included $ 18,000 for private - jet travel for her and an entourage of five people , according to two people who ’ve seen the contract .
Palin jetted to Nashville with two bodyguards , her spokesperson Meg Stapleton , and her daughter Piper .
“ I remember looking at the contract and was thinking , Holy cow , ” one person involved in organizing the event says .
“ It was very specific on a lot of details . ”
Most events require a Learjet , or its equivalent , from Wasilla , at a cost of some $ 1,500 per hour of flight time .
Though Palin may not like it , she makes money for Democrats and Republicans alike .
Across the political spectrum , Palin is a ratings magnet .
Whenever she appears on Fox News , ratings tick up by 10 to 15 percent .
At MSNBC , she ’s also a ratings phenomenon , albeit with opposite adjectives .
Tina Fey ’s reprisal of her Palin character in early April juiced Saturday Night Live ’s ratings , beating prime - time programming , a rare feat .
Online , right - wing sites like the Drudge Report frequently plug Palin headlines , while Palin ’s presence at liberal outlets like the Huffington Post and Talking Points Memo routinely sparks hundreds of reader comments .
During the campaign , people said she could be another Oprah , but now , in many ways , she ’s bigger than Oprah , an empath for people who feel , rightly or wrongly , that America has forgotten them .
“ People are drawn to her , ” says Fox News programming chief Bill Shine .
“ People look at her and say , ‘ She has a bunch of the same troubles I do , there ’s a mom who ’s there changing diapers . ’ ”
And she ’s a canny — and completely modern — promoter of her product .
Last year , Bristol introduced her mom to Facebook , and Palin began speaking to her audience of 1.5 million fans directly with frequent status updates and tweets , which consist of conservative boilerplate ( “ Man-Made Global Warming =Snow Job ” ) interspersed with chirpy reports about goings - on in Wasilla ( “ Family is getting ready for Todd ’s IronDog race tomorrow ; I ’m watching @GlennBeck on TV now giving # CPAC speech , while racers are in garage ) .
For an operation with such a massive footprint in both politics and entertainment , Palin has a tiny inner circle .
Her team includes husband Todd and her close friend Kris Perry .
In D.C. , Palin relies on her former advance aide Jason Recher , and she also maintains ties to John Coale , the powerful Democratic lawyer and husband of Fox News host Greta Van Susteren , former Nixon aide Fred Malek , and neoconservative foreign - policy adviser Randy Scheunemann , a McCain adviser and hunting enthusiast from Minnesota who was a fierce ally inside the McCain campaign .
Palin also hired former RNC finance director Tim Crawford as her PAC ’s treasurer , as well as Pam Pryor , a former spokesperson for conservative black Republican congressman J. C. Watts , to improve her relationships with fellow Republicans .
Palin gets advice from Rebecca Mansour , a right - wing activist who co-founded the blog Conservatives4Palin.com , and Kim Daniels , a pro-life attorney for the Thomas More Law Center in Michigan , whose slogan reads , “ The Sword and Shield for People of Faith . ”
Palin ’s bare - bones staff and seat - of - the - pants approach have often caused her problems .
In February 2009 , Palin canceled a planned appearance to headline the CPAC conference in D.C. , claiming she was too busy .
Also this past winter , Palin ’s spokesperson Stapleton quit , and Palin has made no move to replace her .
Communication in and out of Palinworld for many reporters , and even fellow Republicans , is virtually nonexistent .
Last month , her staff told Republican officials to take her name off the guest list of a fund - raiser after they had hyped her appearance .
Palin ’s relations with the national GOP , which have always been fraught , have n’t gotten any better .
Palin is a fund - raising machine and a turbocharger for the right - wing base .
The party knows she is a possible bridge to the fractious and suspicious tea -party crowd .
But Palin ’s conspicuous lack of depth — and the sheer joy she takes in what she does n’t know — is a source of angst among Republicans who see larger brand risk if Palin comes to define the party .
Meanwhile , she continues her erratic flirtation with a presidential run .
Where other likely candidates — Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty — are preparing for 2012 with staffs and advisers and carefully planned travel schedules , Palin is , essentially , winging it .
But it ’s not yet been shown that Palin needs any specifically political organization , or that she has to kowtow to any gatekeeper to get where she wants to go .
In fact , she and her new network have themselves become the gatekeepers .
It ’s very hard to get anywhere in Republican politics without going past them .
And the gate also happens to be a tollbooth .
Nowadays , for both poles of the political spectrum but especially for the right , politics is a business — the entertainment business .
The freak show , as Mark Halperin termed it , has been turned into a fully merchandised product .
It was Fox ’s Roger Ailes who had the insight that the American right was an underserved market , one with a powerful kind of brand loyalty .
Fox News has turned a disaffected segment of the populace into a market , with the fervor and idiosyncratic truth standards of a cult .
Wingnut - ism has been monetized , is one admittedly partisan way of looking at it .
Palin stokes the disaffection of her constituents and then , with the help of Fox , offers to heal them , for a price .
And — surprise — they ’re more affluent than most Americans .
Fifty - six percent make over $ 50,000 a year , according to a Times / CBS poll .
Running for president is no doubt part of her business model .
But forget elections ( as many Palin supporters already seem to have done ) ; she ’s already the president of an alternative America — and also its CEO .
In Wasilla , the Palins are in the midst of a major lifestyle upgrade .
There ’s a new Escalade in the driveway and a new Dodge Ram pickup for Bristol , says someone who knows the family .
When I visited in early April , the sound of whirring saws and hammers could be heard emanating from the trees from the deck of the Best Western Hotel next door , which , since the campaign , has served as a base camp of sorts for visiting press .
Todd ’s cherry - red seaplane sits propped on its floats by the shoreline .
A couple of years ago , the Palins purchased the adjacent lot from their neighbor , and they are currently building a 6,000 - square - foot , three - level structure , according to building plans filed at the Wasilla Planning Office .
On the ground floor , Palin will have an apartment for Track , who recently returned from his deployment in Iraq .
Upstairs , there ’s a second residence for Bristol .
Palin is building herself an office that features custom woodwork , a long marble countertop , and panoramic windows .
“ The view is incredible , from the Chugach Range all the way to the Alaska Range , ” Wasilla mayor Verne Rupright told me .
Palin stokes the disaffection of her people , then heals them , for a price .
But her current prosperity was not the case when the campaign ended .
Then , Palin needed money , and a crash course in post - campaign reinvention .
Palin Inc. began coalescing almost immediately after November 4 .
Around the holidays , Palin ’s spokesperson called Mary Matalin , who was vacationing on her farm in the Shenandoah Valley .
During the GOP convention , when Palin first came under fire from the left , Matalin went on CNN and vigorously defended her ( “ She ’s the future of the party , ” she said ) .
Palin heard about her performance , and the two began communicating during the campaign and kept in touch afterward .
“ After the campaign , they were just asking , ‘ What do we do now ?
How does this work ? ’ ” Matalin says .
Matalin , who is editor - in - chief of a conservative imprint at Simon & Schuster , gave her publishing - industry advice and offered to call Washington power agent Bob Barnett — who ’s also represented Bill Clinton , Bob Woodward , and Barack Obama .
Barnett , recognizing Palin ’s value , quickly signed her on .
The first order of business was a book deal , which he pitched exclusively to Jonathan Burnham , the publisher of HarperCollins .
Partly because her meltdown with Katie Couric promised more great television , and partly because of her outlandish family life and moose - shooting habits , Palin was a massive American celebrity , and the interest seemed to build rather than fade .
“ I fielded 1,000 individual requests in the first four or five months after the election , ” Bill McAllister told me .
Barbara Walters , George Stephanopoulos , and Charlie Gibson all made personal calls in an effort to land post-election interviews with Palin .
Stephanopoulos was especially aggressive in his pursuit .
“ George and I talked so much we ’re like new best friends , ” McAllister joked .
“ Bill Maher also tried to book her .
In that case , he had to be dreaming . ”
But everyone wanted her for free , which was a problem .
In November 2008 , John Coale tagged along with Van Susteren , who was in Alaska taping an interview with Palin for Fox News .
Later , the Fox camera crew , Van Susteren , and Coale gathered around the Palins ’ dinner table in Wasilla for some moose chili in her kitchen overlooking Lake Lucille .
After dinner , Coale and Palin retreated to the pantry and sat on stacks of boxes and talked for the next hour about her Troopergate dilemma .
Palin confessed she did n’t know what to do about her legal bills .
“ She was concerned she did n’t know how to deal with this , ” Coale told me .
Coale assured Palin he would figure something out .
When he returned to Washington , Coale went to see McCain in his Senate office to discuss Palin ’s desperate finances .
“ If Sarah Palin knew I was here , she would be very upset , ” Coale said to McCain .
McCain told Coale he was n’t aware she was in debt for Troopergate .
“ I ’ll do fund - raisers , I ’ll help , ” McCain offered .
Still , Palin was stewing about money .
Before Coale ’s meeting with McCain , she was in Atlanta campaigning for Republican senator Saxby Chambliss , who was in a runoff .
Coale visited her in her suite at the Four Seasons , and explained to Palin that she could form a political - action committee and a legal - defense fund to cover her travel and legal bills .
“ I told her , ‘ Almost all of this can be paid for by a PAC , and you could contribute to other candidates . ’
She liked that . ”
Palin was worried , though , that forming a legal - defense fund would signal to her critics that she had done something wrong and was trying to get out of it .
“ She was n’t sure how that would look . ”
With Coale ’s help , Palin set up SarahPAC in January 2009 .
Immediately , money started pouring in , especially , says Coale , after Cindy Adams mentioned it in her New York Post column .
“ It was like $ 100,000 every week .
Without any ask , ” Coale says .
When Going Rogue was released last November , it became the fastest - selling nonfiction debut since Bill Clinton ’s 2004 memoir , My Life .
Palin ’s torrid book sales are the single biggest reason HarperCollins returned to profitability last year .
When Palin sat down to promote Going Rogue with Oprah in November , she boosted Oprah ’s ratings to the highest level in two years .
The campaign - style tour through Palin ’s heartland strongholds was executed flawlessly .
Burnham was amazed at the response .
“ When the cover was revealed , every screen I turned to , every television show I turned on , was showing it .
As a publisher , I ’ve never experienced anything like that . ”
The book , which gleefully skewered her former adversaries in the McCain campaign and elsewhere , did not seem to have made extensive use of a fact - checker , but that only seemed to accentuate its from - the - heart Palinness , part of her brand :
In Palinworld , Palin , by definition , speaks the truth .
The only real blip concerned her ghostwriter , Lynn Vincent , a writer for the Evangelical World magazine , whom Palin chose from a short list of candidates presented to her by HarperCollins .
After news of Vincent ’s selection leaked , critics seized on a January 2009 pro-life piece she had written for World titled “ Black Genocide ” — as well as her association with the co-writer of her 2006 book Donkey Cons , former Washington Times writer Robert Stacy McCain ( no relation ) , who had a history of racially charged statements and associations — to claim that Vincent was racist .
Vincent , who had collaborated on a New York Times best seller about racial reconciliation , told me that she was deeply hurt by the racism allegation and considered suing the Daily Beast for a piece by writer Max Blumenthal headlined “ Palin ’s Noxious Ghostwriter . ”
But when the media shifted its focus to Palin ’s next adventure , Vincent dropped the lawsuit idea .
From Buffalo Bill to the Marlboro Man , the self - reliant frontiersman has always been an image with mass appeal .
Palin has managed to graft this rugged Western myth onto a beauty - pageant face and a counterpunching , do n’t - tread - on - me verbal style — a new kind of character , and a remarkably compelling one .
In early March , Palin was in a midtown conference room with Burnett and Abbe Raven , the CEO of A&E Television Networks .
It was the final stop in a series of meetings with television executives .
In January , Palin had signed a production deal with Burnett , the impresario behind reality shows Survivor and The Apprentice , to pitch a show about Alaska that she would star in .
His pitch to executives was the wispiest of concepts .
The show would have Palin tagging along with prototypical Alaskan characters — miners , loggers , oilmen — “ against the background of this beautiful outdoor world , ” as one network executive explained .
Palin could “ go meet the ice fishermen .
You ’ll see her whether she interviews them or goes to the far reaches to where they ’re fishing . ”
Another idea is to have her go to the part of Alaska where you can see Russia ( take that , Tina Fey ) .
Not incidentally , the commercial and political appeal are in perfect synergy .
“ Alaska represents a place of possibility in the way Denver used to or California used to , ” Mary Matalin says .
“ I have friends who have gone up there and put up a tepee and stuck a stick in the ground and made it .
It is compelling to the imagination , and it ’s a connection to our heritage . ”
A few days before Palin ’s meeting at A&E , Burnett introduced her to CBS CEO Les Moonves in Los Angeles and NBC chief Jeff Zucker in New York .
Both networks passed on the show , since , even under the best circumstances , it would most likely attract a few million viewers , strong by cable standards yet far too small to justify a network ’s economics .
Discovery Communications , the parent company of TLC , emerged as the successful bidder .
Burnett negotiated the deal with Discovery COO Peter Liguori and TLC head Eileen O’Neill .
Palin is a centerpiece of a strategy that TLC executives see as positioning the network as the anti-Bravo , whose shows like Top Chef , the Real Housewives franchise , and America ’s Next Top Model are programmed to a liberal urban audience .
TLC ’s fare , like the antics of Jon and Kate Gosselin , or the inspirational documentary about Captain Sullenberger ’s miracle landing , or American Chopper , which moved over from Discovery , are decidedly downmarket .
“ We do n’t program TLC to the coasts , ” one Discovery executive said .
“ To counterprogram against that Bravo audience , we are programming to Middle America , and we ’ve built a successful business doing that . ”
Once Palin resigned from the governorship in July , the race was on to sign her .
Roger Ailes deputized Bill Shine to land her .
Rupert Murdoch met Palin during a charity dinner hosted by his wife , Wendi , at Cipriani 42nd Street in September 2009 , and that only increased the network ’s appetite .
Shine called Palin ’s agent Barnett in the summer , but negotiations dragged out over the next six months .
Barnett drove negotiations with Fox hard .
Palin made it clear to Fox that she would n’t be willing to move to New York or Washington .
“ If you take someone like Karl Rove who left office , he lives in D.C. and he could take a car down to the bureau , ” Shine says .
Fox offered to build a remote - camera hookup in her Wasilla home .
Barnett also told Shine that Palin did n’t want producers hounding her for interviews .
Barnett wanted all her appearances to have to go through Shine personally .
In January 2010 , Palin finally had her deal .
Her star power at Fox has sparked competition among the various personalities , all of whom would like more Palin on their shows .
Shine is responsible for making sure everyone gets equal time , to maximize her ratings appeal across the network .
“ Obviously , there needs to be a sense of fairness , ” Shine explains .
In March , the traveling political carnival known as the Tea Party Express III tour arrived in Senator Harry Reid ’s hometown of Searchlight , Nevada , a dusty strip of highway on a high desert plateau about 50 miles south of Las Vegas .
The venue was a gravel parking lot near an abandoned mine .
Palin ’s scheduled appearance caused numbers to swell far beyond organizers ’ most bullish estimates .
The line of cars waiting to enter stretched for more than a mile down the road .
Here , as everywhere , the tea party is a carnival where politics and commerce commingle .
Vendors on the perimeter of the crowd manned booths hawking conservative books , pins , OBAMA REPELLENT bracelets , and ONE NATION UNDER GOD sweatshirts .
Palin paraphernalia was prominently on display .
A stack of round pink pins with a moose cartoon read DRAFT SARAH PALIN next to a bumper sticker with big block letters : RUN SARAH , RUN .
There was also brisk business in anti-Obama items .
Rachel Hamil , a home - schooled 17 - year - old running a booth , smiled and pointed to one of the more popular pins : SOMEWHERE IN KENYA , A VILLAGE IS MISSING ITS IDIOT .
Fans jockeyed to get their photo taken with Joe the Plumber , who was posing in his trademark Carhartt jacket and wraparound Oakleys .
“ Right on , brother ! ” he said .
“ I ’ve been to over 140 tea parties , ” he told me .
“ I do my own events , I schedule my own stuff .
It ’s just me . ”
I walked a little farther into the crowd and met Kevin Unck , an unemployed truck driver from northern
Utah who was selling T - shirts out of the trunk of his faded blue Ford Taurus .
Unck said he used his last unemployment check along with a loan from his girlfriend to come up with $ 1,600 to print up 300 T - shirts that proclaimed OBAMA : ONE BIG ASS MISTAKE , AMERICA I asked Unck what bothered him most about Obama .
“ I think he ’s a communist , plain and simple as that , ” he said .
“ I ’m fearful for the country . ”
Unck said he did n’t expect to make much money selling T - shirts , but it gave him an excuse to come see Palin .
Then Palin took the stage .
“ Thank you , tea - party America ! ” she yelled .
“ Do you love your freedom ? ” Palin primed the crowd .
“ My husband , Todd , is here … I was gonna ask Todd if I could borrow his sunglasses , but I ’d have to take these off , though , and it ’d make it really rough for me to see the teleprompter , and then I realized , ‘ No teleprompter , time to kick it old - school ! ’ ” She raised her palms marked with pen .
“ Good thing I remembered how to use a poor man ’s version of the teleprompter ! ”
The crowd exploded in cheers .
For the next nineteen minutes , Palin worked her true believers into ecstasy .
She built toward the climax .
“ Now , when I talk about , it ’s not a time to retreat , it ’s a time to reload , what I ’m talking about — now media , try to get this right , okay ? ” she sneered .
“ It ’s telling people that their arms are their votes .
It ’s not inciting violence .
It ’s telling people , ‘ Do n’t ever let anybody tell you to sit down and shut up , Americans . ’
You stand up , and you stand tall ! ”
After the speech , Sal Russo , a former Ronald Reagan aide and conservative operative whose PAC runs the Tea Party Express , invited me onto the tea - party bus .
The coach was luxuriously appointed , with soft carpeting , mood lighting , and mirrored walls .
A large flat - screen hanging from the ceiling was tuned to Fox News .
We eased into a plush leather couch next to some of the conservative celebrities who travel along with the tour .
A young woman named Bethany Owens was sitting at a small table , pulling bills from a leather satchel .
The 20 - year - old daughter of black conservative entrepreneurs William and Selena Owens , Bethany had spent the morning at her parents ’ booth selling books and CDs , like her mother ’s title The Power Within a Conservative Woman ( $ 9.95 ) and her dad ’s motivational CD Answers Beyond the Rhetoric ( $ 19.95 ) .
Bethany began stacking up bills , doling them out like a Vegas dealer .
“ One hundred , two hundred , three , four , five hundred , ” she counted .
“ Ugh ! I gotta start over . ”
“ Five , six , seven , eight , nine hundred .
Okay , that ’s $ 3,300 , ” she said , piling bills into neat rows .
“ Are there corn dogs here , somebody ? ” yelled Melanie Morgan , a blonde conservative talk - radio host sitting nearby .
Just then , Russo informed her that he ’d heard Palin had agreed to speak alongside Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh at Morgan ’s upcoming charity event for the troops , which would mean more care packages .
“ Oh my God !
This is fabulous .
Sal , brilliant .
I could cry I ’m so happy , ” she said .
“ That ’s gonna be so many hundreds of thousands of dollars more . ”
The Tea -Party movement is Palin ’s political base and a central part of her audience .
Early on , it was a profit center , too , but politics and the profit motive had a near - disastrous collision in early February , when Palin showed up at the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville to deliver her first significant public speech since stepping down from office .
Landing Palin was the work of Judson Phillips , a smooth - talking Nashville defense lawyer who was active in the tea -party movement and wanted to make a business out of it .
While many tea-party groups , such as Dick Armey ’s FreedomWorks , operated as traditional activist organizations , Phillips ’s effort was entrepreneurial :
He had launched the Tea Party Nation network as a conservative social - media website that would also put on for - profit conferences .
Phillips told me he saw a business opportunity to create a right - wing version of Facebook , which he believes is a liberal front that could be used to silence conservatives .
“ I knew people on Facebook who had their accounts disabled for no reason , ” Phillips told me .
“ My fear is that we ’d be 72 hours out from Tax Day tea parties and Facebook would wipe us out . ”
Phillips saw Palin as the linchpin of his new business , and was willing to pay top dollar .
And since the tea-party convention was a profit - making enterprise , Palin insisted on her full fee .
In Wasilla , the Palins are in the midst of a major lifestyle upgrade .
Sometimes , for the right organization , Palin takes a pay cut .
While negotiating with Phillips last summer , she was also in negotiations to speak to a Nashville group called Proclaiming Justice to the Nations , a Christian organization that supports Israel .
Laurie Cardoza - Moore , the group ’s president , wanted Palin to headline a dinner in Nashville during the National Religious Broadcasters convention .
Palin cut a deal for the Christian group .
She agreed to appear for only $ 50,000 , and the three - page contract required only two first - class tickets , one coach ticket , and accommodations at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel .
As part of the contract , Cardoza - Moore gave Palin and her family the option of traveling to Israel for ten days this summer .
“ She was willing to come in and speak for [ $ 50,000 ] , and that said a lot to me , ” Cardoza - Moore says .
To help pay Palin ’s fee , Phillips turned to Bill Hemrick , the founder of Upper Deck baseball cards , for a seed investment of $ 25,000 .
With Phillips , Palin struck a hard bargain .
Her contract stipulated that for almost any reason she could back out and send a surrogate .
“ If we fart wrong , she is gonna back out on us , ” Phillips declared in one planning meeting , according to a participant .
“ That ’s how detailed this contract is . ”
Palin finally agreed to speak — but then Phillips and Hemrick ’s deal fell apart amid mutual recriminations , with Hemrick accusing Phillips of misrepresenting the deal and Phillips claiming Hemrick had tried to use his access to Palin to pitch her on a business opportunity .
In March , Hemrick sued Phillips for $ 500,000 .
Last fall , after Cardoza - Moore had signed the $ 50,000 contract and gotten a verbal commitment from the Washington Speakers Bureau , Palin mysteriously backed out .
“ It was a personal issue , ” Palin ’s agent told Moore .
After the imbroglio , Palin announced she was giving her $ 100,000 Tea Party Nation fee to charity , and has since done such events for free .
In 1996 , a few weeks into her run for Wasilla mayor , Palin revealed to Laura Chase , her campaign manager at the time , the scope of her ambition .
“ We were sitting at my table one night and I said , ‘ Sarah , one day you could be governor . ’
She just looked at me and said , ‘ I do n’t want to be governor , I want to be president . ’ ”
Palin ’s winking star turn at the Republican convention , and the polling bounce for McCain that followed it , showed that it was n’t just an idle dream .
But it looked to many like there was a great deal of work to do .
“ My advice to her , ” a former McCain staffer told me , “ was to keep a reasonably low profile and do your job as governor and come back and do an interview with Oprah , something big that will give you a platform and rebuild your image as a successful executive .
But that ’s not what she did . ”
Instead , Palin doubled down on building — and monetizing — her personal brand , the plainspoken Alaskan frontierswoman who ’s not ashamed of what she does n’t know .
( If her Couric interview showed to many that she needed remedial education in various political areas , she does n’t seem to have received it . )
And she has n’t modified her lone - wolf management style , something many see as a massive handicap for any presidential race .
“ People are constantly close to her and then estranged , ” one former McCain - campaign staffer said .
“ It ’s a great weakness to her and will be a great challenge for her to ever put together a team that could mount a successful campaign . ”
Adds another former staffer who traveled on her plane : “ She ’s difficult to staff .
She likes to make her own decisions .
That ’s the way she ’s always been .
She ’s a strong - willed person . ”
In New Orleans at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference a few weeks ago , as Palin ’s PAC staff gathered to assess her operation , some of her close advisers expressed concern that her minimalist approach is damaging .
According to one person familiar with the matter , when one adviser , Pam Pryor , suggested that the PAC should conduct some polling , the idea fell on deaf ears .
While careful not to say anything that might make her rear her head , some in the GOP Establishment whisper that they hope Palin stays in Wasilla .
She may be useful in raising funds and drawing crowds , but Palin ’s unseriousness and carnival antics damage the brand .
“ There ’s a big piece of the Republican Party that does n’t want her to run , ” said one national Republican strategist .
Even among her base , some see her rogue operation as a form of selfishness and her cashing in as unseemly .
And Palin ’s close relationship with John McCain is a liability for her right - wing audience .
In March , Palin made several campaign stops in Arizona with McCain and tried to convince the crowd of his tea -party bona fides .
“ People in the tea-party movement despise John McCain , ” Judson Phillips says .
“ When was the last time John McCain drove his own car ? ”
The synergies that have driven Palin Inc. thus far may evaporate if she pursues a presidential run in earnest .
There will be , eventually , interviews to do , with networks other than Fox .
Why Palin would trade the presidency — and the salary — for a candidacy that faces possibly insurmountable political hurdles is a question to ponder .
As Palin took to the stage in New Orleans , I sat down for lunch with Levi Johnston at a local brewpub in Anchorage .
Johnston was slumped down in his chair , faded green baseball cap pulled low .
Tank Jones , his manager - bodyguard , sat across the table , fielding calls on his cell phones from television producers .
It turns out that Johnston ’s career is precisely parallel to Palin ’s , a doppelgänger .
In the middle of the night , Jones and Johnston had flown back ( first - class , of course ) to Alaska from L.A. , where they had taped a segment for ET while taking meetings with producers to pitch Johnston ’s reality show .
“ It ’s everything I do , man .
Kinda like the Kardashian show , ” Johnston says , describing his proposed show .
“ It ’s everything .
Like one day I ’ll be hunting , next day I ’ll be , ‘ Hey , I gotta fly to California tonight , ’ so I ’ll hop on a flight .
Go to a party , maybe meet a chick , bring her back to Alaska and take her fishing and see if she can hang .
If not , kick her out .
Then go hang out with my son , or go to the track and race my dirt bike .
Next week , up in the mountains sheep hunting .
Or jumping out of airplanes .
I do n’t know .
It ’s not looking at glaciers and going to Bristol Bay . ”
Johnston sipped a Diet Coke while picking at a plate of fried calamari , his preferred dish ( “ Every time I came here , I had the fish or something ’ cause I was training for the Playgirl shoot , ” he said when we first sat down ) .
Johnston told me he ’s not surprised Palin is cashing in .
“ When she lost , I knew exactly what she was gonna do , ” he says .
“ The whole time she was getting big - money offers for book and TV shows .
I was like , All right , she ’s gonna pick that up .
It was just a matter of time before she quit . ”
Johnston says he ’s working on a memoir that would air the true story of the Palin household .
“ They ’re never around each other , ” Johnston says of Sarah and Todd .
“ It ’s like they hate each other but they do n’t want anyone to know it .
I think they were gonna get a divorce , but then they were like , ‘ Let ’s not prove them right . ’
I ’ve never seen them sleep in the same room , he ’s always on this little recliner .
For years , they never really talked . ”
( This summer , Palin threw cold water on the divorce rumors , telling Politico that the speculation was “ made up . ” )
“ I know everything there is to know about her , ” Johnston adds .
“ She ’s so fake .
But she ’s so good at it , too .
She ’s amazing at it .
If I did n’t know it , I would n’t know the difference .
She ’s gifted .
She could do movies because she ’s so gifted . ”
Relations between Johnston and the Palins have been surprisingly good considering all the public feuding — essentially , they ’re actors on the same show .
But that will likely soon get worse .
In May , Johnston ’s lawyer Rex Butler plans to file for joint custody of Tripp , which will drag the Palins back into court .
Johnston gets up from lunch and wants to beat the traffic on the only highway back to Wasilla .
He ’s off to practice his motocross before leaving on a weeklong bear - hunting trip in the Alaska Range .
“ Why not jump on it ? ” he says of all the money being offered his way .
“ I ’m not gonna lie and say I ’m not gonna go for it .
It ’s there , why not ?
It ’s a great living , you make money , and it ’s fun . ”
Sarah Palin is clearly having fun .
As her longtime Wasilla friend Judy Patrick told me , “ I always used to say she needed a bigger crowd . ”
Florida police officer Paul C. Lawrence , 38 , allegedly was so good in combating traffic violations that he did not wait for them to occur before ticketing citizens .
Lawrence has been charged with giving tickets to people who were not even in the state , let alone on the highway .
Prosecutors believe that Lawrence was trying to fulfill his quota of tickets — a ridiculous practice among police departments that forces officers to write tickets to bring in revenue .
Authorities believe that Lawrence used information from prior traffic stops to write the tickets .
In November alone , Lawrence wrote 397 tickets with 82 missing a signature and 203 of them were later dismissed .
One man was in Peru at the time that Lawrence said he was speeding down a Florida highway .
He is facing 22 counts of official misconduct , a third - degree felony .
This is not an unheard of occurrence as we have seen in prior stories .

Obama ’s Supreme Court nominee agrees with Cass Sunstein – wants the state to regulate the First Amendment
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , May 11 , 2010
President Obama ’s Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan is perfect in every way – perfect that is if you think the role of the highest judicial body in the United States is to ban free speech , indefinitely detain Americans without trial , resurrect command and control socialism , while urinating on everything the Constitution stands for .
We already discovered Kagan ’s penchant for treating Americans as guilty until proven innocent , or in fact just plain guilty without even the chance to be proven innocent , when she was quoted as saying , “ That someone suspected of helping finance Al Qaeda should be subject to battlefield law — indefinite detention without a trial — even if he were captured in a place like the Philippines rather than a physical battle zone . ”
So under that definition , if you send money to a charity later linked with some nebulous terrorist group then you are financing Al - Qaeda and could be thrown in Gitmo or some other CIA black site never to be seen again .
And this is the woman being forwarded to sit on a body that is supposed to safeguard civil liberties ?
That would be like hiring Charles Manson to coach the high school basketball team .
But it gets worse .
Now we learn that Kagan thinks certain expressions of free speech should be ‘ disappeared ’ if the government deems them to be offensive .
On the surface that ’s any opinion on racial , sexuality or gender issues , but since criticizing Obama is now deemed racist , where will it all end ?
In a 1993 University of Chicago Law review article , Kagan wrote , “ I take it as a given that we live in a society marred by racial and gender inequality , that certain forms of speech perpetuate and promote this inequality , and that the uncoerced disappearance of such speech would be cause for great elation . ” ( emphasis mine ) .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ In a 1996 paper , “ Private Speech , Public Purpose : The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine , ” Kagan argued it may be proper to suppress speech because it is offensive to society or to the government , ” reports World Net Daily .
Kagan also argued as recently as September that corporations should n’t be allowed to engage in free speech , and that the government can censor things like newspaper editorials , as well as the political opinions of radio talk show hosts or television reporters .
Chief Justice John Roberts blasted Kagan ’s argument at the time , reports Newsmax .
“ The government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech .
It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts , but of pamphlets , posters , the Internet , and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern , ” he wrote .
Kagan ’s standpoint on free speech , that it is subject to regulation and definition by the government , has no place in America , completely violates the fundamental premise of the First Amendment , that even unpopular speech should be protected , and would be better suited for countries like Iran , Zimbabwe or North Korea .
Little surprise therefore when we learn that in her undergraduate thesis at Princeton , Kagan lamented the decline of socialism in the U.S. as “ sad ” for those who still hope to “ change America . ”
If Kagan is approved she is going to find an eager ally in White House information czar Cass Sunstein , who in a January 2008 white paper entitled “ Conspiracy Theories , ” called for the government to tax and outright censor political viewpoints it deemed unsavory .

Tom Boonen ( Quick Step ) suffering on the slopes of the Mur de Grammont .
( Image credit : Bettini Photo )
Belgian champion Tom Boonen felt he was an equal match in strength for Fabian Cancellara in the Tour of Flanders today , yet for the second time in a week , he found himself unable to stay on the Swiss champion 's wheel .
Once the gap opened on the Kapelmuur between the two riders with less than 20 km to go , Boonen realized he did n't stand a chance of winning his third career title and had to settle for second place .
Unlike last week 's E3 Prijs , where Cancellara struck on a technical final turn that caught Boonen off guard , this time the Saxo Bank rider distanced Boonen on the toughest part of the climb in Geraardsbergen with 16 km to go .
Without getting out of the saddle , he powered away and when Boonen tried to accelerate he found himself unable to match the effort .
" It was n't a secret that if something was going to happen that it would be there .
I did n't feel worse than him .
I had taken the lead to control affairs when he passed me .
He did n't accelerate extremely hard .
I wanted to follow but had to sit back right because I cramped in my right leg .
Then I sat back , hoping that I would get in my rhythm and that the cramps would fade away , which happened .
" Cancellara gained twenty seconds in one kilometer so then you have to accept the facts .
I rode away from the men behind me but he was riding a minute away from me .
You do n't need a drawing to understand that , " Boonen said before pointing out there was n't much else he could do against Cancellara .
" What can you do ?
Shoot him to death ? "
Boonen joked .
From then on the Belgian champion did n't give up and stood tall to keep his second place .
" I battle with as much pleasure for second place as for first place .
I 'd rather won today and I had a good chance , but he has one of the best periods in his career .
He 's a top rider . "
For himself , Boonen invented a new title .
" Finishing second in the last few races ... it makes me the most regular rider of the peloton . "
When asked about the attack on the Molenberg that resulted in the two riders leading the race , Boonen explained that at that moment he felt strong .
" I started in the lead and wanted to go myself .
Maarten [ Wynants ] had escaped earlier with a group [ with Bernhard Eisel , Matthew Lloyd and Daniel Oss ] to be in front and keep up with us .
" I attacked at half speed to join them .
He rode next to me and I told him to wait because it was still far away , I still had Maarten and the others who were all good too .
Then he went on the right hand side of the road , very quietly .
I was a bit boxed in behind those men .
Then I manueverd to get past them and I managed to come back on him quite easily .
" Cancellara and I started co-operating without saying a word .
So afterwards , I did n't feel I was less strong than him .
But he 's the time trial world champion and I 'm not , and I never will be .
If he 's gone , he 's gone ; it 's as simple as that , " Boonen said .
Before the finale started many riders were caught behind one of the multiple crashes .
Boonen was among them together with his teammate Stijn Devolder .
" It took us thirty kilometers before we returned to the front .
It was total misery .
Everytime we bridged up they crashed again .
It was total bullshit .
The men from Saxo were going flat out in front .
Stijn needed even more time to return .
" I bridged back up on my own - that took some energy .
I think everybody has his own side story about a crash .
It was a classic how we predicted it , a very tough one , " Boonen said .
" It was a beautiful race .
I liked the new course a lot .
In the past riders were able to come back and attack but now that was impossible .
The Molenberg did n't make the difference .
It 's the part just before and after the Molenberg that makes it very hard , " Boonen said .
New jobs numbers will be released Friday morning , and they are expected to show , at last , some significant creation of new jobs .
A cheer will go up at the White House at this sign that the long climb out of the recession 's unemployment hole may have begun .
But any cheering will be tempered by nagging concern over an insidious problem lurking within the numbers : the startling number of Americans who have fallen into the ranks of not just the unemployed , but the long - term unemployed .
The ...
Mowalola is the eponymous London - based fashion brand by Mowalola Ogunlesi , who showed her second collection at London Fashion Week for SS20 earlier this year , as part of non-profit fashion collection and talent incubator Fashion East .
The Mowalola aesthetic is high - energy and provocative , featuring leather crop tops , halter - neck suits , and lascivious prints – there 's even a suit jacket with a bullet wound .
Ogunlesi – whose work has developed an ardent following with fans such as Skepta , Steve Lacy , Kanye West , and Solange – uses fashion to dismantle thought patterns , particularly regarding society and sexuality .
" Every time I get a new collection , I just ask myself :
What is the world like ?
What do I want to change in the world ? " she explains .
" I feel the most free people can be is when they truly know themselves wholly , sexually .
There [ are ] so many things trying to block that in the world , and I want people to be more in tune with themselves .
If they can do that sexually , then they can adopt that to every aspect of their lives . "
" So , with my clothes , I want to show men in a different way to the way they are perceived , especially black men " she continues .
" I 've grown up being taught to think a certain type of way about how black men should be , or how we should perceive them as quite hard and aggressive .
To me , a strong man is like Prince or like André 3000 .
They can be graceful , they can be soft , they can be family men .
Yet they can still be masculine , all in one .

Ogunlesi notes that Mowalola is not a a brand per se , but is just her , and therefore incredibly personal : " I do n't see ' fashion , ' which is just making things to sell – I 'm actually translating how I feel into to my clothes .
I do n't want to see so much shit in the world .
I want to see shit that has a purpose , to make people feel some way , so that 's what I do with my work .
So you would never see any work for me that I have n't applied myself into .
Otherwise , I 'm not going to do it . "
Ogunlesi is exploring Mowalola in a different dimension with a new installation at NOW Gallery called " Silent Madness , " which combines music , film , and pieces from her collection for a trippy walk through Mowalola 's surreal punk - inspired aesthetic .
Ogunlesi locks in on how she would like those walking through " Silent Madness " to feel : " Well , we 're just hoping people will stop and just be in themselves and in their minds for a couple of minutes .
So , now you 're in your own world , but also in my world .
You still have control , but I guess I 'm kind of dictating where your mind is going to end up .
I kind of wanted to give people the freedom to create their own reality in the space . "
You can see " Silent Madness " at NOW Gallery in London from now until 19 January , 2020 .

Charcoal in Container Growing Media
Tom Miles , January 11 , 2009
After visiting Richard Haard and Larry Williams in early 2007 I started discussing the use of charcoal with various nursery growers and researchers in the West .
A commercial nursery in California became interested in substituting charcoal for vermiculite in a growing media - soilless substrate - for container grown tree seedlings .
There could be both financial and ecological benefits from using charcoal in place of vermiculite .
Vermiculite is increasingly expensive , especially in the quantities used by commercial nurseries .
Locally made charcoal should be cheaper .
Vermiculite has a poor carbon footprint since it is heated to 1000 C ( 1832 F ) in processing and transported long distances , often imported .
Charcoal that is made locally as a byproduct of energy production could be used in growing media .
Since it would be planted in the forest with the seedling the carbon sequestration would be permanent .
The nursery uses a growing media made of combinations of peat ( 50 % ) , bark ( 20 % ) and vermiculite ( 30 % ) .
Bark is a common material in Northwest nurseries and has been studied extensively .
( See Landis , Altland , Buamscha , Scagel ) .
The grower tested seven mixtures substituting charcoal for vermiculite ( up to 30 % of the mix ) and substituting compost for peat , another expensive substrate .
Each blend was placed in two Styrofoam blocks containing 112 plants for a total of 896 plants including the control .
Ponderosa pine was grown in all containers .
Charcoal was gathered from mixed conifer burns in a local watershed .
It was crushed and screened through a 1/4 inch ( 6 mm ) screen .
The bulk density of the charcoal was 14.6 lbs/ft3 ( 0.23 g/cm^3 ) compared with vermiculite at 4- 10 lb/ft3 ( .06-.160 g/cm^3 ) ; bark at 0.17 to 0.20 g/cm^3 ; and peat at 0.08 g/cm^3 .
Perlite and pumice are also used in some nursery mixes .
They are denser with perlite at 0.32-.4 g/cm^3 and pumice at .38-.66 g/cm^3 .
The density of the 30 % charcoal mix 15.4 lb/ft3 ( 0.25 g/cm3 ) was similar to the control at 14.6 lb/ft3 ( 0.23 g/cm3 ) .
The other blends were somewhat heavier at 18 - 29 lb/ft3 ( 0.29-0.47 g/cm3 ) .
Water availability was similar for the 30 % char ( 67 % ) to the 30 % vermiculite control ( 68 % ) and slightly less ( 48 - 60 % ) for the other mixes .
50 % is typical .
At loading it was noted that the char mix was " very hydrophobic . "
Air - filled porosity was similar ( 14 % ) for the 30 % charcoal to the 30 % vermiculite control ( 16 % ) and in a similar range ( 14% - 19 % ) for the other mixes .
Typical is 12 - 15 % with a maximum of 25 % .
pH was 5.2 in the 30 % vermiculite control mix and 6.1 in the 30 % charcoal mix .
Substitution of compost for peat in the mixes raised the pH to between 7.1 and 7.5 .
At the time of my visit last week both plant health and root growth looked the same for the 30 % char and 30 % vermiculite .
Root plugs were firm .
The grower is both surprised and satisfied with the success of the charcoal substitution and will be doing further testing after a closer evaluation of the plants .

Today the U.S. Citizens Association , a conservative group in Ohio , filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 's individual health insurace mandate .
A press release from lead attorney Jonathan Emord sums up the constitutional arguments against the mandate :
The suit challenges the Health Reform Law 's mandatory requirement that every uninsured American purchase health insurance .
The suit contends that the federal government has no constitutional power to compel citizens to purchase a particular product with after tax dollars .
No such power exists in Article One of the United States Constitution under the Commerce Clause ( U.S. Const .
Art. I , § 8 , cl. 3 ) .
The suit also contends that the mandatory requirement violates the freedom of association protected by the First Amendment ( U.S. Const .
amend .
I ) by forcing Americans to obtain unwanted insurance ; violates the liberty provision of the Fifth Amendment 's Due Process Clause ( U.S. Const . amend .
V ) by forcing Americans to buy a product , insurance , that they wish not to buy ; and the right to privacy protected as a liberty right under the First , Third , Fourth , Fifth , and Ninth Amendments because it compels them to divulge confidential health information to an insurer against their will .
The lawsuit is here ( PDF ) .
I criticized the the mandate 's crazy constitutional logic in a column last March .
More on the mandate here .
The main purpose of this write up is to create a tutorial for running , installing , and analyzing results of Capture - Bat .
I did n’t really want to name this article “ Capture - Bat tutorial ” because not everyone is familiar with the tool and what its used for .
When it comes to analyzing malware there are a handful of tools that every analyst should have , Capture - Bat is one of those tools .
Capture - Bat will monitor changes malware makes to your system so that you can effectively determine what the malware is attempting to do .
Capture - Bat does a great job of eliminating noise and ignoring “ regular ” windows events .
It is a behavioral analysis tool which means that it does not analyze the malware itself , it only monitors changes the malware makes to the windows system .
In this article I hope to highlight the best way to use the tool and what options I always use when running the tool .
Capture - Bat is a free tool which can be grabbed here .
I ’ll get into all the details later but whenever I run this tool I execute the following command right before I execute the malware .
C: \Program Files \Capture \CaptureBAT.exe -c -n -l c:\temp\output.txt
Below are what the options mean .
-c capture any deleted or modified files
-n capture network activity
-l save output to a specified location ( lowercase L )
Let ’s walk through an example using the zipped up malware located here ( password is “ malware ” ) .
For the inexperienced keep in mind you ’ll need to run this malware in a virtual machine environment that is not connected to a network .
Now that you ’ve downloaded the malware open up two command prompts in windows ( Start > Programs > Accessories > Command prompt ) .
In the first command prompt you ’ll need to start up Capture - Bat with the command above .
Once you run this command you should see the following .
C: \Program Files \Capture & gt;CaptureBAT.exe -c -n -l c:\temp\output.txt
Option : Collecting modified files
Option : Capturing network packets
Option : Logging system events to c:\temp\output.txt
Loaded kernel driver : CaptureProcessMonitor
Loaded kernel driver : CaptureRegistryMonitor
Loaded filter driver : CaptureFileMonitor
Creating network dumper
Loading network packet dumper
network adapter found : 192.168.94.130
---------------------------------------------------------
My output is going to c:\temp , you may have to create this directory before running the command .
It looks like Capture - Bat is just sitting there but it ’s actually monitoring changes to your system .
It ’s important to only run the malware while Capture - Bat is monitoring your system , if you launch another application it will muddy your output and you may not be able to tell it ’s the malware making changes to your system or a benign application .
Now that Capture - Bat is monitoring let ’s go ahead run our malware .
I ’m a fan of running exe ’s from the command line because you may get a more verbose output , so execute the command below to launch the malware .
C:\temp\40033d8063564d1b3e4b41f1d5c9a31f.exe
After you execute the malware let Capture - Bat sit there and monitor events for about 30 seconds to one minute , after that time period simply go into the command prompt running Capture - Bat and type “ control + c ” to kill the Capture - Bat process .
Next step is to open up our output .
txt to see what the malware has done to the system , my output is below .

The first line is simply us executing the malware .
Lines 2 – 4 is where the malware creates a file , an exe in this case , named spoolsvc.exe .
Spoolsvc.exe does n’t already exist on windows systems but spoolsv.exe does so the malware author is trying to be tricky in creating an exe that is very similar to what already exists on the system .
It ’s very important to note that spoolsvc.exe is not executed here but simply created , had it been executed you would have seen “ process ” , ” created ” as is seen in line one .
Spoolsvc.exe is eventually executed on line 15 .
Line five is where a “ .bat ” file is created , for those that do n’t know “ .bat ” files are windows batch scripts which contain a series of commands to be executed .
Capture - Bat ends of saving this batch script which we will take a look at later .
Lines 6 – 13 is where the malware is setting registry values .
It appears that lines 6 – 11 are ensuring the “ Local Intranet ” has certain settings ( see IE setting screen shot below ) in internet explorer , this will allow internal connections to have a lower security setting than external connections .
My virtual machine is setup in a default and vulnerable setup , my registry values for lines 6 – 11 did n’t change after the malware was executed .
Also I intentionally changed these settings before the malware executed but the malware failed to modify the registry so go figure .
McAfee states that these settings are used to bypass firewalls ?
More information about internet explorer security settings and registry values can be found here .
Also good information here about IE security zones .
Lines 12 and 13 are modifying where temporary internet files and cookies are stored , in my case I did n’t notice a difference between before and after .
Also I modified the default location where temporary internet files are located , the malware failed to change this location after execution so go figure once again .
I have n’t contacted the developers of Capture - Bat but “ SetValueKey ” could also be used to query the registry ?
Either way the values stayed the same for me , it could have been that the malware authors wanted the registry settings for cache and cookies in a default state ?
Lines 14 – 15 are having cmd.exe execute the malware spoolsvc.exe .
Lines 16 – 18 are setting a value in the registry .
Once again these values did not change for me after the malware was executed and it appears that the value for BaseClass the value of “ Driver ” is default ?
I have n’t yet figured out why this piece of malware sets the value of BaseClass to driver but I have seen other malware perform these same actions .
In lines 19 – 30 the malware and Capture - Bat delete and create certain files and processes so hopefully that output is clear to you .
It gets interesting again on line 31 .
HKLM \SOFTWARE \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion
\Run\ is the location of exe ’s set to run when a user logs into the system .
It is very common to see malware modify these registry values to have itself execute once the user logs into the system .
In this case it only modified the Spooler SubSystem App value but it ’s common to see it modify other values in that location .
The last two lines of the output are Capture - Bat saving deleted files .
So that ’s a basic analysis of this malware .
I only let the malware run for about 30 seconds so it may actually perform more actions than my output .
You may be wondering why the funny name for this particular piece of malware , 40033d8063564d1b3e4b41f1d5c9a31f.exe .
The experienced will recognize the name as a MD5 hash , MD5 hashing is commonly used to uniquely identify malware or any exe for that matter .
I will also google search the MD5 hash of the malware to see if anyone else has run across it .
Turns out others have and Anubis has a good analysis of this malware as well .
Anubis reports some of the same activities as we see in our output .
You can also perform a hash search over at virus total , looks like other anti-virus vendors have signatures for this malware .
For the uninformed virus total will query about 40 anti-virus vendors to see which ones have seen it before .
I love malware analysis sites like Anubis and Virus Total but nothing beats performing analysis on a local system .
For example we were able to capture the deleted batch script that the malware executed , below is the output of that batch script .
Granted the batch script is lame , it ’s a very basic script that deletes the malware and deletes itself but the batch script could have contained a lot of useful information .
All deleted or modified files that Capture - Bat sees are located in the following directory .
C: \Program Files \Capture\logs
Below is a screen shot of my deleted files for this malware .
Do n’t forget that Capture - Bat collects pcap ’s during the analysis under the same directory as the deleted malware , see screen shot below .
From a quick google search it does n’t look like that memehehz .
info has a great reputation .
It could be that memehehz .info is a malware site or it could be that memehehz .
info got infected with malware itself .
The malware analyzed here is n’t the most recent malware I simply wanted to walk you through an example and how Capture - Bat can help you in the analysis of what the malware is trying to do .
When it comes to analyzing malware I would n’t say only the tip of the iceberg has been analyzed but there is definitely more to cover .
My main goal was to get others familiar with good malware analysis tools such as Capture - Bat so that they may be better able to react and respond to malicious activity on their own networks .
Hopefully this helped and as always if you have any feedback I ’d love to hear it .
CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF ART / HEINZ FAMILY FUND Charles ' Teenie ' Harris ( 1908 - 1998 ) sitting in chair with his son , Charles Harris Jr. , c. 1930 - 1950 .
Black and white , Agfa Safety Film .
According to those who knew him , the photographer Charles " Teenie " Harris never destroyed a negative .
Working from the period just after the Depression through the civil rights movement , Harris amassed nearly 80,000 images .
Harris 's body of work is considered one of the most important records of 20th century African American life .
But when he died in 1998 , there was something seriously missing from his collection .
Though his photos of celebrities , politicians , and those published in the local newspaper were clearly labeled , tens of thousands of his images–everyday scenes at birthday parties , little league games , church groups –had no titles , no identifying information , no dates .
Enter Carnegie Museum of Art , which purchased Harris 's collection in 2001 .
Since then , the museum 's archivists have scanned and catalogued almost 60,000 photos , releasing many through an online , searchable database .
What stands out about the Harris archive is that it keeps changing .
Not the images themselves , but the titles .
That 's because the museum has collaborated with historians , activists , Harris 's family members , and –most strikingly –community members from Harris 's neighborhood , soliciting any information they can find to help reconstruct the story behind the images .
Using digital tools mixed with old - fashioned neighborhood outreach , the museum is updating an historic collection with huge contemporary significance , in the process redefining a cultural institution 's relationship to its community .
Take this Harris image ( courtesy of Carnegie Museum of Art ) , highlighted in Professor Nicole Fleetwood 's forthcoming book , Troubling Vision ( University of Chicago Press ) , which includes a chapter on Harris .
In the book , Fleetwood says the fact that Harris left images like this one unlabeled is part of what distinguishes his work from the canon of documentary photography , lending the archive a particular kind of intimacy , even in its anonymity .
At first , Fleetwood says the museum called the above image " Children Showered by Fire Hydrant . "
Later , they changed the title to " Group of Children Posed under Shower from Fire Hydrant . "
And then , it became , " Group portrait of children , some in bathing suits , standing on Webster Avenue under spray from fire hose , near Webster Avenue firehouse at Wandless Street , Hill District , August 1947 . "
The archive is full of wordy titles like this one , Fleetwood says .
They can be read like small stories–e.g. , " Woman , Holding Cigarette , and Robin Bullard on her lap , Seated behind sheet cake inscribed ' Happy Birthday Peg ' in kitchen , for birthday party for Margaret Bullard , 2801 Bedford Ave. June 1963 . "
The endless labels are ironic , given that Harris himself was known for his concision , even earning the nickname " One Shot , " a reference to his habit of getting his one picture , then moving on .
There 's a far - flung community that 's forming around Harris 's work that 's not moving on .
They 're connecting his local time and place to a broader world through the Internet , keeping his work relevant through that process .
By adding new information , narrative , context , and memory , they 're co-creating his archive , even all these years later , as an emerging , evolving collection with no end in sight .
An " independent " investigation into the Lower Merion School District laptop scandal has concluded that there 's no evidence that students were being spied on .
This is despite the existence of 58,000 photos surreptitiously taken of students on or around their computers and e-mails between district IT people commenting on the entertainment value of the photos .
The 72 - page report ( PDF ) from law firm Ballard Spahr claims , however , that most of the photos were not seen by anyone and that the district merely failed to implement proper record - keeping procedures .
The report starts out by recounting facts about the district 's policies when issuing laptops to students , offering details about the machines themselves and the acceptable use guidelines that each student is required to sign .
However , the firm notes right away that the district did not adopt official policies when it came to the use of the district 's TheftTrack software — instead , the IT department came up with its own policies " that varied over time and were not followed consistently , " and record - keeping was informal .
As we learned earlier in the case , the IT department was known to activate the webcams on student laptops if they were thought to be stolen or lost , or in some cases , when the student failed to pay the required $ 55 insurance fee in a timely manner .
According to the report , there were " a number of instances " in which the tracking was left active for extended periods of time after a laptop was found or recovered .
As of February 23 of 2010 ( the date the server was shut down and the investigation started ) , there were 30,564 webcam photos and 27,428 screenshots stored by the IT department .
Ballard Spahr admits that there is no way to determine how often the images were viewed , but says it found no evidence that the IT staff had viewed any of the images .
Additionally , it says there was no evidence that district administrators knew how TheftTrack worked or even understood that large numbers of images were being collected in the first place .
This , of course , is the problem : because there was very little record - keeping going on and no official policies , there are few ways to know who knew what and when .
However , claiming that there 's no evidence whatsoever that IT staff saw the images seems disingenuous , considering the fact that e-mail records were dug up last month that showed at least two IT administrators chatting about the photos .
One staffer that has since been put on leave , Carol Cafiero , described the pictures as " a little [ Lower Merion School District ] soap opera , " while another staffer responded , " I know .
I love it ! "
This is on top of the fact that the whole brouhaha was kicked off because a 15 - year - old student was disciplined by the assistant principal of his school for " improper behavior " at home .
The administrator cited a photograph taken from his laptop 's webcam , so it certainly seems as if staffers were aware of the software 's capabilities and were using them to carry out what they considered to be everyday business .
One detail of note is that Ballard Spahr was hired by the Lower Merion School District itself to carry out the investigation , casting doubts on the true " independent " nature of the report .
Still , the firm 's findings place responsibility predominantly on the IT staff , so it does n't let everyone off scot - free .
Higher - level district administrators should be also held responsible to some degree , if only for failing to follow up with IT to ensure that the district 's activities were legal .

McCain , like Arizona , should n’t be singled out for censure :
He is far from alone in cowering before his party ’s extremists .
Neither Mitch McConnell , John Boehner nor Eric Cantor dared say a word against Arizona ’s law .
Mitt Romney , who was mocked during the 2008 campaign for having employed undocumented Guatemalan immigrants as landscapers on his Massachusetts estate , tried to deflect the issue by vacillating ( as usual ) .
So did Mike Huckabee , who told The Dallas Morning News last week that “ it ’s not my place to agree or disagree ” with what happened in Arizona .
If it ’s not the place of a talk - show host and prospective presidential candidate to take a stand on an issue of this moment , whose place is it ?
There are few profiles in courage among the leaders in this G.O.P.  only a lot of guys hiding under their desks .
The one group of Republicans that has been forthright in criticizing the Arizona law is the Bush circle : Jeb Bush , the former speechwriter Michael Gerson , the Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge , the adviser Mark McKinnon and , with somewhat more equivocal language , Karl Rove .
McKinnon and Rove know well that Latino - bashing will ultimately prove political suicide in a century when Hispanic Americans are well on their way to becoming the largest minority in the country and are already the swing voters in many critical states .

The Bushies , however , have no power and no juice in the new conservative order .
The former president is nearly as reviled in some Tea Party circles as Obama is .
Even conservatives as seemingly above reproach as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina now invite the nastiest of blow - back if they fail Tea Party purity tests .
When Graham had the gall to work with Chuck Schumer of New York on an immigration reform bill , the hard - line Americans for Legal Immigration punished him by spreading rumors about his private life as loudly as possible .
Graham has been backing away from supporting the immigration bill ever since .
It ’s harder and harder to cling to the conventional wisdom that the Tea Party is merely an element in the G.O.P. , not the party ’s controlling force  the tail that ’s wagging the snarling dog .
It ’s also hard to maintain that the Tea Party ’s nuttier elements are merely a fringe of a fringe .
The first national Tea Party convention , in Nashville in February , chose as its kickoff speaker the former presidential candidate Tom Tancredo , a notorious nativist who surely was enlisted precisely because he runs around saying things like he has “ no idea where Obama was born . ”
The Times / CBS poll of the Tea Party movement found that only 41 percent of its supporters believe that the president was born in the United States .
The angry right and its apologists also keep insisting that race has nothing to do with their political passions .
Thus Sarah Palin explained that it ’s Obama and the “ lamestream media ” that are responsible for “ perpetuating this myth that racial profiling is a part ” of Arizona ’s law .
So how does that profiling work without race or ethnicity , exactly ?
Brian Bilbray , a Republican Congressman from California and another supporter of the law , rode to the rescue by suggesting “ they will look at the kind of dress you wear . ”
Wise Latinas better start shopping at Talbots !
In this Alice in Wonderland inversion of reality , it ’s politically incorrect to entertain a reasonable suspicion that race may be at least a factor in what drives an action like the Arizona immigration law .
Any racism in America , it turns out , is directed at whites .
Beck called Obama a “ racist . ”
Newt Gingrich called Sonia Sotomayor a “ Latina woman racist . ”
When Obama put up a routine YouTube video calling for the Democratic base to mobilize last week  which he defined as “ young people , African - Americans , Latinos and women ”  the Republican National Committee attacked him for playing the race card .
Presumably the best defense is a good offense when you ’re a party boasting an all - white membership in both the House and the Senate and represented by governors who omit slavery from their proclamations of Confederate History Month .
Flash : NASA 's Cassini Sees Lightning on Saturn
PASADENA , Calif . – NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has captured images of lightning on Saturn .
The images have allowed scientists to create the first movie showing lightning flashing on another planet .
After waiting years for Saturn to dim enough for the spacecraft 's cameras to detect bursts of light , scientists were able to create the movie , complete with a soundtrack that features the crackle of radio waves emitted when lightning bolts struck .
" This is the first time we have the visible lightning flash together with the radio data , " said Georg Fischer , a radio and plasma wave science team associate based at the Space Research Institute in Graz , Austria .
" Now that the radio and visible light data line up , we know for sure we are seeing powerful lightning storms . "
The movie and radio data suggest extremely powerful storms with lightning that flashes as brightly as the brightest super - bolts on Earth , according to Andrew Ingersoll , a Cassini imaging science subsystem team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
" What 's interesting is that the storms are as powerful -- or even more powerful -- at Saturn as on Earth , " said Ingersoll .
" But they occur much less frequently , with usually only one happening on the planet at any given time , though it can last for months . "
The first images of the lightning were captured in August 2009 , during a storm that churned from January to October 2009 and lasted longer than any other observed lightning storm in the solar system .
Results are described in an article accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
To make a video , scientists needed more pictures with brighter lightning and strong radio signals .
Data were collected during a shorter subsequent storm , which occurred from November through mid-December 2009 .
The frames in the video were obtained over 16 minutes on Nov. 30 , 2009 .
The flashes lasted less than one second .
The images show a cloud as long as 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 miles ) across and regions illuminated by lightning flashes about 300 kilometers ( 190 miles ) in diameter .
Scientists use the width of the flashes to gauge the depth of the lightning below the cloud tops .
When lightning strikes on Earth and on Saturn , it emits radio waves at a frequency that can cause static on an AM radio .
The sounds in the video approximate that static sound , based on Saturn electrostatic discharge signals detected by Cassini 's radio and plasma wave science instrument .
Cassini , launched in 1997 , and NASA 's Voyager mission , launched in 1977 , had previously captured radio emissions from storms on Saturn .
A belt around the planet where Cassini has detected radio emissions and bright , convective clouds earned the nickname " storm alley . "
Cassini 's cameras , however , had been unable to get pictures of lightning flashing .
Since Cassini's arrival at Saturn in 2004 , it has been difficult to see the lightning because the planet is very bright and reflective .
Sunlight shining off Saturn 's enormous rings made even the night side of Saturn brighter than a full - moon night on Earth .
Equinox , the period around August 2009 when the sun shone directly over the planet 's equator , finally brought the needed darkness .
During equinox , the sun lit the rings edge - on only and left the bulk of the rings in shadow .
Seeing lightning was another highlight of the equinox period , which already enabled scientists to see clumps in the rings as high as the Rocky Mountains .
" The visible - light images tell us a lot about the lightning , " said Ulyana Dyudina , a Cassini imaging team associate based at Caltech , who was the first to see the flashes .
" Now we can begin to measure how powerful these storms are , where they form in the cloud layer and how the optical intensity relates to the total energy of the thunderstorms . "
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .

" Three strikes " will start striking out the Irish today .
The Irish Times reports that one of the largest ISPs in the country , Eircom , has agreed to process 50 content industry complaints each week , and to disconnect users who rack up three complaints .
The move has been awaited for months .
Eircom voluntarily agreed to the system after being sued by the major music labels , but had yet to implement it while it was challenged on grounds of data privacy .
But IP addresses are n't considered " private , " said the Irish High Court in April , and so Eircom today becomes the only ISP in the country to adopt a graduated response system .
The Irish Times says that this is the first such system in the world , though South Korea has had something similar ( but mandatory ) in place for some time .
France has also approved such a system , but it has yet to take effect .
The system is needed , in the words of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton , because " the mischievous side of the human personality , containing a repulsive aspect as well as an attractive and humorous one , has also come to the fore over the Internet . "
" Adults as well as kids have been caught sharing a giggle as well so we are considering covering the packaging on shelf or even giving the product a new name . "
“ I came in to find the window on the floor and a 1,200 - page manuscript all over the place , ” said Mr. Janssen , director for academic and library marketing at Macmillan .
The 21st floor , which was added in 1905 , three years after the rest was completed , can be reached only by taking a second elevator from the 20th floor .
Though he loves his office , he said it could be a lonely place .
“ You do n’t get a lot of people walking by , ” Mr. Janssen said .
He compares it to being in a situation comedy : “ Guest stars come by every now and then . ”
On the 20th floor , windows are placed much higher up , the bottoms nearly at chest height .
“ I have an incredible view , ” said Charles Bozian , Macmillan ’s vice president for finance and administration .
“ But not unless I stand up . ”
The small bathrooms alternate by floor , men on even , women on odd .
“ And the bathrooms are not very nice , either , ” said Alison Lazarus , the president of Macmillan ’s sales division .
When important guests visit , she has them use the spacious bathroom on the 18th floor , by far the building ’s best , offering a view all the way to New Jersey .
Because the building is narrow , it is flooded with light .
Most employees have windows — big windows , which is a plus for the most part .
John J. Murphy III , director of publicity for St. Martin’s , remembers when he bought new glasses and then came into work .
“ I was sitting at my desk , and everyone kept coming in and looking at me oddly , ” Mr. Murphy said .
He then realized that because of all the light in the building , his tinted lenses never turned clear .
“ I looked like some Greek shipping magnate or shady drug dealer sitting here at my desk , ” he said .
Adobe platform evangelist Lee Brimelow has told Apple to " go screw yourself , " upbraiding the Cupertino cult for banning iPhone and iPad applications translated from code Steve Jobs does n't like .
Such code includes - most famously - Adobe Flash .
Yesterday , Apple released an updated SDK for the upcoming iPhone 4.0 OS , and unlike previous incarnations of the kit , it forbids developers from accessing Apple 's APIs through any sort of intermediary layer that translates code not officially supported by the platform .
" Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) , " reads the new iPhone 4.0 SDK .
This will likely prevent the iPhone packager in Adobe 's Flash Professional CS5 development suite - due for release next week - from converting Flash scripts into native iPhone apps .
Untranslated Flash was already barred from the platform .
AppleInsider cites sources familiar with Apple 's plans in reporting that the company has made the change so it can implement certain " smart " multitasking APIs .
These APIs are designed to pause some apps while other continue to run , the report says , and they would not be able to do with cross-compiled applications .
But Brimelow sees the move as mere Apple pettiness .
In a blog post entitled " Apple Slaps Developers in the Face , " he says :
What they are saying is that they wo n’t allow applications onto their marketplace solely because of what language was originally used to create them .
This is a frightening move that has no rational defense other than wanting tyrannical control over developers and more importantly , wanting to use developers as pawns in their crusade against Adobe I am positive that there are a large number of Apple employees that strongly disagree with this latest move .
Any real developer would not in good conscience be able to support this .
The trouble is that we will never hear their discontent because Apple employees are forbidden from blogging , posting to social networks , or other things that we at companies with an open culture take for granted
Brimelow is n't forbidden from doing so .
But his words are n't unrestricted .
At the request of Adobe , he removed a sentence from his post that speculated on the motives behind the new language in Apple 's iPhone and iPad SDK .
And though for most of his original post , he seemed to be speaking in his official Adobe capacity , he later added a note to the top of the post that reads : " Adobe would like me to make it clear that the opinions below are not the official views of the company and are entirely my own . "
Then , in the last paragraph , he struck through the bit indicating that in previous paragraphs , he'd been speaking for Adobe :
Now let me put aside my role as an official representative of Adobe for a moment as Speaking purely for myself , I would look to make it clear what is going through my mind at the moment .
Go screw yourself Apple .
Earlier in the post , Brimelow - and apparently not Adobe - says that his company would never stoop to Apple 's level .
" The fact that Apple would make such a hostile and despicable move like this clearly shows the difference between our two companies , " he writes .
" All we want is to provide creative professionals an avenue to deploy their work to as many devices as possible .
We are not looking to kill anything or anyone .
This would be like us putting something in our SDK to make it impossible for 3rd - party editors like FDT to work with our platform .
I can tell you that we would n’t even think or consider something like that . "
He says that Adobe has no intention of pulling its products from other Apple platforms .
But personally , he intends to abandon the company entirely .
" I will not be giving Apple another cent of my money until there is a leadership change over there .
I ’ve already moved most of my book , music , and video purchases to Amazon and I will continue to look elsewhere .
" Now , I want to be clear that I am not suggesting you do the same and I ’m also not trying to organize some kind of boycott .
Me deciding not to give money to Apple is not going to do anything to their bottom line .
But this is equivalent to me walking into Macy ’s to buy a new wallet and the salesperson spits in my face .
Chances are I wo n’t be buying my wallets at Macy ’s anymore , no matter how much I like them . " ®
Name three games off the top of your head where a police officer plays a positive protagonist role .
Recently I asked a few of my gamer friends to do just that .
No one could name three .
Resident Evil 2 is a good answer .
Leon Kennedy is definitely shown as the hero of the game on his first day on duty as a Raccoon City Police Officer .
Max Payne does n’t quite cut it since Max is an incredibly dark and negative character .
Heavy Rain was close too , but the only positive law enforcement officer shown in the game is Norman Jayden .
He ’s FBI .
The actual police in the game are shown as either overly - violent by roughing up witnesses or incompetent by trampling through crime scenes .
So , without googling , did you honestly come up with three examples ?
If so , kudos !
If not ( and be honest with yourself ) , do you see that as a problem ?
Ever since our infancy , we ’re taught that the police are the good guys .
We ’re told that if we ’re ever lost , we should find a police officer .
If we see a burglar break into our homes or we see anyone in trouble , we dial 911 and ask for the police .
We played “ Cops and Robbers ” when we were kids .
We had toy police cars .
In our youthful minds , police were unquestionably always the hero .
But there ’s something odd about video games where police are more often than not , shown as the villain .
Certainly the military and the FBI get their fair share of playing the role of the devil .
But the FBI and the military have an air of sexiness to them .
The high tech gizmos found in Condemned : Criminal Origins and cool military phrasing like “ we ’re Oscar Mike to the next base ” from Battlefield Bad Company 2 make gamers feel kinda special .
But it ’s regular police that are vilified most of the time .
I ca n’t help but wonder why that is .
I understand fully that escapism is probably the # 1 reason why we game .
Hell knows I ’m guilty of lining up a good pile of police cars in GTA IV and launching an RPG into the center of their blue mass .
There ’s no denying it .
It ’s a ton of fun to play the role of the criminal since in our every day lives we ’re living under social laws and constructs .
So if given the opportunity to really let loose in a virtual world , most of us will !
My question to you is n’t , “ why are we always playing the role of the villain ? ”
Instead , my question is “ Why are n’t we ever playing the role of the unsung beat cops ? ”
Police officers are almost a near - perfect role to play .
They live normal routine lives like our own , yet they are sometimes known for acts of great heroism .
They ’re armed .
Most are in shape .
Depending on where you live , some of them have pretty sweet squad cars .
But game makers have somehow missed all this potential .
So where are all the cop games ?
As I look to other entertainment mediums , there ’s no shortage of regular cops that are shown as heroes .
Television alone has NYPD Blue , The Shield , Law & Order , CSI : New York , CSI : Miami , Justified , … CHiPs .
The show COPS has been running since 1989 !
We have an entire “ Police Drama ” genre .
And if for some drag - addled reason you ca n’t think of any movie where a regular cop plays the role of a near superhero , I have two words for you : Die Hard .
Hell , I ’ll toss two more words at you : Rush Hour !
There are tons of fantastic cop movies : Beverly Hills Cop , Scorpio , Police Story , Crime Story , The Thin Blue Line , Lethal Weapon , uhm … .
Turner & Hooch ...
I ’d love to play a modern adaptation of Die Hard .
It could be part Splinter Cell , part Batman : Arkham Asylum .
We seem to have nailed the buddy routine with Army of Two , so why ca n’t we have something similar with cops ?
Cops in video games are often the villain .
They ’re shown as being crooked to the point where they make the actual criminals seems likable .
Francis McReary is the perfect example of this in Grand Theft Auto IV .
Francis is so smarmy , he makes his addict brother Derrick seem like a sweet fellow .
And if they are n’t villainous , then they ’re seen as helpless as they run away in the classic “ scared NPC ” run with their hands over their heads and running as low to the ground as possible .
Or the police get in the way of you doing your super duty or stealth mission .
They ’re in your way and prevent you from really letting loose on your enemy .
I ca n’t speak for everyone , but I would love a police sim game .
I tend to be a bit of a sim addict , Roller Coaster Tycoon nearly stole a few years of my college career .
Train Simulator is a runaway success .
But when you put “ trains ” next to “ cops ” … which would you rather play as ?
Cops !
I would knock people over to get my hands on a Grand Theft Auto - styled game where you take back the streets and face off with dangerous gangs .
I loved Heavy Rain .
I could have done without some of the overly - stereotypical character archetypes , but I ’d sell my neighbor ’s noisy dog ’s soul to get some more games in that vein .
I want to play “ Cops and Robbers ” again , but as an adult !
True Crime by Activision looks like it has some strong potential .
But ONE police game is n’t going to cut it .
It still feels like this is a relatively untapped well of inspiration that developers could be drawing from instead of giving us yet another sequel .
Did we need another Bioshock and God of War ?
Do we need another Gears of War so soon ?
Because I can wait longer .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The Cleveland school board went budget cutting on a grand scale Tuesday , approving layoffs for about 10 percent of its 8,000 employees .
True to forecasts , the board voted to lay off 545 teachers and 117 support staff , effective in June .
To that were added more than 100 principals and assistant principals .
Six of the eight board members present voted to approve separate resolutions to lay off teachers , support personnel and administrators .
The board made its decision after meeting privately for more than an hour .
During that time , teachers stood and loudly sang " We Shall Not be Moved " and other songs .
The seniority - based layoffs would knock out scores of newer teachers , who were handpicked for 10 district innovation schools created in recent years .
Chief Executive Officer Eugene Sanders said the single - gender and other specialty schools could lose half of their staffs .
A science , technology , engineering and math high school , Design Lab Early College , would lose all of its teachers .
Those specialty schools are where the district has seen the kind of academic success it hopes to replicate through a sweeping " transformation plan " to be implemented next school year .
" My reaction is that of absolute dismay at both the layoff news generally , but in particular at the devastation that will cause at schools that are working , " said Ann Mullin , who oversees education programs for the George Gund Foundation .
The Gund and Cleveland foundations have invested millions in the specialty schools .
Mullin encouraged Cleveland residents to call legislators and complain about a state law that requires the newest teachers to be laid off first .
" There 's something wrong when a state law forces removal of teachers without regard to their effectiveness in the classroom , " she said .
The job loss district - wide could grow if the ax sweeps through smaller unions and the central office .
The job cuts , along with 16 building closings , will help avoid a $ 53 million deficit predicted for next school year .
As hundreds of teachers watched grimly Tuesday night from the board auditorium and two overflow areas , Sanders pointed out that districts across the country are struggling financially -- closing buildings and paring staff to stay afloat amid the economic downturn and declining enrollment .
A report released this month by the American Association of School Administrators , based on a survey of 453 administrators in 45 states , found that 68 percent of them cut jobs in 2009 - 2010 .
Ninety percent expect to cut staff , many of them teachers , in 2010 - 2011 .
Sanders acknowledged that the Cleveland cuts could push the size of some classes to more than 40 students .
Special education , which suffers from a shortage of teachers , and kindergarten through third grade , where the district and union have agreed on a cap of 20 children per class , would be spared .
The CEO said the teachers could blunt losses or avoid them altogether by considering solutions such as pay cuts and changes in health care coverage .
A 4.6 percent pay cut , the same as what the district 's nonunion employees are taking , would save $ 17 million a year , Sanders said .
That would nearly cover the gap remaining after the school closings , nonunion furlough days and use of $ 15 million in federal stimulus money are factored in .
" This is a fixable problem .
We continue to explore options that will allow us to reverse the difficult course of action we are forced to take this evening , " Sanders said Tuesday night .
Normal attrition , averaging about 150 teachers a year , could reduce the number of layoffs .
Sanders said he will consider a union - proposed " separation plan " that teachers say would save the district nearly $ 20 million a year .
Terms have not been disclosed .
Teachers union President David Quolke urged the board to take more time and consider alternatives to layoffs .
He said the administration and board had created the crisis by waiting to address a problem that they have been aware of for nearly a year .
" When you vote tonight , you can continue to rubberstamp for the policies of this administration or you can vote with a clear understanding that your vote will impact hundreds of Cleveland classrooms and thousands of Cleveland 's children , " Quolke said .
Teachers stood and cheered as Quolke spoke .
Harriet Applegate , executive secretary of the North Shore AFL - CIO Federation of Labor , also accused the district of being hasty .
" Why would you lay off teachers without exploring every possible option ? " she said .
" This is unbelievable . "
The teachers ' contract allows the district to lay them off with 30 working days ' notice .
Serving notice now would allow the layoffs to take effect at the end of the school year .
Word of the layoffs come as children in the district are taking state achievement tests .
Sanders called on teachers to put aside distractions and carry on with the exams .
The principals and assistant principals on the layoff list preside over chronically low - performing schools .
Sanders said they can apply for other administrative positions with the district .
Lee Anne Chambers , a teacher at Denison Elementary School , was among more than 1,000 teachers laid off in 2004 .
With 10 years of experience , she found out Tuesday night that she would be out of work again .
But Chambers was also worried Tuesday about her principal , Leslie Rotatori - Tranter , and assistant principal , Alvin Nix , who also are on the layoff list .
" You do n't have a more dynamic duo , " she said .
" They can read each other 's minds .
I could n't ask for more support as a teacher . "
A new school board policy spells out the reasons the district can cite in suspending administrators ' contracts .
The policy also sets criteria for restoring contracts .
It includes seniority but also lists success of students and potentially subjective standards of " leadership , integrity , professionalism and judgment . "
The Cleveland Council of Administration and Supervisors accused the district of reneging on a promise to cut by seniority .
It sent a letter to schools lawyer Stephen DeVita before the policy was approved , calling the measure vague and saying it opened the door for favoritism .
" Simply put , the rules have changed , in what appears to be a way to benefit our CEO in his efforts to maintain the staff he has recruited during his tenure , " the letter said .

By itself , task manager GQueues is pretty handy — a list - oriented task manager with sub-tasks , due dates , assignments , tagging , and other neat features .
But its integration with Google sign - in , Calendar , and Google Apps make it more than just another to - do app .

Central Asia -- Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan -- is insecure .
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have ethnic kin fighting in Afghanistan who might target repressive rulers at home .
The extremist Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan is becoming more threatening .
The recent cessation of U.S. support for eradicating poppy fields in Afghanistan will spur narcotics trafficking via Central Asia .
Economic challenges and rampant corruption undermine security .
The area is rich in oil and gas mainly in the Caspian region and America and its companies have an important stake in the development of its huge oil reserves and diversification of world oil supplies .
That said , high unemployment and dashed expectations in impoverished Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan could provoke social explosions .
Most people in Turkmenistan remain poor despite its huge natural gas reserves .
In Kazakhstan oil development raises many but not all living standards .
A major Central Asia security initiative – made more urgent by developments in Kyrgyzstan – could offer content worthy of a summit .

Regional animosities also impede development .
Desiccation of the Aral Sea , shared by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , endangers agriculture , the environment , and health .
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan use only a small fraction of their hydroelectric potential .
Uzbekistan , their stronger neighbour , demands water for irrigation but wastes a lot .
Finally , lack of respect for human rights and poor governance undermine security .
The rule of law is a distant hope .
In Uzbekistan , torture is widespread .
Human Rights
Watch calls Turkmenistan one of the most repressive countries in the world .
Central Asians need better security .
It would help stabilize northern Afghanistan , defeat violent extremists , staunch illicit trafficking , protect supplies bound for Afghanistan , and facilitate legal transportation and migration .
These steps would also benefit Russia and the West .
Russia has no right to coercive “ privileged interests ” in Central Asia but it does have legitimate interests .
Half of Russia ’s many foreign migrants come from Central Asia .
In Kazakhstan , Russia uses the Baikonur cosmodrome and conducts military testing .
Narcotics transiting Central Asia feed crime and addiction in Russia .
Except to support operations in Afghanistan , the West largely treats Central Asia with benign neglect .
The EU excludes the region from its neighbourhood policy but provides some assistance .
The NATO Partnership for Peace programme offers limited training and exercises .
Threats to Central Asia justify far greater exertions .
Russia might agree .
Foreign Minister Lavrov has called for the OSCE to create counter - drug belts around Afghanistan .
The OSCE could indeed play a valuable role .
It has unmatched skill in fostering regional cooperation .
The OSCE approach of comprehensive security - politico - military , economic and environmental , and human - is well suited to Central Asia ’s woes and all five countries are members .
The OSCE has significant ground presence in each country and modest but popular projects , such as border security training and a higher education academy .
The time is ripe for the West and Russia to empower the OSCE to support Central Asia as its top priority .
Kazakhstan , the Chair - in - Office this year , seeks this and is pressing for an OSCE summit , the first in over a decade .
A major Central Asia security initiative could offer content worthy of a summit .
First , the initiative should help governments improve threat awareness , lessen security vulnerabilities , and enhance warning of potential conflicts .
Training and transparency measures to fight security force corruption make sense .
Second , the initiative ought to facilitate regional transportation and cooperation on water use and hydroelectric generation .
Development of common principles and proposals would be a good start .
Establishment of an intra-Caspian freight carrier could expand trade .
International support for cooperation in the region has proven its worth .
The U.S. facilitated a new export pipeline across Russia for Kazakhstani oil , and a pipeline has just opened for Turkmenistan to export gas to China .
Third , the initiative should expand the OSCE ’s solid leadership in fighting human trafficking , both forced labour and forced prostitution .
It is a significant problem in Central Asia , as victims are exploited within the region and also recruited from within the region for exploitation in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia .
In a departure , the OSCE might also help mobilize support for public health campaigns , such as battling TB .
Improvements in minority and religious tolerance and human rights may be harder to achieve but more likely to emerge as comprehensive security improves rather than through forced linkages .
The OSCE should begin by launching an intensive dialogue with its sometimes fractious Central Asian members .
They lack a good understanding of what the OSCE can do for them as members .
They tend see it as a foreign organization that only criticizes them and thus are reluctant for the OSCE to become more active in the region .
To help turn this around and build support , an informal group of Friends of the Chair - in - Office should be formed – the troika ( preceding , current , and subsequent Chairs - in - Office ) , and the EU , France , Germany , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
Some momentum for an OSCE summit is building but hour is late .
At the global nuclear security summit in Washington in early April , the Friends should begin organizing and developing a Central Asian security initiative suitable for an OSCE Summit .

Milton Friedman has been dead for more than three years .
But his spirit was surely hovering protectively over Chile in the early morning hours of Saturday .
Thanks largely to him , the country has endured a tragedy that elsewhere would have been an apocalypse .
It 's not by chance that Chileans were living in houses of brick — and Haitians in houses of straw — when the wolf arrived to try to blow them down .
In 1973 , the year the proto -Chavista government of Salvador Allende was overthrown by Gen. Augusto Pinochet , Chile was an economic shambles .
Inflation topped out at an annual rate of 1000 % , foreign - currency reserves were totally depleted , and per capita GDP was roughly that of Peru and well below Argentina's .
What Chile did have was intellectual capital , thanks to an exchange program between its Catholic University and the economics department of the University of Chicago , then Friedman 's academic home .
Even before the 1973 coup , several of Chile 's " Chicago Boys " had drafted a set of policy proposals which amounted to an off - the - shelf recipe for economic liberalization : sharp reductions to government spending and the money supply ; privatization of state - owned companies ; the elimination of obstacles to free enterprise and foreign investment , and so on .
A new tongue - in - cheek ad from John McCain ’s Senate campaign has the Arizona lawmaker ’s leading Republican primary opponent , J.D. Hayworth , declaring that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya , believing that vampires are real and preparing for an alien invasion .
“ I’m J.D. Hayworth and I ’m running for US Senate to take on the pressing challenges facing Arizona , America and indeed the entire human race , ” the ad — paid for by McCain ’s campaign — begins .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ First , I ’ve committed to exposing the secret Kenyan birthplace of the president of the United States , ” the fake “ Hayworth ” declares as footage from Disney ’s The Lion King rolls on the video .
“ Second , I ’ve stood up against the grave threat of man -horse marriage .
Third , I believe that Dracula is real . ”
The ad concludes with “ Hayworth ” declaring that he is preparing to tackle “ our most critical national security threat ” as footage of the alien - invasion movie Mars Attacks rolls on screen .
Much of the ad mocks the less - than - flattering media attention Hayworth , a former GOP House member and conservative talk show host in Phoenix , has received in recent weeks .
Last month he drew criticism when he told an Orlando radio station that Massachusetts ’ law allowing gay marriage “ would mean if you really had affection for your horse , I guess you could marry your horse . ”
Hayworth , who is trailing McCain in the polls but is considered the favored candidate among Tea Party Republicans , appeared on MSNBC in January and demanded that the president should “ come forward ” with his birth certificate , a move that had him labeled as being firmly in the “ birther ” camp .
ADVERTISEMENT
But it was a joke by a former Arizona attorney general that got Hayworth labeled , fairly or otherwise , as a believer in vampires .
“ Someone needs to drive a wooden stake through [ Hayworth ’s ] heart , ” joked Grant Woods in a recent Newsweek interview .
“ This cavalier death threat that he issued is over the top , ” Hayworth responded , adding that making a “ death threat ” in a national magazine is “ beyond the pale . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ No , J.D. , unless you are in fact a vampire , interpreting an innocent reference to pop-culture as a death threat is what ’s ‘ beyond the pale , ' ” quipped blogger James King at the Phoenix New Times .
In the latest poll , McCain is solidly leading Hayworth by a margin of 15 percentage points .
But news analysts suggest the longtime senator , known for being a moderate , is taking the threat from Tea Party challengers seriously , which may explain his recent reversals on some issues .
ADVERTISEMENT
Most recently , McCain declared he had “ never considered ” himself a “ maverick ” — this despite the fact the word was practically the senator ’s catch - phrase when he ran for president in 2008 .
“ Considering just how quickly McCain himself has dropped pretenses of political moderation ( denying , for example , that he every called himself a maverick ) , it takes a certain amount of chutzpah for him to accuse his opponent of lacking seriousness , ” writes Sam Stein at the Huffington Post .
“ But Hayworth has made the case easy — certainly with his dabbling in birther conspiracies .
And in the process , he ’s demonstrating just how hard it is to walk the line between Tea Party activism and sensible conservatism . ”

In Dedication to Grassroots Following is the dedication of the final Jets media guide , which details the failed efforts in the spring of 1995 to save the Jets :
On Wednesday , May 3 , 1995 , Winnipeg local investors known as the Manitoba Entertainment Complex Inc. ( MEC ) announced that they would not exercise their option to purchase the Winnipeg Jets and build a multi- purpose facility that would keep the club in Winnipeg .
The end was certain .
The future was bleak .
The Jets , an integral part of Manitoba 's way of life for over 23 years , were destined to be sold .
Due to the MEC 's inability to come up with an economically viable solution to keep the team in Winnipeg , the Jets organization was left with no alternative but to accept reality and stage a proper farewell to the players , fans and the team 's logo .
The highlight of the event would be to say good - bye to Thomas Steen , the player who dedicated his entire career to the Jets and the city of Winnipeg .
The Jets organized a ceremony that was held on May 6 , 1995 at the Winnipeg Arena that paid tribute to Jets ' players , staff , management , coaches , but most importantly the Jets ' fans , who had proved over the years that they were , without question , the most loyal and dedicated in the entire NHL .
Over 16,000 fans turned up on Maroons Road to say goodbye to their heroes and spend a few last moments in the building that had provided them with so many bittersweet memories over the years .
Children , teenagers , adults and grandparents witnessed a spectacular farewell that included an appearance by Hockey Night in Canada 's Don Cherry .
Cherry praised Jets fans , calling them the best in the world , and commended them for their tremendous support throughout the years .
He complimented Thomas Steen on his remarkable career and encouraged fans not to give up hope and keep their dream alive that the team would remain in Winnipeg .
The afternoon was extremely emotional .
Cheers turned to boos as a banner with the Jets ' logo commemorating 23 years of professional hockey in Winnipeg ( 1972 -1995 ) was raised to the roof of the Winnipeg Arena .
There were tears of joy and sorrow .
The people were left stunned in disbelief .
Could this really be it ?
Would this be the last time they assembled in this old barn for a Jets ' event ?
Thomas Steen 's jersey retirement was the climax of the afternoon .
The veteran of 14 NHL seasons had come to represent everything good the Jets organization had stood for : loyalty , commitment to excellence , hard work , dedication , and pride .
Steen did everything you could ask for from a player and deserved the recognition and adulation that he received .
Everyone cheered as his familiar # 25 jersey was raised to the Arena rafters .
Steen , accompanied by his family , teammates , and management stood in awe of the spectacle .
When he signed his first pro contract in 1981 , Steen expected to play three seasons in the NHL before returning to his native Sweden .
He never would have imagined that he would play 14 years with the same organization that drafted him , and amass an incredible 264- 553 - 817 in 950 NHL games .
Steen 's 14 years with the Jets were second only to Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins in years of service to one NHL franchise .
The moment his jersey was raised to the ceiling of the Winnipeg Arena , one of the worst days in Steen 's life became one of his best .
He was overcome with pride .
The veteran had been so upset with the prospect of the team leaving the city that he became ill the day before the ceremony .
Later , after the ceremony was completed , he still had hope that the team would stay and that a new arena would be built .
The ceremony seemed to ignite the people of Manitoba .
There were feelings of anger , disappointment , and frustration that seemed to fuel the public .
The Blue Ribbon campaign , which had been instrumental to the dream of keeping the Jets in Winnipeg , gained momentum .
Fans started looking for ways to contribute to keep the team in the city .
The people had always wanted the team to stay , but were never able to visibly show their support .
The onus was always on the politicians and the business leaders .
The people needed a cause , a movement , a campaign .
Then on May 9 , 1995 , Operation Grassroots began .
In an effort to persuade government and local buyers to construct a new arena and keep the Jets alive , a movement began .
The public was asked to step forward and put their collective money where their mouths were .
The response was overwhelming .
Spurred by local radio station CJOB ( 680 AM ) , fans were encouraged to contribute anything they had to the Grassroots campaign through a four - day on - air telethon to help " Save the Jets " .
A phenomenal outpouring of support followed .
Calls came in from around Canada and the world .
Jets ' fans from England , Japan , Australia as well as the U.S. and Canada called in and contributed to the cause .
Through the efforts of CJOB , approximately $ 5 million was raised from the general public .
The culmination of this movement was a rally held at the Forks ( a central gathering place in the downtown of the city ) on May 16 , 1995 .
An amazing turnout of over 35,000 fans were in attendance to show their support for the club .
Bands played , speeches were made , donations were collected and in the end , over $ 250,000 was raised towards the purchase of the team .
Jets ' GM John Paddock and players Keith Tkachuk , Teemu Selanne , Kris King and Randy Gilhen were present at the rally .
After witnessing the incredible outpouring of emotion and support , Paddock said " You just ca n't imagine what it 's like unless you 're here . "
Selanne added , " This city deserves a hockey team .
This is great .
If this works out , it will be unbelievable how strong this city is going to be . "
The following night , a hockey social ( a traditional Winnipeg fund - raising event ) was planned at the Winnipeg Convention Centre .
Over 2,500 Jets faithful flocked to the Convention Centre and paid $ 100 each to help save the Jets.
Festivities included live bands , player appearances , and a silent auction which generated additional funds for the project .
In the end , over $ 13.5 million was raised in Operation Grassroots .
What the people of Manitoba accomplished was something unique and truly remarkable .
Never before in the history of the city , the province or the country had a community responded in this fashion .
On August 14 , 1995 , the group known as The Spirit of Manitoba ( a group of private investors developed out of MEC ) announced , however , that they were unable to raise sufficient capital to proceed with the purchase of the Jets .
With no alternative options available , Jets ' Owner and President Barry Shenkarow announced that he would being seeking a buyer for the team , and confirmed the worst nightmare of Jets ' fans , that 1995 - 96 would be the final season for the Jets in Winnipeg .
As a way of showing our appreciation to the thousands of fans who demonstrated their support throughout Operation Grassroots , the Winnipeg Jets Hockey Club would like dedicate this final media guide to Jets ' fans , the best in the National Hockey League .

The FIA was originally scheduled to inspect the car before flying to Bahrain , but that had to be delayed until today .
The MP4 - 25 , however , was given the all - clear by the FIA stewards ahead of tomorrow 's practice sessions .

Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose book " Late Edition : A Love Story " will be published in a new paperback edition this week .
( CNN ) --
When 4 - year - old Ethan Stacy was reluctantly sent off to spend the summer with his mother late last month , he was in effect being given a death sentence .
The child never had a chance .
He was dead within two weeks of arriving at the apartment in Layton , Utah , where his mother lived with her fiancé .
What could have been done to save him ?
" I do n't have a good answer for you , " Layton police Lt. Garret Atkin , one of many law enforcement officers in Davis County , Utah , who are grieving for the boy who lived among them so briefly , told me .
The facts of what happened to Ethan speak for themselves :
He was living with his father , Joe G. Stacy , in Richlands , Virginia .
Stacy and his estranged wife , Stephanie , were involved in divorce proceedings .
The divorce was being adjudicated in Florida , where they had lived before she moved west .
Joe Stacy , in a divorce court filing last November , warned of his fears .
His estranged wife was " unstable , " he wrote to the court : " The mother has abandoned the child and I 'm afraid the mother will come and take him and I 'll never see him again . "
But the judge in the divorce case , Maura T. Smith , told The Associated Press that she never read the filing .
Judge Smith said that Ethan 's parents had worked out a settlement , including shared custody , and that the finalization of their divorce last month was " cut and dried . "
Part of the decree was that Ethan would live with his dad during the school year , and with his mother during the summer .
The child reportedly did not want to go to Utah with her .
" I did not want him to go , and he did n't want to go at all , " Joe Stacy told the Salt Lake Tribune .
" He kept telling me he did n't want to go . "
But in late April , the divorce agreement newly in effect , the boy was put on a plane to fly to Utah with his mother .
What allegedly happened next is described in affidavits prepared by the Layton Police Department :
Ethan , his mother and her fiancé , Nathan Sloop , began living in their Layton home .
On May 5 , Nathan Sloop , 31 , took the 4 - year - old child into a bedroom and began slapping and hitting him on the face and head , police said .
Ethan 's face began to swell .
Police said his mother did not alert anyone or seek medical attention for her son .
On May 6 , the couple went to the county courthouse in Farmington , Utah , to get married .
They did not bring Ethan with them .
The reason , according to police , was that they were " afraid to take him out in public with the swelling and bruising to his face , " because they thought that if anyone saw Ethan 's injuries , they would call authorities .
So , police detectives said , they removed the inside doorknob of the bedroom where they left Ethan , so he could not get out .
For the next three days , police said , Ethan was vomiting , was lethargic , had a fever , and was not able to eat .
His symptoms were consistent with a possible brain injury .
Instead of trying to help the child , Nathan Sloop engaged in " a systematic and progressively more violent pattern of abuse . "
But no one knew .
Joe Stacy had called his son every day after the child had been sent to Utah , but he told the Salt Lake Tribune that beginning on May 5 , his former wife began to make excuses on the phone for why the boy could not talk to him .
" I never did get a call back , " Stacy told the paper .
On May 7 , police said , Stephanie Sloop returned home from shopping to find that Ethan had been scalded on his feet , legs and buttocks .
Nathan Sloop said the boy had burned himself in the bathtub .
Joe Stacy continued to try to call his son , but to no avail .
On May 9 -- Mother 's Day -- Ethan was found dead in his bed .
Police said that Nathan and Stephanie Sloop did not notify anyone , but instead began " to formulate a plan to dispose of the body and deceive law enforcement . "
The couple , according to police , wrapped garbage bags around the child 's body and drove to Powder Mountain .
Police said Nathan Sloop took a hammer to Ethan 's face and teeth , in an effort to make him unrecognizable should anyone ever find him .
The boy was then buried .
Late the next night , Stephanie Sloop reported the child missing .
She told the Layton police that Ethan had walked away from home .
Some 40 officers , in foul weather , searched for the child .
But before long the Sloops ' story began to fall apart .
Late on the afternoon of May 11 , officers digging in the mud recovered his body .
Nathan and Stephanie Sloop are being held in the Davis County Jail .
He is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder , felony child abuse , obstruction of justice and desecration of a corpse .
She is being held on suspicion of felony child abuse , obstruction of justice and desecration of a corpse .
The Davis County prosecutor , Troy Rawlings , told me that he will file formal charges by next Friday , when the Sloops are scheduled to appear in court .
The body of Ethan Stacy , who had never wanted to leave his father in the first place , was flown back to Virginia last week .
That is where , with summer coming , he was buried , this time with dignity and with love .

The bacon - and - cheese - stuffed KFC Double Down made fast - food history by replacing the standard sandwich bun with two hunks of fried chicken .
Introduced nationwide on Monday , the Double Down has taken America -- and the blogosphere -- by storm .
We may never be the same .
Here 's what this all - American sandwich is revealing about society .
We Are the Double Down The Awl 's David Cho concludes , " America , we did it !
We , like the Double Down , are pretty much exactly what people think we are . "
He adds , " What I 'd point to as the major flaw in this sandwich — in its underlying principle , really — is that both varieties of chicken , particularly the fried , out - muscle and overpower the rest of the sandwich with the intense taste of saltiness . "
' Dumbly , ' Shockingly Bold Salon 's Francis Lam declares , " the Double Down , and everybody 's peeking - through - covered - eyes reaction to it , is not about logic .
It 's about balls .
...
The Double - D is so macho , so deeply , dumbly dude , it 's a sandwich for people who want to take down Michelle Obama in an arm wrestle . "
The really funny thing about the Double Down is not that it exists , not that it 's a dare pretending to be a lunch , but that it would be nothing special if they added a bun to it .
Think about it .
It 'd be like , " What 's that ?
A double chicken sandwich ?
Pffft. Snooze .
Any jackass can make a double chicken sandwich . "
Somehow , by taking off the processed - food bread , KFC made this thing look deadly .
With Inventive Past Behind Us , Accepting Our Mediocrity Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker suggests Americans have " accepted " the Double Down in " Much the way the remaining American Idol contestants accepted the challenge of performing Elvis Presley songs .
...
Me , I respect Elvis in his prime the way I respect McDonald ’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese : brilliant American inventiveness . "
Awed , Horrified by Our Own Gluttony The Palm Beach New Times ' John Linn explains , " people are both incensed and enticed by the egregiousness of a sandwich in which the buns have been replaced by fried chicken .
The fact that it 's filled with both bacon and cheese pushes that button even more . "
The Recession 's Toll on Food Conservative blogger Allahpundit asks if our spiraling standards have hit a new low .
" If tough economic times influence men ’s tastes in women , is n’t it possible that they influence our tastes in food too ?
Without the recession , the Double Down might never have happened .
Silver lining ! "

There is only one thing that we do well here , and only one product that is of any worth .
You can get other things at other places , at better prices and higher qualities .
Better shows .
Better food .
Better accommodations .
Better networking .
Better atmosphere .
We 've tried the business plan of Alice 's Restaurant , but it did n't work .
No , here , you can't get everything you want .
No Starbucks in the atrium .
No concerts or productions .
No motivational talks or self - improvement or meditation podcasts .
No gourmet dinners and a chance to rub elbows with the high - and - mighty's .
No healthclubs or consciousness - raising marches for the fashionably oppressed or picketing soldier funerals .
No permission slips for conspicuous consumption or up - to - date assumptions ( and situations of convenience ) .
I 've done research on my marketing segment : we 're blown out of the water on every index of " felt needs . "
Child care is better somewhere else .
The air conditioning is better .
The music is better .
The theater is far more entertaining .
Potential clients go elsewhere to find complete acceptance , and permission to remain as they are : there is , here , a pressure to change .
Accordingly , we 're going out of business , and we 're certainly not too big to fail .
We 'll stay open but the sale is shut down .
We have " focused " our business model .
There is only one " thing " left on the shelves .
Salvation .
Salvation from hell .
Salvation , more importantly , to be like Him .
Deification , in a word .
If you want this , then come here and fast .
Come here and learn to stamp out your passions ( which are , each one , a rehearsal of perdition ) .
Come here and force your brain into Nicaean and Chalcedonian molds .
Come here and take the word " sinner " as your personal ward and savor .
Come here and run away from ecstasy , take divine sweetness instead for the mundanities of the vale and blessing for the journey .
Come here and embrace the Cross , instead of a visitor 's badge .
Take the Eucharist instead of a brochure .
That 's my commercial , my billboard , my ad campaign .
I do not understand how or why anyone would want to be religious without being concerned about perdition .
Theology is meaningless unless you know yourself as a sinner and want to be a Christian .
Theology is useless unless you pine for a cool drop of water on your tongue .
And " sin " is an utterly absurd concept unless you are interested in salvation .
If you are interested , you will recognize sin as necrosis , and you will stand outside the village and look for the Son of David to come by some day .
Being a Christian means that there is no way you can think about God without Christ : Christ is the only image you have of God the Holy Trinity .
Christ is the only means , also , by which you can think of divinity at all .
I understand that " salvation " is old - fashioned sounding , and is probably a word held in great contempt , because it is predicated on the possibility of perdition .
If perdition is not a possibility in your construct of the world , then by all means dismiss salvation , sin and Christian theology .
Theology is a waste of time if there is nothing you fear .
Religion becomes damnation outside of the desperation for the Cross .
Theologizing without begging for salvation is useless : you wo n't like it , or anything of the Holy Trinity , or especially the Cross , at all .
Our business plan is wrecked , after all .
Very few talk about hell and death in a way that they want to be saved from it : they are too interested in prosecuting God for crimes of disaster and unease .
We , on the other hand , have stocked our shelves with other things , and the agora has simply passed us by and left us obsolete .
It is Holy Week , and we must be grave , solitary , the crowds will turn .
We are out of business , the den of thieves is closed .
Back to the House of Prayer .
Game
Table will surely join a legion of games on Apple 's iPad , but it is worth a mention here as it stands out in one rather unusual way : it does n't actually do anything .
Game
Table is just like a real world game table , and comes with boards and pieces for checkers and chess , along with a deck of cards .
After that , its up to you .
The game provides nothing but a physics engine to let you move the pieces , and to shuffle , deal and flip cards .
It 's up to you what game you play , and whether you follow the rules or break them .
It is also , like the real - world versions of these games , a two - player experience .
If you want to play alone , you 'd better enjoy solitaire :

A letter from Soviet secret police chief Beria was among the files published Russia has published online once - secret files on the 1940 Katyn massacre , in which some 22,000 members of the Polish elite were killed by Soviet forces .
The state archive said the " Packet No. 1 " original files had until now only been available to researchers .
The Soviet Union denied its role in the massacre for decades .
But relations between Russia and Poland have warmed since the Polish president and others were killed in a plane crash on their way to a Katyn commemoration .
The six documents that were published on the state archive website were declassified in 1992 on the order of the then - Russian president , Boris Yeltsin .
Current President Dmitry Medvedev had now ordered their publication online , the state archive said .
' Symbolic gesture '
One of the documents is a 5 March , 1940 letter from the then - head of the Soviet secret police or NKVD , Lavrenty Beria , to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin , recommending the execution of Polish prisoners of war .
ANALYSIS Adam Easton , BBC News , Warsaw
The publication of the Katyn documents on Russia 's state archive website has been warmly welcomed by Polish authorities .
" It 's yet another symbolic step testifying to the fact that we are witnessing an obvious change in the Russian attitude and handling of the Katyn issue , " Polish foreign ministry spokesman Piotr Paszkowski told the BBC .
Polish historians said the Russian president 's decision was an attempt to end persistent speculation in Russia that the massacre was in fact committed by Nazi Germany .
German troops uncovered the first mass grave in Katyn in 1943 .
It 's certainly another gesture from the Russian authorities which began in earnest with Vladimir Putin 's invitation to his Polish counterpart , Donald Tusk , to jointly commemorate the massacre for the first time earlier this month .
The plane crash which killed the Polish president , Lech Kaczynski , three days later has accelerated that process .
Excerpts : Beria letter to Stalin Beria refers to them as " steadfast , incorrigible enemies of Soviet power " .
" Each of them is just waiting for liberation so as to actively join the struggle against Soviet power , " it says .
The letter bears Stalin 's signature in blue pencil , with the comment " In favour " .
Given that historians have already had access to the files for some time , correspondents say the decision to put them on the state archive website is likely to be seen as a symbolic gesture , rather than shedding new light on what happened at Katyn .
" We on the Russian side are showing absolute openness in telling what happened in Katyn and other places with Polish prisoners of war , " Russian state archive chief Andrei Artyzov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies .
" All the basic documents about these events have been published . "
Among the files that remain secret are documents relating to a Russian investigation into the massacre that began in the 1990s .
Russian human rights campaigners have appealed for those documents to be declassified .
Joint commemoration Poland has repeatedly demanded that Russia open all its files on Katyn , and the issue has soured relations between the two countries in the past .
Recently though , tension over Katyn has eased .
Russian and Polish leaders marked Katyn together for the first time in April Earlier this month leaders from both states marked the massacre together for the first time , in a joint ceremony attended by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk .
It was the first Russian ceremony to commemorate Katyn .
Days later , Polish President Lech Kaczynski and more than 90 others were killed when their plane crashed as it was trying to land in western Russia ahead of a separate event to mark the killings .
Moscow 's handling of the aftermath of the crash was well received by Poles .
The April 1940 killings were carried out by the NKVD on Stalin 's orders .
Members of the Polish elite , including officers , politicians and artists , were shot in the back of the head and their bodies dumped in mass graves .
The killings took place at various sites , but the western Russian forest of Katyn has become their chief symbol .
The Soviet Union blamed the massacre on Nazi Germany before acknowledging responsibility in 1990 .
One of the documents now posted online was a March 1959 letter marked " Top Secret " from the former head of the KGB , Alexander Shelepin , to then - Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev , proposing that all dossiers concerning the Katyn killings be destroyed .
He said the authorities should just keep a few documents - the minutes of meetings of the NKVD troika that condemned the prisoners and some papers on the fulfilment of the troika 's instructions .
Shelepin wrote that the official Soviet version - that Nazi Germany had carried out the killings - had been " firmly implanted in international opinion " .

The changes to section 3.3.1 of Apple 's iPhone SDK license agreement have been extensively covered on the web .
Apple 's position is well expressed by a pair of articles .
John Gruber gives a high - level view in his Jobs - approved piece , while Louis Gerbarg provides a more technical perspective .
As usual , I 'm thinking meta .
The " section 3.3.1 " issue is just another in a long line of events that have the same basic shape : actions taken by Apple in what it believes to be the best interest of its platform ( and , by extension , itself ) that run afoul of the interests and opinions of developers .
Any Apple follower can surely list others : the lack of Flash on the iPhone , the App Store as the sole gateway for iPhone applications , deprecating Carbon , and on and on .
Apple 's decisions regarding its mobile platform in particular have been extremely protective from the very start .
Cumulatively , these actions represent a huge bet placed by Apple .
The proposition is this :
Apple is betting it can grow its platform fast enough , using any means necessary , that developers will stick around despite all the hardships and shoddy treatment .
Each time it chooses to do what it thinks is best for the future of the iPhone OS platform instead of what will please developers , Apple is pushing more chips into the pot .
Like the Mac , the iPhone debuted with a huge technical lead over its competitors .
But this time , Apple is determined not to squander its advantage .
Instead , it 's front - running as hard as it possibly can .
Anything that has any chance of slowing down " the progress of the platform " has simply got to go .
And the best way Apple knows to ensure platform progress is by controlling its own destiny in every way that it can .
That means , among other things , no middleware vendors , no encouragement of cross- platform development ( either explicit or implicit ) , and complete , arbitrary control over every application 's presence on the platform .
It 's Apple 's contention that other mobile platforms that allow these things , most of which developers adore , do so at the cost of slowing the speed with which they advance upon their competitors .
In Apple 's case , it 's trying to put as much distance between itself and the guys it sees in its rear - view mirror .
And why ?
Because the only way to keep developers around while you do things that annoy them and sometimes hurt their business is to provide so much upside — customers , sales and marketing support , new revenue models — that they 're willing to choke down the bad stuff .
The win scenario is big : Apple as the dominant player in the most important new technology market .
Microsoft - level dominance .
But the flip - side is terrible — though I can see how it may have snuck up on Apple .
If Apple fails to outrun developer dissatisfaction with its platform 's success , it 's not much work to change the offending App Store policies , issue a new SDK license agreement , etc .
All of these problems are policy - related , and a policy is easy to change , right ?
Unfortunately , developers ' hearts and minds do n't change so easily .
In fact , they 're pretty darned stubborn .
If Apple ever gets to the point where it needs to change its developer - unfriendly policies in order to maintain its momentum , it will most likely be too late .
Opinions will have been formed , grudges cemented .
Just like in Vegas , it 's easy to get heavily invested in a pot before you realize what 's happening .
At that point , you have to decide if continuing would be throwing good money after bad , or if your hand really is as strong as you think .
So far , Apple 's has n't gone all - in ( whatever that might look like ) .
As in real gambling , I 'm sure Apple hopes that it never has to go that far .
But it 's happening slowly , by increments .
Apple is playing a dangerous game of chicken with itself .
On one hand you have its mobile platform strategy and associated products , succeeding in the market and growing ever upwards and outwards .
On the other hand you have the policies that are ostensibly making this happen , pissing off developers and causing high - level corporate clashes .
If the platform outruns the angry developers and partners , Apple wins , and wins big .
But if things start to go south for the platform , Apple 's options are becoming fewer by the day .
More evidence that California is the new Greece .
As the state grapples with a horrible budget situation , Arnold Schwarzenegger is warning of pain ahead .
Specifically , according to the SacBee , Schwarzenegger press secretary Aaron McLear said :
" What you can expect generally is no taxes and terrible cuts , absolutely terrible cuts ...
We 're not going to get through the deficit we have without some really tough decisions and some really terrible cuts . "
This is going to get really ugly , and though California may stave off default , there 's no way they 'll be able to stave off the horrible demand destruction that will result from these " absolutely terrible cuts . "

And their stats :
Last month Intel announced that it was shipping systems with its experimental 48 - core processor .
Now we get to see what a system with the radical chip looks like .
X - bit labs caught the supercomputer on chip ( SCC ) system on demonstration in Europe , which runs on an experimental " Copper Ridge " motherboard with integrated I/O and graphics and eight DIMM slots .
There 's no SATA ports , instead an Intel USB flash disk is used for storage .
According to the report , the SCC contains 24 tiles with two x86 cores per tile , each of which has its own L2 cache and can run a separate OS and software stack and act like an individual compute node that communicates with other compute nodes over a packet - based network .
The SCC also has four integrated DDR3 memory controllers .
The 48 - core chip features 24 small routers between the cores , which facilitate faster data exchanges across the chip .
Each core also has on - chip buffers that can instantly exchange data in parallel across all the cores .
Intel also says that the 48 - core chip has a more advanced on - die power management system that can vary the power draw between 25 watts to 125 watts .
It can also reduce clock speed and shut down cores .
As far as clock speeds go , current desktop and even laptop offerings outpace this 48 - core wonder .
Intel revealed that its experimental chip runs at about the same frequencies as the Atom CPU , so we 're looking in the neighborhood of 1.2GHz to 1.83GHz .

- Local leaders at grass - roots level are championing the family planning drive given the threats posed by the country 's fast growing population .
. . The gathering of over 70 residents , young and old , male and female , then keenly listened as Dr. Ezechias Rwabuhihi , an area resident , who is also a former Health Minister and legislator expounded on the threats posed by a large family and , consequently a large population to a small comparatively poor economy .
" A family should , surely , have children it is able to properly look after - feed , educate , cloth , and provide many others basics for , " Rwabuhihi told the attentive audience .
"
Unlike our forefathers , it is time we bring to an end the misguided conceptions that we can only give birth to children and then leave them to God 's care . " . . . Describing an alarming population state of affairs in the most unambiguous terms , Rwabuhihi told Intwari residents how the country 's population has exploded from one million to , currently , averagely over 10 million in just a few decades .
He noted , Rwanda 's wealth moves up unproportionally slowly and the land size too , does not increase at all .
The residents seemed to take all this in and agreed that the village 's women , including girls above 18 years should participate in a related but special female only session . . . The average fertility rate drop of 5.5 children per woman from 6.1 in 2005 , however encouraging , analysts state , still remains a massive burden to the economy and if it continues unchecked , could be ruinous .
Instead of forcibly limiting couples to no more than three children , Government has opted to sensitize Rwandans to control the size of their families .
Two children per family are considered as ideal .

On Roosevelt Island , a narrow strip of land in New York 's East River , no one takes their trash to the curb .
They just drop it down a chute , anywhere on the island , and pneumatic pipes take care of the rest .
Advertisement
The infrastructural curiosity is the subject of Juliette Spertus ' Fast Trash ! , an exhibition that looks at Roosevelt Island 's unique system in the context of how we might better design our cities in the future .
The Island 's Automated Vacuum Collection System sucked its first junk in 1975 and is used by over 12,000 of the island 's inhabitants today .
Here 's Spertus on how the system works :
Garbage is deposited in a regular building garbage chute , which is gravity - fed , and piles up behind a valve at the bottom .
With your average garbage chute , there is a compactor at the bottom that compacts the trash and puts it into bags that are then carried to the curb .
Here , there is no compactor – there 's just a plate and a network of tubes that lead to a facility at the end of the island ...
The valves open , the garbage drops in and is pulled back to the facility with an air speed of 60 miles per hour ( the garbage itself , depending on the density , shoots through at 30 - 60 miles per hour ) .
A cyclone separator then separates the heavy items from the light , after which a dust collector removes the dust from the air , and the all the garbage and dust drops into a compactor and is condensed into one of 10 containers in the facility that are then picked up by the Department of Sanitation .

Well that sounds easy .
And for the most part , it is — the island 's entire trash system is operated by only eight people .
Spertus hopes the exhibition , which is currently open on Roosevelt Island and runs through May 23 , will encourage people to stop and consider waste removal , a process that she says is both " invisible " and " essential . "
You can learn more about Roosevelt Island 's high - speed trash tubes on Urban Omnibus and find out more about the exhibition on it's website .

Discovery is scheduled to launch April 5 on a mission to the International Space Station .
( AP Photo / John Raoux )
( AP ) -- NASA 's countdown clocks began ticking Friday for next week 's launch of shuttle Discovery on a space station supply run , one of only four remaining .
Discovery is scheduled to blast off just before dawn Monday with seven astronauts and a load of science experiments and spare parts for the International Space Station .
Forecasters put the odds of good weather at 80 percent .
This is scheduled to be the last space shuttle launch in darkness .
Only three shuttle missions remain after this one .
NASA already is relying on the Russians for rides to the space station .
In fact , U.S. astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson hitched a ride aboard a Soyuz rocket early Friday .
The space agency hopes U.S. commercial rockets will take over this taxi job , but that 's still several years away .
As for cargo , Russian , Japanese and European spacecraft will fill the void , though none is as big as the shuttle .
" Every one of the remaining missions is an important mission for us .
Because we only have a few left , we have to get everything that we 're going to get uphill on these next few missions , " said NASA test director Steve Payne .
" The team out here really loves launching space shuttles .
So we 're enjoying everything we can , while we 've got it , " he added .
Launch time will be 6:21 a.m. , nearly an hour before sunrise .
If the visibility is good , sunlight should reflect off the shuttle as it rises and , a little later , create a rainbow of colors in the exhaust plume .
This was n't supposed to be a night flight .
But the mission was delayed two weeks after this winter 's unusually cold weather stalled preparations .
Three spacewalks are planned during Discovery 's 13 - day flight .

Protesters demonstrating against the Israeli attack on a Gaza - bound aid ship have attempted to storm the BBC in Manchester .
More than 800 people marched through the city centre and down Oxford Road , where the crowd surged at the BBC 's entrance , smashing its front doors .
One man climbed to the top of the building to plant a Palestinian flag and there were at least three arrests .
Protesters said they were also angry about the BBC 's coverage of Israel .
Police officers formed a chain across the BBC's Oxford Road entrance and surrounded the building with police vehicles and officers .
Protesters from the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign , who organised the demonstration , chanted slogans including : " BBC tell the truth . "
Image caption Protesters smashed glass doors and there were at least three arrests
The demonstration followed the confirmed killings of nine humanitarian aid workers by Israeli soldiers , who stormed their ship as it approached Gaza .
Talat Ali , 40 , organizer from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign said : " This is a peaceful demonstration against the attack that has taken place on the Gaza flotilla .
" We are not happy with the way commanders boarded vessels and butchered people .
" We are not happy with the biased news given by the BBC . "

$ 120 million from GM sparks hope in Detroit
With GM's $ 120 million investment , the plant that straddles the Detroit - Hamtramck border will build the Malibu and the Volt and reassure workers in this community .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors ' announcement Wednesday that it 's investing $ 120 million in a Detroit auto plant is an encouraging sign for many in this hard hit city .
" Investment of that amount means long - term job security , " said Tom Summers , vice president at union Local 22 , which represents workers at the plant that straddles the Detroit - Hamtramck border .
" And it shows that Michigan is still a centerpiece of manufacturing . "
The investments are designed to produce the next generation of the Chevy Malibu , GM 's best selling car , in the facility located just 5 miles northeast of downtown Detroit .
The Malibu is currently made at a Kansas City plant .
It was also made at a factory about a half hour drive northeast of Detroit , but that plant is being retooled to make a smaller car .
Summers said 100 or so furloughed workers at the Hamtramck plant should be brought back , and maybe even new ones hired , over the next couple of years .
Ultimately , he said GM plans on running the factory three shifts a day , which could entail at least doubling the workforce .
The plant currently employs just over 1,000 people and runs one shift a day .
GM could not immediately be reached for comment .
The plant , which has been operation since 1985 , currently makes two sedans for the company , the Cadillac DTS and the Buick Lucerne .
It also makes GM 's much - hyped plug - in electric car , the Chevy Volt , set to go on sale later this year .
Last year , GM said it is putting over $ 300 million worth of investments into the plant to make the Volt .
Summers said the Cadillac and Buick models will ultimately be phased out .
For the city , the investments represent a much - needed economic boost .
Unemployment in the Detroit metro area , which includes the suburbs , is over 15 % , a third higher than the national average .
In Detroit proper , it 's a jaw - dropping 25 % .
City leaders have been trying to bring new industry to Detroit for years , with mixed success .
Some in the city , notably in the business community , have said that even if U.S. automakers started hiring again in a big way , they would n't be likely to invest heavily in Detroit or in any of the northern manufacturing states , preferring to go to cheaper southern states instead .
Wednesday 's announcement seemed to counter that logic , at least for the moment .
" This investment affirms that Detroit is and always will be the Motor City , " Mayor Dave Bing said in a statement .
" As we work to attract new jobs and investment , the auto industry will continue to play a vital role as employers and taxpayers . "
A reader who asks his name not be used writes about the drug raid video from Columbia , Missouri :
I am a US Army officer , currently serving in Afghanistan .
My first thought on reading this story is this : Most American police SWAT teams probably have fewer restrictions on conducting forced entry raids than do US forces in Afghanistan .
For our troops over here to conduct any kind of forced entry , day or night , they have to meet one of two conditions : have a bad guy ( or guys ) inside actively shooting at them ; or obtain permission from a 2 - star general , who must be convinced by available intelligence ( evidence ) that the person or persons they 're after is present at the location , and that it 's too dangerous to try less coercive methods .
The general can be pretty tough to convince , too .
( I 'm a staff liason , and one of my jobs is to present these briefings to obtain the required permission . )
Generally , our troops , including the special ops guys , use what we call " cordon and knock " : they set up a perimeter around the target location to keep people from moving in or out , and then announce their presence and give the target an opportunity to surrender .
In the majority of cases , even if the perimeter is established at night , the call out or knock on the gate does n't happen until after the sun comes up .
Oh , and all of the bad guys we 're going after are closely tied to killing and maiming people .
What might be amazing to American cops is that the vast majority of our targets surrender when called out .
I do n't have a clear picture of the resources available to most police departments , but even so , I do n't see any reason why they can't use similar methods .

Usually getting someone to do a double - take while looking at an infographic is the last thing you want .
But , in the case you have no choice .
Your initial thought is , “ these are some weird fish . ”
But wait a moment and let your brain catch up to your eye and you will see the fish are really creatively crumpled pieces of garbage found in the Mediterranean sea , or any body of water , for that matter .
This was extremely well - executed and it is easy to see the writer and designer made something special out of garbage for this anti-pollution infographic , a nice green marketing piece .

Toshiba using Senseg haptic feedback for ereaders & cellphones [ Video ]
Toshiba have picked up Finnish firm Senseg ’s haptic feedback system and plan to release commercial products using the technology next year .
Senseg ‘s system , unlike mechanical haptic feedback which use vibration to help users identify touchscreen taps , uses an electrical field to stimulate the receptors in the fingertip that would normally feel vibration .
Video demo after the cut
The Senseg layer is flexible and can be fixed to an irregular surface ; that means the curved or angular chassis of a device , such as a smartphone , could be fitted out for haptic feedback , rather than just the flat display .
Also , since the technology is affecting the fingers ’ touch receptors directly , it can produce different sensations rather than just vibration : for instance , texture of on - screen materials like wood or leather .
Toshiba ’s Information Systems department – who have adapted the Senseg film into their own “ New Sensation UI Solution ” – expect to use it in ereaders , notebooks and cellphones .
It should n’t add too much to the price tag , either ; the company says it ’s expected to cost just $ 0.10 to $ 0.20 when in mass production .

The software has a familiar look
Microsoft has unleashed its latest weapon in its ongoing battle with Google .
The software giant has launched its flagship product Office 2010 , aimed at businesses and home users .
The latest version of the software has a free online component - called Office Web Apps .
Analysts believe the web offering is a response to Google , which has been encroaching on Microsoft 's core business with its free online tools .
Crucially , Microsoft will also offer its online office suite to all users of one of the world 's most popular social networking sites , Facebook .
" There 's no question - Microsoft is responding to Google 's threat , " said Whit Andrews , analyst at research firm Gartner .
' Microsoft world '
Google and Microsoft have increasingly begun to stray into each other 's traditional markets .
Microsoft has thrown its full weight behind its search engine Bing , whilst Google is about to launch its own operating system , known as Chrome OS .
It is critical that Microsoft capture users who are not tethered to the same desktop PC every day Whit Andrews , Gartner
The battle for the Office software market started in 2006 when the search giant launched the first elements of its Google Docs .
" Until Google emerged with a credible suite of networked applications , Microsoft was not compelled to do anything . "
Google Docs now offers word - processing , spreadsheet software and a presentation tool , amongst others .
Businesses can pay for premium versions .
" Each release of Office has a new set of competitors and we take those very seriously , " Jeff Teper , vice president of the Microsoft Business Division told BBC News .
" [ Google ] has introduced a product that they have tried to target businesses with - it has n't done very well . "
Google Docs currently has a small ( 4 % ) but growing share of the market .
Image caption Google Chrome OS will be released in the second half of 2010
By contrast , Microsoft dominates the office software space , with a market share of more than 94 % , according to Gartner .
The vast majority of sales are to businesses .
Business " is still overwhelmingly a Microsoft world " , said Sheri McLeish , analyst at Forrester Research .
Microsoft retains its dominant position despite the free offerings from Google and other alternatives such as Zoho or the free office suite OpenOffice.org .
Ahead of Microsoft 's launch Google posted a blog urging businesses to switch to its software , claiming that it represents a real alternative " .
" If you 're considering upgrading Office with Office , we 'd encourage you to consider an alternative : upgrading Office with Google Docs , " it read .
Despite , Google 's focus on businesses , Mr Andrews said its message and software were likely to appeal to younger people , who have not necessarily grown up using Microsoft products .
" If all your content is generated in the Google apps system and it lives there , you would need to have a really good reason to move , " he told BBC News .
Social software
Office Web Apps offers a free version of programs such as Word , Excel and PowerPoint .
Office 2010 is the ultimate freemium deal - where some basic services are offered for free , while power users are happy to pay a premium Tim Weber , Business editor , BBC News website Microsoft bets on free Office
The service allows people to access and edit documents from within a web browser , as well as share and collaborate on files .
It lacks the entire gamut of features found in the desktop versions , but is designed , in part , to entice consumers to try Microsoft 's products , said Mr Teper .
" One of the reasons why we are so excited about the Office Web applications for free ... is the appeal to consumers ; to get new people to try the latest versions . "
Microsoft has said that the suite will be offered free to its 400 million Windows Live users .
" It is critical that Microsoft captures users who are not tethered to the same desktop PC every day , " said Mr Andrews .
" They need to be able to serve the growing netbook community and people using their phones . "
The firm has also integrated the social web into its software in a bid to attract new customers and keep the desktop software relevant in an increasingly online world .
Its Social Connector service allows people to suck information from social networks such as LinkedIn and MySpace into the Office Outlook e-mail program .
The firm has also released a trial version of its online apps that integrates with Facebook .

Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) --
At a vigil protesting the passage of Arizona 's tough new illegal immigration law , a young man in Army fatigues and a beret lit a candle at a makeshift shrine .
Pfc. Jose Medina , an Army medic , came to the Arizona capitol while on leave , to express his sadness over the law , signed by Arizona 's governor on Friday .
" I'm here because this is something that 's close to my heart , " said Medina .
" I went off to protect this country , to protect my family .
That 's what hurts . "
The new law requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect that they 're in the country illegally .
Critics fear the law will result in racial profiling .
The bill " strengthens the laws of our state .
It protects all of us , every Arizona citizen , and everyone here in our state lawfully .
And it does so while ensuring that the constitutional rights of all in Arizona remain solid , stable and steadfast , " Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said .
Medina , 20 , is from El Mirage , a working class Latino community northwest of Phoenix .
" When I first joined the military , they would ask us where you from , and I would say ' I 'm from the great state of Arizona , ' " Medina reflected .
" I was raised here , I grew up here .
Now I do n't know if I can say that so proudly .
I do n't know if I want to live here anymore . "
Medina says he came to the United States from Mexico illegally when he was 2 years old .
When he was 11 years old he became a legal resident of the United States and now has a green card .
" I felt I had a huge debt to this country that 's given me so much , " Medina said .
" When I heard the law that passed , I could n't believe it .
Because the America I know , freedom , liberties we enjoy , are for everyone and then this law passes and I 'm like ' wow . '
It 's a shame ; it 's a state that does n't even want you here ?
If I take this uniform off I 'm just another person who came here illegally . "
Just six hours before shipping off , Medina 's family and friends gathered for a farewell feast .
The Mexican barbecue could be smelled a block away .
Impassioned conversation about the controversial law could be heard over the scratching of forks and knives on plates of tangy barbecue .
" You may go to Afghanistan , you may go to Iraq , " said Medina 's close family friend Victor , who did not want his full name used .
" After this night man , we may not see you again .
You can give your life for this country .
But your mom may be stopped by Joe Arpaio ( the Maricopa County , Arizona , sheriff known for aggressive policing . )
" That 's true , " Medina answered .
" But it 's my duty to go . "
" You 're Mexican , " Victor said .
" I am of Mexican descent , " said Medina .
" But I have grown to be an American . "
Ricky , 22 , a friend who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , is white and stops eating .
" We are all brothers over there , " said Ricky , who did not want his full name used .
Before the sun rose over Arizona on Sunday morning , Medina left El Mirage for deployment to Germany .
Jose Medina wondered if some of his family members or friends , some of whom are undocumented , would still be in El Mirage when he returned .
" I worry will my family live in peace , " he said .
" What good is keeping us safe here ... if we lose a part of what makes America so great ?
If we drive fear into our own peoples ' hearts ? "
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Reserve opposes it .
The country ’s chief banking regulator dislikes it .
The secretary of the Treasury has been unsupportive , at best , and Paul A. Volcker — no one ’s idea of a best friend to Wall Street — calls it unnecessary .
Their antipathy is directed at a proposal from Senator Blanche Lincoln , Democrat of Arkansas .
She wants banks to get rid of their lucrative derivatives operations because they played an outsize role in the financial debacle .
And when Wall Street needed a rescue , Mrs. Lincoln says , taxpayers should not have had to bail out bankers ’ bad bets .
But just how far Democrats will pull back from an outright prohibition is unclear .
Mrs. Lincoln is in a vicious primary campaign .
Her opponent has tried to portray her as a Washington insider cozy with Wall Street and big business .
If Mrs. Lincoln is seen as having given ground to bankers on derivatives , she could lose her job — and Democrats might well lose the seat to a Republican this fall .
In the month since Mrs. Lincoln offered her proposal , Democrats have played a waiting game .
But in that time , opposition has grown and bank lobbyists have fought her plan , what they call the “ push out ” provision .
The question now is whether after the Arkansas vote , on Tuesday , Democrats will argue that other safeguards in Mrs. Lincoln ’s derivatives bill — requiring them to be traded on an exchange , processed through a third party and backed by sufficient collateral — will be sufficient .

PHILADELPHIA —
A suburban Philadelphia school district says it secretly captured 56,000 webcam photographs and screen shots from laptops issued to high school students .
Lower Merion School District lawyer Henry Hockeimer says an internal investigation shows students likely were photographed inside their homes .
He says none of the images appears inappropriate .
A tracking program took images every 15 minutes to find missing computers .
Hockeimer says the program sometimes was turned on for months .
Sophomore Blake Robbins is suing the district .
He alleges wiretap and privacy violations .
He says the district took pictures of him sleeping in bed and half - dressed .
The Philadelphia Inquirer first reported Monday on the number of images recovered .
A 22 - year - old Michael Jackson impersonator and local entertainment promoter has been jailed on charges of molesting an 11 - year - old Michigan boy .
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy says in a release Friday that Ricardo West of Allen Park has been charged with multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct , using a computer to commit a crime and accosting children for immoral purposes .
Worthy says the incidents occurred between March 15 and April 9 at a home in Allen Park , 10 miles southwest of Detroit .
She also says sexual contact was made with the victim at the Allen Park Auditorium .
West also worked a driver for a private bus company that transports children to events .
He is being held without bond in the Wayne County Jail pending an April 26 preliminary examination .
" Playing with Pictures : The Art of Victorian Photocollage , " an amazing exhibit that just showed at the Metropolitan Museum , illuminates a bizarre , fascinating art form .
The Victorian ladies making these surreal photo - scrap - books were not kidding around - except when they were :
In the Victorian era , genteel ladies were taught to draw and paint .
As adults , they were expected to ply these talents in a range of domestic crafts .
Sometimes , this meant photocollage , a mix of , well , photographs and original artwork .
Sound dull ?
It 's anything but .

The first thing you think when you see these works , dating from the 1860s and 1870s , is : these women had a lot of time on their hands .
These books - whimsical takes on photo - albums - are often incredibly elaborate and painstaking in their detail .
After all , they were intended as keepsakes and it's not like photos came cheap .
But what 's even more striking is their whimsy , their skill , and the just plain weirdness of some of these images .
Clearly , the women making these were having fun with it - and at times the surrealism verges on subversive .
Not just a creative outlet , the albums are a look at a whimsy we hardly associate with Victoriana .

They 're also surprisingly modern - or what we think of as modern .
While the links to the avant - garde are clear , I was also immediately reminded of outsider art legend Henry Darger - as much by the elaborate fantasy worlds on view as the use of collage - and another friend commented that the images reminded her of the work of digital artist Maggie Taylor .
In a time when , with few exceptions , the art world was both overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly staid , this purely domestic work continues to resonate today .

" This ca n't be real " was my first thought .
Then I checked the source : The Guatemalan government .

A sinkhole is a natural depression caused by the removal of underground soil by water .
Usually , it happens when the substrate is formed by limestone , carbonate rock , salt beds or any other rock that is easily eroded by water streams .
The process could be slow , but sometimes the land just cracks open without notice .
In this case , it happened suddenly , swallowing an entire house .
The cause : Massive underground water torrents created by tropical storm Agatha .

Sinkholes ' size ranges from low terrain depressions to hundred of meters .
Unlike the similar sinkhole that killed two teens in 2007 , there seems to be no victims .
At least one local newspaper is reporting one person dead , but the authorities have not confirmed it .
Some neighbors claim that a whole three - story building and a house fell into the hole .
Updated :
The sinkhole swallowed a clothing factory .
No deaths or injuries have been registered .

How can we learn to say no ?
The federal government is now starting to build the institutions that will try to reduce the soaring growth of health care costs .
There will be a group to compare the effectiveness of different treatments , a so - called Medicare innovation center and a Medicare oversight board that can set payment rates .
But all these groups will face the same basic problem .
Deep down , Americans tend to believe that more care is better care .
We recoil from efforts to restrict care .
Managed care became loathed in the 1990s .
The recent recommendation to reduce breast cancer screening set off a firestorm .
On a personal level , anyone who has made a decision about his or her own care knows the nagging worry that comes from not choosing the most aggressive treatment .
This try - anything - and - everything instinct is ingrained in our culture , and it has some big benefits .
But it also has big downsides , including the side effects and risks that come with unnecessary treatment .
Consider that a recent study found that 15,000 people were projected to die eventually from the radiation they received from CT scans given in just a single year — and that there was “ significant overuse ” of such scans .
NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft has captured images of lightning on Saturn , allowing the scientists to create the first movie showing lightning flashing on another planet .
“ Ever since the beginning of the Cassini mission , a major goal of the Imaging Team has been the detection of Saturnian lightning , ” said team leader Carolyn Porco in an email .
Porco said the ability to capture the lightning was a direct result of the dimming of the ringshine on the night side of the planet during last year ’s Saturn equinox .
“ And these flashes have been shown to be coincident in time with the emission of powerful electrostatic discharges intercepted by the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave experiment , ” Porco added .
The sound in the video approximates the electrostatic discharge signals detected by the instrument .
“ The process of electrostatic discharge and lightning production is tied to the motions of electrically charged particles and molecules in the Earth ’s atmosphere , ” Porco said , “ and the same is believed to be true for the atmospheres of the giant planets .
Measuring the power of lightning strikes in a planetary atmosphere can tell of the energy contained in the thunderstorms that spawn them and of the vigor of the atmospheric motions . ”
The movie and radio data suggest extremely powerful storms with lightning that flashes as brightly as the brightest super - bolts on Earth , according to Andrew Ingersoll , a Cassini imaging science subsystem team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
“ What ’s interesting is that the storms are as powerful — or even more powerful — at Saturn as on Earth , ” said Ingersoll .
“ But they occur much less frequently , with usually only one happening on the planet at any given time , though it can last for months . ”
The first images of the lightning were captured in August 2009 , during a storm that churned from January to October 2009 and lasted longer than any other observed lightning storm in the solar system .
Results are described in an article accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The data collected in order to make a video came in November through mid-December 2009 during a shorter storm that included brighter lightning and stronger radio signals .
The frames in the video were obtained over 16 minutes on Nov. 30 , 2009 .
The flashes lasted less than one second .
The images show a cloud as long as 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 miles ) across and regions illuminated by lightning flashes about 300 kilometers ( 190 miles ) in diameter .
Scientists use the width of the flashes to gauge the depth of the lightning below the cloud tops .

WASHINGTON —
The evidence of ties between the man accused of being the Times Square bomber and Pakistani militants has intensified debate inside the Obama administration about expanding America ’s military presence in Pakistan , with some officials making the case to increase the number of Special Operations troops working with Pakistani forces in the country ’s western mountains .
The American military presence in Pakistan has already grown substantially over the past year , and now totals more than two hundred troops , part of a program to share intelligence with Pakistani Army and paramilitary troops and train them to battle militant groups .
But the failed bombing in Times Square , and evidence that the accused man , Faisal Shahzad , received training in a camp run by the Pakistani Taliban , has given support to those who want to expand the mission .
In particular , some inside the administration believe that the C.I.A. program of killing militants from the air is insufficient for preventing attacks on the West , and that an expanded training mission might raise confidence in Pakistan ’s military enough to launch an offensive in the militant sanctuary of North Waziristan , in the tribal areas .
Editor 's note : Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the San Diego Union - Tribune editorial board , a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to CNN.com .
San Diego , California ( CNN ) -- Jaime Escalante was ahead of his time .
And today , more than 30 years after the Bolivian - born math teacher put East Los Angeles ' Garfield High School on the map by convening 14 students in his very first AP calculus class , the rest of the educational establishment is still trying to catch up .
Escalante -- who was immortalized in the 1988 film " Stand and Deliver " -- died this week at his son's home in Roseville , California , after a bout with cancer .
It was way back in 1978 when Escalante began teaching calculus to Mexican - American kids from the barrio .
That 's more than two decades before President George W. Bush challenged the nation 's public schools to acknowledge and overcome the " soft bigotry of low expectations , " and Escalante was already fighting that battle .
He knew all about low expectations -- most of them coming from jealous colleagues and visionless administrators .
More important , Escalante knew the recipe for how to overcome those low expectations and teach students to succeed .
It starts , he would say , with " ganas " -- the desire of students to learn , coupled with the desire of teachers to teach .
Mix in two parts hard work , a cup of sacrifice , and a dash of " anything is possible . "
Oh , because you 'll inevitability meet up with cynics and critics who try to derail you , to make themselves feel better about their own failings and to sustain their prejudices about who can learn and who can't , it does n't hurt to put in a spoonful of attitude of the sort embodied in Evita Peron 's quip : " It does n't matter what the morons say . "
All across the United States , students and teachers come to the classroom with tons of built - in excuses of why they can't or wo n't do what they know they need to do .
And so , it 's no wonder so little gets done .
Just as it's no wonder that those who try to break through that culture and actually teach students who have been written off often meet with resistance .
One of the things I remember from the years I spent teaching the children of Mexican farm workers in central California was that sometimes , it seems , students and teachers are competing to see which group is the most victimized .
Escalante had no interest in that game .
Personally , I think it was because he was an immigrant .
Here you have someone who arrived in the United States with very little money , who was n't able to speak the language , but went on to mop floors and work as a short - order cook by day .
He learned English and earned math degrees , and a teaching credential by night , on his way to working for an electronics company .
Then he followed his passion into teaching .
You know people like that , or you did .
Think Grandpa .
Think Grandma .
Take out " Bolivia " and fill in " Italy " or " Ireland . "
Those people do n't want to hear your problems and why you think you can't do something .
It 's embarrassing .
You whine about how hard you have it and how the odds are against you , and they just arrived from a place that makes your troubles look like a day at the beach .
That 's how it was for the man who was eulogized this week by Jay Matthews , education reporter for the Washington Post , as " the most famous and influential American public school teacher of his generation . "
Escalante had no interest in hearing why poor Mexican - American kids from a barrio high school could n't learn calculus , ace a national test and go on to attend prestigious universities .
He was too busy making it happen .
I met Escalante once in the late 1980's at a black - tie affair in Washington .
But , the more memorable encounter took place a couple of years earlier , while I was in college .
I had placed a long distance call to Garfield High School and left a message .
A student group on campus wanted him to speak .
To my surprise , after seeing a message that the school receptionist had scribbled down as being from simply " Ruben at Harvard , " he called me back .
To my amusement , I soon realized the reason he did was because he thought I was another Ruben at Harvard -- a former student .
For a lot of public school teachers in America , especially those who teach socio- economically disadvantaged kids , that kind of call might be unusual .
Not Escalante .
His former students from Garfield were sprinkled all over the Ivy League -- not just at Harvard , but also at Yale , Princeton , Columbia , Cornell and other universities .
I 'd sometimes meet them at student conferences , and there was always something special about them and how they carried themselves .
There was that badge of honor , that additional bit of confidence that came from being one of an elite group of high achievers who demolished the low expectations of others .
These were Jaime 's kids .
That 's an impressive legacy -- and , in the case of an extraordinary educator who still teaches us what 's possible in our public schools when you ditch the excuses , and have the ganas to make it happen , a well - deserved one .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr .
Yes , the random hobo doo - wop groups shaking bags of change in your face in the subway are a little annoying , but this ?
I think I 'd clap for this .

This is the University of Oregon 's a cappella group " On the Rocks " and they decided to Rick Roll the subway , just because they can .
It amazes me that even though there are nine guys stationed in various parts of the train it 's still tough to get a reaction from most of the passengers .
I mean , look at that guy beat - boxing !
He 's like a white Michael Winslow .
And besides , this is probably the most positive coverage the University of Oregon has received on this site in a long time .
Hopefully the OTR guys did n't go wilding through Central Park right after they got off the train .

The Whale Whisperer : Astonishing bond between diver and Scar the giant sperm whale
Peering solemnly nose - to - nose at each other , this is the Whale Whisperer and his friend - Scar the 10 - year - old giant of the sea .
These spectacular images show Andrew Armour bonding with the colossal sperm whale in the warm Caribbean waters off the island of Dominica .
Taken on the weekend , the photographs offer stunning insight into the lives of other pod members travelling with Scar .
Friends : Andrew Armour and Scar the sperm whale consider one another solemnly as they swim in the waters off Dominica last weekend
In one picture a large group of ' socialising ' whales come together - giving the impression they are meeting up for a chat .
And in another they arrive in a perfectly formed procession - almost like they are part of an underwater military march .
The jaw - dropping series of images show how a decade spent befriending the gentle giant allows Andrew , 45 , to stroke and gracefully swim alongside the 32 - foot mammal .
Whale watch operator Andrew , from Dominica , said : ' Our bond began in 2000 when my wife Rhona found him injured out at sea when he was just a calf .
We think he might have been attacked by pilot whales but we are not sure .
' His head and dorsal fin were injured and he came to our boat , perhaps seeking some comfort .
The most we could do was pet him and his injuries left him with some scarring .
That feels nice : Scar 's eyes are closed as Andrew swims alongside him petting him
' From then on he and another young female would approach us whenever they saw our boat .
We could even call him over .
' Now he recognises me when I am swimming .
I feel like he even knows my voice .
I can get very close with him because we trust each other .
I even clean lice off him and he lets me do it .
' Other whales in the area do n't tend to stay in the same place when humans are around but Scar seeks interaction and seems to enjoy being petted . '
More than a decade later , Andrew is now able to invite other snorkellers and divers along to share in the incredible experience .
Last week he took underwater photographers Eric Cheng , 34 , from San Francisco , California , and Tony Wu , 42 , from Tokyo , Japan , to witness his amazing encounters with Scar and other sperm whales in his pod .
It meant observers Eric and Tony were given a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to interact with the huge animal themselves .
Social functions :
Other sperm whales in the pod with patches of dead skin flaking off them .
Sperm whales often exfoliate by rubbing against one another
' When Tony and I first encountered Scar we had to continuously move out of the way to prevent the large whale from rubbing up against us , ' said Eric .
' Soon enough , we overcame the worry that is natural when confronting one of the world 's largest carnivores in its native environment .
' We stroked and scratched Scar , who twitched and rolled over repeatedly in what appeared to be enjoyment .
' It 's dangerous to anthropomorphise animals - even intelligent ones - but it was absolutely clear in this case that Scar wanted the interaction . '
Anthropomorphism is the human habit of likening animal behaviour to human behaviour .
Eric continued : ' Scar can be now be approached by humans , but it is important to remember his still a wild animal and needs to be treated with respect . '
Just hanging out :
Four of the whales suspend themselves upside down in the water
Captivated Tony and Eric spent three days photographing Scar and other members of the pod under the watch of experienced Andrew .
' Each day , the number of whales in the group varied , ' said Eric .
' The most we have seen at one time is 13 .
The pods are made up of adult females , their calves , and male and female juveniles .
' When sperm whales socialise , they often come together head first .
Every whale seems to be in physical contact with every other whale , and in addition to the psychological bonding contact may reinforce , their constant rubbing is also a handy way for them to remove dead skin .
' The area around each social group was filled with sheets of dead sperm whale skin , which resembles black plastic bags .
' Also striking was the repeated sonar clicks the whales used to communicate .
During social encounters , the sound of rhythmic clicking was overwhelming .
It felt like our bodies were shaking . '
Dominica is a small , volcanic island in the southern Caribbean and is less than two hours by plane from San Juan , Puerto Rico .
The Gulf oil spill is such a disaster of monstrous proportions -- one that makes the right - wing " drill baby drill " chants look , you know , ugly and moronic and short - sighted -- that you knew that somehow , the right - wing talkers would find a way to blame it on liberals .
Because they always do .
Sure enough .
Of course , they had to scrape down to X - Files Conspiracy Land to get there , but yesterday on Fox & Friends , ex-White House secretary Dana Perino and Fox talker Eric Bolling took turns at promoting a conspiracy theory that , somehow , the Obama administration had delayed attacking the leak because they wanted it to , as a way to shut down the offshore drilling that Obama had just announced the month before .
Or something like that .
Perino :
But we do n't know what happened .
And it will be interesting to me -- I 'm not trying to introduce a conspiracy theory , but was this deliberate ?
You know , you have to wonder -- yeah , if there was sabotage involved .
Bolling :
The question is -- and I saw Dana Perino earlier on the show saying , you know , why the delay in the response .
You guys were pointing out , nine days before it was even addressed , 12 days before he made a formal comment .
The question is : Did they let this thing leak ?
I mean , BP said maybe a thousand barrels a day , it went to five thousand .
Did they let it leak a little bit and say , boy I do n't know .
The conspiracy theorists would say , ' maybe they 'd let it leak for a while , and then they addressed the issue .
...
That would be a humongous accusation and probably the net result would be no different , but if they 're going to try and pull drilling , that may be the way they do it .
The were n't alone .
Limbaugh the Hutt was saying the same thing , only more explicitly :
Yep , El Rushbo believes " environmentalist whackos " may have blown up the oil rig to " head off more oil drilling " .
Just wait till that slick hits .
These people should need places to hide then .
Because really , this is going to transcend dumbass partisan gotcha games .
Yes , it 's a product of conservative governance , and we know who to look for when it comes time to assess blame .
But there will plenty of time for that later .
It was a great time of year to visit Toshogu Shrine , despite the renovations taken place .
I have lots more photos of Sakura in the main Ueno park and will have those ready to post soon .

The Federal Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) contracted a study to see how badly a deep water drilling oil spill would deplete the gulf of oxygen .
this study underestimated the current leak by a factor of 26 .
It was NOT peer reviewed and did not consider that the damage would occur at depth greater than 700 meters .
In other words , the determination of the potential impact of deep water drilling on the ecosystem by the federal agency that regulates these activities was a TOTAL SHAM .
The Gulf oxygen depletion zone or " Dead Zone " has been documented by environmentalists over the last 20 years .
This satellite image from NOAA is from 2008 .
The dead zone typically grows in the summer .
Scientists in Pennsylvania report that boosting production of crops used to make biofuels could make a difficult task to shrink a vast , oxygen - depleted “ dead zone ” in the Gulf of Mexico more difficult .
The zone , which reached the size of Massachusetts in 2008 , forms in summer and threatens marine life and jobs in the region .
Their study is scheduled for the Oct. 1 issue of ACS ’ semi-monthly journal Environmental Science & Technology .
-----
Now an immense amount of fossil - fuel gasses are being released into the ocean at the oil leak site .
How much gas is being released ?
A BP executive stated that they were removing 3000:1 gas to oil at the well before the explosion .
( thats 3000 cubic feet of gas for every barrel of oil )
The amount of oil leaking into the gulf is 25,000 to 70,000 barrels .
a 3000:1 ratio would mean 75 - 210 million cubic feet of gas per day being released .
There is 5.64 cubic feet of gas per barrel .
That would mean there is 13.3 to 37.2 million " barrels " of gas being released each day .
( note : this is at standard atmospheric temp and pressure .
At the ocean floor and 2,400 pounds per square inch , this gas is compressed by a factor of of over 1000 and will expand as it rises .
So , in the video coming out of the pipe it looks like 75,000 to 210,000 barrels of gas per day .
you see , what happens when methane is released into the gulf ?
It goes into solution .
There , in the deep ocean , it oxidizes , stripping the ocean of oxygen and forming carbon dioxide and water .
This report , contracted by MMS , and titled : " Deepwater Program : Understanding the Processes that Maintain the Oxygen Levels in the Deep Gulf of Mexico " was contracted to see what the effects of deepwater drilling would be on the oxygen content of the gulf .
They found that there are three regions of oxygen in the gulf , the oxygen - upper waters from 0 - 200 meters down , the oxygen minimum zone from 300 - 700 meters down , and the relatively dense , oxygen rich deep water brought by currents at a depth of 800 - 1500 meters .
it looks kind of like this , with the oxygen level going up again at deeper levels .
They found that the majority of dissolved oxygen in the deep water gulf is due to current inflow , which then circulates within the depths of the gulf , since the exit at the Florida keys is so shallow .
" For deeper waters , the major source is transport of relatively dense , oxygen - rich water masses through the Yucatan Channel into the Gulf interior "
The study goes on to say that ,
The Gulf of Mexico Basin is in no danger of becoming anoxic due either to natural processes , oil and gas production , or other anthropogenic effects .
Decreased oxygen levels , however , could occur in localized areas .
In this they are talking about NORMAL oil production occurrences .
they are also only looking at oxygen depletion caused by the long - term breakdown of oil .
Because discharges of oil or gas can consume oxygen during their degradation
Now , this is certainly going to occur , and for a long - long time , the oxygen rich waters flowing into the deep gulf will become depleted as the oil breaks down .
That is on the long term .
On the shorter term the real issue is the growing deep water dead zone of hydrocarbon - rich / oxygen - poor waters in the gulf at depths greater than 700 meters .
As this deep water dead zone moves into the loop current , it will recirculate in the gulf since the outflow of the gulf is at shallow depth .
( from the study )
The Gulf of Mexico is a semi-enclosed sea with two ports .
The
major inflow port is at the Yucatan Channel , which has a sill depth that is deep enough ( ~2,000 m ) to allow the transport of relatively dense , oxygen - rich deep source waters from the Atlantic Ocean into the Gulf from the Caribbean Sea .
The Loop Current brings these waters in .
The major outflow port at the Florida Straits is shallow enough ( ~800 m ) that the deeper , oxygen rich waters can mix into the interior of the Gulf , rather than flowing directly out with the Loop Current .
So the Deep Water Dead Zone of the gulf will recirculate within the gulf of mexico , moving up the shore of Florida and back toward the coasts of Louisiana .
It will spread through a majority of the area of the deep gulf .
This deep water oxygen depletion zone has the potential of killing most deep water sea life in the entire Gulf of Mexico .
-------------------------
More on the MMS study
This study by MMS on the effect of oxygen depletion on the gulf of mexico is woefully inadequate .
When they say that a " catastrophic oil spill " in the gulf would not lead to a " significant alteration of the oxygen supply " , they underestimated the amount of hydrocarbons leaked into the gulf by a factor of 26 .
( see below )
In the event of analysis of the potential effect on the gulf oxygen contents they only look at the effects of oxygen depletion caused by oil decomposition .
They estimate that :
Catastrophic oil spills can introduce hydrocarbons at 2 - 3 times the rate of natural seeps , but such an input will not significantly alter the oxygen supply .
There may be local effects from anthropogenic discharges , but the oxygen database is not adequate to assess them .
so , they say that the most catastrophic discharge will only be 2 - 3 times the natural seeps .
Let 's check that with reality .
. . why do n't we . . .
They say the natural seeps produce 140,000 +/- 60,000 Metric Tonnes of hydrocarbons per year .
They say a " catastrophic " leak will produce 2 - 3 times that amount per year .
1 barrel of oil per day = 50 Tonnes of oil per year ( approx )
current oil outflow is between 25,000 and 70,000 barrels per day
This equals 1.25 to 3.5 MILLION tonnes of oil per year .
at this rate , in the last 21 days between 71,918 and 201,370 metric tonnes of oil have ALREADY been released .
AND THAT IS JUST THE OIL
But what about the gases ?
the study says that the release above was hydrocarbons , not just oil .
from above :
That would mean there is 75 to 210 million cubic feet of gas being released each day
.
there are 44,872 cubic feet of natural gas in one metric ton of gas .
that means 1,671 to 4,680 metric tons of gas released each day .
how does that compare with 140,000 +/- 60,000 metric tons of hydrocarbons per year ???
609,900 to 1,710,000 metric tons of gas per year + 1,250,000 to 3,500,000 metric tons of oil per year
IT DOESN'T
woefully inadequate = the definition of MMS
------------------------------
additional comment on the study :
when they say :
Complete oxidation of the U.S. Gulf oil and gas reserves , which are on the order of 10 billion barrels , would consume < 1 % of the standing oxygen supply .
</ p>
They are talking about long - term oxygen depletion due to oxidation of hydrocarbons , not the effects of the immediate release .
They are also including the oxygen located in the super oxygen - rich shallow waters found between 0 - 70 meters down .
The decomposition of the oil will occur below the " oxygen minimum " barrier between the depths of 300 - 700 meters down .
This will provide a buffer zone where depletion in the deep water will be isolated from the oxygen rich surface and will draw exclusively from the deep - water oxygen reserves .
note that they add the caveat :
There may be local effects from anthropogenic discharges , but the oxygen database is not adequate to assess them .

Here is some supporting information :
The Gulf Oils Spill : " A Dead Zone in the Making " ?
Mississippi Scientists Find Oxygen Depletion Near Oil Leak
Oil Spill Science : The Smoking Gun
Understand the Processes that Maintain Oxygen Levels in the Deep Gulf of Mexico - an MMS study
--------------
I really think that this is the most significant issue .
The amount of natural gas being released is 3000 times more in mass than the oil .
But people only talk about the oil !
Oxygen depletion in the deep water zones is significant because there is a buffer of low - oxygen between depths of 300 and 700 meters .
All oxygen depletion that occurs due to the breakdown of hydrocarbons below this level will be isolated from the surface , leading to an even larger " dead zone " in the deep .
The MMS study is intentionally inadequate .
It is not peer reviewed and does not address the stratification of oxygen levels in the deep gulf waters .
This study was supposed to be looking at possible impacts of deep water drilling but underestimates the " worst case " scenario from what is currently happening in the gulf by a factor of 100,000 .
The fact that the natural gas is coming out at a rate of 3000:1 has not been mentioned in the media .
CNN is still reporting that 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels per day ) is the " general consensus " levels of oil .
A total misrepresentation .
It is up to the government to force BP to do a proper estimation of gas and oil leak rates using accurate measurements .

the calculation of this diary has been changed : a units conversion error needed to be fixed .
Thanks for pointing this out .
This is the calculation that has been addressed :
( Natural News ) The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) is reporting that a Miami psychiatrist has prescribed nearly 14 million pills to Medicaid patients since 2004 .
According to the report , Fernando Mendez - Villamil wrote about 285,000 prescriptions in just six years with a total taxpayer cost of $ 43 million .
The astounding find is part of an investigation into the legitimacy of Mendez - Villamil 's practice ; after all , the numbers suggest that he would have had to prescribe about 4,000 prescriptions a month , or 1,000 a week , in order to achieve the large total .
Mendez - Villamil is already recognized as the most profuse drug prescriber in the state of Florida .
Prior to the state 's implementation of new computer tracking protocols around 2007 , Mendez - Villamil 's prescription rate was at its highest ; after those measures began taking effect , his prescription rate slowed by almost 33 percent .
Mendez - Villamil 's highest year was 2004 when he issued over 62,000 prescriptions totaling $ 12.2 million .
The numbers averaged out to almost 2,700 patients that year who all received roughly 23 prescriptions each .
When all was said and done , each patient received an average of 1,200 pills in 2004 .
Senator Don Gaetz ( R - Niceville ) instigated the AHCA review into Mendez - Villamil , alleging that he is taking advantage of the system and wasting taxpayer money for illegitimate purposes .
Sen .
Gaetz is citing the case as evidence that better oversight of the Medicaid system is needed .
In response to a freedom - of - information request , the in - depth review he requested was published in When recently contacted about the issue , Mendez - Villamil refused to speak to the media .
His attorney made a statement in his defense , insisting that all such numbers are normal for the volume of patients seen by the doctor .
Mendez - Villamil did personally speak to the media back in December , however , where he explained that he typically sees patients for about 10 minutes every few months which allows him to see a large number of patients .
Most of these patients , he said , are on four or five drugs each , all of which he says are necessary .
According to the report , Mendez - Villamil often prescribes some of the most expensive psychotropic drugs to his patients , including Zyprexa which costs about $ 840 for a 30 - day supply .
Other common prescriptions include Abilify at over $ 630 a month and Seroquel at $ 430 .
In 2007 , the Bureau of Medicaid Program Integrity received a complaint about Mendez - Villamil which it handed over to the Attorney General 's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit .
The investigation is still in progress but , since receiving more intense scrutiny , Mendez - Villamil has reduced his number of patients by 25 percent .

The U.S. military is bankrolling all kinds of projects to harness the power of directed energy , from laser - equipped aircraft that can shoot down ballistic missiles to smaller beam weapons mounted on Humvees that could zap mortars or artillery shells .
The Navy is no exception :
It wants a shipboard laser that is powerful enough to destroy anti-ship missiles .
Defense giant Boeing now says it has completed the preliminary design of one such weapon , the Free Electron Laser , or FEL .
In a news release today , the company said it had presented its FEL design , which will operate by forcing a stream of high - energy electrons through a series of magnetic fields , creating a weapons - grade blast of laser light .
If it works , it would be the holy grail of military lasers .
For starters , it would able to blast though the atmosphere without losing too much strength ( see explanation here ) .
And it would have an unlimited magazine :
As long as the ship provided enough electrical power , it could keep on zapping .
Boeing is n't the only company working on such a project .
Last year , the Office of Naval Research awarded contracts to both Raytheon and Boeing for preliminary design work on FEL .
As we reported , this laser would be capable of reaching up to 100 kilowatts .
In theory , it would be a potential long - range replacement for the radar - guided Phalanx gun , the Navy 's current system for close - in defense from cruise missiles and other threats .
But as we noted last year , it 's all easier said than done .
Developing prototypes is n't enough :
The future Navy will need a fleet of futuristic , fully electric ships that generate enough power for these next - generation weapons .

The Breed Street Shul in Boyle Hts. has announced that they will soon begin classes for local residents to convert to Judaism .
The goal is to tie Latinos to Judaism so that when Latinos have more political power they will continue America ’s support for Isreal .
Ricardo Montoyiswich a recently converted Chicano Jew said , “ This will help re-establish the Jewish presence in Boyle Hts. and hopefully lure Canters back to the heights ! ”
Montoyiswich , who will be teaching several classes at the Shul , said his life has changed for the better since he made the switch .
“ As an actor I was having a hard time getting work , but out of no where , once I converted , I started getting all these cool gigs . ”
Some of the classes that will be offered include : “ Putting Down Those Whiny Santos , ” “ How To Leave La Virgen and still Love Your Mom , ” “ Circumcising The Chile : Grin and Bare It , ” “ Menorah and Dradle Care for Chicanos ( Do n’t smoke it and it ’s NOT Pon ) , ” and “ How To Trace Your Distant Jewish Roots . ”
Sleepy Tonatiuh , a next door neighbor to the Shul and proud Aztec dancer said , “ This ai n’t right .
They should be teaching people about the people on this land and how this land was stolen , just like the Isreali ’s stole Palestine . ”
He plans to protest the classes once they open by having his danza group do ceremonies during class time .
When asked for a response , Montoyiswich said , “ Sounds like that indio needs to see the play “ Palestine New Mexico ” and learn how Indians are Jewish . ”

CIOs must balance operational management with an entrepreneurial focus if their organistions are to make the most of growth opportunites in 2010 , according on analyst firm , Gartner .
The challenge is hardly new ; IT leaders are well aware of the need to move from the cost consolidation to revenue creation .
" For IT leaders , entrepreneurial growth , and the shift from a ' problem - focused ' organisation to one that is ' opportunity - focused ' requires more planning and execution than simply changing the organisation chart , " Gartner vice - president , Jorge Lopez , said .
" Entrepreneurial IT organisations must maintain a dual focus : Achieving ambitious growth , while running the current business .
Both are critically important to the mission of the organisation . "
Building of new sources of revenue and positioning the business for dominance in the new venture is an entrepreneurial task that requires an equally entrepreneurial CIO to seize the opportunity .
Gartner has outlined two key tools that the CIO must employ to satisfy ambitions for entrepreneurial growth ; frameworks that set the agenda — and actions — for change :
The entrepreneurial scope assessment framework
The framework enables CIOs and other business executives to evaluate the magnitude of the opportunity and understand the scope of the task facing IT , as well as other business units .
The strategic change roadmap
A level - by - level tool that helps assess the tasks that must be performed by an organisation in moving from the current mindset and behaviours of cutting costs to an entrepreneurial mindset .
It can help CIOs outline the current situation and compaire it to the desired future , identifying the required transformational changes around culture , organisation , infrastructure and processes .
Lopez said CIOs must evaluate two factors that were first defined by Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad in the book Competing for the Future .
The book challenged the commonly held idea that to win in business , you must have superior amounts of resources .
They contend that organisations which are in the best position to win business that seemed to win are those with ambition and resource leverage .
" Ambition is the animating entrepreneurial vision that redefines the rules of competition for an industry , " Lopez said .
" It deliberately sets out a compelling picture of the future that will outstrip existing resources to challenge incumbent competitors to match the magnitude of their vision . "
Resource leverage is based on the premise that large differences exist between different industry rivals and the competitive impact they are able to generate with a given amount of resources .
The ability to create greater distance between the required efforts and the results is an important distinction for the entrepreneur and , in doing so , establishes new levels of competition .
Lopez warned , however , that the move from a problem - focused organisation to an opportunity - focused organisation was not without risk .
" The greatest conflict faced by entrepreneurial CIOs will be the tension between the team that is focused on the entrepreneurial opportunities and the team that is focused on ' keeping the lights on ' , " he said .
" Both must function effectively in an environment of elevated risk .
Failing on either responsibility is unacceptable and highly dangerous for the business . "

Good Pope , Bad Pope
The scandal over the Catholic Church ’s handling of child sex abuse charges against priests has been building for years , but in recent weeks the controversy has focused closely on Pope Benedict XVI .
A New York Times article about the Vatican ’s handling of the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting hundreds of deaf boys and new revelations about abuse cases in the German church during Benedict ’s tenure as archbishop of Munich have raised questions about the pope ’s leadership .
Both his adversaries and defenders have been amping up the rhetoric .
On one side are those who see Benedict as central to the church ’s institutional corruption .
They argue that he has done little to punish abusive priests , pointing out that he reportedly ordered that trials be dealt with in secret and covered up known cases of abuse .
One the other side are those who see Benedict as the victim of an ideologically motivated media storm .
These defenders have counterattacked the media for blowing up baseless accusations and underestimating how much the pontiff has actually done to address the abuse problem .
The following are excerpts from some key voices on both sides of the good pope - bad pope debate — a fight that has , at this point , knocked down more than a few metaphorical pews .
Bad Pope :
Christopher Hitchens
Slate

For Ratzinger , the sole test of a good priest is this :
Is he obedient and discreet and loyal to the traditionalist wing of the church ?
We have seen this in his other actions as pope , notably in the lifting of the excommunication of four bishops who were members of the so - called Society of St. Pius X , that group of extreme - right - wing schismatics founded by Father Marcel Lefebvre and including the Holocaust - denying Richard Williamson .
We saw it when he was a cardinal , defending the cultish and creepy Legion of Christ , whose fanatical leader managed to father some children as well as to shield the molestation of many more .
And we see it today , when countless rapists and pederasts are being unmasked .
One of those accused in the Verona deaf - school case is the late archbishop of the city , Giuseppe Carraro .
Next up , if our courts can find time , will be the Rev. Donald McGuire , a serial offender against boys who was also the confessor and " spiritual director " for Mother Teresa .
( He , too , found the confessional to be a fine and private place and made extensive use of it . )
This is what makes the scandal an institutional one and not a matter of delinquency here and there .
The church needs and wants control of the very young and asks their parents to entrust their children to certain " confessors , " who until recently enjoyed enormous prestige and immunity .
It can not afford to admit that many of these confessors , and their superiors , are calcified sadists who cannot believe their luck .
Nor can it afford to admit that the church regularly abandoned the children and did its best to protect and sometimes even promote their tormentors .
So instead it is whiningly and falsely asserting that all charges against the pope — none of them surfacing except from within the Catholic community — are part of a plan to embarrass him .

The Catholic Church can never recover as long as its Holy Shepherd is seen as a black sheep in the ever - darkening sex abuse scandal .
Now we learn the sickening news that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , nicknamed " God ’s Rottweiler " when he was the church ’s enforcer on matters of faith and sin , ignored repeated warnings and looked away in the case of the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy , a Wisconsin priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys .
The church has been tone deaf and dumb on the scandal for so long that it ’s shocking , but not surprising , to learn from The Times ’s Laurie Goodstein that a group of deaf former students spent 30 years trying to get church leaders to pay attention .

" Should the pope resign ? "
No .
As the College of Cardinals must have recognized when they elected him , he is perfectly — ideally — qualified to lead the Roman Catholic Church .
A leering old villain in a frock , who spent decades conspiring behind closed doors for the position he now holds ; a man who believes he is infallible and acts the part ; a man whose preaching of scientific falsehood is responsible for the deaths of countless AIDS victims in Africa ; a man whose first instinct when his priests are caught with their pants down is to cover up the scandal and damn the young victims to silence : in short , exactly the right man for the job .
He should not resign , moreover , because he is perfectly positioned to accelerate the downfall of the evil , corrupt organization whose character he fits like a glove , and of which he is the absolute and historically appropriate monarch .
No , Pope Ratzinger should not resign .
He should remain in charge of the whole rotten edifice — the whole profiteering , woman - fearing , guilt - gorging , truth - hating , child - raping institution — while it tumbles , amid a stench of incense and a rain of tourist - kitsch sacred hearts and preposterously crowned virgins , about his ears .

We all know this game is now over .
The current Pope is now found directly responsible for two clear incidents of covering up or ignoring child abuse and rape .
As head of the organization that took responsibility for investigating these cases for so long , his complicity in this vast and twisted criminal conspiracy is not in dispute .
If he were the head of a secular organization , he would have already resigned and be cooperating with the police .
But he is the Vicar of Christ on earth .
It ’s hard to imagine a deeper crisis for the Catholic hierarchy than this .
If the church is to survive — and it will because it is the vessel of eternal truth — it will have to go through a wrenching transformation .
Beginning with the resignation of this Pope and an end to priestly celibacy .

The focus now is on Benedict .
What did he know ?
When did he know it ?
How did he act once he knew ?
The questions arise not only about his conduct in Munich , but … also as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
A March 25 Times story , citing information from bishops in the United States , reported that the Vatican had failed to take action against a priest accused of molesting as many as 200 deaf children while working at a school from 1950 to 1974 .
Correspondence reportedly obtained by the paper showed requests for the defrocking of the priest , Fr. Lawrence Murphy , going directly from U.S. bishops to Ratzinger , then head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith , and Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , now the Vatican secretary of state .
No action was taken against Murphy .
Like it or not , this new focus on the pope and his actions as an archbishop and Vatican official fits the distressing logic of this scandal .
For those who have followed this tragedy over the years , the whole episode seems familiar : accusation , revelation , denial and obfuscation , with no bishop held accountable for actions taken on their watch .
Yes , there is a depressing madness to this story .
Time after time , this is a story of institutional failure of the deepest kind , a failure to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ , a failure to put compassion ahead of institutional decisions aimed at short - term benefits and avoiding public scandal .
The strategies employed so far — taking the legal path , obscuring the truth , and doing everything possible to protect perpetrators as well as the church ’s reputation and treasury — have failed miserably .
We now face the largest institutional crisis in centuries , possibly in church history .
How this crisis is handled by Benedict , what he says and does , how he responds and what remedies he seeks , will likely determine the future health of our church for decades , if not centuries , to come .
It is time , past time really , for direct answers to difficult questions .
It is time to tell the truth .
Good Pope :
Cardinal William Levada
Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
Letter in response to the New York Times coverage of the scandal
March 26 , 2010
The Times editorial wonders " how Vatican officials did not draw the lessons of the grueling scandal in the United States , where more than 700 priests were dismissed over a three - year period . "
I can assure the Times that the Vatican in reality did not then and does not now ignore those lessons .
But the Times editorial goes on to show the usual bias : " But then we read Laurie Goodstein ’s disturbing report … about how the pope , while he was still a cardinal , was personally warned about a priest …
But church leaders chose to protect the church instead of children .
The report illuminated the kind of behavior the church was willing to excuse to avoid scandal . "
Excuse me , editors .
Even the Goodstein article , based on " newly unearthed files , " places the words about protecting the Church from scandal on the lips of Archbishop Weakland , not the pope .
It is just this kind of anachronistic conflation that I think warrants my accusation that the Times , in rushing to a guilty verdict , lacks fairness in its coverage of Pope Benedict .
As a full - time member of the Roman Curia , the governing structure that carries out the Holy See ’s tasks , I do not have time to deal with the Times ’s subsequent almost daily articles by Rachel Donadio and others , much less with Maureen Dowd ’s silly parroting of Goodstein ’s " disturbing report . "
But about a man with and for whom I have the privilege of working , as his " successor " Prefect , a pope whose encyclicals on love and hope and economic virtue have both surprised us and made us think , whose weekly catecheses and Holy Week homilies inspire us , and yes , whose pro-active work to help the Church deal effectively with the sexual abuse of minors continues to enable us today , I ask the Times to reconsider its attack mode about Pope Benedict XVI and give the world a more balanced view of a leader it can and should count on .

It has become an increasingly prevailing belief that as a cardinal , before he ascended to the papacy , Pope Benedict enabled a pedophile priest to do enormous harm .
This is false .
…
In June , 1998 , [ accused Wisconsin child molester Rev. Lawrence ]
Murphy wrote to Ratzinger , citing the fact that he had suffered strokes and asking to live out his days .
Ratzinger ’s deputy suggested letting Murphy accept banishment , a step short of full defrocking , if he admitted guilt and expressed remorse .
The Wisconsin bishop who had taken the case refused .
In August 1998 , two weeks before Murphy ’s impending death , the archbishop of Milwaukee reported to Rome that he had suspended the trial and would try to get letters of apology from Murphy .
The suspension order was never conveyed to the priest that headed the trial panel .
He says he would have fought such a command and that Murphy died while charges were still pending .
What exactly did then - Cardinal Ratzinger do wrong ?
His office approved the trial and waived the statue of limitations .
Those are not the makings of a coverup .

Serious mistakes have been made within the Catholic Church .
There is some misunderstanding about the Church , too .
Within the Church there is a legal structure , its canon law .
It is the duty of each diocesan bishop to administer that law .
Certain serious offences against that law have to be referred to the Holy See to ensure proper justice .
Some of these offences are not criminal in public law ( such as profanation of the sacraments ) , others ( such as offences against children ) are .
The role of the Holy See is to offer guidance to ensure that proper procedures are followed , including the confidentially needed to protect the good name of witnesses , victims and the accused until the trial is completed .
It is no different from any other responsible legal procedure .
This " secrecy " is nothing to do with the confidentiality , or " seal " of the confessional , which is protected for reasons of the rights of conscience .
…
What of the role of Pope Benedict ?
When he was in charge of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith he led important changes made in church law : the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children , the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18 , the case by case waiving of the statue of limitation and the establishment of a fast - track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders .
He is not an idle observer .
His actions speak as well as his words .

[ A]ll the criticism is obscuring something equally important :
For anyone who knows the Vatican ’s history on this issue , Benedict XVI is n’t just part of the problem .
He ’s also a major chapter in the solution .
…
After being elected pope , Benedict made the abuse cases a priority .
One of his first acts was to discipline two high - profile clerics against whom sex abuse allegations had been hanging around for decades , but had previously been protected at the highest levels .
He is also the first pope ever to meet with victims of abuse , which he did in the United States and Australia in 2008 .
He spoke openly about the crisis some five times during his 2008 visit to the United States .
And he became the first pope to devote an entire document to the sex - abuse crisis , his pastoral letter to Ireland .
What we are left with are two distinct views of the scandal .
The outside world is outraged , rightly , at the church ’s decades of ignoring the problem .
But those who understand the glacial pace at which change occurs in the Vatican understand that Benedict , admittedly late in the game but more than any other high - ranking official , saw the gravity of the situation and tried to steer a new course .
Pope Benedict XVI
Letter to the Catholics of Ireland
March 19 , 2010
On several occasions since my election to the See of Peter , I have met with victims of sexual abuse , as indeed I am ready to do in the future .
I have sat with them , I have listened to their stories , I have acknowledged their suffering , and I have prayed with them and for them .
Earlier in my pontificate , in my concern to address this matter , I asked the bishops of Ireland , " to establish the truth of what happened in the past , to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent it from occurring again , to ensure that the principles of justice are fully respected , and above all , to bring healing to the victims and to all those affected by these egregious crimes . "
…
To the victims of abuse and their families
You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry .
I know that nothing can undo the wrong you have endured .
Your trust has been betrayed and your dignity has been violated .
Many of you found that , when you were courageous enough to speak of what happened to you , no one would listen .
Those of you who were abused in residential institutions must have felt that there was no escape from your sufferings .
It is understandable that you find it hard to forgive or be reconciled with the Church .
In her name , I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel .
At the same time , I ask you not to lose hope .
It is in the communion of the Church that we encounter the person of Jesus Christ , who was himself a victim of injustice and sin .
Like you , he still bears the wounds of his own unjust suffering .
He understands the depths of your pain and its enduring effect upon your lives and your relationships , including your relationship with the Church .
I know some of you find it difficult even to enter the doors of a church after all that has occurred .
Yet Christ ’s own wounds , transformed by his redemptive sufferings , are the very means by which the power of evil is broken and we are reborn to life and hope .
I believe deeply in the healing power of his self - sacrificing love — even in the darkest and most hopeless situations — to bring liberation and the promise of a new beginning .
Not conservative enough
WHAT'S not to like about Senator Robert Bennett ?
The grandson of a Mormon leader and son of a senator , he is as much a part of Utah as the Great Salt Lake .
His conservative Republican credentials would have seemed impeccable not long ago — he opposes abortion , likes a flat tax and voted against Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court .
There were questions about his role in the Watergate scandal , but that was long ago , and Mr Bennett , 76 , has spent three terms in the Senate without notable sleaze or incompetence .
Other senators like him .
So do politicians in Utah .
Mitt Romney , still a star there , endorsed him for a fourth term .
And yet , in this unusual year , this was not enough for Utah 's Republicans .
At their convention on May 8th they ejected Mr Bennett unceremoniously from participating in the Republican primary on June 22nd .
Many of the 3,452 delegates , riled up by tea-party fervour , found his conservatism wanting and chose instead two relative unknowns , Tim Bridgewater , a businessman , and Mike Lee , a lawyer , to run against each other , on the assumption that they will both be ideologically pure .
This makes Mr Bennett the first incumbent senator from Utah in seven decades to lose his party 's nomination .
Suddenly , incumbents are trembling everywhere .
How did Utah's Republicans decide that Mr Bennett had strayed from the true path ?
He voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( TARP ) , part of the legislation ( passed by the Bush administration ) that was meant to prevent an economic depression and which the tea - party movement now calls “ bail - outs ” .
Some delegates were heckling Mr Bennett with shouts of “ TARP , TARP , TARP ” .
Others did not like Mr Bennett 's suspicious record of reaching across the aisle ; he worked with a Democrat to draft an alternative plan to reform health care .
Still others scorned his occasional success in winning federal favours for Utah , seeing this as proof that he is part of an earmark culture .
Whether Mr Bennett is a bellwether for other incumbents up for re-election remains to be seen .
Utah 's nomination process is unusual in that relatively few party faithful , through a caucus system , have the power to pre-select candidates for the primaries , knowing that Republicans invariably win the general election .
Had Mr Bennett faced all registered Republicans , he might have survived .
Tea - party candidates in states with traditional primaries have not done well so far .
But the movement now has high hopes for primaries such as Kentucky 's on May 18th , where Rand Paul , son of Ron , a libertarian presidential candidate , wants to stage another upset .
What seems certain is that this is an angry year .
“ The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment , ” Mr Bennett said , acknowledging his defeat with moist eyes .
But he added that he would not have changed his votes even if he had known that they would cost him his job .
That attitude used to be the mark of not just an honourable but an electable senator .
A trio of Google engineers have ported id Software 's gib - filled first - person shooter Quake II to browsers — you know , for kicks — as a way to show just what HTML5 compatible web browsers are capable of .

Unlike other browser based games , like Quake Live , no plug - in is required to play this version of Quake .
Of course , you 'll need a " bleeding edge browser " that supports the HTML5 spec , like Google 's own Chrome , but we 'll all get there someday .
( Check out Gizmodo 's helpful " Giz Explains " feature on HTML5 for more . )

Here 's how Google engineers did this in their spare time .
We started with the existing Jake2 Java port of the Quake II engine , then used the Google Web Toolkit ( along with WebGL , WebSockets , and a lot of refactoring ) to cross -compile it into Javascript .
You can see the results in the video above — we were honestly a bit surprised when we saw it pushing over 30 frames per second on our laptops ( your mileage may vary ) !

Pizza Stone
Use & Care
Pizza stones may crack or deteriorate with sudden changes in temperature .
So place your pizza stones in your oven before you turn it on .
Then preheat to maximum temperature for about an hour to get your stones to maximum heat .
Open the oven door as little as possible while pizza bakes .
When you ’ve removed the finished pizza , close the oven door as soon as possible and leave it closed till your oven has cooled .
Overnight , if possible .
Do n't worry about " cleaning " a pizza stone .
Pizza stones are beautiful when they 're ugly .
Anything that bakes to the surface of your stone should be wiped or very gently scraped off .
Avoid soaking or washing .
Every stain and streak is a mark of distinction , a badge of honor that proves you 've served in the pizza - making trenches !

Claim : Photograph shows a kayaker being trailed by a Great White shark .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2006 ]
Hello I received this photo today , supposedly taken off Capetown , can you verify it please ??
Hello I received this photo today , supposedly taken off Capetown , can you verify it please ??
Origins : Scarcely a week goes by in which we do n’t receive yet another photograph of a shark for verification ,
such is our fascination with these mysterious predators of the deep .
Of especial interest are pictures that show humans in ( apparently ) imminent danger from threatening
sharks , such as the infamous images of a diver attempting to board a helicopter just ahead of some breaching jaws ( fake ) and a surfer headed directly towards lurking trouble ( misidentified ) .
The image above displays , according to its caption , a kayaker “ sitting in a 3.8 - metre sea kayak and watching a four - metre great white approach . ”
This photograph is genuine and was taken from a September 2005 Africa Geographic article titled “ Shark Detectives , ” about researchers studying Great White sharks off the coast of South Africa , that described the circumstances under which this picture was snapped :
Sitting in a 3.8 - metre sea kayak and watching a four - metre great white approach you is a fairly tense experience .
Although we had extensively tested the sharks ’ reactions to an empty kayak and had observed no signs of aggression , this gave us little comfort as we eyed a great white heading straight for us , albeit slowly .
Just a metre or so from the craft it veered off , circled and slowly approached from behind .
It did this several times , occasionally lifting its head out of the water to get a better look .
Then it lost interest , and as it continued on its way we were able to follow a short distance behind .
Once we ’d come to terms with having nothing between ourselves and a four - metre shark except a thin layer of plastic , our kayak made an ideal research platform for observing great white behaviour in shallow water .
Its advantages are twofold : it is inconspicuous and appears not to cause the sharks to alter their behaviour for long , and it allows us to watch them in a natural situation , as it is not necessary to attract them to us with food .
A similar article appearing in the December 2005 issue of the South African publication The Big Issue included another photograph from the same sequence .

Outboard mirrors are to be banned from Formula 1 with effect from the Chinese Grand Prix in two weeks ' time , AUTOSPORT has learned , following concerns over poor visibility from sidepod - mounted mirrors creating a safety issue .
Several teams have mounted their mirrors on the sidepods of their cars for aerodynamic reasons , with Ferrari and Red Bull Racing 's mirror positioning the most dramatic .
But from Shanghai onwards , the mirrors will have to be fitted on the cockpit sides on safety grounds .
Drivers had said in Melbourne last weekend that they would be speaking to the FIA about the mirror problem .
Several issues of accidental blocking in practice were put down to poor rear visibility .
" Everyone has got a problem with mirrors , " said Sauber 's Pedro de la Rosa in Australia .
" The reality is that the mirrors on the sidepods , they give you very small vision of what is happening behind and they vibrate a lot so you see very little .
" So if you do n't have a lot of information coming from the radio , then you have a problem .
You can see when you have a car straight behind okay , but when it is two seconds behind you have no idea where it is .
" Everyone has the same problem , but since the mirrors have gone outboard this is a problem - as they are aerodynamic devices now . "
But Ferrari's Felipe Massa said he was quite happy with his team 's mirror design .
" I have no problem with my visibility , " he insisted .
" So , if it is the same I prefer to keep what I have , but we will see how it is going to be .
I hope we do n't lose anything moving the mirrors from one side to the other . "

" Perhaps the genius of ultra running is its supreme lack of utility .
It makes no sense in a world of space ships and supercomputers to run vast distances on foot .
There is no money in it and no fame , frequently not even the approval of peers .
But as poets , apostles and philosophers have insisted from the dawn of time , there is more to life than logic and common sense .
The ultra runners know this instinctively .
And they know something else that is lost on the sedentary .
They understand , perhaps better than anyone , that the doors to the spirit will swing open with physical effort .
In running such long and taxing distances they answer a call from the deepest realms of their being -- a call that asks who they are . "
-- David Blaikie , Ultramarathon Canada
( Mental Floss ) --
For centuries , philosophers claimed that the ability to make tools separated man from beast .
But in 1960 , a young wildlife researcher named Jane Goodall told her boss , anthropologist Louis Leakey , that she 'd witnessed chimpanzees stripping leaves from twigs and using them to " fish " for termites .
A stunned Leakey responded , " Now we must redefine tool , redefine Man , or accept chimpanzees as humans . "
Of course , we now know that chimps were only the beginning .
1. Elephants drink bottled water
Not only do elephants use branches to swat flies and scratch their backs , but they also use tools to plan for the future .
In South Africa , biologist Hezy Shoshani observed a pachyderm chewing bark into a large ball and then using the ball to plug up a nearby watering hole .
The result was an elephant - size water bottle !
Later , the animal came back to the spot , removed the ball , and quenched his thirst again .
2. Dolphins cover their mouths
In addition to bouncing balls on their noses , dolphins are also handy with sponges .
Georgetown University researcher Janet Mann reported that bottlenose dolphins in Australia 's Shark Bay have been seen carrying sea sponges in their mouths while fishing along the ocean floor .
When they dig into the sand to stir up hidden fish , the sponges apparently act as a kind of mask .
But , of the thousands of bottlenose dolphins identified in Shark Bay , only 41 have been observed doing this .
Almost all of them were female , and the behavior seems to be something mothers teach their daughters .
3 . Owls make the most out of cow poop
Some burrowing owls have a strange habit of scattering cow manure around the entrances to their homes in the ground .
Until recently , scientists thought this behavior evolved as a way to mask the owls ' scent from potential predators .
But researchers recently determined that the cow manure actually functions as bait to lure dung beetles , one of the owls ' favorite foods .

4. Vultures cast stones
Egyptian vultures love the taste of ostrich eggs , but they can't break the thick shells by just pecking at them .
So hungry vultures go in search of rocks for the job , sometimes venturing up to 50 yards away .
When they return , they dip their heads violently and hurl their rock at the egg , smashing open the shell .
Surprisingly , this technique appears to be an innate behavior .
When presented with tasty eggs , even vultures raised alone in captivity will go hunting for stones .
5 . Crows have a lot to crow about
New Caledonian crows are widely renowned as the tool - using champs of the bird kingdom .
To hunt for insects , they shape sticks into hooks and spears that allow them to probe tree crevices .
They also modify those sticks into the correct size and shape by whittling them with a complex process of snips and tears .
What 's more , New Caledonian crows can make new tools out of old ones and pass along their new inventions to others .

6. Chimps build nutcrackers
Chimpanzees of the Ivory Coast 's Tai Forest are the Bob Villas of their species .
In order to crack open the hard oil - palm nuts they adore , the chimps use two tools at once .
First , they place a nut on a flat stone for traction , then they smash it with a pointed hammer - like stone .
The skill takes young chimps several years to master , but once they get the hang of it , they 'll store their favorite tool sets in certain places and bring their nuts there for cracking .
A recent archaeological dig found that Tai Forest chimps have been making nutcrackers like these for 4,000 years .
7 . Herons go fishing
Like Jane Goodall 's chimpanzees , wild green - backed herons " fish " for their food .
Using insects , feathers , or even flowers , they drop their clever bait into the water and then gobble up the curious fish that come to the surface for a meal .
Herons can be remarkably persistent fishermen , too .
Reportedly , one researcher in Africa watched a heron drop the same bait into the water 28 times in a row before a fish finally bit .

US special forces soldiers dug bullets out of their victims ' bodies in
the
bloody aftermath of a botched night raid , then washed the wounds with
alcohol before lying to their superiors about what happened , Afghan
investigators have told The Times .
Two pregnant women , a teenage girl , a police officer and his brother
were shot
on February 12 when US and Afghan special forces stormed their home in
Khataba village , outside Gardez in eastern Afghanistan .
The precise
composition of the force has never been made public .
The claims were made as NATO admitted responsibility for all the deaths
for
the first time last night .
It had initially claimed that the women had
been
dead for several hours when the assault force discovered their bodies .
" Despite earlier reports we have determined that the women were
accidentally
killed as a result of the joint force firing at the men , " said
Lieutenant - Colonel Todd Breasseale , a NATO spokesman .
The coalition
continued to deny that there had been a cover - up and said that its legal
investigation , which is ongoing , had found no evidence of inappropriate
conduct .
The Kabul headquarters of General Stanley McChrystal , the commander of
US and
Nato forces , claimed originally that the women had been " tied up , gagged
and
killed " .
A senior Afghan official involved in a government investigation told The
Times : " I think the special forces lied to McChrystal . "
" Why did the special forces collect their bullets from the area ? " the
official
said .
" They washed the area of the injuries with alcohol and brought out
the
bullets from the dead bodies .
The bodies showed there were big holes . "
The official , who asked not to be named until the results of the
investigation
have been made public , said that the assault force sealed off the
compound
from 4 am , when the raid started , to 11 am , when Afghan officials from
Gardez
were finally allowed access to the house .
At least 11 bullets were fired during the raid , the investigator said ,
and the
shooting was carried out by two American gunmen positioned on the roof
of
the compound .
Only seven bullets were recovered from the scene .
" I asked McChrystal , ‘ why did the Americans clean some of the bullets
from the
area ? '
They do n't have the right to do that , " the official said .
Haji Sharabuddin , the head of the family who were attacked , told The
Times
last month that troops removed bullets from his relatives ' bodies , but
his
claims were impossible to verify .
The hallway where four of the five
victims
were killed had been repainted and at least two bullet holes had been
plastered over .
Video footage of the raid 's aftermath , collected by Afghan
investigators ,
shows close - up shots of one man 's bloodstained and punctured torso and
walls
with blood on them .
The Afghan official 's conclusion that the bullets
were
removed is based on the testimony of survivors , analysis of the
photographs
and the missing bullets .
NATO promised a joint forensic investigation in a statement issued after
the
raid , but Rear Admiral Greg Smith , the coalition 's director of
communications in Afghanistan , said that this had proved impossible
because
the bodies were buried the same day in accordance with Islamic custom .
Instead Afghanistan 's Ministry of Interior sent its top criminal
investigator
from Kabul , and a Canadian brigadier - general led a separate military
inquiry .
The Afghan investigation differed in one respect from The Times '
findings .
Survivors told this newspaper that Saranwal Zahir , the police
officer 's brother , was shot when he tried to shout that his family was
innocent .
The women , who were crouching behind him , were killed in the
same
volley of fire .
Afghan investigators believe that Mr Zahir was carrying
an
AK47 and wanted to avenge his brother 's killers .
The women were
clustered
around him , trying to pull him inside the house , when the second US
gunman
opened fire , killing all four of them .
Footage collected by the Afghan team also shows a man in United States
Army
uniform taking pictures of the bodies .
The findings have not been made
public .
The Interior Ministry is expected to pass a report to the
Attorney - General 's office , which will decide whether or not it can press
criminal charges .
The family had more than 25 guests on the night of the attack , as well
as
three musicians , to celebrate the naming of a newborn child .
" In what culture in the world do you invite ... people for a party and
meanwhile kill three women ? " asked the senior official .
" The dead bodies
were just eight meters from where they were preparing the food .
The
Americans , they told us the women were dead for 14 hours . "
In a statement yesterday , Brigadier - General Eric Tremblay , a NATO
spokesman ,
said : " We deeply regret the outcome of this operation , accept
responsibility
for our actions that night , and know that this loss will be felt forever
by
the families .
" The force went to the compound based on reliable information in search
of a Taliban insurgent , and believed that the two men posed a threat to their
personal safety .
We now understand that the men killed were only trying
to
protect their families . "

Not mine : Make A Difference
This blog post was forwarded to me recently ; based on the timing , it ’s possible this was prompted by the flurry of memetic attention that Useless Fliers was getting a few weeks back , though I do n’t know for sure .
It could as easily be coincidence , or something older recently noticed .
In any case , its interesting to see the subversion of traditional flier utility kept in check while the uselessness of my own designs is abandoned in favor of some sort of effort to encourage good in the world .
( Or at least to encourage difference - making , I suppose ; will this be the pulltab that inspires the next supervillain ?
Perhaps I can defend my own work by comparison by claiming it will , at worst , inspire the next mildly annoying dadist ? )
The figures are a ' worst case scenario '
The growth of illegal file - sharing could cost European countries 1.2 m jobs and 240bn euros ( £ 215 bn ) by 2015 , an industry report claims .
The study , commissioned by an industry body and endorsed by trade unions , studied the impact of web piracy in Germany , UK , France , Italy and Spain .
It claims that without measures to curb piracy , the UK alone could lose up a quarter of a million jobs by 2015 .
But campaigners described the report as " corporate propaganda " .
' Need for action '
The study , conducted by economics firm TERA Consultants on behalf of the International Chamber of Commerce , said that the UK 's creative industries experienced losses of 1.4bn euros in 2008 because of piracy .
Brendan Barber , General Secretary of the TUC , said that the results showed piracy was a " major threat to the creative industries in terms of loss of employment and revenues " .
" If there was ever the proof needed to demonstrate why the Digital Economy Bill is imperative for the protection of our creative industries , this report is it , " he said .
DIGITAL ECONOMY BILL Legal framework for tackling copyright infringement via education and technical measures New duties for Ofcom to assess the UK 's communications infrastructure every two years Modernising spectrum to increase investment in mobile broadband Framework for the move to digital radio switchover by 2015 Updating Channel 4 functions to encompass public service content , on TV and online Age ratings compulsory for all boxed video games aimed at those over 12 years
Web giants oppose copyright plans The Digital Economy Bill was outlined in the Queen 's speech in November 2009 .
It includes various proposals to tackle illegal file - sharing including a so - called " three strikes " element , which would see persistent pirates cut off from the net .
It also includes element that would give courts the power to block websites that facilitate copyright infringement .
The bill has been passed by the Lords and is now expected to be rushed through the Commons before the general election .
There has been a groundswell of opposition to the Bill from firms such as British Telecom , Google and Facebook , which say that elements of the bill could undermine free speech on the net without reducing copyright infringement .
A campaign has also started on the internet encouraging people to write to their MP to stop the government rushing the bill through " without proper debate " Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group ( ORG ) is a vocal opponent of the Digital Economy Bill and the new research .
" I am fed up of hearing corporate propaganda being deployed in order to justify intrusions on our rights to freedom of speech , privacy and to a fair trial , " he said .
" We have no truck with infringement of copyright , but it is shameful that anyone from the Labour movement can attempt to justify removal of vital services such as the internet as a punishment . "
To me , piracy is something adventurous , it makes you think about Johnny Depp
Agnete Haaland
International Actors ' Federation
The ORG recently revealed that certain amendments to the bill proposed in the House of Lords - but not passed - had been drafted by music industry group the BPI .
" Members of the Labour movement spent decades fighting for people 's rights to basic services , education , and political organisation : they need to ask themselves where their true values lie , " said Mr Killock .
" Are they with Gordon Brown 's call to recognise the internet as just as vital for the today 's citizens as water , gas and electricity ; or are they with music industry lobbyists , calling on Parliament to infringe people 's human rights ? "
Piracy plan
The new report used data from EU countries , the World Intellectual Property Organization and Eurostat , the EU 's statistical gathering arm .
It said its figures were a worst case scenario based on consumer Web traffic growing 24 % annually .
The report said that European creative industries generated 860bn euros and employed 14.4 m million people in 2008 .
In the same year it estimates that 10bn euros and 186,000 jobs were lost across Europe .
Extrapolating that data , it suggests that up to 1.2 million jobs and 240 billion euros worth of European commerce could be wiped out by 2015 .
In the UK alone , losses could be up to 254,000 jobs and 7.8bn euros , it said .
According to the UK government , the creative industries in the UK employ around 2 million people .
Agnete Haaland , the president of the International Actors ' Federation , which supports the research , said that education was key to tackling piracy .
" We should change the word piracy , " she said .
" To me , piracy is something adventurous , it makes you think about Johnny Depp .
" But we 're talking about a criminal act .
We 're talking about making it impossible to make a living from what you do . "
She urged the European Parliament to implement rules to tackle online piracy .

A pedestrian sting operation in Glendale , in which a police officer dressed as a rabbit , has sparked controversy , with one councilman calling it “ breathtakingly dangerous . "
For an hour and a half , Police Officer Tom Broadway donned the eye - catching costume during an enforcement sting aimed at educating motorists about yielding to pedestrians walking along unmarked crosswalks .
Police cited 24 motorists on suspicion of failing to yield as Broadway walked across Central Avenue .
“ One of the violators said he was confused by it , ” Sgt. Dennis Smith told the News - Press .
“ He said he hopped in front of him . ”
Police said the sting was about more than just enforcement , with officers also taking time to educate motorists .
But the operation infuriated Councilman John Drayman , who said he learned of the sting only after it had taken place .

All the statistics in the world can't measure the warmth of a smile .
Dental Portland
KABUL , Afghanistan 
The two Afghan girls had every reason to expect the law would be on their side when a policeman at a checkpoint stopped the bus they were in .
Disguised in boys ’ clothes , the girls , ages 13 and 14 , had been fleeing for two days along rutted roads and over mountain passes to escape their illegal , forced marriages to much older men , and now they had made it to relatively liberal Herat Province .
Instead , the police officer spotted them as girls , ignored their pleas and promptly sent them back to their remote village in Ghor Province .
There they were publicly and viciously flogged for daring to run away from their husbands .
Their tormentors , who videotaped the abuse , were not the Taliban , but local mullahs and the former warlord , now a pro-government figure who largely rules the district where the girls live .
Neither girl flinched visibly at the beatings , and afterward both walked away with their heads unbowed .
Sympathizers of the victims smuggled out two video recordings of the floggings to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , which released them on Saturday after unsuccessfully lobbying for government action .
Six months following their fight of the year performance at WEC 43 , lightweight champion Benson Henderson and Donald “ Cowboy ” Cerrone are one week away from doing it all over again at WEC 48 , except this time the bout will air live on Pay - Per - View .
However , one fighter in the WEC 155 - lbs division does not feel that Cerrone has done much to warrant a third title shot .
WEC lightweight and UFC veteran Alex Karalexis recently spoke with Heavy.com and expressed his frustrations regarding Cerrone .
“ What has “ Cowboy ” done ?
This is going to be his third title loss if he loses .
To me , he has n’t made a name for himself as far as he has n’t beaten anyone that he was n’t supposed to beat , ” Karalexis said .
“ All he ’s done so far is his job .
What , because the guy walks around with his cowboy hat on and has that TapouT deal and they promote him ? ”
“ [ Cerrone ] has n’t impressed me .
Just because he ’s good at taking a beating , like , I do n’t get it .
I ’m confused .
He ’s talented , he ’s a good fighter and he brings it , so I know why the fans like him .
I enjoy watching him fight , but I ’m sitting here watching him get all these title shots and I ’m thinking why ?
Just because he ’s beating kids he ’s supposed to beat ?
Maybe I ’m old school , ” Karalexis said with a chuckle .
After a one - year hiatus due to injuries , Karalexis ( 1 - 2 UFC , 4 - 2 WEC ) will also be competing at WEC 48 against Anthony Pettis on the preliminary card that will air live on Spike TV .
The Boston native acknowledges Cerrone ’s toughness , but does not believe “ Cowboy ” should be receiving multiple opportunities when others who have been working just as hard and have not been granted one .
“ He ’s got to do something , I mean , how many opportunities is this kid going to get ? ” Karalexis said .
“ He better win this fight .
If he does n’t , what are they going to do with him ?
He ’s lost three title fights !
I ’ve been here for how long and I have n’t even gotten one . ”
Cerrone ’s losses to Jamie Varner and Henderson were close bouts in which Cerrone displayed tremendous heart – but they were still defeats .
“ Cowboy ” followed both of those losses up with submission victories over James Krause and Ed Ratcliff , but Karalexis is not impressed .
“ It ’s like dude you lost two [ expletive ] title fights , you got beat both times .
What ’s your claim to fame ?
You beat up a washed up Rob McCullough ?
Where ’s Rob now ?
So , it ’s like know your role and do n’t walk around like a [ expletive ] bad ass because you have n’t done anything yet , ” Karalexis said .
One would think that Karalexis will be paying close attention to the championship fight this Saturday considering his potential victory over Pettis would steer him in the right direction for a coveted lightweight title shot .
That is n’t necessarily the case as Karalexis is not entirely concerned about getting to the title .
In fact , so long as he is getting paid , the heavy - handed striker would be willing to fight the Cerrone / Henderson winner in a non -title affair .
“ I could n’t care less how [ the Cerrone / Henderson ] fight is going to go , I ’ll smack up either one of them .
Title fight , non - title fight , I do n’t give a [ expletive ] , just whatever , ” Karalexis said .
“ That ’s the point where I ’m at right now .
I will fight the champion in a non - title bout ; let ’s go back to the old WWF style .
With the way the economy is , I ’m just happy to have a [ expletive ] job right now .
I ’ll take the title money but you can keep your [ expletive ] belt . ”
If Karalexis defeats Pettis , and Cerrone comes up short against Henderson , we could see the Bostonian step into the cage with “ Cowboy ” sooner rather than later .
“ I ’ve got my hands full with Pettis and I am not looking past him , but “ Cowboy ” is a punk , so whatever [ expletive ] him .

A Feminist�s U - Turn : A Torrid Tale of Disappointment and Discovery
by Megan Carpentier
When my parents instilled in me the belief that I could do anything a boy could do , I ’m not sure they really knew what they were going to get .
They probably pictured me playing baseball ( I turned to ballet ) and taking calculus ( I chose car repair ) , but what they got was a hard - cursing , Feminine Mystique - reading , hyper - independent , precociously - sexual hellion who set off a pitched battle at the age of 16 when she announced she was refusing confirmation into the Catholic Church on the basis of its opposition to abortion and birth control and its 2,000 - year - old refusal to allow women into leadership roles .
In other words , they ’d raised a feminist .

I suppose I qualified as a third - wave feminist , not that I knew what that was when I was a teenager .
I was shocked to find out the Equal Rights Amendment had n’t ever passed , pissed that I could expect to be out - earned by my male peers ( even the ones I was beating at academics ) , fired up about domestic violence in my school and even more about the importance of Roe v. Wade .
I also coped with a less - than - thorough schooling about my body at home by educating myself as best I could about what my body was doing ( and would do ) .
I expected the few boys I dated to treat me as an equal ( and acted like I was ) and I refused to buy into the virginity - equals - wholesomeness message .
I also got into what I later learned was called the intersectionality between women ’s rights and other social justice issues but saw as an important part of the equality my parents taught me was important : standing up for my friends who were out or who coped , as best they could , with being people of color in a very majority - white and sometimes unfriendly environment .
I tried hard to incorporate the messages my parents taught me about how everyone is equal into the way I treated people and the politics I supported , trying out that whole personal - is - political thing before anyone told me what it was .
Of course , the girl whose friends would get her a vibrator and a copy of Backlash for her Sweet Sixteen -- let alone the one who goes on a lobbying day in her state capital with the League of Women Voters -- is going to end up taking women ’s studies classes in college , and so it went with me , once I ’d disposed of prerequisites , distribution requirements and the move from the English department to the sociology department .
But my semester stuck in “ Introduction to Women ’s Studies ” came at a price : the cost of my overt feminism .
It was n’t like it disappeared all at once .
It was more like it came off the way you put weight on , pound by ignored pound , until you look at yourself in the mirror one day and no longer recognize the person in it .
First , the requirement that we keep a daily personal journal to be reviewed for its feministiness by the professor inspired a resurgence in teenage - style eye rolls and series of faux - incidents with which to populate it .
A rigorous introduction to feminist theory -- where was Friedan ?
Steinem ?
Even Paglia ? -- was replaced by rambling lectures about personal experience from the professor and books about “ Important Women ” ( mostly white ) that ran counter to my academic experiences with structural history in the history department and my increasing interest in stratification theory -- and the intersection of race , class and gender in society -- that I found so fascinating in the sociology department .
Oh , we learned about Dworkin , but there was no discussion about sex-positive feminism .
We learned about rape culture in a mandatory group discussion of our experiences with sexual assault that did n’t take into account that the survivors in the group might not be ready , willing or able to relate to a group of students and a professor those experiences .
We learned about gender pay equity in one class , and the problems faced by women of color in another -- and the idea that race and gender are both part of the kyriarchy that oppresses everyone but straight , white men remained unexplored .
Losing the Faith
But it was when the professor told us that , one day , when sexism is over , the government could make abortion illegal again , that I truly lost it -- both my patience and , as it turns out , the A that I ’d been biting my tongue to earn .
She presented this nugget of information not as an idiosyncratic view of her feelings about abortion , but as a tenet of feminist thinking about abortion , and it was one that stood in opposition to everything I understood about abortion and its importance to the feminist movement
I asked questions .
Who would get to decide that sexism is over -- a majority vote of the still mostly - white and mostly - male Congress ?
A national plebiscite ?
Does the end of sexism mean that no one is ever raped again , even by the emotionally disturbed ?
Do feminists really concede that abortion is wrong - but - necessary , and is n’t that just feeding into the stigma attached to it ?
It ’s hard to ignore a raised hand in a room of 12 students , and harder when the student is n’t going to be ignored -- and the sheer stupidity of the idea that abortion policy should be based on a political decree that sexism is “ over ” was just too much for me to bear .
Shutting up was a lesson my parents had n't managed to instill in me .
For my professor , the challenge seemed to be more than she was willing to take .
There was no Socratic give - and - take that I ’d come to love about my other classes ; I was supposed to accept that she was right , I was wrong and that what she said was feminist gospel .
Shutting up was a lesson that my parents had n’t quite managed to instill in me , but if my professor ’s word was Feminist Gospel , then I was n’t sure where I belonged any longer .
I was just sure that , if she was the Perfect Feminist , then I was n’t willing to sacrifice what I thought about women ’s equality to be one .
It was a disheartening experience .
I supported pro-choice politicians with my votes and my voice , but it never crossed my mind to support women ’s groups with my ( admittedly limited ) money .
I eventually became a lobbyist in Washington , D.C. , and lived the dreaded gender wage gap and had the joyful experience of informing no less than two bosses about the sexual harassment I was experiencing from politicians , it never occurred to me that this is part of what galvanized a generation of feminists before me .
But then two friends of mine who worked on reproductive justice issues asked me to join them for the March for Women ’s Lives in 2004 , and we hopped on a train full of women and went down to the National Mall .
We ended up standing , briefly , by a booth staffed by NARAL volunteers who were overwhelmed with stickers and buttons to hand out and questions to answer .
They asked me if I could take a few and hand them .
Streaming Crowds , Streaming Words
For two hours , as the crowds streamed past me , I handed out 20,000 stickers to the people marching .
I handed them to women and men ; to young people and old .
I gave them to lesbian couples with children and straight couples with dogs ; I stuck them to strollers and toddlers ’ cheeks ; I pulled off five at a time for teenagers to bring back to their classmates and ten at a go for women who were my mom ’s age to give out to their friends .
And I just looked at the faces as they all marched past me , and the metaphor got to be too obvious , even to me .
Feminism was n’t the Rich White Lady version presented by my college professor ; it was n’t a fait accompli ; and there were plenty of people that did n’t view abortion access as a stopgap measure on the road to equality , but as a piece of the equality for which we were all still fighting .
And while I still had to get up and go to work the following Monday , I decided I did n’t have to wait around for my company to pay me at a rate equal to my male colleagues .
I started reading again ; I started getting more active in politics .
The discussions I 'd missed in women 's studies , I found on the Internet .
Eventually , I started writing and then blogging ; first for myself , and eventually for others , but always under a pseudonym .
My sex-positivity in a column for the once - female headed Wonkette caused commenters to speculate that I was n’t actually a woman -- a comment that amused my father to no end .
The more I wrote , and thought , and read and shook off years of ignoring everything that had initially interested me in politics , the more untenable my career path in lobbying became .
Flash forward to 2007 , when I was laid off from my latest lobbying gig .
With time on my hands in a suddenly iffy economy , I published my first piece on Jezebel.com , a relatively new women ’s website : it was a satire of the breathless celebrity interview , a staple of women ’s magazines , but the “ celebrity ” was a foreign policy analyst .
A couple more pieces led to a guest - blogging spot , where I wrote about everything from my search for a contraceptive that worked with my body to a host of other subjects : statutory rape laws , how they are disproportionately applied and have negative effects on young women ’s access to reproductive health services ; abortion ; circumcision ; pornography ; evil health insurance companies , and workplace issues .
I engaged with a commenting community , with editors , with critics and fans , and , best of all , with other feminists writers who were mostly my age and younger .
The discussions I ’d missed in my women ’s studies class , I found on the Internet ; the conversations that I ’d needed to make me think harder , better and more critically about gender equity , intersectionality , the personal and the political , I found ten years later outside of the classroom and in the company of strangers I might never actually meet .
Writing about women ’s issues made me learn more about those issues and the feminist theories about them than hours in a classroom ever did , and allowed me to finally feel right reclaiming the word “ feminist ” for myself .

There are many important and urgent questions about the man accused of trying to set off a car bomb in Times Square .
Officials say Faisal Shahzad admitted to the attempt and said he learned bomb - making at a camp in Pakistan .
Is Mr. Shahzad indeed connected to the Pakistani Taliban , which American officials now say seems likely ?
Was he working with others in this country who may be at large ?
How did Mr. Shahzad , a naturalized citizen whose family includes a senior Pakistani military officer , end up trying to murder countless people ?
There are questions , too , about how the F.B.I. lost track of Mr. Shahzad for a time and why he was allowed to board an international flight despite a special alert issued by United States authorities .
The answers to such questions directly affect the security of Americans , and law enforcement officials are beginning to get them .
That has n’t stopped a familiar group of politicians from cynically trying to use this incident as yet another excuse to weaken the rule of law and this country ’s barely recovering reputation .
It soon became apparent that the family group called Family 3 , which for decades had ranked second to a group called Family 1 , had staged a coup .
Family 3 had grown larger than Family 1 several years before .
But Family 1 , headed by a savvy matriarch named Cocobean , had retained incumbency through authority , diplomacy , and momentum .
A week or so before the coup , however , one of Cocobean ’s daughters , Pearl , had been moved from the enclosure to the veterinary facility because her kidneys seemed to be failing .
Family 1 ’s most formidable male , meanwhile , had grown old and arthritic .
Pearl was especially close to Cocobean and , as the only daughter without children of her own , was particularly likely to defend her .
Her absence , along with the male ’s infirmity , created a vulnerable moment for Family 1 .
“ This may have been in the works for a couple weeks , ” Novak says .
“ But as far as we can reconstruct , the actual event , the night before we found the monkeys in the parking lot , started when a young female named Fiona ” — a 3 - year - old Family 1 member , a borderline bully known to have initiated many a scuffle — “ started something with someone in Family 3 .
It escalated .
Family 3 saw its chance .
And they just started to take Family 1 out .
You could see it from who was wounded and who was n’t , and who was sitting in preferred places , and who was run out of the colony , and who was suddenly extremely deferential .
One other female in Family 1 , Quark , was killed ; another , Josie , was hurt so badly we had to put her down .
They ’d gone after all of Cocobean ’s other daughters , too .
Somebody had bitten the big male in Family 1 so badly he could n’t use his arm .
Fiona got roughed up pretty bad .
It was a very systematic scuffle .
They went right at the head of the group and worked their way down . ”
Soon after Novak described all this to me , he and I walked around the enclosure .
Though it was the middle of a broiling July day , downtime for the monkeys , you could see hints of the new order .
Family 3 calmly occupied what seemed to be the new center of power , a corncrib near the pond ( one of several corncribs set out for shelter ) .
They groomed one another , napped , and evenly stared at us as we stared at them .
A more nervous bunch clustered in another crib down the hill .
When we got within 30 feet , the largest monkey in the group shot up onto the cage bars .
From 10 feet up it screamed at me , rattled the bars , and showed some nasty teeth .
From there I went to Suomi ’s office and asked him what he thought had happened .
Suomi has thought a lot about this coup , and it ’s easy to see why .
All of the important threads he ’d been weaving together in his research were on display in this revolt : the importance of early experience ; the interplay of environment , parenting , and genetic inheritance ; the maddening primacy of family and social bonds ; the repercussions of different traits in different circumstances .
And now , in light of the orchid hypothesis , he was beginning to see that the threads might be woven together in a new way .
The famous ' surgeon 's photograph ' of Nessie , later revealed to be a hoax A police chief believed the existence of a Loch Ness monster was " beyond doubt " , according to a historical document .
In 1938 , the chief constable of Inverness - shire raised concerns about protecting Nessie from hunters .
In a letter he wrote : " That there is some strange creature in Loch Ness now seems beyond doubt . "
The document has been released by the National Archives of Scotland ( NAS ) as part of an exhibition .
The government file reflects how ministers handled the issue of the existence of Nessie .
Reports of a monster in Loch Ness date back to 565 AD , when St Columba was said to have encountered a strange water beast .
That there is some strange creature in Loch Ness seems now beyond doubt , but that the police have any power to protect it is very doubtful
William Fraser
Chief constable of Inverness - shire
But alleged sightings gathered pace in the 1930s , with a series of grainy photographs of the " monster " appearing in newspapers .
In 1933 , the Scottish Office was asked to confirm the existence of a monster or sea serpent in Loch Ness .
A parliamentary question was tabled in the House of Commons asking whether , in the interests of science , an investigation would be launched into the creature 's existence , but the question was ridiculed by the press at the time .
Ministers and civil servants were sceptical , but the documents show consideration was given to issues such as stationing observers round the loch to capture Nessie on camera and whether it would be possible to trap the monster without injury .
In the end it was felt that as the creature was popular with the public , it would be better not to kill either it or the myth .
However , this did not stop hunters from flocking to Loch Ness in the hope of capturing the monster .
Police protection
The letter from William Fraser , the chief constable of Inverness - shire , to the Under Secretary of State at the Scottish Office , raises concern about the arrival of a hunting expedition in Fort Augustus in 1938 .
It says they are " determined to catch the monster dead or alive " .
The document goes on to describe how the party claimed they were having a special harpoon gun made and would return with 20 " experienced men " to track the monster down .
" That there is some strange creature in Loch Ness seems now beyond doubt , but that the police have any power to protect it is very doubtful , " the letter concludes .
" If you have any suggestion to make or can offer any guidance in the matter , I shall be grateful . "

' It is certain that the force of the punch was such as to render him unconscious .
His head hit the pavement and there was nothing to break his fall .
The impact was so heavy that he suffered severe brain damage from which ultimately he was to die .
Matthew Farnsworth has the most romantic 3D printed twisty puzzle story you will read all day .
It has to do with Matthew , Mindy & how a Rubik ’s cube can be the key to someone ’s heart .
I will let Matthew tell you the story in his own words :
Many years ago , while digging through some boxes of stuff in my grandfather ’s garage , I found a small keychain Rubik ’s cube .
I did n’t know how to solve the cube , so my brother and I did some research and eventually figured it out .
After a few months , during which I got a standard sized cube , I decided to turn the keychain cube into a sort of personal “ sword in the stone . ”
Whosoever could solve the Rubik ’s cube ( and meet some standard requirements ) I would then and there ask for their hand in marriage .
Time passed and the cube ended up at the bottom of a box of games .
Every so often I would see the cube and think of my secret little pact .
Eventually , I forgot about the cube and life moved on without any significant change .
One day , I was asked to sing at the funeral services of a friend ’s grandfather .
Not wanting to sing alone , I called some friends who called other friends and eventually , a girl named Mindy was invited to sing .
We met shortly before the funeral to practice and before too long , Mindy and I were dating .
Some time afterwards ,
We were looking for a particular game and happened to come across the keychain Rubik ’s cube .
I told Mindy of my little arrangement involving proposing to whoever solved the cube .
A few days later I noticed that the cube was missing and I realized that I really liked Mindy and wanted her to solve the cube .
It was then that I was hit with a burst of inspiration : build a Rubik ’s cube that would open when solved !
I immediately turned to some engineer friends of mine to start the design process .
Chris , Kevin and myself spent a fair bit of time drawing and sketching on the whiteboard many different possibilities .
Most of these possibilities looked fine on paper but as soon as we tried applying a third dimension , things would get complicated .
We had just about finished a design involving spring - loaded pegs , when we discovered a YouTube video of a hollow cube .
Oskar van Deventer had actually redesigned the interior of a Rubik ’s cube , creating a beautiful cavity where one could hide a ring .
Now all I needed was to buy the hollow cube and edit the design so that it would open upon completion .
I decided , instead of trying to setup costly experiments and purchasing multiple hollow cubes , that I would propose the idea to Oskar himself to see if he had any ideas of how to help me .
And help me he did .
Within two weeks , I had the designs in my hands .
a few weeks later and I had the Gift Cube .
In the meantime , I created a small wooden ring box that would fit inside Oskar ’s Gift Cube .
When the Cube arrived , I was ecstatic to discover that the ring box ( a sphere actually ) fit perfectly inside .
After assembling the whole device and scrambling the cube , I hid it in the bottom of a box of my old high school memorabilia .
I suggested to Mindy that we could reminisce about “ the good old days ” while looking through my box of stuff .
Eventually we got down to the Rubik ’s cube and I informed Mindy that it was my first Rubik ’s cube ( a slight fib ) .
She proceeded to solve the scrambled cube only to discover a small wooden ball .
I told her the ball opened , but the lid was too tight and I had to open it for her .
Getting down on one knee , I handed her back the ring box and asked is she would consider marrying me .
She accepted and we are absolutely thrilled .
We would both like to thank the people of Shapeways for their part in this love story .
I would also like to personally thank both Ralph and Maartje for their patience with me during a time of great anxiety .
And of course , none of this would have been possible without Mr. Erno Rubik and Mr. Oskar van Deventer .
You can see a video of the Gift Cube on YoutTube .

A bird which favoured the nooks and crannies of dilapidated industrial sites is being lured back to one of Britain 's cities by a network of green roofs on new and regenerated buildings .
As a result , naturalists in Sheffield can now hear the hurried warble , followed by a sound like scrunching marbles and ending in a coda of clear , ringing notes , which marks the presence of the black redstart .
Slender , with grey , black and white plumage and a rusty - red tail , the protected bird had a small stronghold in the steel city during the mid- to late - 20th century .
Normally a resident of Alpine scree slopes , it took a liking to the Yorkshire city 's temporary wildernesses – much like post - war London bombsites – during the trauma of the steel industry 's collapse .
Redstarts could be heard from Bessemer House , where the celebrated system for converting iron to steel was pioneered .
The project that has tempted them back is part of an initiative centred in Sheffield which has started a programme of " green roof safaris " to showcase the merits of topping buildings with grass , tenacious plants and even groves of birch trees and a pond .
A skyline route takes in a cluster of green roofs at Sheffield University and on city council properties , including Sharrow school whose roof is the first to be designated as a nature reserve .
" We have a remit to work as champions for green roofs , " said Jeff Sorrell , manager of the university 's Green Roof Centre , as he led the Guardian across the rooftops .
" They have an important role to play in water attenuation [ soaking up rainfall and stopping floods ] , improving air quality and , of course , encouraging biodiversity in the city . "
Also on the safari was Belinda Wiggs , from the Sheffield Wildlife Trust , who checked out animal droppings on one of the university 's green roofs .
" They look like a fox 's , " she said .
" The roofs are becoming part of a largely hidden network for animals , which benefit from Sheffield 's hilly landscape .
There are plenty of places where it's too steep to build , so land is left wild or used for allotments , which encourages all sorts of wildlife . "
Sorrell recommends patience on the black redstarts , which have become a high - profile indicator of green roof success in London , where the bird 's bombsite toehold has expanded thanks to the new , high - rise form of urban greenery .
He said : " It 's early days yet , and London has a climate which is a bit closer to the conditions the redstarts are used to on the continent .
" But the sort of sparse vegetation they 're used to on the mountains , or dried - up riverbeds in France and Spain which they also favour , is a feature of many green roofs .
We 're replicating that , in much the same way as Sheffield 's brownfield sites did before regeneration led to development on many of them . "
Council planning staff now suggest the option of green roofs on new or restored buildings in Sheffield as standard , emphasising the " wild and natural " look of successful examples rather than the common misconception of herbaceous borders or wild flower meadows in the sky .
Most of the roofs on Sorrell 's safari look like patches of neglected grassland or the pockets of buddleia and willowherb which marked British cities after the blitzes of the second world war .
But this can be nirvana for a black redstart , according to the Sheffield Wildlife Trust , especially if plant varieties thrive and encourage insect diversity for the birds to feed on .
Initial monitoring by the trust has found six bee species regularly visiting the roofs and identified a target list of 49 local moths , two hoverflies and the violet oli - beetle which sometimes hitches a lift with bumblebees and could colonise high - level green roofs – and add variety to black redstarts ' diet – as a result .
The process of designing a type - based logo is similar to that of designing a shape - based logo .
Both logos need to convey a message , do it quickly and appease the client ’s taste .
All of these objectives can be accomplished by defining goals , favoring message over convention and questioning our assumptions as designers — even to the point of considering Arial or Helvetica .
Anyone who designs a logo faces many questions .
What should it look like ?
In what formats will it be presented ?
Does a particular color scheme need to be followed ?
As rough drafts are refined , the urge to find a general “ solution ” overrides the importance of these initial questions , which often end up neglected .
When design becomes a question of preference , the end result is debatable .
Graphic design is a process of solving problems through visual communication .
The process of designing a logo can be regarded as a series of steps that solves a series of questions .
This article tells the story of a process that focuses on those questions .
What ’s the Project ?
Smalls , Middleton & Bigman , a fictional law firm , hires a professional design company to develop its company logo .
Problems begin with its initial requirements :
It must be easily recognizable .
It should work at all sizes , including for business cards , letterheads and billboards .
It should look professional .
These could apply to any logo for any company .
So , the designer asks for more information about the company itself .
In what specialties does it excel ?
What sets it apart from competitors ?
What brings clients back for business ?
Smalls , Middleton & Bigman is an aggressive new firm specializing in regional real estate deals .
Its owners want to make a dent in the established market .
Most of its staff were born and raised in the area that it covers .
They are locals who understand the region ’s history and politics and could rattle off a list of the best barbecue places in town .
Although the principal partners have many contacts , the firm has no repeat business because it has no clients yet .
Everyone involved agrees that starting with the right logo is important , especially in a market with 20 - year veterans who advertise actively .
While the competition uses law books and scales of justice in its imagery , SM&B wants to emphasize its memorable names .
The designer immediately sets out to create a logotype .
The Importance of Shape
A logotype is a graphical trademark that uses type as its primary or only element .
Like an icon , it expresses a message , but with letterforms alone .
A logotype should communicate the name of the company and reflect its personality .
The temporary letterhead created by the firm ’s secretary is quickly rejected .
Seasoned type designers might roll their eyes at the sight of Arial , Times New Roman or Papyrus ( or of a letterhead created in MS Word ) , but that response smacks of snobbery .
Which of the above logos tells people what the law firm specializes in ?
Which one sets the firm apart from its competitors ?
When we ask whether these are solutions to problems , then we ’re using design as a means of problem - solving .
The examples above are n’t logotypes .
They ’re just text .
How do we tell people non-verbally what the law firm does ?
That is , not with text alone .
“ It ’s Ugly ” Is n’t Reason Enough
What about Arial , Times New Roman and Comic Sans makes designers cringe ?
It ’s not necessarily the letterforms .
Helvetica , for example , is a well - designed geometric typeface that dates back to 1957 .
At a glance , Helvetica is rather plain .
But that ’s because we ’re used to it .
Look again :
The uppercase A steps outside of its container on the left to accommodate its acute point .
The round counters in b , c , d , g , o , p and q match precisely .
The ascenders and feet have a uniform width , even when they end at an angle or curve .
The x -height of most letters may as well have been cut with a razor .
There are only three variations of diagonal angles .
Overall , it ’s hard to imagine a more legible face ( though some have tried ) .
But its success turned into a dilemma .
Faces such as Helvetica lack impact because they are common .
Common typefaces blend into the background .
We see them everywhere .
Anyone can use them .
Rejecting Helvetica , Times , Arial , Papyrus or Comic
Sans is justified if it ’s inappropriate or if a better alternative exists , not because we just do n’t like it .
Above , the SM&B logotype is set in Helvetica at two sizes .
Whether large or small , it is legible , modern , and sensible .
It ’s a good start , but rather plain .
Nothing about this logotype presents the law firm as aggressive , young or specialists in real estate .
Except for the fact that law firms are often named after three people , this logotype could be for anything .
A typeface speaks volumes about the company ’s character :
Above , the statement “ We ’re a law firm ” is written in different voices .
As in the movies , delivery can change the same line into a comment , a joke , a question or a threat .
When Meg Ryan smiles and says , “ I ’ll be back , ” she means something different than Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Likewise , four different law firms could each use a different one of the above typefaces , but guess which three would have trouble finding business ?
Viewing Type , Not Reading Text
If you work on a logotype long enough , you ’ll reach a point when the word in the logotype starts to look funny .
Something ’s odd about the text .
Has it always been spelled that way ?
If you ’ve just noticed that it contains a peculiar combination of letters , then congratulations : you ’ve stopped reading the words and started looking at the shapes of the letters .
The effect is stronger when you set the words in a variety of font styles .
( Unfortunately , staring at the examples in this article wo n’t work .
For a taste of type nirvana , play around with a program that lets you experiment with fonts up close . )
The name SM&B is already set , so the designer can take his time choosing the right typeface for it .
Above , our law firm ’s name is set in four different — and more appropriate — serif typefaces .
The differences are subtle , but two immediately stand out : the ampersand and the letter S. ( Look closely : setting it in large type helps you notice the details . )
Originally an abbreviation for the Roman “ et ” ( “ and ” in English ) , the ampersand can take on unique personalities .
Above , six fonts show how wide the variety can be .
For SM&B , the important question remains : which best suits a young aggressive real - estate company ?
All of the ampersands “ flow ” ( i.e. have a sense of motion ) , but they take radically different approaches .
Choosing an ampersand is not about which looks nicest , but about which sets the appropriate mood .
Jenson ’s bar is balanced like the scales of justice , which is too close to SM&B ’s competitors .
Warnock ’s combination of hard angles and refined lines makes it the most modern .
The ornate style of Palatino looks more like calligraphy than an aggressive law firm .
Giovanni , which curves inward , is either introspective or self - centered — neither of which fits SM&B ’s personality .
Baskerville ’s vine - like swirls are the least appropriate .
The question is , what shape (s ) best communicates energy , professionalism and real estate ?
No less important are the serifs :
Each letterform ends in a distinct serif ( although Minion and Giovanni are close ) .
Warnock and Palatino do n’t quite fit .
They are clunky compared to Baskerville and Jenson , whose serifs flow from the S shape .
Minion and Giovanni ’s serifs are subtle accents to the letterforms .
Eventually , the designer settles on the Warnock ampersand and the Giovanni letters .
A few extra tweaks add to the sense of motion :
A gap enhances the ampersand ’s “ hop . ”
Right - aligning the last word balances the white space in the upper - right and lower - left corners .
Using bold instead of Giovanni Book lends greater intensity .
So , how do we convey the professionalism and capacity of a firm that does not yet have years of experience ?
Which font says “ fresh and new ” ?
A serif face whose tails are kept to a minimum .
Text Informs .
Color , Style and Font Emote .
People “ read ” and “ view ” logotypes at the same time .
Reading text is informational : people interpret the words and relate them to other information .
Absorbing text is emotional : people get a sense of the company ’s character and attitude , and this is determined by font choice , color , placement and size .
For example :
The text of each word contradicts its hue .
But if you processed the text before the style , then you followed the pattern that most people follow .
When people see text , they look for a literal message .
The message ( for example , the mood ) is absorbed much less consciously but is no less important .
At this point , one might ask what colors SM&B ’s logo should be ?
But choosing colors is n’t the goal .
Communication is the goal .
Instead of looking for colors that he likes , the designer returns to the original problems .
Specifically , how do we convey specialization in real estate ?
Treating color choice as a solution , not an arbitrary preference , leads to a revelation .
Most law firms use dark blue , red , gold and white .
SM&B wants to stand out .
Earth tones solve the problem of how to avoid conformity while conveying the firm ’s real estate specialization .
The designer and law firm start reviewing earth tones .
Representing lawyers with browns and greens is unusual , but the decision is n’t arbitrary .
The color scheme solves a design problem .
The order of blue , green and brown suggests a landscape , but not explicitly so .
The designer tries a few variations , which do n’t add anything .
Gradients , for example , are a solution with no problem .
So , how did we manage to say that this is a real - estate law firm without actually saying “ Real estate law firm ? ” through color .
The Right Questions Lead to the Right Answers
The story of SM&B ’s logotype is about process , not solutions .
The final logotype depends as much on personality and good sense as the client and designer ’s tastes .
Any of the proposed solutions are open to debate , as a logotype should be .
But the questions that sparked the process by which the logo was created should not be forgotten .

Senators John F. Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , presented their long - delayed proposal to address global warming and energy Wednesday afternoon .
They are calling it the American Power Act .
The nearly 1,000 - page plan provides something for every major player – loan guarantees for nuclear plant operators , incentives for use of natural gas in transportation , exemptions from emissions caps for heavy industry , free pollution permits for utilities , modest carbon dioxide limits for oil refiners and expansion of offshore drilling for those states willing to accept the risks .
The bill ’s overall goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 .
The targets match those in a House bill passed last year and the Obama administration ’s announced policy goal .
It is impossible to know now whether all the concessions will add up to the 60 votes needed to thwart an attempt to filibuster the bill .
But Senator Kerry said he was confident he had found a winning formula for a comprehensive approach to climate change and energy independence .
“ The American Power Act will finally change our nation ’s energy policy from a national weakness into a national strength , ” Mr. Kerry said in a prepared statement .
“ This is a bill for energy independence after a devastating oil spill , a bill to hold polluters accountable , a bill for billions of dollars to create the next generation of jobs , and a bill to end America ’s addiction to foreign oil and protect the air our children breathe and the water they drink .
The path to 60 votes in the Senate has been long , but despite Washington conventional wisdom , we are closer than ever to a breakthrough . ”
The full text of the bill can be found at www.kerry.senate.gov.
Dr. Paabo has pioneered the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA from fossil bones , overcoming daunting obstacles over the last 13 years in his pursuit of the Neanderthal genome .
Perhaps the most serious is that most Neanderthal bones are extensively contaminated with modern human DNA , which is highly similar to Neanderthal DNA .
The DNA he has analyzed comes from three small bones from the Vindija cave in Croatia .
“ This is a fabulous achievement , ” said Ian Tattersall , a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , referring to the draft Neanderthal genome that Dr. Paabo ’s team describes in Thursday ’s issue of Science .
But he and other archaeologists questioned some of the interpretations put forward by Dr. Paabo and his chief colleagues , Richard E. Green of the Leipzig institute , and David Reich of Harvard Medical School .
Geneticists have been making increasingly valuable contributions to human prehistory , but their work depends heavily on complex mathematical statistics that make their arguments hard to follow .
And the statistical insights , however informative , do not have the solidity of an archaeological fact .

“ This is probably not the authors ’ last word , and they are obviously groping to explain what they have found , ” Dr. Tattersall said .
Richard Klein , a paleontologist at Stanford , said the authors ’ theory of an early interbreeding episode did not seem to have taken full account of the archaeological background .
“ They are basically saying , ‘ Here are our data , you have to accept it . ’
But the little part I can judge seems to me to be problematic , so I have to worry about the rest , ” he said .
In an earlier report on the Neanderthal genome , the reported DNA sequences were found by other geneticists to be extensively contaminated with human DNA .
Dr. Paabo ’s group has taken extra precautions but it remains to be seen how successful they have been , Dr. Klein said , especially as another group at the Leipzig institute , presumably using the same methods , has obtained results that Dr. Paabo said he could not confirm .
US says BP move to curb oil leak ' no solution '
A boom is erected in Louisiana to counter the spill
The success of a move by oil giant BP to curb a leak in the Gulf of Mexico is " not clear " and the technique provides " no solution " , the US has said .
It was responding to BP 's move to siphon oil from the leaking well head to a tanker on the surface .
A government statement said it would not rest until the leak was permanently sealed and the spill cleaned up .
BP executive Kent Wells earlier said that the siphoning process was " working extremely well " .
This was the third attempt it had made to insert a long narrow tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots .
It is thought that BP 's 6 in - wide ( 15 cm ) tube and stopper could capture more than three - quarters of the leak , although a smaller spill nearby also has to be contained .
Mr Wells said on Sunday at the firm's US headquarters in Houston , Texas , that over the next few days the company planned to slowly increase the amount of oil and gas flowing through the pipe to the tanker .
Commitments
But a joint statement by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the latest technique was " not a solution to the problem and it is not yet clear how successful it may be " .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The US government 's aggression against BP has n't lessened ...
I wonder whether the assault makes other big companies nervous

It added : " We will not rest until BP permanently seals the well head , the spill is cleaned up , and the communities and natural resources of the Gulf Coast are restored and made whole . "
It was the second strong statement to BP by the government officials on the current crisis .
Earlier they sent a letter saying they wanted to be sure BP would honour commitments not to limit costs to a US statutory cap of $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) .
BP responded by saying it had already made clear its position on paying damages for the disaster .
It said last week the cap was irrelevant and it would settle all legitimate damages claims .
" What they are requesting in the letter is absolutely consistent with all our public statements on the matter , " said BP spokesman David Nicholas on Sunday .
Lurking slicks
Earlier , scientists said they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles ( 16 km ) long and a mile wide .
Researchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology said they had detected the slicks lurking just beneath the surface of the sea and at depths of 4,000 ft ( 1,200 m ) .
Samantha Joye , a marine science professor at the University of Georgia , said : " It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas .
" We 've never seen anything like this before .
It 's impossible to fathom the impact . "
Chemical dispersants BP has been dumping underwater may be preventing the oil from rising to the top of the ocean , the scientists said .
The find suggests the scale of the potential environmental disaster is much worse than previously feared since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers .
Some scientists cast doubt on BP 's estimate of the oil flow rate , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels per day dramatically understates the real amount .
A week ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100 - tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals .
Mississippi has become the third US state to have traces of oil wash up on its coast , along with Louisiana and Alabama .
The spill is threatening to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez leak off Alaska as America 's worst environmental disaster .

Paul Michelotti STEPWISE NANOBOT
A molecular nanorobot labeled with green dye strolls along a DNA origami track toward its red-labeled goal by cleaving visited strands of DNA .
Text Size A A
Futuristic visions of nanobots that travel the body to treat disease and construct compounds one atom at a time got a little closer to reality this week , thanks to two advances in nanoscale robotics ( Nature 2010 , 465 , 202 and 206 ) .
Using DNA as the key construction material , one group of researchers created a nanoscale robot that can autonomously walk across a track , and a different group prepared a nanofactory in which DNA robots can carry and deposit nanoparticle cargo .
The primary obstacle in making nanoscale robots is that their small size restricts the amount of information or programming they can carry .
" How do we program molecules when they cannot hold much information ? " asks Milan N. Stojanovic , a molecular computing expert at Columbia University .
" In this paper , we do it by defining their interactions with the environment . "
Stojanovic , along with groups led by Nils G. Walter of the University of Michigan , Erik Winfree of California Institute of Technology , and Hao Yan of Arizona State University , created that environment — a surface of DNA — using DNA origami , a technique in which small strands of DNA " staple " one long strand into a desired shape .
To that environment they added their nanorobotic walker , which has an inert body of streptavidin protein and four single - stranded DNA legs .
The legs are designed to associate with pendant strands of DNA on the DNA origami surface .
While one leg anchors the crawler onto the surface , the other three are so - called DNAzymes , which cleave the pendant strands once they 've formed a duplex with it .
Interaction with the shorter , cleaved strand is weak , so a leg travels along to the next dangling bit of DNA , propelling the walker along autonomously until it reaches strands that can't be cleaved .
The DNA - based walker in the second report , from New York University chemistry professor Nadrian C. Seeman 's lab , has three hands and four legs all made up of single - stranded DNA .
Anchoring strands of DNA help bind the legs to strands of DNA on an origami surface .
The walker is freed to move by the addition of " fuel " strands of DNA that displace the anchoring strands , propelling the walker along .
Adding more anchoring strands halts the motion .
The walker 's hands can take and carry gold nanoparticle cargo , which is held by DNA machines on the track , and can assemble the particles in a predefined manner .
The entire system functions as a nanoscale assembly line , Seeman tells C&EN .
" This is the first time that systems of nanomachines , rather than individual devices , have been used to perform operations , constituting a crucial advance in the evolution of DNA nanotechnology , " University of Wisconsin , Madison , chemistry professor Lloyd M. Smith writes in a commentary that accompanies the papers .
" A goal of our field is to refashion and reimagine all the complex biochemical machinery of cells to suit our own purposes — to have synthetic molecules that can move around and carry cargo as protein motors do in cells , to have molecules that act as chemical factories , which make a particular product based on a particular chemical input , and above all to make these processes modular , to make them engineerable , " notes Paul W. K. Rothemund , the Caltech scientist who invented DNA origami .
" These two papers mark a significant advance along this research direction . "
Paris Hilton says she cries sometimes after reading the cruel comments about her posted on TMZ .
Play video content
In an exclusive interview Wednesday , after finishing a meeting with her publicist Elliott Mintz , Hilton agreed to talk to TMZ's Harvey Levin about thousands of messages TMZ users have posted , many of which are , as Hilton says , " mean and sadistic . "
Levin asked Hilton about such comments as , " Paris is just an overused human condom , " " Paris is like a fart in a mitten .
You know it 's there , you can't stand it , but you can't get rid of it , " and " Would you please drop over dead or commit suicide you damn slut . "
Hilton said " I 'm far less promiscuous than any of my friends . "
As for the infamous sex tape with ex-lover Rick Solomon , Hilton said " I 'm judged because of something that an ex-boyfriend did to me .
I 'm not a slut at all . "
