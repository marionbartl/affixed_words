Online encyclopedia launches first data .
The ambitious Encyclopedia of Life project published its first web pages on Earth ’s biological diversity on 26 February — one species per page .
Born of a 2003 essay by biologist Edward O. Wilson and formally announced in May 2007 , the website ( http://eol.org) aims to create an extensive , expert - created page for each of Earth ’s 1.8 million named species ( see Nature 449 , 23 2007 ) .
Many of the world ’s foremost natural - history institutions are participating .
Most of the 1 million pages set up so far are placeholders with minimal information .
Around 30,000 of them are fuller , thanks to pre-existing online databases that have agreed to share their data , including the Solanaceae Source website , FishBase and AmphibiaWeb .
And 24 ‘ exemplar pages ’ , which are rich in information and multimedia content , show how the pages will eventually look .
The project has no new funding beyond that announced last year : US $ 2.5 million from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York and $ 50 million from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago , Illinois .
More will be needed if the project is to meet its goal of a full page for every species by 2017 .
Executive director James Edwards says the project ’s biggest challenge is “ providing incentives for the scientific community to participate ” .
He is working on ways to make the pages similar to conventional publications so that academics will be credited for their input .
Each page will have its own digital object identifier , and publications that cite the pages will be able to be tracked .
Citations of the pages will contribute to the author ’s publication record .
Edwards admits that money could be problematic .
“ Another challenge further down the road will be to implement a financial model that will assure long - term sustainability , ” he says .
In the past , critics have noted that because the costs of maintaining and updating vast online databases never end , the projects tend to peter out when the funders lose interest .
Sustaining their excitement about the encyclopedia for a full decade will be difficult .
The first batch of pages was officially launched this week at the TED ( Technology , Entertainment , Design ) conference in Monterey , California .
Media moves
As of sometime this weekend when the DNS change propagated , all static / media files for this site migrated over to Amazon ’s S3 storage service ; when I relaunched back in September , media was coming off a Joyent BingoDisk account .
While a change in media serving technology really is n’t all that sexy or exciting compared to some aspects of web development ( or as popular as writing about whatever Microsoft is doing today ) , I ’d like to take a moment to talk about this move , why I decided to go with S3 , and point out a few tricks which , hopefully , might be useful to you at some point .
Refresher : separate media servers are good
Officially , the Django documentation recommends that , in production deployment situations , you have one web server handling requests which will be processed by Django and another handling requests for “ media ” : static files like images , stylesheets , JavaScript , etc .
This does n’t mean you need to have two physically separate computers , just that you should have two separate HTTP daemons running , with one serving Django and one serving your media .
This is mostly because the preferred deployment situation for Django over its history has been Apache and mod_python , which means that each Apache process is carrying around an embedded Python interpreter , plus an in -memory copy of Django , your applications and any other Python code you happen to be using .
In that situation , taking one of those processes and using it to simply read a file off disk and shove it down the wire is an incredible waste ; you ’re using up valuable system resources to get Django running inside your web server , so you want those processes to be actually doing things with Django as often as possible .
Of course , under alternative deployment setups such as FastCGI or mod_wsgi ( which is likely to become the “ winner ” in terms of deploying Python applications behind Apache ) this is n’t necessarily a problem : under FastCGI , or under mod_wsgi in daemon mode , all that code that used to be embedded inside Apache is instead running in a separate external process .
In this case the hit is n’t so bad , though it ’s still present : you ’re still tying up a process which could be talking to your external Python / Django processes .
And even if that does n’t bother you too much , it ’s still worth noting that , typically , the types of web server configurations which give the best performance for Django are not necessarily the same as the configurations which give the best performance for straight - up file serving ; keeping the two separate means they can be tuned separately for the best possible results .
On BingoDisk
But regardless of how sensible it is or how much of an impact it ’ll have on performance , the recommendation to use a separate media server has always been a bit of a stumbling block for first - time Django deployment .
When I was setting this site up on its new server , I knew I did n’t want to deal with configuring and maintaining a separate media server , so I started shopping around for a good file - hosting service .
Given the well - known fact that I am Joyent ‘s bitch , I naturally gravitated first to their offering : BingoDisk , which seemed like the ideal option .
And I liked it at first ; Bingo had a couple of “ quick win ” features which initially won me over :
It supports pointing any domain you like at your BingoDisk account via a DNS CNAME record ; I set up media.b- list.org as a CNAME to my BingoDisk account , and everything just worked .
You do n’t pay for bandwidth on Bingo , only for storage ( generally speaking , bandwidth is cheap these days , but quality storage is n’t and probably never will be ) .
The upload / download interface is WebDAV , which is supported out of the box in most operating systems and file managers these days .
For the most part I ’ve been happy with Bingo ( even with the recent downtime ; I was able to quickly set up an alternate media server to keep things chugging along while that was happening ) .
But there are a few things that I kept tripping over which ultimately led me to migrate away :
Everything on your Bingo account is locked away behind HTTP authentication , except for one automatically - created folder called public .
So anything you want to serve to the general public has to go in there , and even that arrangement sometimes causes HTTP login boxes to appear where they are n’t wanted ( largely because browsers want to request / favicon.ico which , if you even create it , would live in the non-public area ) .
WebDAV starts out looking neat , and quickly becomes a pain .
It ’s an extremely chatty protocol , and though it ’s supported by modern file - management tools it ’s often unbearably slow ; getting a useful listing ( including file descriptions and metadata ) from a directory with a lot of files can take several minutes in OS X’s Finder , for example .
Bingo — so far as I can tell — does n’t really offer much control over how your files are served , which can impair some useful optimization tricks .
I still like the idea of Bingo , especially as an easy way for non-technical people to easily share files amongst each other or just between multiple computers ( which , to be fair , is really what it ’s best suited for ) , but a little while back I decided it was time to look elsewhere for a media - serving solution .
On S3
The solution I settled on , in the end , was S3 .
The factors which won me over , in the end , were :
The CNAME trick works just as well on S3 as it does on Bingo ( and , in fact , I think “ point a CNAME at us ” is a must - have feature for web - based services these days ) , though it actually points to an S3 “ bucket ” ( essentially a named container into which you can put things ) of the same name as the domain you ’re pointing at it .
The pricing policy is about the best you ’ll find : instead of a flat subscription rate , you only pay for what you ’re actually using ( and quite reasonable prices , too ) .
Access control is fine - grained , and it ’s easy to make everything public .
It ’s extremely easy to specify how you want the file to be served , and the REST API does a lot of things with nothing but standard HTTP headers ( allowing you to set things like Expires , Content - Type , Content - Encoding , etc. ) .
The downside is that all interaction with the service is through an HTTP - based API , so you need to write a little code to automate the process .
Fortunately , Amazon provides a Python library which speaks S3 ’s REST API , and from there it ’s a simple matter to write an uploader script ; Adrian has posted the one he used to upload chicagocrime .org ’s media , if you ’re looking for an example .
I ended up writing my own upload script ( like weblog applications , I have a feeling that S3 uploaders are a sort of “ rite of passage ” script that every web developer will want to to write in a slightly different way ) , and ended up with a pretty simple process : my script takes a filename , optional key prefix ( S3 has no concept of directories , but you can specify a “ key ” for a file which looks like a directory path + filename ) and optional bucket name ( defaulting to the one for this site ’s media ) , and I ’ve got local copies of everything arranged correctly , so I could drop into a particular directory — say , img — on my laptop , and run a quick bash one - liner ( you do know your way around a Unix shell , right ?
That ’s one of the most underappreciated skills a web developer can have ) :
for filename in ` ls *.* ` ; do s3_upload -f $ filename - k img / ; done
And voilà : all my images upload to S3 .
Tips and tricks
While I was migrating , I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to do a little performance tuning , with some help from YSlow ; it had been giving this site a “ B ” grade for months , and a lot of its complaints ( OK , all of its complaints ) were related to the way static files were being served .
One thing YSlow had been griping at me about for a while was the lack of an HTTP Expires header on some files .
S3 allows you to send an Expires header along with an upload through the REST API , so I simply built that into my uploader : everything I upload to S3 gets an Expires date set two years in the future .
So , for example , if you do a curl - I on my stylesheet , you ’ll see something like Expires : Thu , 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT come back in the response headers .
If this seems like a bad idea — stylesheets have a tendency to change more often than every two years , after all — take a look at the URL of the stylesheet : the filename is b-list - 20080206.css .
It was preceded by b- list - 20080203.css , which was preceded by b- list - 20071218.css , and so on ; each revision of the stylesheet is actually a unique file with a datestamped filename .
This strikes a nice balance between being able to specify a date far in the future for the file to expire from caches ( not that any browser actually would cache a stylesheet for two years ) and having an easy way to force an update for browsers which exhibit strange caching behavior ( I ’m looking at you , Safari ; if any browser ever does respect that two - year Expires header , it ’ll be Safari ) .
The logo up in the header and a few other stylistic images work the same way .
I do n’t honestly remember where I first saw that trick , but I ’ve used it off and on now for a while and highly recommend it or a variation ; my favorite is probably Ryan Tomayko ‘s implementation , which adds a querystring to his stylesheet ’s URL , containing the Unix timestamp of the last change ( which I assume is generated by checking the mtime of the file , since it matches up with the Last - Modified header his server is sending out ) .
Another useful thing YSlow kindly reminded me about is compressed file serving ; all of my Django - generated content is already being gzipped server - side , and adding that to my stylesheet ( the only static file I serve where compression makes sense ) was something I ’d initially overlooked .
Serving gzipped files with S3 is pretty easy , as it turns out ; you just gzip the file contents before uploading , and send along a Content - Encoding header with a value of gzip .
Python offers two ways to gzip something programmatically : a low - level interface in the “ zlib ” module , and a higher - level file - like interface in the “ gzip ” module .
If you ’re unsure which way to go , you probably want to use the gzip module ; the interface is a lot easier to work with .
And if you ’re lazy like me , you can copy / paste this seven - line function from django.utils.text , which is used by Django ’s GZipMiddleware :
def compress_string ( s ) : import cStringIO , gzip zbuf = cStringIO .
StringIO ( ) zfile = gzip .
GzipFile ( mode = ' wb ' , compresslevel = 6 , fileobj = zbuf ) zfile .
write ( s ) zfile .
close ( ) return zbuf .
getvalue ()
Since the stylesheet is the only thing I want to compress , I ended up special - casing this in my S3 uploader ; like Adrian , I ’m using mimetypes.guess_type( ) to work out the correct Content - Type for each uploaded file , so I just have my uploader watch for a value of text / css , which it will take as a cue to compress the file and add a Content - Encoding header .
And now ( with a little tweaking of a preference value so it wo n’t complain that I ’m not using a CDN ; see the YSlow documentation for details ) , thanks to those fairly - minor tweaks , YSlow gives me an “ A ” grade ; the only thing it still complains about is the non-gzipped , non - ETag ged , lacking - an- Expires - header JavaScript include from the stats tracker I use , and there ’s not much I can do about that ( Google Analytics passes YSlow with flying colors , but does n’t offer nice real - time stats ) .
There ’s even a nice psychological illusion that the site feels faster .
The future : file uploads
The only thing missing from S3 right now is actually something missing from Django : the ability to have file uploads go from Django straight to S3 , instead of requiring them to be stored locally ( right now , your options for storing files on a different machine basically consist of NFS , NFS , and … well , NFS ) .
Fortunately , Marty has been working steadily on a plan to allow Django to use pluggable file - storage backends , much as it already allows pluggable authentication and session backends , and the logical first use for that would be an S3 backend .
As soon as that lands in trunk , S3 ( and services like it ) will constitute an easy , affordable and full - featured option for Django media serving .

Bush Administration ' mugshot ' exhibit angers right wingers Adam Doster
Published : Saturday December 8 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Tucked deep into a corner on the third floor of the New York Public Library sits an art exhibition .
While few visitors ever pass the unassuming display , right wing bloggers are taking it upon themselves to get it banned .
The project ?
A series of six black and white prints in the form of mugshots , each containing the faces key Bush administration figures in the first few years of his presidency .
The various " suspects  in  Line Up ,  as the exhibition is called , carry placards bearing a date .
The Guardian reports that Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese , who created the piece , chose the dates to refer to key speeches in which they believe the politicians incriminated themselves in front of the American people .
An audio tape runs in tandem with the prints and plays the speeches as the prints come up in a slide show .
President Bush scowls at the camera .
Donald Rumsfeld and his assistant Richard Perle stare into the distance .
Dick Cheney points a finger directly at the audience while a clip of his January 2001 speech insisting that there is not a " single shred of evidence " that he used government contracts to favor his old firm , Halliburton , plays in the background .
While small in scope , word of the exhibition 's political nature quickly spread throughout the blogosphere .
According to The Guardian ,  Conservative commentators have decried the fact that a public institution had showcased the prints . 
" What is disgusting about these doctored photos is the place of prominence the library has given them , " one blogger wrote .
" I am shocked and angry that a public library would stoop to this level . "
Tammy Bruce , a rightwing radio talkshow host , said : " At first I wondered who put al - Qaida in charge of the New York public library , but then of course remembered the American left is doing their bidding for them . "
A library spokeswoman said that the reaction had taken the prints out of context .
They were one part of a larger exhibition of 23 different printmakers .
The library was making no political statement , she said , pointing out that " printmaking has been a popular medium for artists ' commentary on current events of their day , among them Hogarth , Goya , Gillray and Daumier . "
The artists have stayed mum on the current controversy , allowing the prints to speak for themselves . 

Recently , quantum computing has been heralded as the new cool kid on the block .
The point of quantum computing is that , during a calculation , the bits ( called qubits ) that are being manipulated are never in a definite one or zero state .
Instead , they can be thought of as being both a one and a zero simultaneously , which allows a quantum computer to explore many solutions at the same time .
The upshot is that , for a limited set of problems , quantum computers may offer a substantial speed up over normal computers .
In recent , unpublished research , scientists have made use of the similarities between a certain type of quantum computation and neural networks to construct a very simple quantum neural network .
The result may offer a faster and more robust form of pattern recognition .
To understand what the researchers have done , we are going to have to take a step back and take a look at a particular form of quantum computing , called adiabatic quantum computing , and compare that to a specific type of neural network .
In normal quantum computing , the qubit values might be encoded in the states of a bunch of atoms .
These are then individually manipulated by direct operations on their states to perform the calculation — the answer is obtained by measuring the final state of the atoms .
In adiabatic quantum computing , the qubits are still encoded in atomic states but the problem is encoded in the environment of the atoms .
The combination of states with the least energy ( called the ground state ) for that environment is the answer to the problem .
It is usually pretty easy to encode a problem in the environment , but getting the atoms to find their lowest energy state is more problematic , so the approach has to be modified slightly .
The initial quantum computing environment is set so that it 's simple to put the qubits in their ground state .
Then , very slowly , the environment is smoothly modified to the one that encodes the problem .
If this is done without exciting the atoms , the answer to the problem can be obtained by reading out their states .
Neural networks use a similar principle , where a memory is encoded across a series of " neurons " as the lowest - cost stable state .
In this case , a memory is encoded by putting it into the neural network 's inputs .
The network 's internal state evolves in response to the input , taking on a unique configuration .
If one equates the cost property of neural networks with the energy state of the atomic qubits , one can see a number of similarities between neural networks and adiabatic quantum computing .
These similarities were exploited for pattern recognition purposed by researchers in Munich , using a liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer ( think MRI scanner ) .
Two qubits were encoded in the nuclear magnetic moments of hydrogen and carbon , which can be linked up to form a very simple neural network called a flip - flop .
The researchers encoded a series of patterns in the neural network — something that is not possible in a classical neural network this small .
The neural network was able to recognize those patterns again if they were presented as input .
That is , if a one - zero state was stored along with a one - one and a zero - zero state , the neural network would give one response to seeing a one - zero input — a pattern that was stored previously — while a zero - one input would generate a different response .
Note that the classical version of this circuit could store exactly one two bit pattern , while the quantum version can store all four bit patterns .
As is typical with quantum computing experiments , this is small - scale stuff .
Will it scale up ?
The researchers seem to think so , since that is what they are trying to do now .
If it does scale , we will be looking at a huge boost in the abilities of computers to recognize images and sounds .
And we can all buy an extra basement for the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer PCI card .
Cheering God , Bush says war with Iraq ' will forever be ' the right decision RAW STORY

Print This Email This Speaking Tuesday to the National Religious Broadcasters ' convention , President Bush declared the decision to " remove " Saddam Hussein in 2003 the " right decision at this point in my presidency , and it will forever be the right decision . 
The 42 - minute speech , covered in the New York Times , drew rousing applause , " mixing faith and foreign policy as he told a group of Christian broadcasters that his policies in the region were predicated on the beliefs that freedom was a God - given right and 'every human being bears the image of our maker . ' "
A White House aide told the Times -- anonymously -- that the speech , along with speeches by General David Petraeus , is intended to allow Bush to " frame " the Iraq war .
 It s a way of resetting a little bit ,  the White House official said .
 There was a lot of talk about the surge , and then when the surge worked , it was like ,  O.K. , it worked ,  and then 08 heated up and people sort of moved on .
People need to be reminded of who were up against and what the stakes are .
 The effects of a free Iraq and a free Afghanistan will reach beyond the borders of those two countries ,  Bush said .
 It will show others what s possible .
And we undertake this work because we believe that every human being bears the image of our maker .
That s why were doing this .
No one is fit to be a master , and no one deserves to be a slave . 
He lauded the broadcasters for " standing up " for " our values , " and pledged to veto the " fairness doctrine , " which would enjoin radio stations to give even time to opposing views .

No freedom of religion in Egypt ( duh ! )
Radio Netherlands ^ | January 19 2008 | Alexander Weissink
Posted on by knighthawk
Former Muslim Mohammed Higazi is lucky that he was not present in an Egyptian courtroom on Tuesday .
An Islamic fundamentalist lawyer made death threats against the Egyptian for converting to Christianity .
To the dismay of Higazi 's lawyer the judge made no objection .
What made matters even worse , the judge went so far as to express his loathing off the accused because he had converted .
There was no verdict but the judge vowed that he would never let Mr Higazy be registered as a Christian .
He defended his decision by saying that Islam is the principal religion in Egypt .
No mention was made of the freedom of religion established in the constitution which is a fundamental right of all citizens .
Hideaway Mr Higazy and his pregnant wife have been hiding for months at a secret location .
He is the first convert who is attempting to get a judge to change the faith on his identity card from Muslim to Christian .
Egyptian identity cards must report the faith of the holder .
While freedom of religion exists theoretically , in practice Muslims are not allowed to change their religion in the municipal register .
At the age of 16 Mr Higazi converted to Christianity and took on the Christian name Beshoi .
A classmate had left a book with takes from the Bible on his desk .
" I began to read the book and was consumed by the love of Jesus , " he explained last year in an interview at a secret location .
When his wife , who is also a convert , became pregnant last year he decided to make the change official .
" Otherwise my child will automatically be registered as a Muslim . "
However , his application was rejected .
Converts
Mr Higazi's lawyer Ramsis el - Naggar , who specialises in conversions , says " there is no freedom of choice in Egypt , unless you 're a Muslim . "
His law firm now represents some 400 converts .
Most of his clients were originally Christian , for one reason or another converted to Islam , and now want to return to Christianity .
Sometimes his clients are people who regret that they changed their faith .
However , many times his clients are the victims of government bureaucracy , such as children whose Christian fathers became Muslims .
 Many civil servants are overzealous .
If a man changes his faith to Islam they also change the listing of his children .
Others function on the automatic pilot .
They type the word  Muslim on the card as a matter of habit .
A lot of mistakes are made and it takes years to correct them . 
An estimated 90 % of Egypts population is Muslim .
Coptic Christians are the largest minority .
Violence
So far El - Naggar has only achieved success in cases in which he could prove the person had never changed faith .
In 2004 he won for the first time in the case of Mira Makram ( 33 ) .
Her husband had converted to Islam in 2002 and had forced her to sign a statement confirming that she had converted to Islam .
Her religion was changed to Islam in the register without her knowledge .
After two years of legal proceedings .
the judge ordered that the change be rectified .
Fundamentalists called for the death of Mira Makram .
The lawyer says  These kinds of cases lead to so much controversy that they are becoming even more difficult . 
El - Naggar is expecting a verdict on 22 similar cases at the beginning of February and is full of optimism .
However , the Higazi case is more difficult since his client was originally a Muslim .
His only chance of success would be a letter from the patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , Shenouda III , acknowledging that he is a Christian .
However even the pope does not dare to provide him with such a letter .
Mr Higazi says he understands this .
 It s too dangerous .
If the pope were to give me the letter today , churches would be burning tomorrow . 

The only two countries in the Middle East where freedom of religion is guaranteed in the constitution are Israel and Turkey .
You ’ll notice neither are Arab lands ....
When Muslims attack Christians in Turkey , they ’re arrested .
In Egypt , Muslims can give death sentences to soon - to - be- Christians in the courtroom .
Big difference .

Dallas Morning News Runs Edited Version of Phil Giraldi’s Detailed ‘ American Conservative Magazine ’ Report on Former FBI Translator ’s Corroborated Allegations Against High - Ranking U.S. Officials …
Kudos the Dallas Morning News for becoming the first U.S. corporate mainstream outlet to run coverage of former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds ’ startling allegations of high - treason and the sale of U.S. nuclear secrets to the foreign black market , with the cooperation of high - ranking U.S. officials , originally published weeks ago by UK ’s Sunday Times , and papers in virtually every other country — except for this one .
( Source )
With the exception of Washington Note and Financial Times , the mainstream media decided not to report Zbigniew Brzezinski ’s comments that shatter the United Stator ruling class .
Auditioned on February 1st , 2007 by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , the former National Security Adviser read a statement the terms of which had been carefully chosen .
He indicated that : " a plausible scenario for a military collision with Iran involves Iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks , followed by accusations of Iranian responsibility for the failure , then by some provocation in Iraq or a terrorist act in the US blamed on Iran , culminating in a ‘ defensive ’ US military action against Iran that plunges a lonely America into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan and Pakistan " .
As you must have noticed : Mr Brzezinski evoked the Bush administration plausible organization of an attack in the United States , and the possibility of holding Iran wrongly responsible for it .
In Washington the analysts hesitate between two interpretations of this statement .
For certain officials , the former National Security Adviser tried to beat the neoconservatives to it and to cast doubt in advance on any circumstance which would lead to the war .
For others , Mr Brzezinski wanted , in addition , to suggest that in case of collision with the war partisans , he could reopen the September 11th file .
In any case , Thierry Meyssan ’s hypothesis - According to which the September 11th attacks would have been perpetrated by a Military - Industrial Complex faction to provoke the Afghanistan and Iraq wars - Leaves suddenly the taboo domain to be discussed publicly by Washington elites .
Incremental Map / Reduce
Ok , here is a quick rundown of how the full Map / Reduce functionality in CouchDB will work .
So right now , to create views in CouchDB , you create a function that takes a document and outputs key value pairs .
This is a function that defines a view of documents keyed by their tags :
function ( doc ) {
for ( var i=0 ; i<doc.tags.length ; i++)
map( doc.tags [i ] , null )
}
To be used , this function must be stored in a design document :
{
" _id " : " _design /tags " ,
" views " : { " all " : " function ( doc ) {... snipped ... } " }
}
Then we can get the results :
GET /db/_view/tags/all
Result :
{ " total_rows " : 6 ,
" rows " : [
{ " id " : " 2DA92AAA628CB4156134F36927CF4876 " ,
" key " : " bar " ,
" value " : null} ,
{ " id " :" 4156134F36927CF48762DA92AAA628CB " ,
" key " : " bar " ,
" value " : null} ,
{ " id " :" 4F36927CF48762DA92AAA628CB415613 " ,
" key " : " bar ” ,
" value " : null}
{ " id " : " 2DA92AAA628CB4156134F36927CF4876 " ,
" key " : " foo " ,
" value " : null} ,
{ " id " :" 4156134F36927CF48762DA92AAA628CB " ,
" key " : " foo " ,
" value " : null}
]}
Then get just the docs tags foo :
GET /db/_view/tags/all?key = " foo "
Result :

The restriction on map functions is that they must be referentially transparent .
That is , given the same input document , they will always emit the same key / value pairs .
This allows CouchDB views to be updated incrementally , only reindexing the documents that have changed since the last index update .
Okay cool , simple and efficient and it 's already working .
( The only thing I want to change about it is rename the internal javascript map ( Key , Value ) call to emit( Key , Value ) .
It 's less confusing that way . )
Now what about Reduce ?
This is a similar example to the previous view map function , but this time we want a view of all the tag counts in the database .
( The user programable reduce is n't done yet , but this is how it will work . )
We need a Map function to output doc tags :
function ( doc ) {
for ( var i=0 ; i<doc.tags.length ; i++)
emit(doc.tags [i ] , 1 ) ;
}
And a Reduce function to count the tags :
function ( tag , counts ) {
int sum=0 ;
for ( var i=0 ; i<counts.length ; i++)
sum+=counts [i ] ;
return sum ;
}
And then stored in a design document :
{
" _id " : " _design /tags " ,
" views " : {
" all " : " function ( doc ) {...snip ...} " ,
" count " : {
" map " : " function ( doc ) {...snip ... } "
" reduce " : " function ( tag , counts ) {... snip ... } "
}
}
}
Now to access the results :
GET /db/_view/ tags / count
Result :
{ " total_rows " : 2 ,
" rows " : [
{ " key " : " bar " ,
" value " : 3} ,
{ " key " : " foo " ,
" value " : 2}
]}
Then get the count of just the docs tagged " foo " :
GET /db/_view/tags/count?key = " foo "
Result :
{ " total_rows " : 2 ,
" rows " : [
{ " key " : " foo " ,
" value " : 2}
]}
To make incremental Map / Reduce possible , the Reduce function has the requirement that not only must it be referentially transparent , but it must also be commutative and associative for the array value input , to be able reduce on it's own output and get the same answer , like this :
f( Key , Values ) == f( Key , [ f( Key , Values ) ] )
This requirement of reduce functions allows CouchDB to store off intermediated reductions directly into inner nodes of btree indexes , and the view index updates and retrievals will have logarithmic cost .
It also allows the indexes to be spread across machines and reduced at query time with logarithmic cost .
The incremental design makes it possible to use map / reduce to query huge partitioned clusters in realtime , instead of having to wait for a whole map / reduce job to complete or having stale , occasionally updated indexes , .
The downside is it may be harder to write the Reduce function in an associative and commutative manner .
Update :
Here is a followup posting about Combiner functions .
Posted February 7 , 2008 8:02 PM
One of the biblical stories from which the modern - day religious right draws the most inspiration is the fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah .
The religious right has assumed that the sin for which they merited this fate was rampant homosexuality , to the point that “ sodomite ” has become a derogatory synonym for homosexuals .
( Consider the Jack Chick tract “ Doom Town “ , which contains a variety of grossly offensive antigay caricatures . )
However , there is some evidence that this is jumping to conclusions .
The book of Genesis simply says that God had resolved to destroy Sodom ( and its sister city Gomorrah ) because its sin was “ very grievous ” ( Genesis 18:20 ) and its people were “ wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly ” ( 13:13 ) .
It does not , however , specify the nature of this sin .
The episode in this story from which conservatives draw this inference is in Genesis 19 .
When two angels come to Lot ’s house in Sodom to warn him of the impending destruction , the men of Sodom surround the house and demand that he “ bring them out unto us , that we may know them ” ( 19:5 ) , using a biblical euphemism for sexual intercourse .
Readers should notice , though , that this could not have been the sin for which God was determined to destroy Sodom , because he had already made that decision before this ever happened .
The angels were coming to warn
Lot to flee the city .
And furthermore , could it not be argued that the sin in this was the intent to rape , rather than homosexuality ?
In any case , this speculation is not necessary .
The book of Genesis never explicitly says what sin Sodom committed , but another book in the Old Testament does .
And , as readers might guess , what it says is something very different from what the religious right believes :
Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom :
She and her daughters were arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy .
– Ezekiel 16:49 ( NIV translation , emphasis added )
In light of this clear statement , it is surprising that “ sodomy ” has become so universally identified with homosexuality .
Even the author of the New Testament epistle of Jude fell victim to this misunderstanding when he identified Sodom ’s crime as “ fornication ” ( 1:7 ) , a statement completely unsupported by any other scripture .
It is completely ad hoc and unreasonable to believe that homosexuality was Sodom ’s capital sin and the one for which God decided to destroy the city , and yet it was completely omitted by a verse that states it was listing Sodom ’s transgressions .
This little - known verse is an example of how presupposition and prejudice , rather than evidence , has shaped the tradition of biblical interpretation among conservatives .
There is a valuable lesson here about what is most important .
Homosexuals in stable , committed , loving relationships are not sodomites , not even according to the Bible .
Instead , the wealthy and arrogant televangelists and preachers of the religious right – the people who are haughty and proud , who have much wealth and influence but hoard it selfishly rather than using it to advance the cause of happiness for all people everywhere – are the true Sodomites , and should be described as such .
I do not agree with much that is in the Bible , but this is a conclusion I can stand squarely behind .

With the wind chill , I reckon it 's minus - 15 .
I do n't know whether to hang on with both hands , as Rifleman Richard Crowther has instructed , or use one arm to shield my cheeks from the blizzard that 's whipping across West Yorkshire .
" In all my years here I 've never known the weather to be so bad , " the 6ft 6in head of paratrooper training tells me .
Tanks are anything but glamorous , least not in a blizzard at the British Army 's infantry training centre at Catterick , near Darlington .
I 'm here to check the specs of the Warrior , the workhorse of the Army for more than 20 years , and experience first - hand life inside a thick - walled tin can .
The 25 - ton beast transported and defended troops in the Gulf War and is now in service in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It might be a reliable and fearsome tank – sorry , tracked armoured vehicle ( the name is reserved for battle tanks with much bigger guns , apparently ) – but the Warrior is not hi-tech .
" What new gadgets does it have ? "
I ask Crowther before he drives me , completely exposed in the tank 's gun turret , about a mile across Catterick 's off - road course .
" Well , they put in new air conditioning recently , " he replies .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Air -con will be no use to us today , as the Warrior 's V8 Rolls - Royce engine , which churns out 550 bhp , powers us through the storm .
I 'd rather be " downstairs " , in the hull , but that is hardly homely , either .
Designed to hold seven fully equipped soldiers on two benches , there 's barely space to fit seven men ; it 's not much bigger than the back of a Land Rover .
" I 've spent two days straight in here in Bosnia , " Crowther tells me .
Fairly soon , I have a more urgent enquiry – how does one use the loo ?
Crowther reaches across to the end of a bench , revealing an egg - shaped , upholstered lid set flush in the seat .
" You all shuffle round and your man just sits on it .
They say in the army you really get to know each other . "
Next , I scan the hull for some sign of technology , expecting to find kit like that on a stealth ship or fighter jet .
Behind a backrest I spot a unit about the size of a DVD player .
" What 's that then ? " I ask .
" I can't tell you – it 's classified . "
Maybe it 's the switch that makes us invisible to our enemies .
Then again , it could just be a DVD player .
Simon Usborne 's view from the Army Infantry tank
The Warrior is , a very strong lump of metal with a whacking great engine , a few seats , commode and a big gun .
But a new breed of tank is being planned that will make the Warrior look like , as Crowther puts it , " an armoured minibus " .
BAE Systems is building a new fleet of hi-tech tanks for the British Army , which go by the family name FRES ( Future Rapid Effect System ) .
They will roll out from 2012 , and will replace the inches of heavy steel and stonking great cannons that limit the utility of the Warrior and the Army 's battle tank , Challenger 2 .
The problem with much of the current fleet , says BAE land systems spokesman Mike Sweeney , is that they were built for a different time .
" Most armoured vehicles are well - protected in what 's called the frontal arch , which is fine on a traditional battlefield where you know the enemy 's location .
But in Iraq and Afghanistan , you have the invisible threat of IEDs [ improvised explosive devices ] , mines and guys popping up in urban environments and taking pot shots from all directions . "
BAE has already shipped bolt - on armour kits for the existing tanks , but the new theatre of war calls for a nimbler , lighter vehicle with the strength of the 60 - ton Challenger 2 .
" You 're seeking to achieve three things – mobility , protection and firepower – but traditionally , they are mutually exclusive , " Sweeney says .
" It 's a constant battle of wits between the techies and a very resourceful and innovative enemy . "
A lot of the innovation in the FRES tanks is in the form of smarter protection .
One system under trial on the Warrior is reactive armour , to defend against the terrifying force of a shape charge .
Often loaded in the tips of rocket - propelled grenades ( RPGs ) , when one strikes a tank , the detonator triggers the explosive , which in turn forces a metal cone to deform into a thin dart of metal .
The dart pierces the tank 's armour , and the explosion propels the dart at a speed of more than 15,000 mph through whatever it hits .
" It travels so quickly it behaves almost like water , washing away metal like a hose playing on sand , " Sweeney says .
Reactive armour , which can be bolted on , is designed to interrupt the formation and passage of the deadly dart with a layer of explosive .
In the split - second the RPG strikes , the explosive in the armour detonates , sending metal sheets into the path of the high - velocity dart .
There 's still an explosion , damage to the armour , and an almighty bang , but the tank remains largely intact .
But what if a tank were so smart it could destroy a missile before it even hit ?
That capability is not far off .
In a recent demonstration by the US Defence Department , a Stryker vehicle ( similar to the Warrior ) identified an incoming missile with an automatic radar tracking system .
A " kinetic energy " system fired a beam of energy at the missile , destroying it in mid-air .
In the meantime , the radar had worked out where the missile had come from , allowing the Stryker to fire back , seconds later .
Sweeney says it will take years for similar " death beam " systems to be in place on British vehicles .
However clever the armour , there will always be holes .
So if the safety of tank crews can't be guaranteed , why not take them out of the loop altogether ?
Soon the battlefield could hum with the sound of remote - controlled , or even autonomous , artificially intelligent tanks .
BAE has already developed a remote - controlled digger called the Terrier , which soldiers can use in dangerous tasks such as minesweeping , from a distance of more than 2 km .
The Terrier looks like no more sophisticated than a " ruggedised " JCB , but its driverless heart – a computer – relies on some 500,000 lines of software code , twice as many as there are in the Tornado fighter jet .
Remote - control tanks , on a smaller scale , are already being used .
In Iraq , American and British troops use metre- long , remote - control robots to inspect suspected roadside bombs .
The defence contractor Foster - Miller has developed a robot , called Talon , that wields machine guns .
For now , it relies on soldiers to control it and , more importantly , fire the guns , but many in the industry say autonomous tanks that move and even fire without anyone pressing a red button are not far off .
In fact , the technology has already been tested .
Last year , videos of a prototype robotic border sentry , developed by Samsung , circulated on the internet .
The footage showed the fixed position unit apparently using a laser - tracking system to locate and follow a dummy human , and then a machine gun to destroy it .
At no stage did a human make the decision to fire .
Mike Sweeney says that the delay in employing similar technologies on the battlefield is more down to the politicians than the engineers and inventors .
" There 's a clear political decision not to fire things without humans in the loop , " he says .
Developments like directed energy defence systems , reactive armour , remote operation or elements of autonomy will make the tanks of the future infinitely stronger and smarter .
But as long as tanks take humans , there is one piece of kit that will always be vital .
" The most important thing on a British armoured vehicle is the BV , " Sweeney says , as we trundle back to the Army base .
The BV ?
" The boiling vessel – the kettle . "

Gears of War 2 Technology Demo
Ambient occlusion , dynamic fluids , soft - body physics , AI flocking , and destructible environments ?
Yes please !
The new Unreal Engine is looking fantastic .
Now if they can add all of that to Call of Duty 5 my life would be complete .
I never really got the hang of Gears of War on the PC , the controls were far too clunky for me , but the multiplayer was insanely fun .
And Unreal Tournament 3 is vaguely fun as a multiplayer game , but going up against COD4 and Crysis it just does n’t cut it anymore without a story .
Ambient occlusion : Deals with bounced light off objects to enhance the contrast of objects and characters to make them more realistic with believable shadowing .

AI flocking :
With the new ambient occlusion tech they can render many more characters on screen , so you can have literally hundreds of AI enemies bearing down on you .
And they ’ll do it realistically using flocking technology to get around stuff and push each other out the way instead of just walking through each other the way most games bug out .

Ops tried to do this , but the result was cartoonish .
Unreal is trying it themselves , and the result is impressive , but they ’ve still built in artificial limits in that you can blow a wall to pieces , but it will still be standing with the steel structure underneath .
A bit of a cheat so you ca n’t blow your way out of a level .
· Industry is linked to trafficking and child labour · One in 10 products sold worldwide is counterfeit
A fancy hotel foyer , a glamorous model , and a vintage Ferrari to die for .
The hotel off Brussels ' main square is real , and the model , Yasmin Le Bon , is also genuine .
But the cherry - red Ferrari ?
A 1967 P4 , it looks like it has just turbocharged off an Austin Powers film set .
There were only three of these ever built .
Each is worth several million .
But this is not one of them .
Knocked up in a garage in the Thai countryside using Japanese parts , the Ferrari was about to be shipped to a European client when Thai police confiscated it .
Replicating the original in every visible detail , the car is a startling example of the genius for counterfeiting that is flourishing worldwide , eating into the aprofits of corporations and costing governments billions in lost tax revenue .
It has been linked to child slave - labour in India and China , with the products being distributed from New York to Leicester .
Le Bon posed beside the " Ferrari " yesterday to launch an international drive against counterfeits .
Campaigners say that the illicit global business has become a monster that is killing tens of thousands , funding terrorism and crime , and entrenching the victimisation of women and children in the developing world .
" This is something that really affects me because I 'm in the fashion business , " said Le Bon .
" It 's all very well buying that fake wallet in Dubai .
But every time you do that , you 're helping organised crime .
Many people are losing their lives . "
Fake designer labels remain a staple of the counterfeits industry .
But advances in digital technology and electronics mean that there is now little that cannot be quickly and cheaply reproduced and marketed as the real thing .
The result is a business worth an estimated $ 600 bn a year , with one in 10 of all products sold in the world now believed to be counterfeit .
Buying a new car ?
Around 10 % of the components are said to be counterfeit .
Travelling by air ?
The US says 2 % of the 26 m parts used annually in aircraft are phony .
Buying medicine online ?
There 's a good chance it will make you sick .
The Authentics Foundation , a London - based NGO behind the first " global anti-counterfeit summit " staged yesterday in Brussels , said : " Today reverse engineering can take place literally at a key stroke , counterfeiters use 3D laser scanners and software to develop the perfect copy in record time .
Digital technology has enabled counterfeiters to produce virtually any product known to mankind . "
According to customs figures for the EU for 2006 , the last year for which figures are available , more than 128 m counterfeit and pirated goods were seized at European borders , a rise of 70 % on the previous year and a tenfold increase in five years .
The EU commission president , Jose Manuel Barroso , said : " Counterfeiting now takes place on an industrial scale .
It has become an extremely profitable business , generating income that can compete with narcotics and weapons trafficking , but at much lower risk ...
The days when fake goods meant shifty men with a suitcase full of Rolexes are over . "
The proceeds , say the campaigners , are funding terrorism and organised crime , and facilitating money laundering and drugs and people trafficking .
Of 126 million children exposed worldwide to armed conflict , trafficking and child pornography , said John Trew of Care International , many are abusively employed in the fakes manufacturing industries , and being denied education .
" Any child being involved in the illegal production of goods is an unconditionally bad thing , " he said .
In Europe the campaigners singled out Britain and Italy as main distribution points for counterfeit goods , specifically Nottingham and Leicester .
In recent weeks customs officers have made several seizures of tens of thousands of counterfeit cigarettes from smugglers arriving at East Midlands airport , which serves the two cities .
The burgeoning trade in fake medicines such as Viagra is particularly alarming , according to researchers , because of the greater potential for damage to health .
The World Health Organisation thinks 10 % of all medicines are now faked .
False economy
· The fake medicines market is said to have an annual worth of € 40bn , up 25 % on three years ago and tipped to rise to € 70bn by 2010
· The main entry point to Europe for counterfeit goods , overwhelmingly from China via the United Arab Emirates , is Greece
· Almost half of all spirits sold in Russia are counterfeit , killing 43,000 Russians every year
· Hi-tech products , electronics , pirated media products and pharmaceuticals are believed to be the leading sectors in the fakes industry
· In 2006 , European border searches uncovered almost 74 m in counterfeit cigarettes , 60 % of all articles confiscated , although only 1 % of the seizure cases .
Clothing and textiles made up two thirds of cases
Iran and the United States remain so far apart on so many issues that they refuse to talk about them .
But in the cramped sea routes of the Persian Gulf , U.S. and Iranian warship sailors and fighter pilots speak to each other daily .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday July 14 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 68 words Type of Material : Correction
U.S. warship : A photo caption accompanying an article in Wednesday ’s Section A about U.S. and Iranian warships in the Persian Gulf said a fighter jet was lifting off from the U.S. nuclear - powered carrier John C. Stennis .
The plane , a French naval jet , was flying over the warship .
The photo was taken in April , when the carrier was participating in exercises with a French carrier in the Indian Ocean .
They have to .
They ’re practically jostling one another in courteous games of surveillance , counter - surveillance and geopolitical posturing .
“ We are operating very close to their territorial waters in a very confined space with a tremendous amount of traffic , be it the small dhows , be it the supertankers going up to the oil platforms , ” said U.S. Navy Capt .
Sterling Gilliam Jr. , commander of air operations for this nuclear - powered supercarrier and its associated ships .

“ The margin of error is smaller in that the space is more confined .
That would be the case even if anyone was your ally , just because of the sheer small size of the Arabian Gulf , ” Gilliam said , using an alternative name for the body of water .
Even mundane changes of direction require chitchat with Iranian counterparts .
When sedate gulf winds fade to a whisper , for example , this 100,000 - ton carrier whips up to the 25 knots required to hurl jets into flight from the 1,092 - foot flight deck .
But first the vessel alerts nearby forces of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard and the organization ’s navy .
“ We would do the standard international maritime measures , ” said Capt .
Bradley Johanson , commanding officer of the aircraft carrier .

“ We would call them on their radio and say , ‘ Sir , I just wanted to let you know that we ’re going to be turning to port and be coming to this course so that we ’re into the wind in support of our flight operation . ”
The Iranians respond professionally and courteously , Johanson said : “ ‘ Thank you very much for the information .
We will move off to the starboard position .
We very much appreciate the heads - up . ’ ”
Nearly half of the U.S. Navy ’s 277 warships are stationed close to Iran , alongside most of Tehran ’s estimated 140 naval surface ships and six submarines , according to GlobalSecurity.org .
More than five dozen aircraft are aboard the Stennis , along with dozens more aboard the Nimitz , another U.S. aircraft carrier in the gulf .

Multiple roles
Crew members on the Stennis say they are here to provide aircraft for peacekeeping and counterinsurgency missions in Iraq , Afghanistan and Somalia .
But few doubt they are also here to send a message to Iran , which the U.S. accuses of pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program and supporting anti-American militants from Lebanon to Afghanistan .
“ My feeling here is we ’re here to show our resolve , and to protect our friends , ” said Cmdr. Marcus Hitchcock , the Stennis ’ executive officer .

A flotilla of nine U.S. warships steamed through the Strait of Hormuz two months after the United Nations Security Council passed the last round of sanctions against Iran for continuing with its uranium enrichment program and Iranians seized 15 British sailors and marines in disputed waters off Iraq .
Positioning two aircraft carrier groups in the gulf gives the United States the capability to operate 24 hours a day and potentially conduct about 180 daily bombing and surveillance operations over Iran .
It also means the United States may be deploying nuclear weapons , believed to be aboard some of the ships in the aircraft carrier groups , within 10 miles of Iran ’s shores .

Big targets
But the aircraft carriers , each accompanied by four or five other ships , could become big targets for Iran in the event of a war .
“ It ’s going to be very hard to defend U.S. ships against small ships and volleys of missiles in the confines of the Persian Gulf , ” said Joseph Cirincione , a security analyst at the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank .
“ This is not an ideal situation for the Navy . ”

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. lie barely beneath the surface of the delicate maritime protocol .
Both Iran and the U.S. regularly dispatch spy planes to watch each other .
A photograph of an Iranian T - 12 reconnaissance plane is posted outside the intelligence office of the Stennis .
“ Image of the day , ” says the caption .
“ We would take a picture of an Iranian navy warship to see if they ’ve made any changes , ” said Vice Adm. Kevin J. Cosgriff , commander of the Bahrain - based U.S. 5th Fleet .
“ They do it too .
We pay attention and want to know where they are .
Is their action routine or are they getting ready for an exercise ? ”
Each country accuses the other of bad behavior .
Iran says the U.S. plays a disruptive role in the gulf and destabilizes the region .
U.S. officials say the Iranians behave like bullies , sometimes getting on the radio to order Americans to leave what the Iranians claim as territorial waters .
Americans also complain that Iranians do n’t do enough to clear sea lanes before conducting missile tests in international waters and that their aircraft fly too close to U.S. planes .
Advertisement
“ They ’re overt about it , ” Cosgriff said .
“ They ’re communicating . ”
Operating an aircraft carrier is a task that requires precision and stamina even in the most spacious waters .
Stumbling into a hot conflict with the Iranians remains a constant concern in the overcrowded gulf , where nearby oil wells glow orange in the steamy night , and wooden dhows , steel - hull freighters and warships navigate the waterway by day .
On the ship ’s computer maps , a thick black line delineates Iranian coastal waters from the rest of the gulf .
Shades of gray mark the waters off Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , allies of the United States .
U.S. pilots are told to stay well away from Iranian airspace .

“ We do worry about miscalculations , ” Cosgriff said .
“ That ’s one of the reasons we want to be transparent on the radio and be talking to them a lot . ”

NOVEMBER 20 -- Here is the police report detailing the heartless online hoax that apparently triggered last year 's suicide of 13 - year - old Megan Meier .
The Missouri teenager became despondent after a boy she met via MySpace abruptly and viciously turned on her , accusing the girl of promiscuity and saying the world would be better without her .
However , as the St. Charles County Sheriff 's Department report notes , Megan 's online friend ' Josh Evans ' was , in fact , the creation of a local family seeking to determine whether Megan was saying derogatory things about their daughter .
The adult behind the ' Josh ' ruse was Lori Drew , whose daughter had been friends with Megan , who died 13 months ago .
Drew admitted to police that she created the phony MySpace profile in a bid to smoke out negative comments about her child by Megan , who is pictured at right .
It was only after the girl 's death ( which is detailed in this sheriff 's report ) that her mother , Tina , discovered that ' Josh ' was created by Drew , who lived four doors away .
Drew , along with her husband Curt , sent the Meiers a handwritten note last year saying they had ' every compassion ' for the Meiers and asked for a chance to talk to them .
After law enforcement agencies determined that Drew apparently could not be held criminally accountable , the Meier family decided to go public with details of the hoax .
Drew approached the sheriff 's department last November , after ' the neighborhood ... found out her involvement in Megan 's suicide and her neighbors have become hostile toward her and her family . '
Drew , the report noted , wanted the neighborhood tension to be documented in case any of her property was subsequently damaged .
Since last December , Drew , 48 , has filed three police complaints alleging harassment and property damage in retaliation for her MySpace hoax .
She has reported a brick being thrown through her kitchen window and claimed that Megan 's father Ronald yelled at her , ' Who are you gonna kill today ? '
In April , Drew told police that a paintball had been shot at her sunroom 's window , causing about $ 50 in damage .
While Drew had previously placed a surveillance camera in the sunroom , the tape did not help identify a suspect .
And , as a sheriff 's report notes , ' Drews did not wish to release the tape , as she anticipated a civil law suit against her by Meier and may need the tape for legal purposes . ' ( 13 pages )

As social networks like Friendster and then MySpace first came to prominence in the 2003/2004 time frame , we wondered why the big players ( AOL / Yahoo / Microsoft ) in the instant messaging space did n't recognize that those instant messaging networks were better social networks than the networks .
Whereas most social networks had little to do once you connected , most people used instant messaging to communicate all the time .
Those instant messaging systemsknew who all your " friends " were , and it should n't be that hard to then take that information and convert it into a more standard social network , with instant messaging features built right in .
Yet , nothing really happened .
Yahoo and Microsoft made some half - hearted attempts at social networking with little success , keeping them mostly separate from their vibrant instant messaging networks .
Now , it appears that AOL has finally woken up and realized this possibility , but since it 's so late to the game , it 's decided to just buy Bebo for $ 850 million and integrate it with AIM
While $ 850 million is less than was earlier rumored , and suggests that Bebo 's growth rate is n't as strong as it would like , the site does have plenty of users ( mostly in the UK ) .
When I was over in the UK a few months ago , everyone was talking about Bebo the way people talk about Facebook here .
That said , linking AIM to Bebo in a way that gets people interested may be difficult .
There 's certainly a bit of social network fatigue going on these days , and it seems as though people are beginning to wonder why they should join yet another social network unless it really provides something different and compelling than the last social network .
Yes , AOL should be turning AIM into a social network , but they should have done it four years ago when it still made sense .
As it stands , this seems likely to go nowhere fast -- especially with the cloud over AOL 's future strategy .

So the stimulus plan agreed to by House Democrats is a real piece of , um , bad legislation .
It could have been even worse — it could have been the plan Bush wanted , which would have delivered virtually no stimulus at all .
But it ’s very , very weak .
But why worry , aside from the big waste of funds ?
Because there ’s a real chance that we ’ll be very sorry that we did n’t get a serious stimulus plan .
This plan leaves recession - fighting entirely up to the Fed .
And as I ’ve pointed out before on this blog , the Fed may not have enough ammunition .
People say that the last recession was brief and mild .
But that ’s an artifact of the way the NBER defines recessions — basically as periods when everything is going down .
Once something starts going up ( usually GDP ) , it ’s labeled a recovery .
But in the last two recessions the thing that matters most — employment — kept falling long after the official end of the recession .
And in the last two recessions the Fed kept cutting interest rates long after the recessions were supposedly over — all the way down to just 1 percent in 2003 :
Indeed , as Alan Greenspan has revealed , the Fed still feared the possibility of “ corrosive deflation ” well into 2003 .
What finally created a convincing recovery was the housing boom .
But that turned into a bubble , which has burst big time .
We do n’t know for sure by any means , but it definitely looks possible that this slump will be worse and more persistent than 2001 - 2003 .
And housing wo n’t come to the rescue this time .
Meanwhile , the Fed has less room to cut : interest rates ca n’t go below zero ( banks will just sit on cash rather than lend money out at a negative rate ) , and they started lower this time than they did in 2000 .
The bottom line is that Ben Bernanke could definitely use some fiscal wind at his back .
But thanks to the lousy deal announced today , he wo n’t get it .
McCain to 60 Minutes : US has been torturing prisoners David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Senator John McCain was recently accused of flip - flopping on the issue of torture when he voted against a bill to ban waterboarding , saying that he did not want to tie the CIA to the guidelines of the Army Field Manual .
McCain , who was him tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , had previously spoken out strongly against the use of torture and added a ban on torture to a defense spending bill in 2005 .
Now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee for president , McCain appears eager to shore up his anti-torture credentials .
In an appearance on CBS 's 60 Minutes , McCain replied , " Sure , yes , without a doubt " when asked if waterboarding is torture .
" We prosecuted Japanese war criminals after World War II , " McCain went on , " and one of the charges brought against them , for which they were convicted , was that they waterboarded Americans . "
Asked " how did we lose our way , " McCain answered , " I do n't know the answer to that .
I think one of the failures maybe was not to listen more to our military leadership , including people like general Colin Powell on this issue . "
McCain appeared less certain when asked about the economy , saying only that " these are very tough times " and that " I would love to tell you that I had an immediate answer " for high gas prices .
McCain also stated that he disagrees with Hillary Clinton 's description of universal health care as " a moral responsibility " because the government should not " mandate anything to the American people . "
His own proposals are based on a $ 2500 - per-person , $ 5000 - per- family tax credit to cover a portion of the cost of buying health insurance .
This video is from CBS 's 60 Minutes , broadcast March 9 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: pelley : it is an immutable law of american politics that the candidate with the most money wins the nomination .
but tuesday that ended when john mccain , nearly broke at one point , became , in effect , the republican nominee .
the life of john mccain is the story of one near - death experience after another , both literally and in terms of his career .
how appropriate that he hails from a town called phoenix . :: ladies and gentleman , please welcome the presumptive republican nominee for president , senator john mccain and mrs. cindy mccain . :: pelley : tuesday night in dallas marked a historic comeback for a campaign that had been considered dead - finished . :: mccain : thank you , texas , ohio , vermont , and rhode island .
thank you . :: pelley : mccain claimed the nomination at the end of an exhausting and emotional day .
we met the senator and his wife , cindy , after his speech .
about four months ago , the polls showed you coming in fourth in new hampshire .
you were down to your last $ 50,000 .
your opponents were out spending you massively and tonight you 're the party 's nominee .
what is it about you that got you here ? :: mccain : i think it shows that in america , anything is possible .
i think hard work , i think telling people the truth .
but tonight i'm obviously very happy and very humbled by having had the ability to get this nomination . :: pelley : as of about an hour ago , you became the leader of the republican party , a party that you 've sometimes been at odds with . :: mccain : from time to time . :: pelley : where are you going to lead it to ? :: mccain : we have to , i think , reenergize the party .
we have to expand the base .
we have to appeal to the independents and we got to go out and get those reagan democrats and there 's a whole new generation of them , we got our work cut out for us . :: pelley : the next day , he accepted an endorsement that cuts both ways .
the president is popular with conservatives , but , overall , he has the lowest approval ratings since nixon and carter . :: bush : i'm proud to be your friend . :: pelley : the united states is going to be in iraq for years to come .
afghanistan is not going well .
osama bin laden is at large .
and the economy is slipping into recession .
how do you make a case for a third republican term ? :: mccain : i can make a case that a less government , lower taxes , less regulation , safer america is what i can give america .
but i do n't underestimate the size of the challenge . :: pelley : senator obama calls you a genuine american hero who represents the politics of yesterday . :: mccain : yeah , that 's a pretty good line , i think .
yeah , and i understand that .
and my response , of course , is that i have the experience and the knowledge and the background to make the judgments that are necessary to move this nation forward and make it safe . :: pelley : you 're saying that senator obama does n't have the experience , that he 's too naive to be president ? :: mccain : no , i am saying that i have that .
and if the phone rings at 3:00 a.m. , i think the american people would want me to answer it first . :: pelley : but no one had expected him to be around to take that call .
moderates did n't like mccain 's support for the surge in iraq .
conservatives did n't like his plan for citizenship for illegal immigrants .
contributions dried up .
before new hampshire , he burned through a $ 3 million loan that he had secured with a life insurance policy .
what was the darkest moment ? :: mccain : there were so many .
it 's hard to pick one out . :: pelley : i am told that , on a trip to new hampshire , one of your aides switched you off one airline and put you on southwest airlines because it would save a few bucks .
you were down to that .
is that true ? :: mccain : i do n't remember the incident .
it may have happened without them telling me .
but it certainly would n't surprise me . :: pelley : you never talked to anybody about giving it up ? :: mccain : no. no. :: pelley : mccain centered his campaign on what was among the most divisive issues in america , the surge in iraq . :: mccain : i believe that we should not choose to lose in iraq . :: pelley : when we traveled with him to iraq last april , two - thirds of the american people were against the surge . :: mccain : i believe that we can succeed , and i believe the consequences of failure are catastrophic .
those who say , " just withdraw , " then you say , " what next ? " :: pelley : i wonder at what point do you stop doing what you think is right , and you start doing what the majority of the american people want ? :: mccain : well , again , i disagree with what the majority of the american people want .
failure will lead to chaos .
withdrawal will lead to chaos . :: pelley : that was not what the american people wanted to hear at that time . :: mccain : that 's exactly right .
it 's not what they wanted to hear .
i can read the polls very well . :: pelley : but you said it anyway . :: mccain : well , i said at the time i'd much rather lose a campaign than lose a war .
now more and more and more americans are believing that the surge is succeeding .
i'm very glad of that .
:: mac is back !
mac is back !
mac is back ! :: pelley : surge success helped win new hampshire , and , later , the conservative vote split between romney and huckabee .
mccain won just enough conservatives , moderates , and independents to seize the momentum .
it was a narrow escape for mccain , but then , that 's the story of his life .
johnny be good :: pelley : as a naval aviator during vietnam , he walked away from an accident that killed 134 others .
he was shot down on his 23rd combat mission .
the enemy offered to let him go because he was the son of an admiral , but mccain demanded that other americans be released first , so he remained five and a half years .
because of torture , today he can lift his arms only so high .
we asked him about american interrogation methods today .
is water boarding torture ? :: mccain : sure , yes , without a doubt . :: pelley : so the united states has been torturing p.o.w.s ? :: mccain : yes .
scott , we prosecuted japanese war criminals after world war ii , and one of the charges brought against them , for which they were convicted , was that they water - boarded americans . :: pelley : how did we lose our way ? :: mccain : i do n't know the answer to that .
i think one of the failures maybe was not to listen more to our military leadership , including people like general colin powell on this issue .
if i have to follow him to the gates of hell , i will get osama bin laden , and i will bring him to justice . :: pelley : in your town hall meetings , you 're fond of saying that you will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell . :: mccain : yeah . :: pelley : with respect , following him to the gates of hell is easy .
what 's hard is putting several divisions of u.s. forces on the border of afghanistan and pakistan .
what are you willing to do ? :: mccain : well , the first thing is not to tell osama bin laden what i'm going to do , but i'll get him . :: pelley : foreign policy is mccain 's specialty , but at least for now , most voters say they 're worried about the economy .
back in 1992 , bill clinton had a sign hanging in his campaign war room , a pretty famous sign .
do you recall what it said ? :: mccain : " it 's the economy , stupid . " yes . :: pelley : everywhere we went in texas with you , it was about the war and foreign policy , and i wondered in those town hall meetings if you had an understanding of how concerned people are about the economy , about whether they can keep their homes , about whether they can keep their jobs . :: mccain : look , these are tough times .
these are very tough times . :: pelley : how would you characterize the mortgage mess ? :: mccain : i think it 's a disaster .
but let me hasten to add , scott , i think the fundamentals of our economy are still strong . :: pelley : what do you do for the person who just saw gasoline go from $ 3.25 to $ 3.50 , and on it 's way to $ 4 ? :: mccain : i would love to tell you that i have an immediate answer for that , and i do n't .
the only way we are going to fix it is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil .
we 've got to have a crash program , an all - out effort .
but i can't give you straight talk and tell you that tomorrow i can change the price of a gallon of gas . :: pelley : on taxes , mccain voted against the bush tax cuts originally .
now he wants to make them permanent .
but he says that his own party has let spending go wildly out of control .
senator clinton says that providing universal health care is " a moral responsibility . " do you agree ? :: mccain : well , i think that 's one of the big differences we have about the role of government .
if you think that the government should mandate anything to the american people than besides a safety net ... and i do n't view it as a safety net .
i view medicare and medicaid as a safety net .
but to mandate that all americans are required to do something , then that 's just not within the fundamental philosophy that i have about the role of government in america . :: pelley : instead of government insurance , mccain proposes a $ 5,000 tax credit so families can buy insurance of their own .
on immigration he says that the borders should be secured first .
but despite criticism from conservatives , he told us this about illegal immigrants . :: mccain : if they complied with some very stringent and rigid requirements , they could find themselves on a path to citizenship . :: pelley : on capitol hill , he gets credit for reaching out to democrats on big issues like immigration and campaign finance reform .
but his fellow politicians are critical of his high - minded condemnation of money in politics .
you point your finger at other senators and claim that there is a culture of corruption on capitol hill , but you take money from lobbyists who have business before your committee , as other senators do .
so how is it that you call the system corrupt ? :: mccain : well , one of the reasons why i call the system corrupt is because we have members of congress who are in jail , who are former members of congress .
but it 's not the individuals .
it 's the system we have today .
i believe that i serve with honorable men and women .
and i believe the people who bring their case to government , the overwhelming majority of them are honorable people . :: pelley : the lobbyists ? :: mccain : retirees have a lobbyist .
firemen have a lobbyist .
your business has a lot of lobbyists , a lot of lobbyists . :: pelley : mccain claims he 's never done a favor for money .
he believes that he 's being held to a higher standard because of his criticism .
at 71 years old , mccain 's health has been an issue .
after his presidential race in 2000 , he was diagnosed with the most lethal form of skin cancer .
how 's your health ? :: mccain : it 's excellent .
it 's excellent , excellent .
thank you .
and we 'll be doing the medical records thing with the media sometime in the next month or two .
:: pelley : there has been some criticism that you have not released your medical records .
you 're saying in this interview that you 're about to do that .
:: mccain : oh , yeah , we 'll do it in the next month or so , yeah . :: pelley : is it fair to say that , at this point in time , there 's no sign of a recurrence in cancer ? :: mccain : oh , no , no .
there 's none . :: pelley : but there is an occasional recurrence of mccain 's temper .
we saw it again the day of our interview when he became annoyed with a reporter 's questions . :: mccain : there 's no one , and you know it , too .
so , no , you know it .
you know it .
so i do n't even know why you ask . :: pelley : some people say you have a short fuse . :: mccain : yes . :: pelley : you acknowledge that ? :: mccain : i think i get angry when i see things go wrong .
i've never been elected ms .
congeniality .
but i do believe that i can unite this party .
and i think the american people support somebody who still has the capacity , maybe , to get angry from time to time when we see something wrong . :: pelley : now , eight months before election day , mccain is running a close race .
he 's behind in fund - raising , but he has a head start on november as the democrats battle on .
to those who say that you can't beat a democrat in november , you say what ? :: mccain : i say i know that i can .
but i also believe that america is a right - of - center nation .
and i think that senator obama and senator clinton , with all due respect , are liberal democrats , and i'm a conservative republican .
so i believe i can make a better case to the american people .
As the hype surrounding the Tata Nano subsides , we 're seeing a sharper picture of what a $ 2,500 car means for the environment and global energy demand .
It does n't look good .
The world 's cheapest car is a marvel of engineering and ruthless cost - cutting sure to bring greater mobility to people throughout the developing world .
And that is what makes it so troubling .
The Nano does n't go on sale until fall , but already environmentalists say it will bring big increases in carbon dioxide emissions and pollution .
" This car promises to be an environmental disaster of substantial proportions , " Yale environmental law professor Daniel Esty told Newsweek .
Some energy experts say all those new cars will increase demand for gasoline , with one telling CNN , " we 'll get into a situation where we 'll have to compete with them for gasoline , $ 4 , $ 5 a gallon .
Who knows how high we could go ? "
It would be easy to denounce the naysayers as western do - gooders with no moral standing to criticize India .
But the most vocal critics include Indians who say the Nano will deepen the country 's critical pollution , infrastructure and traffic woes .
Could the Nano really be so bad ?
At first glance it looks like an eco-friendly ride .
It has a 623 cc engine that produces 33 horsepower , gets close to 50 mpg , meets Euro III emissions standards and according to the Economist should be able to meet tougher Euro IV standards " with a bit of tweaking . "
But the prospect of tens or even hundreds of thousands of Nanos on the road worries environmentalists .
India 's Economic
Times says the Nano potentially could expand the country 's auto market by 65 percent and spur a 20 percent increase in auto sales in its first year .
Honda , Toyota and Fiat are among the companies developing competitors to the Nano .
The proliferation of cheap vehicles could prompt as much as 25 percent of the 50 million people who ride scooters to buy cars , the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi says .
India is the world 's fourth - largest overall producer of the greenhouse gas ( it ranks far lower in per- capita terms ) .
Its carbon emissions are expected to triple by 2020 , according to the United Nations , and climate experts are only beginning to ponder what the " Nano effect " may mean for the global environment .
" In none of our reports did we assume there 'd be a car like this , " Judi Greenwald , a researcher with the Pew Center on Global Climate Change , told Newsweek .
" This is a new category .
It will effect everybody 's projections . "
The Center for Science and Environment warns more cars will only exacerbate congestion and smog - related illnesses in a country where 57 percent of cities already face critical levels of air pollution .
Tata counters that the Nano is cleaner than the scooters it will replace and claims the car 's catalytic converter cuts emissions by 80 percent .
The Nano supposedly emits 30 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer , well below the 160 g/ km average of Europe 's cars and far less than the 130 g/ km standard the European Union will adopt in 2012 .
Even if half a million Nano's hit the road and each of them travels 5,000 miles a year , they will be responsible for less than 8 percent of India 's annual CO2 emissions , Economic Times reports .
Most of the hand - wringing over the Nano has focused on its environmental impact , but some are beginning to ponder what the car will mean for global energy supplies .
There is mounting concern that increased demand for petroleum will boost prices .
The International Energy Agency has said " alarming " growth in worldwide energy needs could , among other things , bring worldwide shortages .
It said India 's motor vehicle fuel consumption will triple by 2030 .
Growth in the U.S. , by comparison , is expected to increase 40 percent .
Auto sales in India are expected to double , to 3 million , by 2015 , according to J.D. Power & Associates .
Although the Nano is very fuel efficient , energy policy experts see two problems , according to CNN .
First , Nano buyers will be moving up from scooters , which typically get much better fuel economy .
Second , the Nano - and the cheap cars that are sure to come along to compete against it - are " gateway vehicles " the automakers hope will entice customers to upgrade to larger , and less fuel efficient , cars down the line .
Not everyone is convinced a $ 2,500 car in India means $ 5 gas in Illinois .
Michael Robinet , vice president of global vehicle forecasts for CSM Worldwide , notes that gasoline refining blends vary by country and the high prices we pay in the U.S. are due largely to refining bottlenecks .
And , he said , if India is going to follow the West 's development model , it 's better that they do it in subcompact cars that get 50 mpg than SUVs that get 15 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Defense Department accidentally shipped ballistic missile components to Taiwan , the Pentagon said Tuesday .
A U.S. Defense Department image shows the missile components it says were accidentally shipped to Taiwan .
Four nose - cone fuses for intercontinental ballistic missiles were shipped instead of the helicopter batteries that Taiwan had requested , Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne said .
The fuses were shipped to Taiwan in fall 2006 and kept in a warehouse there .
The Taiwanese military informed the United States last week about their presence on the island .
" There are no nuclear or fissile materials associated with these items , " Wynne said .
" The United States is making all appropriate notifications in the spirit of candor and openness in an effort to avoid any misunderstanding . "
Watch Wynne describe the fuses »
An investigation is under way , he added .
Watch how missile parts ended up in Taiwan »
Ryan Henry , principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy , said , " In an organization as large as DOD , the largest and most complex in the world , there will be mistakes .
But they cannot be tolerated in the arena in strategic systems , whether they are nuclear or only associated equipment , as was in this case . "
Henry said the parts were 1960s technology , designed for use with Minuteman ballistic missiles .
Officials said China , which considers Taiwan to be a renegade province , has been notified about the mistake .
The Chinese government did not immediately issue a response to the news .
Wynne said the missile components were first shipped from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to Hill Air Force Base in Utah in 2005 .
On arrival at Hill , they should have been placed in the classified storage section , Wynne said , but instead were moved to a storage area for unclassified items .
He said stocks at the Utah base should be checked quarterly and a key part of the investigation will be determining how those checks did not turn up the missile parts before they were shipped to Taiwan .
It is the second nuclear - related mistake involving the Air Force in less than a year .
In August , a B - 52 bomber mistakenly carried six nuclear warheads from North Dakota to Louisiana .
A six - week investigation uncovered a " lackadaisical " attention to detail in day - to - day operations at the air bases involved .
The Air Force said it relieved four officers , including three colonels , and other personnel lost their certification to handle sensitive weaponry .

Rebelling against alleged " slave treatment , " some 100 workers recruited from India staged a dramatic protest at a Mississippi shipyard Thursday , claiming they had been tricked into coming to the United States .
The workers , brought from India to work as welders and pipe - fitters at Signal International shipyard in Pascagoula , hurled their hard hats at company gates and demanded a federal investigation .
The workers claim they were defrauded by a Signal International recruiter in India who promised them green cards and permanent residency in the U.S. in exchange for a $ 20,000 fee .
The workers allege that they instead received 10 - month work visas , which was only enough time for them to pay off their recruitment fees .
The workers also claim that Signal forced them to live in substandard housing , with 24 men crammed into a small room .
The men say Signal charged them more than $ 1,000 a month to live in company housing .
" For more than one year , hundreds of Indian workers at Signal International have been living like slaves , " said former Signal worker Sabulal Vijayan .
" Today the workers are coming out to declare their freedom .
This trafficking needs to end . "
The workers have reported their situation to the U.S. Department of Justice and are calling for Signal International to be prosecuted on human trafficking charges .
Signal International strongly denied the workers ' allegations .
The company released a statement saying , " Unfortunately , a few of the workers whom Signal had sponsored for H2B visas and recruited have made baseless and unfounded allegations against Signal concerning their employment and living conditions . "
According to the statement , " The vast majority of the workers whom Signal recruited has been satisfied with the employment and living conditions at Signal . "
Signal called its housing complex " state of the art " and said government inspections have " found that Signal 's practices and facilities are fully compliant with the law . "
The Mississippi Gulf Coast has faced a severe labor shortage in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , and many companies have replenished their workforce with overseas labor brought in under a guest worker plan .
Human rights groups , however , charge that many foreign workers have been exploited by their employers .
" The U.S. State Department calls it ' a repulsive crime ' when recruiters and employers in other parts of the world bind guest workers with crushing debts and threats of deportation , " said Saket Soni of the New Orleans Workers ' Center for Racial Justice .
" This is precisely what is happening on the Gulf Coast . "

Truthfully , this is as good as it gets .
We wo n’t have a chance like this again for some time - if ever , we know that , and we ’ve fallen in line .
The power structure has allowed this brotha to compete as long as he is clear on a few ground rules : no material changes will be made to the racist global economic order , Africa will not be liberated from its economic dependence on the World Bank and the IMF , and incremental changes in domestic economic institutions like the [ tag ] health care system [ / tag ] will be permitted within certain limits .
BEFORE VOTING FOR THIS MAN know just who and what you are voting for ...
It is now time for Senator John McCain and his implementation of the John Boyden , Esq. plan to " disappear " the Navajo of Arizona , so as to profit from the sale of Coal under their land , to be brought to Justice for criminal violation of the United States own Human Rights Laws , in a pattern of behavior that mirrors that of NAZI GERMANY and it 's Genocide of the Jews of Europe ..
Along with him , officials of the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs who arranged to embezzle the licensing money paid in by Peabody Western Coal , supposedly for use to help the Navajo , but embezzled anyway , along with officials of the Bureau of Land Management and Mines , who manipulate the wildlife rights of American Indians every year , so as to reduce their number , concentration and ability to prosper by living off the land .
In the most BRAZEN coordinated effort of Genocide in History , corrupt public officials are literally murdering the Navajo of Arizona and converting their lives and their lands into instant personal gain , by selling them off under the table to mining industry and the Power Industry .
In Arizona , John McCain claims there is a " Range War " going on in the Black Mesa .
There 's not , there 's just a militant corporate intimidation of the gentle people living their and cooperation by the above named public officials , coordinated by McCain , to accomplish the desired goals : remove the People ( Dine ) and mine their lands , hoping they die off before they can complain .
THE WHOLE SAD , DISGRACEFUL STORY
From the 1980 's - 2000 Senator John McCain sponsored , as both a Senator and a Congressmen , bills that under the guise of solving an alleged yet fake tribal land dispute , forced Navajo and Hopi Tribes off their native lands , by entering into a relationship with non-Traditional " leaders " , FAKE Tribal Counsels - puppets organized into a non-representative council by business interests at Kennecott Peabody Western Coal ( by Peabody attorney John Boyden ) .
Senator McCain 's bills to modify the Native American statutes in Congress and the Senate , followed enactments by his predecessor and mentor , were signed into law by Presidents Ford , Carter , Regan and as a full fledged Navajo " Resettlement " act by President Clinton .
They included elements authored by McCain , and his predecessor in Arizona , which forcibly relocate communities of Di'neh onto Nuclear Polluted EPA Condemned Dumpsites ( Superfund Sites ) .
Over 25 % of all the relocated Di'neh families have died within 6 years from Radiation - related disease and birth defects occur among Di'neh children at over twice the national average .
Uranium tailings uncovered in populated areas the Di'neh were resettled to are exposing children in schools on the Di'neh relocation sites to over 700 RADS per minute of radiation poisoning .
Mining company Peabody Western dumped Ammonium Nitrate into Di'neh watersheds , killing thousand upon thousand of sheep and cattle in the areas occupied by surviving Dine who refused to leave .
Bureau of Indian Affairs and Department of Justice personnel ran Fences across Di'neh Cattle Grazing Lands , and hired thugs were sent in to beat up and brutalize elders living on the lands .

HOW TO STEAL FROM INDIANS : CREATE A FAKE PUPPET TRIBAL COUNSEL
[ How to deprive a people of their voice , while undermining their rights and property ! ]
Unlike American Society , the Tribal system of government ordinarily has its own system of ascendancy to leadership , based on attributes adjudged to be important in the character and parenthood of the Chiefs , and wisdom and skills that bear personal examination by an entire tribe .
Peabody , by organizing its own facade " Tribal Council " in the 60's , created a condition whereby the Tribal system of government could be circumvented .
After decades of misdirecting relationship so that the American Public would not suspect that these Peabody Chiefs were " on the payroll " , rather than part of the Traditional Navajo or Hopi Government , along came Senator McCain with his " Relocation " and " Accommodation " bills .

HOW TO CIRCUMVENT RESISTANCE : IGNORE IT ,
BRUTALIZE IT , LIE ABOUT IT
These McCain sponsored bills virtually gave away the COAL MINING rights of the Traditional Native People of the Black Mesa , to a group of special interests , while displacing these noble , gentle , spiritual people onto something euphemistically called " the New Lands " - an abandoned dumpsite on EPA Superfund territory , spoiled by toxic materials including but not limited to Uranium spills , tailing from manufacture of Nuclear Fuel for Reactors and Bombs , and Uranium dust .
The individual human rights and requirement for the consent of the majority of the Natives ( of Navajo and Hopi descent and their Traditional Leaders ) went completely ignored , while the " contrived " leadership were easily influenced to sign documents used as justification to engage in the resettlement , against the permission of the Tribes themselves .
In essence , corrupt Public Officials bought easily corruptible Native personnel , who were then used to enslave and relocate the remaining tribal people against their will , above their protest , in opposition to a unanimous consensus intended to stop relocation and in violation of the Native 's Human Rights .
When confronted , McCain periodically would indicate he intended to issue ' amendments ' to these bills aimed at curbing the hardships imposed on the Native Peoples , amendments to such as S1973 and the Navajo Resettlement Act , which amendments never quite seem to get out of committee ... below you will find what Senator McCain was really doing : writing demand letters to the Attorney General asking Janet Reno to ENFORCE the public laws already in place , e.g.- to RELOCATE the Navajo , in what could only be described as a serious , two - faced betrayal of the the Native people 's human rights .
And , Janet Reno did just that , which led to the death of nearly another 2,000 of the elders of the Navajo Di'neh People .

HERE's AN EXCERPT FROM A UK NEWSPAPER : Doing anything on Wednesday ?
Peabody Coal is strip - mining Navajo and Hopi sacred land in Northern Arizona .
It ’s transported to the generating station via a " slurry line " ( a pipe carrying a coal and water mixture ) , for which Peabody extracts 1.2 billion gallons of water a year .

WHEN JANET RENO COMES A-KNOCKIN ' : PREPARE TO GLOW IN THE DARK !
We call the foregoing process , " the Cycle of Carpet Bagging " , whereby Peabody Western , the acknowledged Carpet Bagger , comes into a territory with " big bags of money " in carpet colored bags ( pardon our symbolic reference to the post Civil War south ) and buys off a few people to serve as puppet leadership , at the time Peabody was a Kennecott Petroleum company .
Then Senator McCain , and his predecessor a Government representative acting to the benefit of the Carpet Bagger , to get ahead in his political career , modifies or sponsors a few laws designed to produce the Bounty : displace the Native Navajos by creating the clever appearances of a range war ( requiring intervention ) AND unrestricted Grazing ( requiring Fences ) AND unlicensed Herds of Cattle and Sheep ( requiring Capping off of the wells , to prevent the Natives from having any more Herds ) and more of the same ( requiring the sending in of the Justice Department to move the Navajo out ) and there by all intended to make it that much easier for the Trust Held lands of the Navajo to be conveniently conveyed to the Carpet Bagger Peabody Western so they can then Mine the Coal .
Black Gold , Coal crushed and mixed with the very pristine water of the Di'neh used to feed their cattle and sheep , redirected to mix with the Coal Slurry and pumped through a pipeline , to sell to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin , Nevada and Southern California .
And just in case any Navajo be left to complain , after brutalizing them , McCain and his political allies like President Clinton and his wife , and others , came up with the idea of moving them wholesale to the Nuclear Dumping Grounds of Arizona .

A people who aside from their farming , who could only find a life by working for Uranium mines in the area that fed the American Nuclear Power Industry and Weapons facilities , leading to illness in that profession one can't even imagine without medical texts on cancer and radiation poison , find that their remaining elders and children and entire families are then made to live on the Dump Sites for the Nuclear Tailings and Toxic Waste , while their absolutely beautiful Mesa and Mountain territories are strip mined by Peabody Western Coal , and even the money paid in by Peabody that was supposed to be " rent " paid to the Navajo , ends up stolen , and not given to any of the Native Indians .
JOHN MCCAIN AND MENTORS LEARNED THIS METHOD FROM JOHN BOYDEN , ESQ
While Coal Profiteers : Ted Kennedy , John Kerry , and Jay Rockefeller remain mute and gain wealth from it all !
( And you thought Ted Kennedy just inherited Boot Legging proceeds from his father ???
Coal is a Kennedy Family business ... )
These McCain - sponsored Laws were carefully orchestrated to support mining interests , designed around a fiction : a Kennecott owned Peabody Western Coal Mining attorney named John Boyden , a Kennedy family / Rockefeller family stooge , back in the 60's and 70's cleverly organized a Peabody controlled NON - TRADITIONAL " Hopi Tribal Council " during the latter half of this century , and created the FICTION of Tribal Consent , and a second FICTION of Tribal Benefit .
Neither actually took place .
In fact , the Hopi Tribal Council then passed laws which entitle Coal Mining to take place , while evicting the Native Americans living on the land above it , without any regard for their rights or religious beliefs , sending them to a toxic dump site to live .
This " Hopi Tribal Council " is what is called a " Proxy Government " , and in support of its efforts to deprive the Native Americans of their Human Rights and Coal Bearing lands , Senator McCain created several laws , one of which forces the Navajo to sign a " settlement " with the bogus Hopi Tribal Council proxy , or be evicted ANYWAY , forcibly .
The Non-Traditional leadership council , composed of a small group of Hopi citizens carefully culled by Boyden out of the Native Population , were used by Kennecott / Peabody to falsely represent the consensus of the Navajo and Hopi .
They were also used to create the appearances of an intertribal dispute , after the BIA was convinced by Boyden to recognize it as the " true leadership " of the Natives ( which was as far from the truth as could be ) .
The laws signed by these non-traditional " Council Members " always represented the interests of Peabody ( from the 60's forward ) .

WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE ABOUT JOHN BOYDEN >
the man who played both sides of the issue against the middle .
Secretly counsel to the Rockefeller / Kennedy family interests
he represented their effort to spread Coal interests in Arizona Native Lands .
They never involved the consent of the actual Navajo or Hopi .
Boyden 's contrived " Tribal Council " carefully cultivated public perception that it represented the Native Peoples of Black Mesa ( a self fulfilling prophesy , as : the more they were accepted by the White public as leadership , the more power was conveyed to them by the Bureau of Indian Affairs ) .
They gradually became an " elite leadership " , awaiting a Senator John McCain to come along in the 80's and 90's to answer their false claims of " tribal border conflict " with a series of Public Laws purported ( falsely ) to curb this conflict .
McCain sponsored bills these " false chiefs " ratified ( after the US enacted them ) into law allowing the Secretary of the Interior to remove nearly all the Traditional Elders , Religious Leaders and the actual Native people off the Black Mesa land , licensing it 's mining rights over to Peabody , placing the property licensing fees into Trusts administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( which trust funds appear to have at least in part been embezzled ) , falsely claiming that a " range war " existed and action had to be taken .
HOW TO FAKE A RANGE WAR ...
SIMPLE : FENCE 'EM IN , CAP THE WELLS , SEIZE THEIR CATTLE , BLOW UP THEIR LAND , GET THEM TO STAND UP AND COMPLAIN ...
THEN SEND IN YOUR THUGS TO BEAT THE HELL OUT OF THEM AND PAY THE AUTHORITIES A LOT OF HUSH MONEY !!!
THE JOHN MCCAIN / PEABODY WESTERN FORMULA ...
To give the appearances of such " range war " , the Boyden " Tribal Council " , indirectly confronted the traditional elders and natives , arranging for the confiscation of horses and livestock belonging to the Elders and Traditional Leadership of the Navajo and Hopi ( we here prefer to speak of the Navajo and Hopi as two tribal people living in harmony with each other ) , leading to periodic scuffles instigated both by this " Tribal Council " of no-portfolio and by the enforcement agents of the Bureau of Land Management and Reclamation , claiming the Elders and other Natives had been " mismanaging " their herds .
The BIA also built a fence 300 miles long to block the normal feeding territories of the tribes , causing many of the remaining traditionally farming and range herding Natives in the area to take action to tear pieces of the fence down so that they could resume their farming and herding .
Of course , one might suggest that the BIA modeled this behavior after the Russians in Berlin with the Berlin Wall .
What easier way to claim a " range war " than to fence across people 's grazing and herding grounds bottling up their cattle and their peace of mind ?

IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM , KILL 'EM , LIE ABOUT 'EM OR CON 'EM ,
CONVICT 'EM & EVICT 'EM
Today , after the first big phase of this " eviction " has been undertaken : Peabody is now strip mining the enormous quantities of Coal discovered to lie untapped below the surface , and has publicized it believes it can continue to do so for 100 years .
Meanwhile , the leases continue for so long as the coal exists , providing Peabody an ongoing motive for hoping to displace the traditional Native tribes in the region , generally by the same methods described above , so that the leases will be prolonged and their coal output increased .
And Senator John McCain is Peabody 's CAPO , he has continued to maintain the false appearances for so long , even he seems to believe his own BS .
" This is sacred site preservation . "
Interviewer : " Say more about that . "
" This tree over here is Peabody Coal 's idea of preserving sacred sites .
If you say that you have a burial or a shrine , this is how they preserve it .
When a family tells them that there is a burial site or a shrine of some sort , and they have to go around it , this is how they go around it . "
Shockingly , Peabody strip mined the entire sacred site , leaving a small mound of dirt , root and the tree that was at the center of the Dineh 's holy land .
ELDER Di'neh ARE SO INTENSELY SPIRITUAL , ALL THEY SEEM TO WORRY ABOUT IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LAND ...
The Traditional and Spiritual Leaders of the Di'neh ( Navajo ) and Hopi , who have lived together for over a century and a half peacefully , have approached the United Nations and the various Authorities on Environmental Refugee and Human Rights matters , about the fact that their lands are being destroyed , and that they will not just " repair themselves " spontaneously .
Both Tribes have a deep spiritual connectedness with the Lands they occupy .
Millions of gallons of their pristine waters are being pumped out by Peabody to make slurry of coal and water , to send to the Mohave Generating Station near Laughlin , Nevada , a primary power supplier to Las Vegas and elsewhere in Nevada where Casinos flourish .
Even present day leadership of the Navajo and Hopi will not allow Casinos onto their property ( it is a violation of some Native spiritual beliefs , which monotheistic , at - one - with nature philosophical discipline is a very gentle , very advanced religious theology which , when practiced normally produces a very noble , very intelligent and worldly world view remarkably similar to that of early Judeo - Christianity ) in Big Mountain or Black Mesa .
And , the Traditional Elders , Leaders and Natives of the Black Mesa have been continuously opposing , and resisting and filing complaint after complaint for repeal of S1973 and the other laws which caused the resettlements .
A second mine ( the Kayenta Mine ) railroad 's coal to other distribution units which feed a consortium of electricity " harvesters " based reportedly in Massachusetts ( Citizens Power ) , also a Peabody company .
" DROP YOUR SOCKS , AND HEAD TO CHURCH'S ROCK , CHIEF CRAZY HORSE "
This classic line uttered by a local law enforcement official to a local native in the Big Mountain area , an official on Janet Reno 's staff , understated the true problem with the Clinton Administration 's and John McCain 's / Ted Kennedy 's / John Kerry 's plans to deport the Dineh from their own lands ...
" This is yellow cake , the uranium used to power nuclear plants , and to make atomic bombs .
It is surface contamination from the uranium spill into the Rio Puerco at the Church 's Rock Dumpsite .
This is part of the New Lands to which we are being relocated . " -- Dineh Leadership
As Bill and Hillary Clinton traded barbs with the Republican critics of the Clinton Administration , Natives were force marched to this uranium spill soaked land , and forced to squat on 700 RAD emitting ground , many of whom have since died of unspeakable Cancers .
And what did the Clinton's and the Kerry 's and the Kennedy's and the McCain 's and the Rockefeller 's ( the true culprits at the back of the pack ) do with what was left with the incredible Black Mesa after Peabody mining ?
" This is a reclaimed site , after strip mining . "
Interviewer : " This is how they leave it , just totally bare ? "
" This is the first stage of reclamation .
What they do is they plant cattle grass .
They are replacing the pinion , juniper growth and the medicine plants and the dye plants and the wild foods with cattle grass .
This is reclaimed land . "
Interviewer : " So they are replacing a complex ecosystem with a monoculture , one plant ? " " Exactly . "

Here is a photograph of the same area above prior to the above strip mining :
: Exactly !
Believe it or not , this effort to deport the Dineh off their land was formalized in 1996 by an act of the US Senate , something the Dineh peacefully resisted for over 30 years was fraudulently restated as settlement of a disputed lands , resulting in the actual Navajo being deported off them !
Consecrated with false evidence , a phony tribal counsel hired by Peabody , and the lies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs , the Navajo were being set up by the Senate Sponsors : The Senate Sponsored Partition Law of 1996 > ( click link to left )
Note the language that fraudulently suggests that the Navajo Dineh need to be relocated " to facilitate a peaceful resolution of conflict " , fraud that is based on a non existent conflict that was manufactured by John McCain and Peabody : who formed their own fake Hopi Tribal Council and police consisting mainly of BIA agents , then filed phony land claims against the Dineh living on the Coal Rich Lands .
All just public fraud - done to facilitate the mining , without regard to the Dineh 's Human Rights .
Note that professional hackers have tried to hack the various copies of this introduction on web at many sites .
The History showing the Senate Partition Law of 1996 > ( click link to left ) was " by Mr. McCain " .
No argument there .
This is the first retrieval of the history showing Senator McCain was its author .
This bill was followed by annual amendments by McCain expanding the territorial disputes beyond any reasonable claim , over and over to widen the area Peabody could mine without any " filthy natives " in the way ( quoting a private memorandum involving the mining company ) .
Senate Bill S.2111 ( TEXT OF ACT , HISTORY OF ACT ) , Introduced by McCain to amend settlement terms dating back to 1988 ( laws opposed by many Senators who introduced opposition bills to halt the relocations of Navajo in 1988 ) in violation of treaty with the Navajo and leading to reauthorization of relocation by bills introduced by Senator Inyoue , then head of the Interior Committee , on behalf of Senator McCain .
( Later intervention by Congressman Renzi ( HERE ) in the House resulted in the 2004 repeal of the horrific Bennett Freeze ( which forbade the Dineh - Navajo from drawing water from there own water wells : Section 10 ( f ) of Public Law 93-531 ( 25 U.S.C. 640d - 9( f ) ) ) .
Despite falsificaiton of the records of Govtrack.gov , sponsored by Sen. McCain , which falsify that he sponsored the repeal , McCain sponsored the Bennett Freeze and had to be overridden by Renzi and the entirety of the Senate to give the Dineh the right to draw water from their capped wells ; McCain also sought to attempt to lock out legislation designed to halt mining and reallocate lands not covered by original acts for Peabody , after Renzi was petitioned by the membership of the ACSA and other vocal opposition groups and introduced the Repeal ) .
DON'T BE FOOLED BY FALSIFICATIONS in the record , Peabody has a lot of financial clout with Bechtel , a predominant contractor to Government Agencies who do record disclosure and they will attempt to hide the record for Senators implicated in this conspiracy .
An unrepentant US Senate has tried to hide this enactment which has its roots in the original resettlement act sponsored by Wayne Owens signed into law by Jimmy Carter , in 1974 , amendments to which have progressively been backed and introduced by " war hero " Senator John McCain .
At no time has the US Government completely owned up to what it knows is a gross violation of the Indigenous Dineh - Navajo 's Human , Religioius and Property Rights .
A little about this geopolitical conflict that was fostered to support Peabody 's mining interests in Arizona : http://www.blackmesais.org/Geopolitics.html explains the ongoing political absurdness in which senators and congressmen were awarded while they as elected officials misdirected American response to the charges of Human Rights violation by abusing the Dineh - Navajo further .
A little about Utah Congressmen Wayne Owens , who went on to create " peaceful coexistence " between Israel and the Arabic neighbors in the 90's .
Interesting the similarities , with the Arabic oil interests trying to evict Israelis from Israel , and with Peabody 's coal interests trying to evict the Navajo from the Navajo nation .
Clearly , one can ( no disrespect to Owens ) clearly see he was bought and paid for by the Rockefeller / Kennedy / McCain and Coal / Oil interests from the very start .
About Wayne Owens work at the Center for Middle East Cooperation and Economic Development .
Wikipedia about Wayne Owens life .
( Reportedly , it became inconvenient for Wayne Owens to continue to work towards the solution , with impending Hezbollah war against Israel " scheduled " by the Rockefeller family , his knowledge became too great a liability , and a French intelligence agent dosed Owens allegedly with PET , a heart attack causing poison . )
HOW COULD ANY GROUP OF AMERICAN POLITICIANS BE THIS CORRUPT , DO THIS TO SO GENTLE A PEOPLE ?
HOW COULD ANY CORPORATION BE THIS DIRTY ?
Many of the Navajo & Hopi have had to endure hardships unspeakable in the modern era , living in untold poverty on charitable support .
Thousands have died as a result of a wide variety of causes .
Aside from deceiving and robbing the Traditional and Native Navajo and Hopi people , Boyden 's contriving a non-elected tribal government ( which , by the way , included his allegedly embezzling nearly $ 3,000,000 in Indian
Trust funds along the course - what better way to offset the costs of such a lengthy exercise ? ) , which led to the legal enactments eventually entitled the " Navajo Resettlement Law " , and bill S1973 were signed into law by President Clinton as part of a deal with the Senate Republican Leader McCain .
Senator McCain and his peers , Jay Rockefeller , Teddy Kennedy , John Kerry , Harry Reid , Howard Dean , they all participated , this was a Senatorial profiteering scheme .
It is of interest to note that , through action or inaction , the present administration also ensured that tens of thousands of these gentle , spiritual , noble people , were forcibly resettled , even going so far as to move for the Attorney General to compel the natives to sign on the dotted line as required with one of the Public Law , and leave and be resettled in " the New Lands " .
This repetitive relocation of the Native Peoples has been one of the Human Rights blemishes tarnishing the history of the United States .
The bill providing a tiny stipend to those who would sell , allegedly relocated many of the Navajo onto an abandoned Uranium dump Superfund Site called " Church 's Hill " ( aka " Church 's Rock " ) , dubbed glibly " the New Lands " in the Resettlement actions .
During the original relocations , larger sums of money as much as $ 260,000 , were offered to hold - outs , as if it were just the amount of money that kept these people desperately trying to hold on to lands they 'd lived in for centuries .
This led to massive over - reaction by those suffering enormous poverty in the area .
Here 's some backgrounder 's on the Church 's Rock disaster , the worst Uranium mining disaster in Human History , on the land that Bill Clinton , Ted Kennedy , John McCain , John Kerry and Jay Rockefeller contrived to deport the Dineh to , after evicting them from their Black Mesa in Arizona .

It is ironic to realize that were it not for the Navajo Uranium Miners of America , America 's power and nuclear weapons infrastructure would not have been possible .
It is an unspeakable statement that the Clinton Administration , John McCain , the Rockefellers and the Kennedy / Kerry senate team sought to reward them by evicting them from their beautiful homeland , the Back Mesa and Big Mountain areas of Arizona , and dump them unsupported onto the very Nuclear Waste Site they had been literally enslaved into mining , with all that mining Uranium implies in terms of health and harm to the very Navajo who were being deported off their own national lands !

AND AS IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH , PEABODY
VIOLATED EVERY EPA LAW IN EXISTENCE !
The incoming coal mining tore up the countryside , destroying nearby remaining homes and has virtually exhausted the water in the area .
The pristine waters of the Black Mesa are being pumped dry to mix into the Slurry ( a mixture of ground coal and water that is pumped through an underground pipeline , which can be burned to power Electric Companies ) .
The Slurry pipeline is used as a fuel for power to power such as the Casinos in Las Vegas and some parts of Southern California , leaving open wounds behind in what had been a beautiful land around Black Mesa , Arizona , near Big Mountain , Arizona .
The expanding forcible relocation continues to this very day and the Coal Mines there keep growing and expanding .
The utter destruction of the environment , and of the Native People , continues .
Native have been hired into jobs in the Mines , but the health effects have been devastating .

AND WHAT DID JOHN MCCAIN PAY EACH OF THESE Di'neh FOR THE FARMS HE WANTED TO RELOCATE THEM FROM ?
$ 2500 PER FAMILY ?
UNBELIEVABLE AUDACITY OF THE MAN TO CALL HIMSELF A SENATOR !!
And ,
If the Natives wo n't move , they are forced to move , if they wo n't take a pittance of a few thousand dollars , to give up , they are battered by the mining operations in their midst if they try to stay .
Many , not knowing what to do , just wander off , homeless .
Some , threatened , sign the papers presented them and then leave in fear for their lives .
Others , forced to live on " Church 's Hill " , find themselves racked with pain and awful biological consequences .
Some , having no work and no place to live , are offered low paying jobs mining the Peabody BLACK MESA mines , facing silicosis Black Lung Disease , and exposure to the Rare Earths like Uranium found in the rock at Black Mesa .
FOR THE Di'neh , THEIR LANDS ARE LIKE OUR " JERUSALEM " , OR ISLAM'S " MECCA " For the Native People the Black Mesa is like Jerusalem is to the Judeo - Christian Religion .
Yet , the mining goes on and the sacred burial grounds are all being desecrated there , and the environment destroyed .
The pristine water is pumped out of the beautiful , potable lakes and aquifer and mixed with coal in a slurry that is then pumped hundreds of miles underground at high pressure , to power the aforementioned Casinos and parts of Los Angeles .
Of the first 14,000 forced off a land they 'd lived in for 500 - 1500 years , over 2000 + are now dead from causes ranging to early mortality in elder years , to strange maladies ranging from cancers from exposure to just plain disheartened repression of the outdoor spirit .
Many thousands will continue to die off as a result of this terrible tragedy , some from the unthinkable consequences of being suddenly urbanized or being for the first time in their long lives , tragically homeless .
Below you will find testimonials from many of the Di'neh ( Navajo ) telling about only a few of the tragic consequences of the Native Holocaust that 's been tacitly sponsored by Senator McCain .
You will find International Condemnation of the enactments backed by Senator John McCain .
Mr. McCain , as you can see , has chosen to run for the Presidency ( Ed. Note : from the 2000 Election ) against VP Al Gore , Governor George W. Bush and former Senator Bill Bradley .
With a man as obviously insensitive to the plight of the Traditional Native Tribes of Black Mesa , as ready to accept the misconceptions prevailed by the non-traditional leaders cultivated by the business leaders so as to seal their fates , as McCain is ... with a Senator McCain as President , we can surely see that some of the people are ALWAYS GOING TO BE SEEN AS MORE EQUAL than others .
We fully expect Mr. John McCain to reply , if asked about the death and destruction of the Navajo in his home state of Arizona :
Dear Senator John McCAIN ,
You should be asking Him , as you read the Bible :
> CLICK HERE < to proceed directly to the HOLOCAUST BACKGROUNDER PAGE .
SIMULTANEOUSLY ASK THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHY IT PLAYED DUMB ??
[ The answer to the question on your mind , Senator McCain : yes , you are , and you bear a symbolic mark of Cain ... for failing to recognize your own wrongdoing against your own brethren , the Di'neh .
For they are your Brothers , whether you are aware of it or not .
You have killed your own brothers for each Di'neh who died at your hand and pen ... for any Native anywhere who , not involved in a combat unit , died at your hand ... think about it !
You sold your soul long ago to SATAN for a few miserable votes and a few additional more hundred gallons of Liquor sold by your wife to Casinos in Nevada .
Hardly worth it , in the final analysis !
Particularly since you 've sold your soul and SATAN is n't about to give it back , Senator .
This terrible stain of blood - let , land destroyed , people 's will brutalized , children irradiated , men , women and children sadistically terrorized , an entire People practically extinguished ... will live as the Senator and Congressman John McCain Legacy until the end of time .
It is a stain of BLOOD , a pox upon you , your family and children and many McCain generations to come , seven to be exact .
YOU HAVE FOOLED NO ONE .
SENATOR .
You withdrew from the US Presidential Election on account of this story in 2000 .
NOW WITHDRAW FROM PUBLIC OFFICIALDOM FOR GOOD !
You just can't resist the urge to break the law , can you " Senator_John_McCain 2004 " ( he withdrew again over this story ) ?
Now in 2008 will you withdraw again rather than face the legal music for criminal behavior ?
The world has a habit of rewarding people like you in kind , maybe - just maybe - the Senate will see fit to censure you for what you 've done !
You certainly are n't capable of standing up , like a Man , and admitting your crimes !
You hide behind silence and a code of criminal conduct unparalleled in the history of Public Corruption in America .
Yet in your heart of hearts , you know full well you 're role and responsibility , your accountability for the deaths and dishonor you caused the Navajo , with the help of the Clinton Administration .
Right now , you belong in Jail for a good , long time , so you can consider what it means to utterly destroy both an entire people and entire communities in modern America by cleverly rigging changes in laws like Title 25 .
You are both unthinkable and unforgivable . ]

ABJECT POVERTY AND PEACEFUL RESISTANCE
Most Di'neh families are living in abject poverty due to 25 years of peaceful resistance .
Explosions at the Peabody mines have destroyed sacred burial and prayer grounds , and collapsed Di'neh homes .
Most Di'neh live only by virtue of charitable donations .
United Nations Special Rapporteurs continue to condemn the forced relocation of the Di'neh by the Bureau of Indian Affairs , the Bureau of Land Management and the seizure of Di'neh livestock by the Bureau of Wildlife ordered by President Clinton as he signed a document based on an older forged agreement that bore no signatures or agreement from the actual Di'neh people referred to in Clinton 's agreement as " signers " !!
The Clintons , Gore , Reno and McCain , bought , sold , signed , sealed , and delivered the crime , a new record for even an American President , his wife , an Attorney General , a Vice President and an all powerful Senator : a conspiracy of carpet bagging , corruption and human rights violations .
MOHAVE , MOHAVE , LET ME LIGHT YOUR FIRES AND GENERATE COAL POLLUTION
The continued use of coal to power the Mohave Generating Station ( operated by giant Bechtel Corporation ) in Laughlin , Nevada bordering on Southern California is a violation of the EPA statutes preventing use of Coal Fired Power Grids in the heavily polluted airways of Southern California .
Militant Intimidation of the Di'neh people and their lands continues as of this date in 2003 / 2004 ...
What we are left with is the desire by the Di'neh to PROTECT THE LAND , not prevent the generating of power .
Here is a people who are willing to DIE on their lands rather than be forcibly relocated onto Nuclear Dumping Grounds and forced to sit back and watch some of the most beautiful lands in America laid to waste by improper and abusive corporate enterprises engaging in a RAPE of our Natural Resources .
It is one thing to dig an oil well .
It is another to blow up every square foot of a 500 x 500 mile Mesa Corridor so beautiful in it 's pristine state , that to destroy it would be a CRIME AGAINST ALL OF HUMANITY .

I STAND UNITED WITH THE NATIVE AMERICANS OF BIG MOUNTAIN
In recent publicity , it has been suggested that the $ 250,000 contributed by Peabody 's parent organization , Lehman Brothers , to the Republican National Committee ( Soft Money ) was insufficient to explain how a Senator would sell his soul and the very lives of these Native Peoples " down the river " .
Considerable investigation is underway to find out if hidden compensations took place which benefited Senator McCain and / or his campaigns .
Recently , indications that the largest contingent of McCain support moneys come from Las Vegas , uncovered by a gifted pair of Investigative Journalists , has led to the discovery that there is an economic link to where the Coal Slurry is shipped out of the Black Mesa mine .
It is our belief that McCain became a pawn in this activity , after becoming a familiar of the St. Louis business community when he was first backed by the ownership of Anheuser - Busch , in his first job after his discharge from the Navy .
That community is up to its ears in the Coal , Alcohol , Mining and Gaming business , as a vendor , supplier and financial partner in Las Vegas .
It is that power base that launched John McCain 's first Congressional and subsequent Senatorial careers .
Ignorance and apathy in the voting base , often leads to the rise of individuals with the strongest industrial backing in any area , in Arizona : its quite clear that Peabody and its business partners , carry a very large amount of clout .
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ACT TO PROTECT THEM .
This tragedy of our modern era is made more difficult by the clever tactics of bribing native leadership into doing the dirty work of the coal mining companies and the government interests .
The actual Di'neh ( Traditional Navajo ) and Hopi people never seem to receive any substantial aid ( something like $ 1400 per family , plus up to $ 20,000 per family house was allocated , and most were never paid ) .
A relocation commission organized by the Government to implement this " relocation " had been organized allegedly at the insistence of Peabody Coal , who had contracted with the non-Traditional Hopi Council and the Trustees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior , to mine other areas of Navajo country for some time prior to the relatively recent 15 year long move on Black Mesa .
They were given entry to the area by John Boyden 's non-traditional Hopi " Tribal Council " , which signed a 35 + year lease authored by Kennecott / Peabody during the early 70's or late 60's .
The big villains in this holocaust : Senator John McCain , and Peabody Group , have gotten away virtually unscathed while reaping huge rewards from the entire affair .
They have acted to protect their appearance , while turning the Traditional Tribal Native Peoples ( both Traditional Navajo and Hopi ) into Environmental Refugees .
The victims : the Traditional Tribal Native Peoples , have been forced out , in many cases left homeless , and their health damaged in some case beyond repair , many have even deceased before their time .
This is not some kind of Election Year assault on Senator McCain , its the outcome of a 30 year effort by a Bureau of Indian Affairs with its priorities in the wrong place , a 15 year effort by a Politician , Senator McCain , who apparently has little sense of responsibility for what his sponsorship of public laws has reaped .
What we have here is a real world assault on the lives of some very fine , and kind , gentle people , by a political machine gone mad with the greed of Casino profiteering , Energy Politics , Electioneering , Carpet Bagging and an apathetic Government that looks dispassionately the other way so long as the right people are making vast sums of money .
It is almost a classic definition of the disparity of our times , where politicians like Senator John McCain speak out of both sides of their mouths , feeding special interests from one side so as to get ahead , while saying anything to get elected , including false claims that he 'll reduce the special interest influence in Washington .
He 's only saying what you and I want to hear .

NATIVE HOLOCAUST BACKGROUND MATERIAL
Being Jewish , one could very easily identify the ceaseless nature of Evil present in any Genocide and every Holocaust .
It does n't even require Hate , for Hate is only a tool : Holocausts are innately economically motivated -- religion and race , and racial hatreds , politics and greed are just some of the methods the Holocaust - ers use to get others to help them with the genocide .
Whether its Treblinka , Auschwitz , a Bosnian Village or Big Mountain , Arizona , it is humankind 's greatest demonstration of its ability to become the embodiment of Evil .
Holocaust strikes out at us without regard for what horror it causes and does n't care who it murders ... for the real Evil is that it is the murder of humanity over something so arcane as MONEY .
The first sign of greatness in a people is its ability to prevent , rather than having the need to fight , war .
The second sign of greatness in a people is its ability to protect all of the people from deprivation of their human rights .
And the third sign of greatness in a people is to admit when it was wrong , and correct those wrongs without further penalizing those it victimized ...

STATEMENT BY Di'neh SOVEREIGN ELDER ROBERTA BLACKGOAT about the consequences leading the Hopi and Navajo to become ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES .
SOME POINTED QUESTIONS FOR MCCAIN ABOUT THE JOHN BOYDEN PLAN by a journalist interested in some " hard hitting " answers from Senator John McCain .
Of particular interest is McCain 's adoption of Public Laws which could only succeed if there already existed a plan in place to create the appearance of " managing tribal disputes " .
This plan , commonly called the Peabody - Boyden plan , had been authored by attorney John Boyden , who had been employed by Peabody Coal .
Boyden , it appears , had set up a tiny " Native tribal government " which he managed to get recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the 50's , 60's and 70's .
It appears that this was all just a setup , for the purposes of establishing the basis of creating an authority which could sign " on behalf " of the Natives in Black Mesa , certain laws that would legitimate various activities involving their eventual removal .
Senator McCain and his peers sponsored relevant bills in the 80's and 90's that gradually secured the mining rights away from the Black Mesa 's rightful owners , the Hopi and Di'neh ( Navajo ) , on the false basis of these land disputes CONTRIVED by businesses and politicians interested in Mining the Area , and other manipulations .
The Boyden / Peabody plan was clever , it falsely disputed territorial ownership , but also raised the all important question of who owned the Coal ( obviously , Peabody must have offered large sums for anyone who could implement this plan , and attorney John Boyden , seeing an enormous profit potential , must have realized that by organizing his own competing tribal government opportunistically , he could stake a claim for Peabody , by a classic trick : creating the appearances of a range - war dispute between his puppet council and the traditional leadership of both tribes , using them against each other ) .
Boyden 's effort simply managed to create an effective excuse for Senator McCain to finish the job by evicting the Native Peoples altogether ( to avoid the messy political consequences of mining their land without their permission , while pretending otherwise ) .
The fake Land dispute also provided an alibi to Peabody who continues to leverage it when confronted on the matter , to this very day .
After picking up the ball shortly after he first took office , it appears that John McCain engaged in a very carefully orchestrated decade - long sponsorship of bills which progressively opened up the Native Lands by eviction of the inhabitants , backed by public laws manipulated to benefit Peabody Coal 's mining operations through something called " an accommodation " , which laws were forged that REQUIRED that the un-consenting traditional Tribes HAD TO SIGN , in order to receive reclamation relief .
A strange law that has other law requiring a people to agree to it , without first obtaining their true consent .
Something about " ex post facto " laws being unconstitutional in the United States , leaps to mind .
The false perception by the Public that the Native Peoples had spontaneously attacked settlers from Europe , reminds us of the first such incident in History .
In the 15th Century in New Jersey , Natives executed a Dutch settler , but only after he'd executed one of their Tribesman for " stealing a sheep " running free on the range during an especially hard winter .
This execution of a Tribesman for allegedly stealing a sheep was a punishment obvious to the Native Peoples not befitting the crime .
They gave the Dutch Farmer a murder trial in the Tribal manner , found him guilty and executed sentence upon him in civilized fashion .
Apparently , however , the Dutch had no such notion of " punishment that befits the crime " , as had the Delaware , resulting in the Dutch Leadership dispatching the troops and eventually massacring several thousand members of the Delaware Tribe .
Everything since then has been downhill for the Native Populations of America .
The laws have always been one - sided , and the Natives considered " savages " , when it has always been US who were savage , and disrespectful of their rights .
Here are some key questions for Senator McCain about the laws and Peabody 's behavior .
FORCIBLE ENFORCEMENT
OF THE RESETTLEMENT
LAW sought by Senator McCain in a letter addressed to the Department of Justice and Department of the Interior , demonstrating McCain 's personal knowledge that the Navajo and Hopi were resistant to being relocated in the first place , and never gave their knowledgeable consent to the evictions .
This letter also demonstrates McCain 's intent to go outside of the normal process and use his office to enforce the eviction precursor to Peabody Western Coal 's extending its efforts to mine the land formerly held by the Hopi / Navajo .
This is only one of many smoking guns .
THE SMOKING GUN : COAL UNDER BIG MOUNTAIN is what the present relocation efforts are all about .
This letter details references which prove that Peabody and its puppet Hopi Tribal Council , and Senator McCain are trying to move another bunch of thousands of Navajo off of Big Mountain ( one of the most beautiful areas in the country ) so as to then convey the right to Mine the Coal there , ostensibly to Peabody Western Coal Mining .
And the Navajo are resisting ( hence this website ) , refusing to go to the Uranium Spill site , they 've been asked to move onto quietly .
Talk about rampant deprivation of the Human Rights of a people , McCain !!
UNDER INVESTIGATION by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights - the first such investigation of the US .
ORION MAGAZINE'S INVESTIGATION the early history of John Boyden , Kenecott ( a former parent of Peabody Coal ) who employed him in the 50s/60s as a Peabody attorney , the $ 2.7 Million he embezzled from the so - called Indian Trust , the Puppet Tribal Council and how he created it to sign laws that have been used to deprive the Natives of their land and their Coal , and how it all led up to the modern day Peabody Coal and the LONG TERM DESTRUCTION of the Black Mesa and eviction of the Native Navajo / Hopi and Di'neh .
Written from a non-political , commercial perspective by journalist Judith Nies ...
With an extra special note about how " His Pomposity " Lord Hanson called his security guards and had them EJECT the small group of Native Peoples , whom he supposedly is leasing the Black Mesa coal from , who showed up to participate in his 1997 " De- Merger Talk " at the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of Peabody Energy in London at Hansons , Ltd. , , and how the British Press ( the Daily Telegraph ) caught a picture of Di'neh representative Roberta Blackgoat kneeling to offer a prayer , a picture later carried widely in the Press , quoting : " The Prayer , she said , was crucial ... "
THE NATURE of " HOLOCAUST " From the Stockholm International Forum .
The ceaseless dimension of evil associated with Holocaust , can strike any of us , anywhere , it is humanity at its worst , and the worst part is its economic motive .
Greed feeds every Holocaust , whether it was the Nazi looting of Jewish Assets in Germany , or the Coal Miners and Politicians Looting the Hopi Assets in Black Mesa , Arizona .
And in every Holocaust , a key Political Leader , by pandering to the economic and political passions of the time , is fueled by the dead bodies and assets of his victims .
Holocausts have degrees and stages .
They often start small .
But they can get huge in almost no time at all .
And they know no prejudice : they are an equal opportunity murderous rampage against ALL OF HUMANITY .
And they can happen anywhere , where they are least suspected , even right here at home , in America .
THE CULTURE OF THE Di'neh BAND , the Traditional Navajo People .
A Gentle , Noble , Religiously Spiritual people at one with the land , are to be deprived of the very heritage they base their worship and one - ness with Creator upon : the Black Mesa and the Big Mountain ... and Star Mountain .
These people are at one with the Universe , and hate no - one .

THE MOHAVE GENERATING STATION , powering greater Las Vegas with dispossessed Native American Coal ...
DISCUSSING THE " NEW LANDS " ( aka : the Nuke Lands ) ,
The land the Navajo who are being forcibly evicted are forced to live on : where the beauty of the mountains , the plains and the trees are only exceeded by the fact that they GLOW IN THE DARK .
DETAILS OF THE MCCAIN STRATEGY , McCain 's seeming hatred of native people must run very deep .
Peabody Coals ' fake Hopi Tribal Council has passed laws which require the Navajo to relocate off the Coal Bearing lands to the so - called " New Lands " on the Uranium Dump Site at Church 's Hill .
Any Navajo who refuses to sign the McCain sponsored " Settlement " Act , and abide by the Hopi Law , are simply EVICTED from their homes in the Black Mesa .
So its : SIGN the McCain " Settlement " agreement , and be evicted from your home , off of the Black Mesa under fake - Hopi Law : to the Uranium Dump , or DON'T SIGN , and be evicted from your home , off of the Black Mesa , period .
Either way , John McCain has created a unique contradiction , the effects of which are the same : IT EVICTS THE NAVAJO NATIVES OFF OF THE BLACK MESA one way or the other .
In this article , you will see that McCain is also unwilling to meet with his victims face to face , in this case a 77 year old Navajo gentleman , Mr. Huck Greyeyes , and his wife , who have lived on their home at Black Mesa for over 50 years .
We have concluded that Senator McCain has acted like a COWARD hiding behind the mere appearance of a feisty politician .

LETTER TO PEABODY authored by the American Computer Science Association ( website ) in response to efforts by Peabody to convince the ACSA from publicizing the issue of John McCain 's and their involvement in these tragedies .
Use of a fraudulent ruse by the executives at Peabody , to falsely claim they were being accused of mining nearby Big Mountain , rather than Black Mesa , to attempt to force a libel allegation , was only one example of the dirty pool played by Peabody .
Peabody , a formerly British Held company , founded in Chicago at the turn of the Century , is now held for long running interests allegedly by Lehman Brothers , through a merchant banking division limited partnership .
Executives at Lehman have refused comment , but have donated over a quarter million dollars to elements of the Republican Party in soft campaign contributions during this period .
The real contributions by Peabody are suspected to be largely influence peddling , cloaked behind the classic shield of smoke filled rooms and golf games .
PEABODY ORDERED TO PAY $ 900,000 FINE .
It is suggested that Peabody was more than a little remiss in its reporting of its own activities .
And , from this letter , the widespread involvement of Peabody as " the " mining operation with the greatest commercial stake in the outcome of the evictions , well capping and livestock confiscation , is documented .

PLANTING FALSE ARTICLES : THE ART OF WAR AGAINST THE NATIVES
Perhaps the saddest commentary have been the deliberate plantings of false articles in the Press by lobbyists for the Mining Industry .
And Peabody Group and their partners in the Senate ... claiming range wars or other such Indian disputes that have not occurred since 1853 , these lies were the basis of this Human Rights Tragedy that has resulted in the very first United Nations Investigation of Human Rights Violations within the United States .
This horrific affair has also been a signature example of shortsightedness on the part of the US Government in allowing an Environmental Calamity of Phenomenal Proportions to occur ...
" We 're only a contractor to the Natives " sneered an executive in Public Relations at Peabody Western , Mr. Vic Svec .
Senator McCain , you 've disappointed us beyond all reconciliation .
Shame on you , you are a disgrace and a hypocrite !
For a man who once sat in a Prisoner of War camp for nearly 5 years , you clearly have forgotten one of the basic principles of this country : All Humans are Created Equal !
If the Arizona Natives are only an example of your personal lack of integrity , we fear for the future , for were you to ever get enough power to be President , this country would become run by an INHUMAN MONSTER .
WANT TO WRITE AN OBJECTING PERSPECTIVE - FEEL FREE , HERE'S HOW :
ANYONE OBJECTING TO THIS STORY UNCONNECTED WITH PEABODY OR SENATOR MCCAIN OR ONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES WHO CAUSED IT TO COME ABOUT , MAY EMAIL US WITH THEIR GRIPES BY CLICKING HERE .
McCain can deal with our Attorney .
However , before going off and writing an email complaining , you had better be prepared to back your complaints up with STRONG FACTS and HARD EVIDENCE .
Or we 'll have to file that complaint where it belongs , somewhere south of the Bit Bucket .
We did our homework , so : opponents to this viewpoint -- do yours or forever hold your peace .
IN THE ACSA'S OPINION : this entire matter has become a DISGRACE to the American People , a DISGRACE to the History of the United States Senate and Government , and a SHAME upon our People , and MUST BE CORRECTED , we have an obligation to our fellow citizens , the Di'neh , and due to our DISGRACEFUL HISTORY OF MISTREATMENT OF THE NATIVE INDIANS , we all share in an even greater obligation to them NOW , than any of us may realize !

OBAMA , Japan 
Just before the results of the big Feb.
5 round of primaries and caucuses reached this snow - covered fishing town hard by the Sea of Japan , a few of its most enterprising residents realized that a man who shared their town ’s name could be America ’s next president .
And so Obama sprang into action , its desire to escape the countryside ’s anonymity interwoven with Senator Barack Obama ’s run for the White House .
A support group was formed .
Primary day events were held .
And “ Go Obama ! ” posters were put up .
On Monday , as expectations ran high here that Mr. Obama would sweep Tuesday ’s primaries in Wisconsin and Hawaii , Obama , population 32,000 , was making plans to buttress its support .

THE STUDY
“ Emotional Well - Being Does Not Predict Survival in Head and Neck Cancer Patients ” by James Coyne et al. , published in the December 1 , 2007 , issue of Cancer .
THE QUESTION
Do emotions influence a cancer patient ’s prognosis ?
In one of the largest , longest , and most controlled studies of its kind , researchers investigated whether the emotional state of cancer patients has any relationship to their survival .
THE METHODS University of Pennsylvania psychologist James Coyne and his colleagues followed 1,093 adults , all of whom had advanced head and neck cancer with nonspreading tumors .
All patients received standardized medical care through clinical trials run by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) .
At the start of the study , the participants completed a 27 - item questionnaire used to evaluate the physical , social , and emotional quality of life in people with cancer and other chronic diseases .
Five items targeted emotional state , asking patients to rate , on a scale of 0 to 4 , the extent to which statements like “ I feel sad ” and “ I am losing hope in my fight against my illness ” had been true for them over the past seven days .
The researchers then calculated a score for each person ’s initial emotional well - being .
Coyne tracked patients for an average of nine years , until they either dropped out of the study or died .
The study reported 646 deaths .
Once the records for the participants were complete , researchers analyzed the data .
“ We were surprised to find absolutely no relationship ” between emotion and survival , Coyne says .
The researchers then looked at emotion and survival in greater detail , examining data for the most buoyant optimists , the most despondent individuals , and patients with complicating factors like smoking .
In none of these analyses did emotional well - being affect survival .
Because the study was so large and long , it gathered far more information than previous investigations of emotion and cancer survival .
In smaller studies , Coyne says , it can be difficult to tell whether deaths were related to a factor like emotion or were simply due to chance .
While the huge pool of subjects and the controlled clinical trial conditions give the study statistical heft , Coyne acknowledges a few limitations .
Having only people with head and neck cancers in the study eliminates the variability of a group suffering from different forms of the disease , but it also eliminates information about whether patients with other forms of cancer would show the same results .
Additionally , patients had to be judged “ mentally reliable ” — able to follow instructions and keep appointments — in order to qualify for the clinical trials , so their emotional scores might not represent the full spectrum of psychological states among cancer patients .
THE MEANING
Coyne says this is the most in - depth study of its kind , and until a study with a similar sample size proves otherwise , he is convinced there is no conclusive relationship between emotional well - being and cancer survival .
Many cancer patients struggling to maintain a positive outlook — and fearing that their lives depended on it — have contacted Coyne to express relief that their survival may not be dependent on their emotions .
“ Having a positive outlook is not going to extend the quantity of life , ” Coyne says .
“ Not everybody is capable of being positive when they have cancer . ”
STATS BEHIND THE STUDY • A 2004 study found that 72 percent of the public and 86 percent of cancer patients believe psychological factors affect cancer survival .
Only 26 percent of oncologists agree .
•
About 25 percent of breast cancer patients who joined support groups told researchers in a 2005 study that they attended to improve their immune systems .
•
Four previous studies indicate that people with better psychological function do survive longer with cancer — but four others suggest that a healthier psychological condition predicts shorter survival time .
More than a dozen studies have found no relationship between the two variables .
• A 2007 study found that the emotional , physical , and social questionnaire Coyne used is effective at predicting depression .
• Major depression afflicts about 25 percent of all cancer patients .
•
The two clinical trials in Coyne ’s study were conducted by the RTOG , which had a $ 13 million budget in 2007 and is funded by the National Cancer Institute .
•
The American Cancer Society cited 1.4 million new cases of cancer in the United States in 2007 and more than 500,000 cancer deaths , with about 11,000 due to head and neck cancer .
SECOND OPINION
While this study attempts to correct factors that muddied previous research , few experts think the question of cancer and emotion is closed .
Stanford psychiatrist David Spiegel notes that coping strategies are an important part of the picture and that they were not addressed by Coyne ’s research .
He points to a study of breast cancer patients that provides evidence that survival has to do more with how people deal with emotions than how they feel .
( Coyne believes the sample size in that study was inadequate and says larger studies oppose Spiegel ’s contention . )
Spiegel says support groups and other therapies might improve outcomes by helping patients manage stress and improve communication with doctors .
Coyne acknowledges the possibility that psychological support could affect survival by mechanisms other than emotional well - being but says no methodologically sound study has yet shown a relationship .

During November last year we reported that the popular DVD ripper aXXo had decided to take a break and stop releasing new material for a while .
It now seems that he is back in business .
A few hours ago aXXo uploaded his first movie in months .
He chose " I Am Legend " .
Since November 11 2007 , when the last official aXXo torrent was uploaded , it has been awfully quiet .
Some people assumed that aXXo had got himself caught while others claimed he had an accident .
After a while it became clear that he simply decided to take some time off .
An administrator on Darkside RG , the official home of aXXo explained at the time : “ aXXo told us that he has decided to take a break , so you will not see new aXXo torrents anywhere for a while .
Please show your support by keeping his torrents alive until he comes back , as always , he will post here first when he does . ”
Now , after nearly four months of absence aXXo has returned , and uploaded his first . torrent on Darkside RG and other torrent sites .
It ’s the news that many BitTorrent users have been waiting for .
Marking his comeback with the movie “ I Am Legend ” could be seen as symbolic .
Before aXXo decided to take a break , an estimated one million people downloaded his DVDrips every month .
The search term aXXo was undoubtedly the most popular at many torrent sites .
Although there are conflicting opinions in respect of the quality of his work , there can be no dispute that he was , and still is , very popular indeed .
While some see him in an almost religious light , others have been quick to take advantage of his popularity for nefarious purposes , or have used the aXXo brand to draw attention to their own releases , like KLAXXON did .
Even though some see him as a legend , aXXo certainly is n’t without his critics but whatever the position , his popularity is indisputable ….. along with his modesty ;)

Just in time for the holiday season , the 110th Congress has renewed its push for credit card companies and lenders to clean up their act .
Michigan Democrat Carl Levin , who sits on the Senate ’s Homeland Security and Gov’t Affairs Committee , is chairing a hearing today on unfair credit card interest rate hikes , featuring three financial industry bigwigs against three undoubtedly angry consumers .
( Fun fact –Bank Of America Card Services prez Bruce Hammonds used to be president of MBNA , widely recognized as one of the most egregiously evil card companies in the business , until Bank of America swallowed them whole . )
Levin and fellow Senator Chris Dodd previously called credit card companies out for hearings in January of this year , which led the financial industry to voluntarily end some of their nastier credit card practices ( such as “ double - cycle billing ” and “ universal default ” ) to avoid being grilled or regulated on Capitol Hill .
Levin , along with Claire McCaskill , has also introduced legislation to rein in the most abusive lending practices of the credit card industry .
Meanwhile , Barack Obama has put the issue of abusive credit card practices front and center in his campaign by calling for a “ credit card bill of rights ” that would offer citizens more protections against dirty lending tricks :
“ Every American has a responsibility to pay what they owe , but we need to make sure that what they ’re paying is fair , and we ’ve got to do more for those Americans who are n’t able to climb out of debt and actually have to declare bankruptcy , ” he said , promising reform of bankruptcy laws if elected president .
When I wrote recently that Democrats should run on the economy instead of Iraq , this is exactly what I was talking about .
This is as clear - cut and obvious an issue you can get that cuts right to the heart of both the American economic crisis and the strength of the Democratic party .
Put more simply , the credit card industry is almost universally loathed , and you ’d be hard - pressed to find a better target for Democrats to rally around than this particular form of economic terrorism .
I ’m glad to see they ’re getting the message , and I hope they ride that train all the way through the elections and use the momentum to pass real reforms –America ’s working families and debt - plagued consumers need all the help they can get .
Swedish researchers present in today ’s Web edition of the journal Science evidence that their theory about the core of the earth is correct .
Among other applications , the findings may be of significance for our understanding of the cooling down of the earth , and of the stability of the earth ’s magnetic field .
It has long been known that the inner core of the earth , a sphere consisting of a solid mass with a radius of about 1,200 km , is mainly made up of iron .
However , seismic observations have shown that elastic waves pass more rapidly through this core in directions that are parallel to the earth ’s axis of rotation than in directions parallel to the equator­ - a phenomenon that has not been previously explained .
At the high temperatures that prevail in the core of the earth , these waves should pass at the same speed regardless of their direction .
In the present study , scientists from Uppsala University and KTH present an explanation for this puzzling characteristic .
The publication is part of a series of articles published by the same research team in Nature and Science .
Initially , in 2003 , they published strong theoretical proof that the earth ’s core assumes the so - called body - centered cubic crystal structure at high temperatures­ - a structure that despite its high degree of symmetry evinces a surprisingly high level of elastic anisotropy , that is , its elastic properties are contingent on direction .
This theory about the crystal structure directly contradicted the then prevailing view , but since then the theory has found both experimental and theoretical support .
In this new study the researchers present simulations of how seismic waves are reproduced in iron under the conditions that prevail in the core of the earth , showing a difference of about 12 percent depending on their direction - ­which suffices as an explanation for the puzzling observations .
First the trajectories of movement were calculated for several million atoms in strong interaction with each other .
On this basis , the scientists were then able to determine that the progress of the sound waves was actually accurately described in the computer - generated model for iron under the conditions prevailing in the core of the earth .
“ We found that the body - centered cubic structure of iron is the only structure that could correspond to the experimental observations , ” says Börje Johansson , professor of condensed - matter theory at Uppsala University .
The earth ’s heat balance , like its magnetic field , is dependent on the amount of heat that is stored in the inner core of the earth .
These conditions , in turn , are dependent on the crystal structure of the iron in the inner core .
Previously these estimates were based on models deriving from the hexagonal structure of iron in the inner core .
The Swedish scientists ’ discovery will now entail a critical revaluation of the cooling off of the earth and of the stability of its magnetic field .
“ This study opens new perspectives for our understanding of the earth ’s past , present , and future , ” says Natalia Skorodumova , a researcher at the Department of Physics and Materials Science .
In their studies these researchers have used models based on the so - called density - functional theory for which Walter Kohn was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize .
The calculations were carried out using the most powerful parallel supercomputers in existence , in Stockholm and Linköping .
The body - centered cubic crystal structure forms a cube with atoms in each corner and a further atom in the middle of this cube .
It is oriented in such a way that its great diagonal is directed along the earth ’s axis of rotation , which makes it possible for the iron to evince sound propagations with the velocities observed .

If you feel your site is being affected by duplicate content , and would like an analysis , please visit our SEO Services Page .
Thanks !
I ’m not sure how many of you are aware , but there is a website in the wine industry that claims to be an blog aggregator for the purpose of “ content analysis ” .
Here is what they say about themselves – Vinolin ’s justification for being thieves .
To make matters funnier / worse , the layout of their site looks like a slight rip - off of cork ’d’s .
I noticed Vinolin was aggregating our content when I discovered this post on their site about a year ago .
In all honesty , it did n’t really bother me all that much , as they were just displaying the excerpt , and I saw there was a back - link to our site .
Now … just take a look at this page : Vinolin ’s Rip - Off of our last post .
This link takes you to google ’s cached version , I did this in the event they pull down the page after this article goes public .
On this page , you see they did n’t limit themselves to an excerpt , they blatantly copied the entire post and displayed it on their site .
The audacity is unbelievable , especially considering they are aware that people have a problem with it ( as people should ) .
So , not only do I discover that they are stealing content from our site and others , but as an even further sign of disrespect , they have not managed their robots .
txt file so as to keep those articles from being spidered by the search engines .
For those of you who are unfamiliar with search engine optimization , most search engines exact a penalty for duplicate content .
It is not uncommon that an original creator of content can lose page rank , and even their indexed version of a page if the spider crawls the the duplicate first .
The fact that they are providing a back - link does n’t help anything as they would lead you to believe , because they are not linking back to the original content , they are just linking back to the main page of ( y ) our site .
In some cases , duplicate content is going to happen , such as occurs with content licensing , and between blogger friends .
The simple solution is to use meta name = ” robots ” content = ” noindex , follow ” and place this in your page ’s header so the search engines know the content is n’t for them .
If you do it this way , google will ignore the content , but still give credit for any links on the page .
Unfortunately , Vinolin did n’t get the memo , and seem to be doing it exactly backwards .
I did a quick whois search ( here ) for Vinolin.com and discovered very little , as the owners seem to be covering their tracks pretty well .
So what do you do ?
First things first , file a DMCA infringement request with Google , with Yahoo ! , and with MSN .
Another option , which is always on the table , is to file suit .
Generally , if the site stealing your work has an owner in the US ( which all information points this is the case here ) , the suit is the most effective means of recuperating your damage , and you can force the violator to shut down their website .
Most people recommend sending a friendly letter before calling in the Attorney ’s , but hell , we did n’t get a friendly letter from them asking if they could use our content ?
Fortunately , one of Grape Thinking ’s fields of expertise is Search Engine Optimization , and web marketing .
Unlike many others who have probably been damaged by Vinolin ’s blackhat tactics , we know how to handle the situation and ensure any damage done is restored .
Granted this will take some time and consequentially money , the fun we get out of exposing Vinolin everywhere using our marketing savvy will more than make up for it .

Continually revved up insulin production , the kind that results from overeating and obesity , slowly dulls the body 's response to insulin .
As a result , blood sugar levels start to creep up , setting the stage for diabetes - associated complications such as blindness , stroke and renal failure .
To make matters even worse , chronically elevated blood sugar concentrations exacerbate insulin resistance .
The vicious circle gets rolling , researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies discovered , when out - of - control blood sugar levels disable the molecular switch that normally shuts off sugar production in the liver in response to rising levels of insulin .
Their findings , published in the March 7 issue of Science suggest that appropriate inhibitors of the enzymatic pathway that blocks the " sugar - off " - switch might be useful in lowering glucose levels in diabetic individuals and reducing long - term complications associated with the disease .
" The islet cells in the pancreas can compensate with increased insulin production only for so long when confronted with chronic obesity and inactivity , " says Marc Montminy , Ph.D. , a professor in the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology , who led the study .
" As a result glucose levels start to rise causing a host of problems . "
Just like a flex - fuel vehicle that can run on either gasoline or ethanol , the human body can switch between different types of fuel :
During the day the body mostly burns glucose , and during the night or prolonged fasting , it burns primarily fat .
But neither flex - fuel engines nor human brains can run on ethanol or fat alone -- a little bit of gasoline or glucose needs to be thrown into the mix to keep either one of them humming .
Three years ago , Montminy discovered a " fasting switch " called CRTC2 ( formerly known as TORC2 ) that flips on glucose production in the liver when blood glucose levels run low during the night .
After a meal , the hormone insulin normally shuts down CRTC2 ensuring that blood sugar levels do n't rise too high .
advertisement
In many patients with type II diabetes , however , CRTC2 no longer responds to rising insulin levels and as a result the liver acts like a sugar factory on overtime , churning out glucose throughout the day , even when blood sugar levels are high .
The Salk researchers were interested in the molecular mechanism that leads to the breakdown of the normally tightly regulated feedback loop .
Mice whose livers light up -- courtesy of the luciferase gene , which produces the glow in fireflies -- as soon as CRTC2 is turned on , led post - doctoral fellow and first author Renaud Dentin , Ph.D. , onto the trail of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway .
Activation of the pathway promotes the addition of sugar molecules to proteins , a process also known as O - glycosylation .
" It had been known that increases in the concentration of circulating glucose activate the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway , " says Dentin .
" But we had no idea that the resulting O - glycosylation would lock CRTC2 in the ' on '- position . "
Normally , the rise in insulin after a meal activates a liver enzyme called SIK2 .
The enzyme chemically tags CRTC2 with a phosphate group , marooning the protein outside the cell 's nucleus .
Unable to reach the genes involved in gluconeogenesis , CRTC2 is powerless to turn them on and glucose production in the liver ceases .
In the presence of excessive glucose levels , however , the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is activated and blocks crucial phosporylation sites on CRTC2 by adding sugar molecules instead .
CRTC2 can no longer be phosphorylated in response to rising insulin levels and is now free to slip into the nucleus and keep the gluconeogenic program going .
Shutting down the O - glycosylation pathway should then get the body 's own glucose production under control , the researchers reasoned .
Just as predicted , glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity markedly improved in insulin resistant diabetic mice and mice fed a high fat diet -- who both suffered from hyperglycemia -- when Dentin and his colleagues decreased the activity of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in the liver of these animals .
" What I really would like to do is to use the glowing mice to screen for drugs that decrease gluconeogenesis , " says Montminy .
" Imagine hyperglycemic mice whose livers light up because CRTC2 is on all the time .
When you feed them a drug that inhibits O - glycosylation the light dims and you know you have compound that 's effective in living animals and you know how it works . "
Researchers who also contributed to the study include research assistant Susan Hedrick , in the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology at the Salk Institute , Jianxin Xie , Ph.D. , at Cell Signaling Technology in Danvers , Massachusetts , and professor John Yates III , Ph.D. , at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California .
This work was supported by NIH grant RO1 GM037828 , by the Clayton Medical Research Foundation , Inc. , and by the Kiekhefer Foundation .
Following rival LG Electronics ( LGE ) 's upcoming launch of a 32 - inch PDP ( plasma display panel ) TV , Samsung SDI is also said to be developing similar products in order to meet demand driven by the persistent shortage of LCD TV panels .
Although Samsung SDI showed minimal interest in 32 - inch PDP TVs in the past , the growing demand for PDP TV amid the LCD TV panel shortages , has prompted Samsung SDI to evaluate related offerings , according to industry sources .
However , the company will not launch any 32 - inch PDP TVs in the near term due to capacity constraints .
PDP TV panel capacity is tight due to buoyant demand from Samsung Electronics , Philips and some China - based customers , the sources explained .
As Samsung SDI has no spare capacity to produce the 32 - inch PDP TV panels , it has no plans to start volume production in the near term , although production is already ready .
With some industry players saying earlier that a possible 10 % PDP TV panel shortage in Taiwan had been seen , some China TV vendors , finding insufficient panel supply , shifted to increase the proportion of their PDP TV offerings , the sources observed .
Demand from China is getting strong as vendors are also under pressure to meet annual sales targets .
Who Is ' Any Person ' in Tribunal Law ?
By Robert Parry
October 19 , 2006 T he New York Times lead editorial gives false comfort to American citizens by assuring them that they will not be victims of George W. Bushs new draconian system for prosecuting enemies of the U.S. government in military tribunals outside constitutional protections .
 This law does not apply to American citizens ,  the Times editorial stated ,  but it does apply to other legal United States residents .
And it chips away at the foundations of the judicial system in ways that all Americans should find threatening .
[ NYT , Oct. 19 , 2006 ]
However , the Times analysis appears to be far too gentle .
While its true that some parts of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 target non-citizens , other sections clearly apply to U.S. citizens as well , putting citizens inside the same tribunal system with resident aliens and foreigners .
 Any person is punishable as a principal under this chapter who commits an offense punishable by this chapter , or aids , abets , counsels , commands , or procures its commission ,  according to the law , passed by the Republican - controlled Congress in September and signed by Bush on Oct. 17 .
 Any person subject to this chapter who , in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States , knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the United States ... shall be punished as a military commission may direct .
If the Times is correct that this law does not apply to American citizens ,  why does it contain language referring to any person and then adding in an adjacent context a reference to people acting in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States ?
Who has an allegiance or duty to the United States if not an American citizen ?
That provision would not presumably apply to Osama bin Laden or al - Qaeda , nor would it apply generally to foreign citizens .
This section of the law appears to be singling out American citizens .
Court - Stripping
Though the new law specifically strips non-U.S. citizens of habeas corpus  the right to a fair trial 
American citizens caught up in Bushs legal system also would be denied the right to challenge their incarceration .
Besides allowing for any person to go into Bushs system , the law prohibits detainees once inside the system from appealing to the traditional American courts until a defendant is fully prosecuted and sentenced , which could translate into an indefinite imprisonment since there are no timetables for Bushs tribunal process to play out .
The law states that once a person is detained , no court , justice , or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever relating to the prosecution , trial , or judgment of a military commission under this chapter , including challenges to the lawfulness of procedures of military commissions .
That court - stripping provision  barring any claim or cause of action whatsoever   would seem to deny American citizens habeas corpus rights just as it does for non-citizens .
If a person cant file a motion with a court , he cant assert any constitutional rights , including habeas corpus .
Other constitutional protections in the Bill of Rights  such as a speedy trial , the right to reasonable bail and the ban on cruel and unusual punishment   would seem to be beyond an American detainees reach as well .
Though the New York Times suggests that the new law chips away at the foundations of the judicial system ,  the law actually seems to obliterate the old judicial system .
Secret Trials
By putting detainees , apparently including American citizens outside the U.S. constitutional process , Bushs system makes a mockery of the Sixth Amendment in particular .
It reads :  In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; [ and ] to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses .
By contrast , in Bushs system , there are no guarantees of either a speedy or a public trial .
Secrecy dominates in a process run by U.S. military officers whose careers depend on the favor of the Commander in Chief .
Under the new law , the military judge may close to the public all or a portion of the proceedings  if he deems that the evidence must be kept secret for national security reasons .
Those concerns can be conveyed to the judge through ex parte  or one - sided  communications from the prosecutor or a government representative .
The judge also can exclude the accused from the trial if there are safety concerns or if the defendant is disruptive .
Plus , the judge can admit evidence obtained through coercion if he determines it possesses sufficient probative value and  the interests of justice would best be served by admission of the statement into evidence .
The law permits , too , the introduction of secret evidence while protecting from disclosure the sources , methods , or activities by which the United States acquired the evidence if the military judge finds that ... the evidence is reliable .
During trial , the prosecutor would have the additional right to assert a national security privilege that could stop  the examination of any witness ,  presumably by the defense if the questioning touched on any sensitive matter .
In effect , what the new law appears to do is to create a parallel star chamber system for the prosecution , imprisonment and elimination of enemies of the state , whether those enemies are foreign or domestic .
Terror Fears
The Times editorial writers might also take into account the circumstances under which Bush is likely to execute his new powers .
Imagine , for example , a terrorist incident or a threat of one somewhere in the United States .
Amid public anger and fear , Bush or some future President could begin rounding up citizens and non-citizens alike .
Once these detainees are locked up at Guantanamo Bay or some other prison facility , they could be held incommunicado and denied access to civilian courts under the laws court - stripping provision .
It could take years before the U.S. Supreme Court even addresses these detentions and  given the increasingly right - wing make - up of the Court  there would be no assurance that the justices wouldnt endorse the Presidents extraordinary powers .
The Times also might want to take note of the curious provision in the law that would jail any person who collects or attempts to collect information by clandestine means or while acting under false pretenses , for the purpose of conveying such information to an enemy of the United States . 
Since the Bush administration and its political allies often have accused the New York Times of collecting and publishing information , from confidential sources , that is helpful to U.S. enemies  for instance , the stories about Bushs secret wiretapping program  this provision arguably could apply to Times reporters and editors .
This spying  provision not only puts alleged offenders into Bushs special legal system but it could result in the offenders being sentenced to death .
So , before assuring American citizens that they re safe from Bushs draconian system , the Times editors might check on why these any person provisions were put into the law .
For more than two centuries , the civilian U.S. legal system has handled similar crimes , including allegations of spying and charges of Americans aiding foreign enemies .
Yet now , under the cloak of setting up military tribunals to try al - Qaeda suspects and other so - called unlawful enemy combatants ,  Bush and the Republican - controlled Congress have effectively created a parallel legal system for any person 
American citizen or otherwise  who crosses some line and becomes an enemy of the state .
The Times editors may believe that to raise these concerns is alarmist .
But over the past six years , Bush and his administration have routinely stretched legal language to aggrandize their power , not the other way around .
There are a multitude of reasons to think that Bush will now interpret every legal ambiguity in the new law in his favor , as granting him the broadest possible powers over people he perceives as his enemies .

Too often these days I see Java developers new to the psuedo - science of UI development finding themselves completely lost before they even get started .
There are a lot of misconceptions about the “ best ” and “ easiest ” way to create a professional UI in Java , and precious few resources which attempt to clear up the confusion .
In this article , I ’m going to make use of the Swing framework simply because it ’s more widely known .
All of the same techniques and processes apply to SWT with equal validity .
I ’ll walk through the steps required to create a simple form UI in the easiest and most maintainable fashion .
I ’m well aware that there are faster ways of doing this , but in my experience , this process will lead to more maintainable and less rigid UIs .
Note :
These steps will obviously be different if you ’re working in a team or with a designer .
The intention of this article is not to present the “ be all , end all ” of UI design practices , but rather to be a set of guidelines for the common - case developer .
Design
It may surprise you , but the very first step in creating a UI is design .
You have to know fairly precisely how you want the UI to look and ( more importantly ) behave .
This step is more than just drawing a few mockups in Illustrator .
This is sitting down and hashing out what you want the controls to do when the window is resized , if the state of any controls should be tied to that of others , whether your labels LEFT aligned or RIGHT , etc .
Often I find the easiest way to start is with a diagram :
This is what my diagram would look like , but it ’s important to note that this is n’t a “ one size fits all ” style .
The point of the diagram is to give you a medium to lay out the semantics of a panel and to help you understand just what it is you have to do .
This step becomes invaluable later on as you start actually writing code .
The important thing about this diagram is that it is annotated .
Anyone can just draw a picture of what they want the UI to look like , what components to use , how they should be spaced .
The real meat of the question is not what does it look like , but how does it behave .
One of the biggest questions Java UI developer have to answer ( as opposed to , say . NET developers ) is how do the controls behave when the form is resized .
This is a much more complicated question than “ where should the component be placed ” or “ how should it look ” .
In essence , the question is asking “ what sort of layout manager configuration do you need ? ”
There are two directions which need to be considered : vertical and horizontal resize .
This may not be news , but it ’s something that a lot of developers ( myself included ) seem to forget .
The way the form scales horizontally is just as important as how it scales vertically , so it is critical that these considerations are dealt with in the design phase .
You ’ll notice on my diagram that I have annotated almost every component with scaling constraints , dictating visually how the component will behave as the form changes size .
For example , all but one of the text fields scale out horizontally , but remain with a fixed height .
The one text field which does not scale horizontally is annotated so that it remains with completely fixed dimensions , both vertical and horizontal .
It ’s also important to note that the City text field scales horizontally , “ pushing ” the State combo box as it does so .
Thus the state selection is always right aligned , the city label is left aligned , and the intervening space is filled with the city text field .
This sort of “ resize mapping ” ( to coin a phrase ) must be considered before any code is written .
You ’ll notice that there is just a single annotation indicating behavior when the form resizes vertically .
This is because , like most form - based UIs , there is n’t really a good way to deal with this situation .
In this case , I just drew a line through the form where I thought I saw the most logical split and indicated annotatively that this “ non-component ” should be what scales vertically .
Thus the buttons remain fixed to the bottom , while the remainder of the components build down from above .
Some forms have text areas ( multi - line text fields ) which may scale vertically , filling this space .
Our form however has no components which logically scale in the vertical direction , thus we invent a non-component which fills the gap in our imagination .
This non-component will only be reflected in the layout constraints , we wo n’t have to add anything extra to the panel itself .
When drawing this diagram , note that I was n’t afraid to make mistakes and then annotatively clarify them .
For example , I made the form to narrow to clearly express the intent of the layout .
The City and State fields take up more room than I expected .
Rather than starting from scratch , I just draw the fields as it seems most intuitive and then indicate with arrows that they should be aligned with the other text fields .
Likewise , the Line 1 and Line 2 fields should actually stretch all the way to the edge of the section .
This was n’t clear in the diagram , so I added the –| annotation to remind myself of this fact .
Always remember that we ’re not trying to make an unambiguous specification , just a reminder to ourselves .
It ’s a design aid , nothing more .
The final bit of annotative goodness which needs to be observed is the “ disables ” marker attached to the Address checkbox and the section below it .
This marker indicates some basic UI state behavior : when the checkbox is selected , the section will be enabled ; otherwise the section below ( and all its components ) will be disabled and no data may be entered .
Note that the annotation does n’t say “ clears ” or “ resets ” , since we just want the section to be disabled and ignored .
Someone may disable the address section only to realize later ( prior to saving ) that they actually do need to enter an address .
They would likely want all of their previous changes to still be there , rather than completely lost .
Notice what we did n’t annotate here .
We did n’t clutter our design with intuitive concepts like “ Save button saves the contents and closes the window ” .
Rather , we left that up to our imagination and ( likely ) prodigious memory .
Remember that this diagram is for our use , not our manager or the other developers in our team .
If we were building a diagram for external consumption , we would have had to make an effort to be more clear .
As it is , we can trust ourselves to build a UI that makes sense according to convention .
First Steps
So we have our design diagram in hand , it ’s finally time to consider some code .
It ’s usually around this time that developers start thinking about what tools to use and how they can be of help .
Let me start out by saying flat - out that I am not in favor of any graphical UI design tool .
Do n’t get me wrong , I think Matisse is a brilliant bit of engineering and a credit to the entire NetBeans team , but it ’s not a silver bullet .
In fact , I do n’t even think it ’s a bullet worth firing .
I could create the code for the diagramed UI in a few minutes using Matisse , but what would the code look like ?
Would it be code worth coding ?

Oh yeah , I ’m looking forward to working with that code .
What ’s actually worse is you ca n’t work with that code .
NetBeans prevents you from editing the auto - generated sections of the code .
Meaning if Matisse got it wrong ( and it did a couple times during the construction of the screenshot ) , there ’s no way for you to fix it by hand .
And even assuming you drop back to your favorite external editor to make your fix , the next time you open the file in NetBeans , your changes will be overwritten .
Matisse is a totally dominating , uncompromising beast that takes over your UI and does n’t let go .
Honestly , this is n’t a stab at NetBeans in any way .
Matisse does a fine job auto - generating its code and it ’s amazingly good at inferring layout constraints based on convention and control placement .
It ’s no substitute for fine - grained manual control however .
People may argue that “ UI design is a visual task ” , but that ’s what the design diagram is for .
I ’ve worked with some fairly complex Swing UIs in my time , and let me tell you that if you do n’t know how to write the code by hand , you ’ll never be able to maintain it .
And if you ca n’t maintain your UI code , that ’s going to cause tons of problems down the road .
So no quick and easy tools for our UI - making .
If we ’re going to write the code by hand ( and we are ) , then we ’re going to need to decide which layout manager ( s ) to make use of .
This is where the diagram can be extremely helpful .
Just looking at our design suggests a grid based approach , a subpanel ( for the address ) and a footer panel for the buttons ( probably using something like FlowLayout ) .
Working from the high - level down to the fine - grained details :
From top down : we have a body , some empty space which stretches on resize and a footer section .
This suggests the use of BorderLayout with the “ body ” as the CENTER constraint and our button panel as SOUTH Button panel appears to keep the components centered , so FlowLayout would be the most appropriate Body panel seems to be a grid of two columns , one for the labels and one for the text fields .
The Address component spans both grids with a left offset of 15 - 20 pixels .
Below this is the address panel which spans both columns and stretches to fill .
The address panel is not set to stretch vertically , but is rather attached to the top of its cell , allowing empty space to stretch below it Address panel appears to be a grid divided into four columns .
The first two rows have text fields which span three columns .
The bottom row contains a text field which also spans three columns , but does not stretch to fill
And no , I ’m not concerned with resolution independence here .
After all , if Apple does n’t care , why should I ?
This process mainly depends upon familiarity with layout managers and some experience with form layout .
I happen to know that some of the most powerful layout managers are grid based , so I try to fit most UI designs into a grid .
I also know that Swing comes with a very nice ( if limited ) default layout manager called BorderLayout .
Many high - level layout constructions fall into a category of problems which are trivial to manage with BorderLayout ( like our button footer ) .
There really are a number of patterns which can be kept in mind during this layout process , but in the end it all comes down to experience .
Once you ’ve built a form - based UI , the steps involved in creating another become somewhat instinctive .
We ’ve already specified two of the three layout managers we will need for this UI .
All that remains is to select a grid - style manager which can accommodate both fixed and fluid constraints .
We could use GridBagLayout , but for reasons which should be obvious , I like to avoid that one .
Unfortunately , Swing does n’t really have another grid layout which is powerful enough to accomplish our goals .
So we look outside of the core Swing API .
There are a number of third - party layout managers available , but the one I really favor is a layout manager I ported from SWT a number of years ago .
SWT ’s GridLayout is basically most of the power of GridBagLayout , wrapped in a clean and intuitive API .
It ’s more than sufficient for our purposes , and it wo n’t needlessly gum up our code with dozens of verbose constraint definitions .
Fleshing it Out
With all three layout managers chosen and most of the constraints solidified , it ’s time to get our hands dirty and actually write some code .
For simplicity of example , we ’re just going to put everything into a single class with a main method .
This main method will simply set the look and feel ( avoiding metal ) and launch the frame :
public static void main ( String ... args ) { EventQueue .
invokeLater ( new Runnable ( ) { public void run ( ) { try { UIManager .
setLookAndFeel ( UIManager .
getSystemLookAndFeelClassName ( ) ) ; } catch ( ClassNotFoundException e ) { } catch ( InstantiationException e ) { } catch ( IllegalAccessException e ) { } catch ( UnsupportedLookAndFeelException e ) { } new ContactDetails ( ) . setVisible ( true ) ; } } ) ; }
As per convention , all of our components will be created and initialized in the class constructor .
Some people are proponents of the init( ) or initComponents ( ) convention , but I personally do n’t see that it serves any purpose .
If you ’re just calling the method from the constructor anyway , why bother ?
You ’ll notice that we ’ve wrapped the entire launch sequence in an invokeLater ( ) .
This is extremely important .
Swing ( or rather , AWT ) manages the entire event dispatch queue for you in separate threads .
It ’s not like SWT where the event dispatch is manually , er…dispatched .
This means that the main thread is not in fact the EDT ( event dispatch thread ) .
If we just made a call to our constructor within the main thread itself , we would be creating components and interacting with Swing in a thread other than the EDT .
Swing is pretty good at making sure that the event dispatch still works , but odd bugs can creep in around the edges .
Ever wonder why the setVisible ( true ) invocation sometimes blocks and does n’t at other times ?
This is usually due to the differences between an in -EDT invocation and a main thread call .
Romain
Guy turned me on to this misunderstood bit of Swing usage , and I ’ve been using it ever since .
Believe me when I say that you ’ll save yourself a world of hurt by making sure you ’re square with the EDT .
Now that we ’re sure our invocations are properly wrapped , we can get started writing the UI layout code , adding the components to the frame .
Honestly , this code is more than slightly verbose and repetitious , so I ’m not going to reproduce all of it .
This is just the interesting stuff :
setDefaultCloseOperation ( EXIT_ON_CLOSE ) ; setSize ( 400 , 265 ) ; JPanel body = new JPanel ( new SWTGridLayout ( 2 , false ) ) ; getContentPane ( ) . add ( body ) ; body .
add ( new JLabel ( " First Name : " ) ) ; JTextField firstName = new JTextField ( ) ; SWTGridData data = new SWTGridData ( ) ; data .
grabExcessHorizontalSpace = true ; data .
horizontalAlignment = SWTGridData .
FILL ; body .
add ( firstName , data ) ; body .
add ( new JLabel ( " Last Name : " ) ) ; JTextField lastName = new JTextField ( ) ; data = new SWTGridData ( ) ; data .
grabExcessHorizontalSpace = true ; data .
horizontalAlignment = SWTGridData .
FILL ; body .
add ( lastName , data ) ; JCheckBox address = new JCheckBox ( " Address " ) ; data = new SWTGridData ( ) ; data . horizontalSpan = 2 ; data . horizontalIndent = 15 ; body .
add ( address , data ) ; JPanel addressPanel = new JPanel ( new SWTGridLayout ( 4 , false ) ) ; addressPanel . setBorder ( BorderFactory .
createEtchedBorder ( ) ) ; data = new SWTGridData ( ) ; data .
grabExcessVerticalSpace = true ; data .
horizontalAlignment = SWTGridData .
FILL ; data .
verticalAlignment = SWTGridData .
BEGINNING ; data. horizontalSpan = 2 ; body .
add ( addressPanel , data ) ;
Well , this is n’t quite like our diagram , but it ’s close enough .
Remember that the diagram is only a guide .
It ’s purpose is to focus your thought and allow you to create the layout constraints .
It ’s never intended to be a hard - and - fast spec .
You ’ll notice how much more readable the manually written code is than its Matisse - generated counterpart .
It may be repetitive and annoying , but it ’s very readable , very maintainable .
We could actually add a little bit of abstraction here ( e.g. createGridData ( ) ) to make things even more readable , but that ’s overkill for this example .
Actually , not only is this code readable and maintainable by myself , but I can also check it into a shared repository and other people ( potentially using different editors ) can make changes to the layout and UI logic and expect them to actually work .
I ’ve had nothing but bad experiences when using UI builders in a team setting , especially builders like Matisse which rely on external meta files .
One thing that is worth calling attention to is that magic number pair in the setSize ( ) invocation .
Of course , I could have used pack ( ) , but that rarely sizes a frame as something which looks pleasing to the eye .
I ’ve found that the easiest way to get a frame which is sized nicely for most platforms is to put in some easy default width and height ( say , 400×400 ) , then once the layout is fixed , size the form by hand .
Literally run the form and resize the window until everything looks good .
Once that ’s done , screenshot it and measure the width and height in Paint .
It may sound crude , but it works surprisingly well .
Of course , the size will have to change a bit , depending on which platform the app is running on , but this is easy enough to handle .
Usually I repeat the process on each platform , taking the largest width - height pair as making that the fixed standard for all platforms .
Conclusion
And there you have it , a simple Java form UI created with minimal fuss and maximum compatibility .
More importantly , the techniques presented in this article can be applied to more UIs in future , and not just forms .
All of us at some point have to build a basic Swing UI , and it ’s best if we ’re comfortable doing so and able to create something that ’s worth keeping around .
Hopefully the concepts I have presented will be useful to you the next time you find yourself faced with a similar situation .
About 10 years ago I worked in a large chain bookstore ( where I once actually selected this book as my “ employee pick ” ) .
I think I was a pretty good bookseller , but there was this one conversation I had with a customer that in retrospect I find amusing .
I was standing in the Science and Computers section when he approached , looking for books on a particular topic .
“ Excuse me , ” he said .
“ Where can I find books about pediaphiles ? ”
Hmm , I thought .
He ’s looking for books about people who are sexually attracted to children .
Well that could be in psychology , or true crime maybe .
“ What kind of book are you looking for ? ” I asked .
“ Just a general book . ”
“ Well , are you interested in the psychology of pediaphiles ?
Or case studies ? ”
With obvious confusion on his face , he said , “ I guess I ’m trying to find out how they ’re made . ”
“ Well , I think that would be psychology .
Let me look in the computer and see what we have , ” I replied , catching on that we were somehow miscommunicating something , but unsure what that might be .
“ I do n’t think it would be psychology , ” he said , “ I think it would be here in the computer section . ”
“ Books on pediaphiles ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ Um … ”
“ Do you even know what a pediaphile is ? ” he asked , obviously thinking I ’m an idiot .
“ Well , I thought so . ”
“ It stands for Portable Document Format .
It ’s what you use when you want to e-mail a document and retain the formatting . ”
“ Oh ! PDF file !
I thought you were asking for … nevermind .
Yes , we have books on PDF files . ”
And I have n’t been able to look at a PDF attachment the same way since .
Note : I know , the word is “ pedophile . ”
But the prefix “ pedia - ” as in “ pediatrician ” threw me off .
I ’ve also recently learned that people who edit a lot of wikipedia articles are sometimes called pediaphiles .
None of these people should be confused with podophiles , who have foot fetishes .

Wal - mart sucks ( via Obsidian Wings ) :
A collision with a semi- trailer truck seven years ago left 52 - year - old Deborah Shank permanently brain - damaged and in a wheelchair .
Her husband , Jim , and three sons found a small source of solace : a $ 700,000 accident settlement from the trucking company involved .
After legal fees and other expenses , the remaining $ 417,000 was put in a special trust .
It was to be used for Mrs. Shank ’s care .
Instead , all of it is now slated to go to Mrs.
Shank ’s former employer , Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
Two years ago , the retail giant ’s health plan sued the Shanks for the $ 470,000 it had spent on her medical care .
A federal judge ruled last year in Wal - Mart ’s favor , backed by an appeals - court decision in August .
Now , her family has to rely on Medicaid and Mrs.
Shank ’s social - security payments to keep up her round - the - clock care .
The tragedy gets worse when you read how Mrs .
Shanks lost her son in Iraq days after losing the case to Wal - Mart , leaving her penniless , brain - damaged , unemployed , and with a dead son .
The fact that she can not remember her son is dead and re-lives the agony of losing a son every time she is told is just the cherry on top .
Did I mention her husband is divorcing her so she can get more public assistance ?
Olberman is right , and I am gonna harp about this issue every singled damned day and hope other blogs do as well .
I am actually on some e-mail list , probably a remnant from the Red State days , where some Wal - Mart flack sends me spam telling me all the good Wal - Mart does .
They probably would n’t need to spend so much time and money on PR if they would stop being such total assholes in cases like this .
But then again , money is involved .
And if there is a choice between making a buck and doing the right thing , we know where Wal - Mart is gonna end up on that side of the equation .
Despicable .
Some of the most common advice for new entrepreneurs is to “ find a mentor . ”
It ’s understandable — after all , it ’s good advice ; having a mentor relationship is often a dream come true .
A mentor is a teacher , a trusted advisor that a budding entrepreneur can turn to with questions and get valuable advice , tailored directly to their industry and specific business situation .
But , how do you actually go about finding a mentor ?
While sometimes the relationship forms organically , it ’s too much to hope that the perfect mentor will simply drop into your lap .
I reached out to several entrepreneurs , both those who have had experience as a mentor and as a mentee , to get their advice on how to find a mentor and establish this relationship .
Listen to Peter and Jonathan talk with Caroline Cummings about finding a mentor on the third episode of The Bcast , Bplan ’s official podcast ( at 12:44 ) :
Click here to subscribe to The Bcast on iTunes »
We ’ll go over where to find a mentor , including both general suggestions and specific online resources .
Additionally , I ’ve compiled a list of tips from these entrepreneurs about building the mentor relationship , how to approach your mentor , and how to get the most out of the relationship .
Where to start your search :
Look to your own network first
To answer the question of “ How do I find a mentor ? ” with the simple reply of , “ By networking ! ” is a bit maddening .
We all know networking builds connections , but for new entrepreneurs , it can be hard to start .
So , when you start thinking about how to find a mentor via networking , think about building connections , rather than finding “ the one . ”
Focus on expanding your network , and making connections with others in a variety of industries whom you can learn from .
“ Consider your own network of connections , ” says Susan Bender Phelps , owner of Odyssey Mentoring & Leadership .
“ Look at the top 20 to 30 people you currently do business with , who are not your customers .
You are looking to see if one of them would be a match or if they can introduce you to someone who would be a match . ”
However , turning a networking relationship into a mentor relationship can be intimidating .
How do you make this transition ?
To put it simply , by thinking less in terms of finding a mentor , but rather building relationships .
“ I am always on the lookout for the next great connection , ” says Jarvis C. Stewart , chairman and chief strategist of IR + Media , LLC .
“ By constantly expanding my network I have surrounded myself with a diverse and resourceful group of mentors .
Among them former colleagues , employers , and even clients who have at one point or another offered particularly salient insights . ”
This sounds great , but how do you take such a diverse network group and narrow it down to one mentor ?
Jarvis advises thinking broadly when it comes to picking a mentor — do n’t feel the need to limit yourself to your field alone .
“ My search criteria is simple :
If you are here to teach me , I ’m here to learn , ” he says .
Use meetup groups to grow your network
Reaching out to those within your existing network is a great start , but when you are on the hunt for a mentor , you may need to expand your network .
“ Mentors usually gravitate toward outspoken , hardworking individuals .
But , sometimes that ’s not enough , ” says CJ Johnson , head of creative and marketing for Buddytruk .
Sites like Meetup.com offer a vehicle for anyone to start any kind of group in your city , and with that comes a variety of networking groups , small business groups , and so on .
“ I recommend going to happy hour events , networking events , and speaking panels that are within your scope , ” says CJ .
Go to any upcoming events in your field
Is there a local conference on an aspect of your technology ?
Maybe a prominent local business owner in your field is giving a speech ?
Attend events like these and use them to make contacts .
“ I also recommend that someone do some independent research into a field they ’re interested in and visit some company websites that are within that field , ” says CJ .
“ See what upcoming events they have coming up and try to attend .
When you attend these events it ’s okay to ask people for their business cards and hand out your own as well . ”
Approaching a potential mentor this way takes out the “ cold call ” feeling that an email or a phone call might have on its own .
Now , you ’ve met and potentially had a brief chat with the person you ’d be interested in having as a mentor , and you can start to build that relationship .
Use your alumni network , internship connections , or professors
If you ’re wondering how to find a mentor while still in school , you likely have access to plenty of potential mentors already ; your professors and any organizations you have completed internships with will make great starting points .
Check out your university ’s business college website ; they are likely to have an entrepreneurship center or mentorship program ( living in Oregon I ’ve naturally focused on two of my local universities , but you ’ll likely find similar programs for your university ) .
If you ’ve completed college , your alumni network may be worth looking into .
“ My most recent business mentor I found by reaching out to my alumni network , ” says Tiffany C. Wright , serial entrepreneur and founder of investment firm The Resourceful CEO .
“ I met with [ a potential mentor ] and he connected me to a number of others .
He then invited me to breakfast two weeks later .
After that , we agreed to meet for breakfast at 7 am every 2nd or 3rd week . ”
Even if you have no connection to your local university , reaching out to professors in your field may be valuable , either in your city or remotely .
“ Some years ago , I wanted to develop classes and get them into academic programs .
I did n’t know a lot about doing that , ” says J. Todd Rhoad , managing director for Bt Consulting .
“ Luckily , I had been reading a lot of entrepreneurial articles by a college professor .
I contacted him and began a relationship with him .
His expertise has been extremely helpful and now we do many activities together , such as writing books , articles , and creating classes .
I simply sent him an email and set up a phone call to discuss my ideas . ”
Join a professional association
“ If you belong to a professional association , that is the first place you should look to find a mentor , ” says Susan Bender Phelps .
“ Look for someone who is not a competitor in your market , and who has achieved the level of success you are aiming for . ”
Tiffany agrees : “ I found my first mentor through a business group I belonged to .
She was very interesting to talk to so I asked her out to dinner ( my treat of course ) .
At the end of the dinner I asked her to be my mentor and she accepted . ”
Professional associations are generally nonprofit groups dedicated to furthering a particular industry or profession , and as such can be a great place to find others in your industry who can potentially serve as mentors .

Take a long shot with your dream mentor
Is there someone in your field that you look up to immensely , who you ’d just love to have as your mentor — but you ’re worried that they would n’t be interested ?
That ’s exactly the person you should be targeting .
Jillian Darlington , creator of the MomCo App , knew who she wanted as a mentor , but was afraid she was taking a long shot .
“ A few months ago , I reached out to one of my idols in the mom space to be a mentor .
She founded one of the most popular websites for moms and I wanted to learn from the best , ” Jillian says .
“ I was n’t sure if she would respond , but she did , and actually ended up coming over to my house to meet with me .
We are great friends now .
I wanted to be able to learn from someone that had already accomplished something similar to what I was trying to achieve . ”
Asking someone that you truly admire to serve as your mentor may feel intimidating , but Jillian suggests going for it .
“ I highly recommend that people put themselves out there and find a mentor .
Never be afraid to reach out to your hero , because they might turn into an incredible friend as well , ” says Jillian .
“ My experience has been a total dream come true . ”
Join an incubator or accelerator
Startup incubators and accelerators can help a new business grow , and with that comes valuable mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs .
“ I applied , pitched , and was accepted into BetaBlox — a Kansas City - based startup incubator — in June of 2014 , ” says Shane Park , CEO of Coinplay .
“ After six months of formal mentoring and lessons in running a startup , my mentors and I check in with each other periodically .
If I have a question , I email them and we set up a meeting depending on the complexity of the issue . ”
If you are interested in exploring an incubator or accelerator for your business , start by seeing what ’s in your city and determining which one will fit your business best .
“ I would recommend entrepreneurs Google startup incubators and accelerators in their own town , ” says Shane .
It ’s important to note that not all small businesses will be a good fit for an incubator or accelerator ; they are generally geared toward tech businesses .
“ Not everyone will get into one — nor do they exist everywhere , ” says Shane .
“ But , if you ’re fortunate enough to find one and make it in , the resources and help provided can really make a difference . ”
Take advantage of online resources
In addition to sites like Meetup , there are plenty of online resources to help you find a mentor .
Here are some free resources that are highly recommended :
LinkedIn :
You can join relevant industry groups on LinkedIn , and either directly inquire with someone you feel would be a good fit , or post to the group at large .
The Women ’s Mentorship Network is a great example of a general group that is geared toward matching mentors and mentees .
Micromentor :
This site connects mentors with mentees , for free .
You can create a profile , complete a mentor request , and contact mentors .
SCORE mentors : Either via email or in person , SCORE connects entrepreneurs with volunteer business mentors .
Your local Small Business Development Center : Through the U.S. Small Business Administration , SBDCs provide businesses with financial , business planning , and other advice .
While it may be more specific advice and less of a close - knit , mentor / mentee relationship , it may be a good starting point .
You can find your local SBDC here .
Women ’s Business Centers , Veteran ’s Business Outreach Centers , and Minority Business Development Agency through the SBA :
If you feel that you qualify for one of the above , check to see if you have a local branch .
13 key tips from entrepreneurs
1 . Ask yourself — do you need a coach or a mentor ?
“ The basic premise of the mentoring relationship is that you seek advice from someone who has already surpassed your entrepreneurial goals , ” says personal development coach Zan Hogan of Happy Alley .
“ There is an assumption there that the mentor will have teaching or coaching skills , based on their professional experience . ”
A mentor should serve as someone who can teach you , advise you , and pass on their experience .
Is this really what you are looking for ?
Zan suggests that before seeking out a mentor , you make sure that a mentor is actually what you are after .
“ Depending on your professional needs , it may be more beneficial to simply seek out someone with a specialized skill set like a business or transitional coach , for example , ” she says .
2 . Get to know them first
Do n’t just jump headfirst into the mentor relationship ; if you ’re hoping to ask someone to be your mentor , get to know them first .
“ Do n’t ask people to be your mentor — just start getting to know them , ” says Ryan Naylor , founder and president of LocalWork .
“ Ask them to grab coffee or happy hour , ask them about themselves and their business , develop a relationship first . ”
Artist and entrepreneur Ann Rea agrees .
“ Looking for a mentor is a lot like looking for a friend who just happens to be more experienced in one area , ” she says .
Ann , who incidentally was mentored by Caroline Cummings , our VP of product development here at Palo Alto Software , also advises thinking about the mentor relationship as that of “ a friend who just happens to possess the professional expertise that you desire . ”
3 . Never start with the word “ mentor ”
So , if you ’re focusing on establishing a relationship , does that mean you should avoid explicitly asking someone to be your mentor ?
Initially , it might be a good idea .
“ Do n’t use the word mentor ! ” says Ryan .
“ Build this relationship slowly — many people get turned off by the idea of ‘ mentoring ’ because it seems like a big time commitment or something they should be charging for as a consultant . ”
Does that mean you should never ask someone to be your mentor outright ?
Not necessarily ; it will depend on the situation .
However , consider first focusing on building the relationship , and once it has been established , shift the conversation and making it clear that you would like them to mentor you .
4. Determine if you and your mentor have a good fit
“ What is critically important is the fit , ” says Tiffany .
“ You can determine the fit before making a formal request to someone to be your mentor .
If there is no fit , at least you garnered more business insights and feedback that you would not have had you not reached out . ”
How do you determine if you and your desired mentor are a good fit ?
By knowing what you are looking for , and having a clear vision , says Jarvis .
“ A mentor ’s advice is n’t one size fits all , and you need to find someone who can relate to your entrepreneurial vision .
Just because someone is successful does n’t mean they ’re the right mentor for you .
Success in one area does not equate to expertise in another . ”
5 . Pick someone who does not have strong “ ties ” to your business
Maybe you ’ve considered asking one of your investors to be your mentor ; after all , you have a connection , they have expertise in your field , and they have an interest in your business .
However , this might not be the best idea .
“ You need to find someone not emotionally or financially tied to your business , ” says Walter Wise , sales and marketing strategist and executive coach at BPI Strategy Group .
Why ?
“ Because you need to be told what you need to hear not what someone thinks you want to hear , ” says Walter .
“ Family , friends , partners , and some investors will tend to sugar coat their advice , whereas a real coach or mentor should tell it like it is .
You need real advice , not fluff . ”
6 . Express genuine interest
Make sure you are truly interested in what your mentor has to say , and you ’ll be well on your way to building a strong relationship .
“ When you express a genuine interest in what someone else is doing , they ’ll usually tell you how they did it — and be elated to offer the knowledge , ” says David Ward , president of Meticulosity LLC .
“ Maybe it ’s a an ego thing , but I think it is because most entrepreneurs are a special breed who are excited to share with other entrepreneurs . ”
This is another test of whether or not you and your mentor will be a good fit — if you find yourself disinterested , it might be a sign that the fit is n’t there .
7 . Make yourself worth mentoring
Just because you want a mentor , does n’t mean that you ’re necessarily good mentee material .
How can you make yourself worth mentoring ?
Jarvis suggests making sure you look the part , and actually following up .
“ Do n’t hit and run , ” he says .
“ If you ask for their card , follow up . ”
Making yourself worth mentoring includes doing your homework and being prepared .
“ You have to do the work , ” says Ann .
“ I know a serial entrepreneur who has mentored many to millions .
If a mentee says that they are going to do something and they do n’t , he drops them .
No second chances .
He says ‘ I love helping people who are willing to help themselves , but I ’m not wasting my time with people who do n’t want to work . ’ ”
8 . Do n’t overlook someone who is n’t in your specific industry
“ You will not find a mail - order mentor , so do n’t limit yourself to one industry , ” says Jarvis .
Keep yourself open to mentors from industries outside your own ; though they may not be able to get into the specifics of , say , industry analysis with you , they can still be a valuable teacher and advisor .
9 . Never pay for a mentor
“ Be sure that the people who you are asking to mentor you do not normally charge for their expertise , ” says Ann .
Paul Dillon of Dillon Consulting Services LLC , adds : “ You should never , never pay for a mentor .
You need to find someone who will do this because they want to do it , not because they are compensated to give you counsel and advice . ”
10 . Confirm that the relationship is a mentor / mentee relationship
But wait — tip # 3 said not to use the term “ mentor , ” right ?
Well , yes , at first ; it ’s not a great idea to rush up to your hero at a conference and beg them to mentor you before you ’ve introduced yourself .
However , once you have established a connection and determined that the relationship is a good fit , it ’s time to officially ask if they will be your mentor .
“ Having an agreed upon , mutually understood mentorship relationship is key to its serving both parties and being productive , ” says Brynn Winegard of Winegard & Company .
Not only that , but failing to inform your mentor that you view them as such can potentially damage the relationship .
“ Treating someone as a mentor that does n’t know this is how you view them can also be harmful — they ca n’t be sure what you want from them and you ca n’t be sure what feedback you are getting , ” adds Brynn .
11 . Have something to offer back
“ Remember , mentors have other things to do , ” says Ann .
“ They are doing you a big fat favor , so never take them for granted . ”
Make sure that your mentor knows how grateful you are for their time , and see if you can offer them something in return — even if it ’s as simple as being an ear to bounce ideas off of .
“ The mentoring relationship must have value for both parties to be successful , ” says Todd .
“ Anything less will end up in a waste of your time . ”
12 . Take your mentor ’s advice with a grain of salt
While your mentor serves as a teacher , guide , and advisor , not everything they say is set in stone .
“ Your mentor is not you , ” says Brynn .
“ They do n’t have your exact experiences , perspectives , ideas , needs , wants , goals , nor do you have theirs . ”
Ann adds : “ You do n’t have to do everything that a mentor suggests .
You are the boss of you .
But if they offer you advice and you agree to take action , take action . ”
13 .
Be clear about your expectations and the end goal
Ann recommends clearly establishing what the mentor / mentee relationship will look like .
“ Once someone agrees to mentor you , then set up very clear boundaries and expectations about what mentoring will look like , ” she says .
She advises that both the mentor and mentee agree on the following points :
What specific goal are they helping you work toward ?
Will you meet once a week , once a month , for how long ?
Will you email them a regular update ?
In addition to establishing clearly what both of your expectations are surrounding the relationship , be clear about your goals .
A broad statement such as , “ I want business help ” is n’t enough ; make sure to clearly define what you hope to gain from the mentor relationship .
The takeaway ?
There ’s more than one path .
You know the phrase , “ There ’s more than one way to skin a cat ? ”
While a little on the gruesome side , the point of the idiom rings true here :
There is more than one way to establish a mentor relationship .
While sometimes the perfect situation may present itself organically , you may have to “ try on ” several mentors before you find the winning relationship .
However , if you let the relationship build by developing a connection first and — once a good fit has been determined — establish a mentor relationship with clear expectations and goals , you ’re well on your way to reaping the benefits of having a business mentor .
How did you find a mentor for your business ?

Nov. 13 , 2007 --
With nearly 3 million new chlamydia infections a year and drug - resistant gonorrhea on the rise , a new CDC report offers a grim view of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) in America .
The report shows that STDs are on the rise across the U.S. Southern states are particularly affected , although sharp increases in Western states also raise eyebrows .
Overall , 19 million Americans catch an STD every year .
Half of these infections are in people aged 15 to 24 .
At particular risk are teenage girls and young women , African - Americans , and men who have sex with men .
" STDs represent a substantial threat to Americans , " John M. Douglas Jr. , MD , director of the CDC's Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention , said at a news conference held to announce the findings .
The CDC report focused on three very troubling STDs : chlamydia , gonorrhea , and syphilis .
All of these infections can be cured -- if they 're detected .
But most people carrying and spreading these infections do n't even know they have them .
In the case of HIV , that could be fatal .
But all of these diseases can cause permanent damage if left untreated .
For example , untreated chlamydia -- the most common reportable infection in the U.S. -- can rob a woman of her fertility .
" Very few young , sexually active women are actually aware that annual chlamydia screening is recommended , and that the disease is linked to compromises in fertility , " Stuart Berman , MD , chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the CDC 's STD branch , said at the news conference .
Orthodox monks have been trying to reach the cave
The group calls itself the " True Russian Orthodox Church " .
Members are waiting for the end of the world , which they are expecting to happen next May .
They say they have enough food and water to last out the winter , as well as large quantities of petrol .
The cult leader did not join them , and has been arrested by police .
Russian television showed pictures of black - robed Orthodox monks scaling down into a snow - covered gully in a forest in the Penza region , about 650 km ( 400 miles ) south - east of Moscow .
Cult leader Pyotr Kuznetsov is undergoing psychiatric examination
Those inside are believed to include four small children .
Cult members say they have hundreds of canisters of petrol and threatening to ignite them if the authorities try to force them out .
The group was founded by a former engineer , Pyotr Kuznetsov , who had fallen out with the Russian Orthodox Church .
He is thought to have ordered his followers into the cave but did not join them .
He is now in custody and is undergoing psychiatric examinations .
Via The Raw Story :
The day after President George W. Bush marshaled political forces in Congress to grant him greater authority to engage in counter terrorism - related spying , the president stated that he would seek greater changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act when the legislative branch returns to work in September .
" While I appreciate the leadership it took to pass this bill , we must remember that our work is not done , " the President said in his Sunday statement .
" This bill is a temporary , narrowly focused statute to deal with the most immediate shortcomings in the law . "
The President said next month he would focus on further immunizing private companies that cooperate with government wiretapping .
However , he used complicated language to describe these activities .
" When Congress returns in September the Intelligence committees and leaders in both parties will need to complete work on the comprehensive reforms requested by Director McConnell , including the important issue of providing meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our Nation following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , " he said .
One constitutional scholar derided Bush 's reasoning , particularly the tortuous language in his statement .

As diplomatic and military fallout from the March 1 Colombian raid into Ecuador escalate regional tensions , allegations from Ecuadorean sources link the unprovoked attack to the U.S. Manta airbase and charge the American mercenary firm DynCorp with piloting the planes that killed FARC commander Raúl Reyes and 24 others .
According to investigative journalist Kintto Lucas ,
A high - level Ecuadorean military officer , who preferred to remain anonymous , told IPS that “ a large proportion of senior officers ” in Ecuador share “ the conviction that the United States was an accomplice in the attack ” launched Mar. 1 by the Colombian military on a FARC … camp in Ecuador , near the Colombian border .
“ Since Plan Colombia was launched in 2000 , a strategic alliance between the United States and Colombia has taken shape , first to combat the insurgents and later to involve neighbouring countries in that war , ” said the officer .
“ What is happening today is a consequence of that . ”
Ecuadorean Defense Minister Wellington Sandoval said an investigation into whether the Manta airbase was used in the attack should be carried out by Ecuador ’s armed forces .
According to the leasing agreement , the Manta base can only be used for counternarcotics operations .
While U.S. Ambassador Linda Jewell assured Ecuadorean Foreign Minister María Isabel Salvador that the planes at Manta “ were not involved in any way , ” the military source told the IPS reporter that “ the technology used , first to locate the target , in other words the camp , and later to attack it , was from the United States . ”
Sandoval had earlier said that “ equipment that the Latin American armed forces do not have ” was used in the Mar. 1 bombing , according to Lucas .
Commenting on the tactical modalities employed in the raid , Sandoval said ,
“ They dropped around five ‘ smart bombs ’ , ” the kind used by the United States in the First Gulf War ( 1991 ) , “ with impressive precision and a margin of error of just one metre , at night , from planes travelling at high speeds , ” said the minister .
The military source said that “ an attack with smart bombs requires pilots who have experience in such operations , which means U.S. pilots .
That ’s why I think they did the job and later told the Colombians ‘ now go in and find the bodies ’ , which is when Colombian helicopters and troops showed up ” at the site of the raid .
The U.S. role in the raid could have been even greater .
The officer claimed that the bombing raid was actually led by “ U.S. pilots , possibly from DynCorp . ”
While demonstrable evidence for these explosive charges has yet to surface , the statements by the Ecuadorean officer seem plausible , particularly when one considers the role played by American military - and mercenary personnel in coordinating Plan Colombia .
Claiming that the aircraft “ took off from the Tres Esquinas air base in the southern Colombian department of Caquetá , ” the officer went on to describe how “ the planes used to fumigate coca crops or to attack the guerrillas are piloted by serving members of the U.S. military or ( former ) military men at the service of companies like DynCorp . ”
More than $ 5.5 billion dollars has been poured into the region by the United States since 2000 , allegedly for “ counternarcotics operations . ”
A key strategic goal of America ’s “ war on drugs ” is to take the “ battle ” to the source–coca growing , processing and exporting Andean nations , and DynCorp has been a major beneficiary of U.S. largess in the area .
Meanwhile , Ecuador ’s President Rafael Correa warned on Saturday that diplomatic tension with Colombia will rise “ if an Ecuadorean was among the dead , ” in the March 1 raid Reuters has reported .
“ It would be extremely grave if it is proven that a Ecuadorean died .
We will not let this murder go unpunished . ”
Citing Uribe ’s “ dodgy dossier , ” the Associated Press claims “ that the FARC gave money to Correa ’s 2006 presidential campaign . ”
Without skipping a beat , or apparently examining the files , denounced as forgeries by investigative journalist Greg Palast who actually did , the AP reporter avers , again citing Uribe that “ Correa ’s ally , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , planned to give the rebels US $ 300 million . ”
As a key “ private partner ” of Plan Colombia , DynCorp ’s aerial spraying of herbicides over portions of the Colombian countryside has caused wide - spread ecological damage with no discernible diminution of the flow of narcotics into Europe and the United States .
Indeed , according to a February 2008 report published by the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) , “ intensive aerial herbicide spraying of coca crops in Colombia has backfired badly , contributing to the spread of coca cultivation and cocaine production to new areas of the country and threatening human health and the environment . ”
The WOLA report , citing UN figures , goes on to describe how cocaine production in Colombia has risen from 617 metric tons in 2001 to 640 metric tons in 2005 , a wretched failure considering the inestimable cost in human lives and habitat destruction .
Since 2002 , congressional authorization for the program has permitted “ counternarcotics ” funds to be siphoned - off into scorched - earth counterinsurgency operations by the Colombian Army and their paramilitary allies .
Some 300 U.S. Special Forces “ advisors ” serve as “ mentors ” to elite Army units in what has become another front in the U.S. - led “ war on terror . ”
Analyst Doug Stokes describes how Plan Colombia has morphed into an all - out war against Colombia ’s left - wing opposition :
In the case of Colombia , civil society organizations , especially those that seek to challenge prevailing socio-economic conditions , are construed by the U.S. government as potentially subversive to the social and political order , and in the context of counter - insurgency , legitimate targets for “ paramilitary , sabotage and / or terrorist ” attack .
[ T ] he 1991 post - Cold War U.S. reorganization of Colombian military and paramilitary networks and the massive levels of post - Cold War U.S. funding of the Colombian military serves to underline the continued relevance of counterinsurgency for destroying movements that may threaten a stability geared towards U.S. interests . “
The controversial mercenary outfit , like its better - known cousin , Blackwater , has a dodgy history and has been fingered by investigators in human rights and other abuses in countries where it operates .
According to a CorpWatch profile ,
DynCorp began in 1946 as a project of a small group of returning World War II pilots seeking to use their military contacts to make a living in the air cargo business .
Named California Eastern Airways the original company was soon airlifting supplies to Asia used in the Korean War .
By 2002 Dyncorp , headquartered in Reston , Virginia , was the nation ’s 13th largest military contractor with $ 2.3 billion in revenue until it merged with Computer Sciences Corporation , an El Segundo , California - based technology services company , in an acquisition worth nearly $ 1 billion .
The company is not short on controversy .
Under the Plan Colombia contract , the company has 88 aircraft and 307 employees –139 of them American–flying missions to eradicate coca fields in Colombia .
Soldier of Fortune magazine once ran a cover story on DynCorp , proclaiming it “ Colombia ’s Coke - Bustin ’ Broncos . ”
While attempting to fly below the public radar , DynCorp ’s questionable Plan Colombia operations surfaced when a group of Ecuadorean peasants filed a class action lawsuit against the outfit in 2001 .
The suit alleges that herbicides spread by DynCorp aircraft in Colombia drifted across the border , killing their crops and causing widespread livestock and human illnesses ; in several cases , aerial fumigation led to the death of several children .
Washington responded by attempting to have the suit squashed .
According to CorpWatch , “ Assistant Secretary of State Rand Beers intervened in the case right away telling the judge the lawsuit posed ‘ a grave risk to US national security and foreign policy objectives . ' ”
In a 2001 article profiling DynCorp ’s Latin American operations , investigative reporter Jeremy Bigwood wrote ,
DynCorp ’s day to day operations are overseen by a secretive clique of officials in the State Department ’s Narcotic Affairs Section ( NAS ) and the State Department ’s Air Wing , a group that includes unreformed cold warriors and leftovers from the Central American wars of the 1980’s .
Working hand - in - hand with U.S. military officials , Narcotic Affairs is supposed to be part of the drug war only , running the fumigation operations against drug crops .
But there are indications that it is also involved in the counter - insurgency .
In areas that are targeted for fumigation by Narcotic Affairs , Colombian right - wing paramilitaries arrive , sometimes by military helicopter , according to a human rights worker living in the Putumayo who asked for anonymity .
Members of these paramilitaries “ clear the ground ” so that the planes spraying herbicides , often piloted by Americans , are not shot at by angry farmers or insurgents .
Whether or not DynCorp pilots bombed Ecuador on behalf of America ’s ally , the paramilitary - linked regime of Colombian president Álvaro Uribe , it is clear the United States will not willingly relinquish the Manta airbase when its lease expires in November 2009 .
In 2001 , a retired Ecuadorean army colonel , Fausto Cobo , told IPS that “ Manta , for the purposes of Plan Colombia is a U.S. aircraft carrier , on land . ”
As one of four “ forward operating locations ( FOLs ) , along with Curaçao , Aruba and El Salvador , Manta is a critical strategic base for U.S. “ counternarcotics ” and “ counterinsurgency ” operations in Latin America–and as a possible launching pad for an attack on Venezuela .
While the furor surrounding Colombia ’s allegations against Ecuador and Venezuela may have fallen off the media ’s radar , congressional efforts to have Venezuela declared “ a state sponsor of terrorism , ” have not .
In Latin America , the “ public - private partnership ” in repression with well - paid mercenary outfits like DynCorp taking the lead , it is a near certainty that incidents like the March 1 raid will continue as Washington seeks to shore - up the periphery of its shrinking imperialist empire .

Mmmm , who does n’t love a nice , hot dish of lasagna ?
Hearty and cheesy , this meal can be made in a many ways so it ’s sure to please a wide variety of taste buds .
Although most associate the dish with Italian cuisine , lasagna did not originate in Italy .
Rather it is Greek in origin .
The word is derived from the Greek word ‘ laganon ’ which was the first known form of pasta .
It was not made with the traditional ingredients , but it was composed of layers of pasta and sauce .
Since then the dish has been perfected in many cultures .
Though Italians would like to stake claim to creating the best recipes , Britain is also a strong competitor as a British cookbook was found with a lasagna recipe that dates back to the 1390’s .
Best Lasagna Recipes
There are so many different types of lasagna recipes you can choose from .
You can use different types of sauces like tomato or white .
Cheese can be mozzarella , ricotta or even American .
And when it comes to fillings , the possibilities are endless .
Chicken can be used , or you can substitute meat for vegetables to suit vegetarians and vegan diners .
Pasta can be whole wheat , gluten free or you can even use tacos for a Mexican spin on the dish .
Although there is no accounting for tastes , there are certain things you can do to ensure your lasagna will be the best it possibly can be .
For one , you can make your own pasta .
That way you can be sure your pasta has exactly the right thickness and the perfect blend of ingredients .
The right pan not only helps you cook your lasagna better , but also helps in the presentation when you serve it .
Using the right pan is also important .
Some like to use a narrow bread loaf pan which makes the lasagna thinner and taller .
The smaller surface area can help to make the lasagna moister .
Lasagna is a great way to make the most of your leftovers and many say that using leftover meat is even better than making it fresh !
Leftover ribs are highly recommended as their taste actually improves after sitting in the fridge for 2 - 3 days .
For best results , add the meat directly to the sauce so it can absorb the flavor .
Another way to improve your lasagna is to thicken the ricotta before adding it .
You can do this by lining a colander with a clean cloth and pouring the ricotta into it .
Allow it to drain for a few hours stirring every so often .
This will help the water escape to make it hold together better and provide a rich creamy taste once it ’s cooked .
You can also add lemon juice or salt to the ricotta while it ’s thickening to give it extra bite .
You can add different cheeses to enhance the flavor but avoid adding too much or your cheese will be stringy .
Home Made Lasagna
Lasagna can be delicious when eaten at a restaurant , but there is something about homemade lasagna that really takes it to the next level .
Making lasagna at home allows you to create a dish that is customized to the tastes of your family .
You can add the ingredients you love , allow for dietary restrictions and more .
There ’s just something AMAZING about homemade lasagna
It is also a great recipe to make with those you love .
Are the kids home from school and bored ?
Have a loved one visiting from out of town ?
No matter what your situation may be , cooking is a great way to bond and spend some time together .
You can also learn each other ’s recipes and cooking tips .
A great big pan of lasagna can feed your family for days .
If you make some at home , you are sure to have enough for dinner , and maybe a few snacks and lunches as well .
Another great thing about making your lasagna at home is the lack of portion control .
So , go ahead and make a nice big pan and take a slice that ’s as big as you want !
If you ca n’t finish it , you can always do so at tomorrow ’s lunch !
But perhaps the best thing about making homemade lasagna is that it is guaranteed to always be made with love !
Our recipe is for a basic lasagna featuring tomato sauce , ground beef , pasta and cheese .
Although lasagna is typically a bit more complicated to make as compared to some other dishes , it is well worth it because it just tastes so delicious !
The use of cheese , ricotta and mozzarella makes for rich , gooey irresistible goodness .
The classic trio of garlic , oregano and basil found throughout Italian cuisine and in this lasagna recipe , plays a major role as well .
This is the perfect lasagna recipe that will please even the pickiest eaters time after time .

In describing the Democratic response to Bush ’s sabre - rattling toward Iran , Power of Narrative ’s Arthur Silber summed things up neatly :
They do n’t object because — they do n’t object .
The only thing wrong with Silber ’s assessment is that it was limited to Iran .
In truth , you could just as easily use those seven succinct words to characterize the Democratic Party in general .
Time and time again , on critical issue after critical issue , the Democrats fall in line with their Republican leaders and do what they ’re asked .
They do the will of the GOP instead of the will of the people .
They act in the interests of the nation ’s narrow power elite instead of in the public interest .
They follow instead of leading .
And they do so because – they do n’t object .
Some examples illustrate the point .
We could go on here , I suppose , but what would be the point ?
Let ’s sum this all up with a simple question :
What has Bush asked for that the Democrats have not given him ?
That ’s an actual question , and I ’d love an answer .
Maybe you can provide an example or two .
If not , my point is proven , and if so , I imagine the smallness of the “ victories ” will do little more than highlight the massiveness of the defeats described above .
On the whole the Democrats were a lot better off when they were the minority .
Under those circumstances they could bluster and pose all they liked , and since we all knew they lacked the votes to actually do a lot many Americans were lulled into believing them .
This engendered a good deal of doomed hope about what would happen in the aftermath of last year ’s dramatic re-taking of the Capitol .
I ’m not innocent here , either .
For a long time I was on record saying that I did n’t see a lot of difference between the two parties , but the sheer abomination of this presidency – easily the worst of my lifetime – just about convinced me that maybe I was wrong .
And when one party is conducting a full - monty assault on the Constitution , the Treasury , our students , the middle class , the working class , and basic human decency in general , it ’s easy to develop fond deelings for those who are standing in front of microphones condeming it .
However , now that they ’re allegedly in charge we expect action .
Specifically , we expect action that ’s consistent with the words they ’ve been pandering all these years .
If you say “ we ’ll do X if you elect enough of us , ” and we elect enough of you , we ’re going to expect you to do X .
If you get filibustered then maybe we need to elect even more of you , but when you do n’t even try we might grow suspicious that we ’ve been had .
So , another question :
In what way , precisely , are things different now than they would have been had we returned a GOP majority to the Capitol last year ?
You might argue that there are plenty of Democratic senators and reps working diligently to counter Dubya & The Dick , but they ’re being undercut by significant numbers of Bush Dogs and DINOs .
Right – my point exactly .
Remember , my thesis is n’t that there are n’t individuals in DC who oppose the current regime , it ’s that there ’s no opposition party .
The Democratic takeover of Congress merely highlights the deep divide within the party and the important ways those divisions work against the nation ’s interests .
Even if you ’re one of the eight people in America who are happy with Bush , the GOP and how things are going generally , you should be instinctively nervous about the fact that our system fails to guarantee meaningful opposition , because that does n’t bode well for you down the road .
( How are you going to feel in eight years when President Hillary Clinton is seven years into perfecting the template that Bush established ? )
What goes around comes around , and democracy is n’t well - served by a government of rich power elites who ca n’t seem to find much to disagree on .
And if they disagree in words , but not in votes , then you ’re a fool to believe they really disagree at all .
We ’d all do well to think more about what is done than what is said .
Otherwise we ’re little more than Republicrat bitches .

The terrorists in the Transportation Security Administration otherwise known as the TSA responded to news of a woman saying that security screeners humiliated her by forcing her to remove body piercings because they set off the metal detector alarm .
The woman was forced to remove the piercings with pliers while low class TSA goons laughed at her .
The TSA claims that there are numerous incidents of female terrorists hiding explosives in sensitive areas of the human body so that ’s why the actions by the security screeners were warranted .
It is funny how the TSA declines to list all of these different incidents involving female terrorists hiding explosives around their private areas .
The bottom line is that the TSA ’s main purpose is not to provide safety but instead to ensure that the American people are acclimated into the 21st century technological enslavement system .
How does forcing people to remove body piercings keep the American people safe from terrorism ?
The whole thing is a joke and the TSA should be abolished and their $ 10 an hour employees should find their way to an unemployment line .
Here is a blurb from an Associated Press report detailing this particular incident .
A Texas woman who said she was forced to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane called Thursday for an apology by federal security agents and a civil rights investigation .
" I would n’t wish this experience upon anyone , " Mandi Hamlin said at a news conference .
" My experience with TSA was a nightmare I had to endure .
No one deserves to be treated this way . ”
Hamlin , 37 , said she was trying to board a flight from Lubbock to Dallas on Feb. 24 when she was scanned by a Transportation Security Administration agent after passing through a larger metal detector without problems .
The female TSA agent used a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of Hamlin ’s chest , the Dallas - area resident said .
Hamlin said she told the woman she was wearing nipple piercings .
The agent then called over her male colleagues , one of whom said she would have to remove the jewelry , Hamlin said .
Hamlin said she could not remove them and asked whether she could instead display her pierced breasts in private to the female agent .
But several other male officers told her she could not board her flight until the jewelry was out , she said .
She was taken behind a curtain and managed to remove one bar - shaped piercing but had trouble with the second , a ring .
" Still crying , she informed the TSA officer that she could not remove it without the help of pliers , and the officer gave a pair to her , " said Hamlin ’s attorney , Gloria Allred , reading from a letter she sent Thursday to the director of the TSA ’s Office of Civil Rights and Liberties .
Allred is a well - known Los Angeles lawyer who often represents high - profile claims .
Applying pliers to the torso of a mannequin that had a peach - colored bra with the rings on it , Hamlin showed reporters at the news conference how she took off the second ring .
She said she heard male TSA agents snickering as she took out the ring .
She was scanned again and was allowed to board even though she still was wearing a belly button ring .
Here is the original response from the TSA regarding this incident that has since been removed from their web site .
TSA is actively investigating Ms. Hamlin ’s allegations to ensure procedures were followed appropriately .
Our security officers are well - trained to screen individuals with body piercings in sensitive areas with dignity and respect while ensuring a high level of security .
TSA is well aware of terrorists ’ interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body , therefore we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover .
Incidents of female terrorists hiding explosives in sensitive areas are on the rise all over the world .
This scenario must be addressed at our nation ’s airports .
This message has been replaced with another statement saying that they are now going to change procedures as a result of the incident .
Considering that this is the same institution that has made people remove their shoes going through metal detectors , banned liquids and adopted all sorts of ridiculous procedures , one ca n’t help but be pessimistic about these changes .
Apparently the TSA thinks that people wearing body piercings in private areas of their body could be hiding something and are terrorists .
This is insane .
There is no need for these intrusive and humiliating searches .
Not to mention , there is no evidence indicating that there are all of these female terrorists hiding explosives around the areas of their private parts .
If there actually is , perhaps the TSA would like to share us specific information .
It seems fairly obvious that the TSA is just making this up so they can try and save face in light of another embarrassing public relations snafu .
Pretty soon the TSA will force all of us to walk through metal detectors naked followed by full cavity searches .
They will claim that this is designed to protect you from Al - Qaeda a so called terrorist group that does n’t even exist as a true organization .
It was founded by the U.S. government in the late 1970s as a list of Islamic freedom fighters that could be counted on to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
Al - Qaeda does n’t even exist as a real organization .
It is all a big fraud , and it would take pages upon pages of text to detail all of the different lies that the government and the media use to convince the American people that the war on terror is real .
You are more likely to die in a car accident or in a swimming pool than you are from international terrorists .
The war on terror is actually the war of terror and it has no basis in reality .
It is just an excuse for the U.S. government to go around the world invading countries and to implement a totalitarian technological enslavement system for the American people .
We are living in a police state and this incident as well as the TSA ’s ridiculous response to the incident shows us that we are living in tyranny .
Protest this tyranny by limiting airline travel as much as possible so that the airlines go bankrupt .
Maybe then , the airline companies will lobby to get rid of the TSA and their Gestapo police state tactics .

It 's not quite a glass - domed city yet , but St. Petersberg has taken the first steps towards that goal .
British architecture firm Wilkinson Eyre , best known for the design of the Gateshead Millenium Bridge in Newcastle , unveiled a bold new plan to revamp the old market of St. Petersburg , Russia by putting it entirely under glass .
Over the next few years they 'll be putting a giant sheet of reinforced glass over Aprasin Dvor , a shopping district .
A matching glass bridge will span the river .
We 've got some interesting facts about the project .

Here are some deets :
- A glazed crystalline glass tensegrity roof reflects weather conditions but keeps pedestrians dry .
- A new building on the Fontanka River will replace the decaying 60s Publishing House .
- A lightweight tensegrity footbridge will be built over the river .
It 'll look like a shiny cloud .

news Unlimited , Meaning The Opposite Of Unlimited
Photo by Denmar from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
Canadian telcos are masters at exploiting customer tolerance limits — when you need a mobile device and are locked into a contract with few alternative options , you ’re pretty much forced to accept the beatdown levied by one of the three majors .
And the carriers benefit greatly by confusing customers , whether it be via despicable “ system access fees ” or by giving meaningless , unhelpful names to monthly rate plans , like “ Fab Five ” and “ Über ” ( Bell ) , “ Mega Value ” and “ Right Fit ” ( Rogers ) , and “ My Faves ” and “ Talk To Me ” ( Telus ) .
Wireless carriers profit from you not reading the fine print , and they disguise borderline criminal marketing tactics in flowerly technobabble so that your near - Luddite Aunt Cicely is more willing to bend over and take it .
In fact , Bell Wireless even has the brass cojones to claim that the “ higher the [ system access ] fee , the greater the opportunity to invest in network quality to enhance your experience . ”
With the announcement this week by Rogers of an unlimited data plan for mobile devices , consumers saw it as a step in the right direction toward reducing historically exorbitant data rates .
The rate reduction across all three carriers within the last year is likely a direct response to the demand for Apple ’s data - hungry iPhone , which has been immensely successful in the United States and U.K .
The Rogers announcement was seen by many as a signal that the iPhone ’s arrival in Canada is imminent , but what appears to be a good deal on the surface comes with some serious caveats , and for the Evil Red Empire , it ’s business as usual .
Under the new unlimited data plan from Rogers , customers get 2,500 sent text messages and 1,000 sent picture / video messages .
Now , one might notice that text and image messages are data , so texting should also be unlimited , but customers are already used to paying for messaging , which actually transmits significantly less data than , say , a regular phone call .
Voice mail , call display , and name display are also included , which is nice , though these are things that already exist on your signal , but are normally blocked unless you pay extra to unlock them under other rate plans .
Again , skeezy , but we ’re used to it .
Where customers need to pay attention is with what Rogers calls “ unlimited on - device mobile browsing . ”
Customers will assume this to mean “ unlimited browsing , ” but it ’s a trap .
Here is how Rogers explains it :
This plan includes unlimited on - device mobile browsing only .
Plan is available on select phones only ( PDAs such as Blackberry or Windows Mobile devices , PC cards and non-Rogers certified devices are not eligible ) .
Data usage incurred on ineligible devices , incurred while tethering ( using device as wireless modem for laptop ) or incurred using non-Rogers ( 3rd party ) applications downloaded to your device will be subject to pay - per-use charges of 5 cents / KB . ”
Here ’s what that means : if you have an unlocked phone that was not purchased directly through Rogers ; if you use your mobile as a modem for your laptop ; if you use a third - party app like Google Maps ; if you swap your SIM card into another GSM phone , you get the unconscionable 5¢ / KB rate .
In other words , Rogers will penalize you for using the internet in a way they do n’t approve of ( read : anything off their internal partner network ) despite the transmitted data being identical on either an unlocked iPhone or a BlackBerry .
Did you notice something else ?
Popular PDAs that Rogers sells , like the BlackBerry and the Palm Treo , are n’t covered under the new unlimited data plan !
Therefore , all the phones Rogers sells still have the old data rates , with the exception of the four Rogers Vision handsets ( none of which are smartphones ) , themselves bundled with a contract consisting of a $ 6 “ service fee , ” a $ 5 “ mobile download charge , ” and a $ 9 “ transport fee . ”
Oh , and that ’s with a 36 - month contract .
If you ’ve sprung for the Unlimited Music Plan and bought ( er , rented ) music over your handset , the tracks ca n’t be burned to a CD , and they ’ll disappear if you cancel the subscription .
You ’ll access your data the way Rogers wants , thankyouverymuch .
Rogers already has a twisted idea of what constitutes reasonable internet use .
Under their BlackBerry plans , they claim that 1.5 MB of data is “ enough for tons of picture uploads , ” and they ridiculously average web pages at a 4 KB maximum .
That would be equivalent to a web page without any images , and consisting of less than 4,000 characters of text .
Rogers justifies that measurement by only classifying those sites as ad hoc pages “ optimized for mobile viewing . ”
Under the unlimited data plan , consumers can only visit Rogers - approved sites , like Lavalife Mobile , Yahoo !
Search , and Canada.com , lest they encounter the good ol ’ 5 ¢ / KB rate again .
So , you can search for something on Google , but just do n’t visit the link once you find it .
The iPhone should be a unique challenge in Canada because it kills the cash cow .
In the United States and U.K. , the iPhone uses the carriers ’ slow EDGE network for full internet access ( Rogers employs both EDGE and the newer , faster HSDPA system ) .
The iPhone is also Wi-Fi-capable , allowing users to bypass EDGE and jump onto a hotspot or a home or office wireless router — exactly what Rogers does n’t want you to do .
For the company to offer a plan that is palatable to iPhone users — and , by proxy , all customers who use internet - capable devices — they will have to offer true unlimited data access .
Until then , customers need to remember that a company calling something “ unlimited ” does n’t actually make it so .
George W. Bush 's failures are so dizzying in scale and scope that , ironically , plenty of Republicans still can't even make them out against the gloom - shrouded horizon .
These are like the Republicans who wanted to re-elect Herbert Hoover in 1932 , only much dumber .
At a time when Bush is often dismissed as a lame duck , the CPAC crowd , in open defiance of the 22nd Amendment , greeted him with a thunderous cheer of " Four more years . "
Unable in their folly to admit that Bush has nearly destroyed the Republican Party , they 're actually eager for more of the same .
And if anybody can give them four more years of such folly , it is John McCain .
Eric Draper , AP file photo
The signs are all around us that the election of McCain this year would amount to a continuation of George W. Bush 's reign for a further four years .
Surrounded by neocon advisers , giddy at the prospect of further wars , hemmed in on all sides by his stubborn support for the most disastrous policies , McCain is increasingly indistinguishable from Bush .
The man even promises fellow Republicans a return during the general election to that hallmark of Bushism , the full - throated demonization of Democrats .
Here are a few selections from McCain 's speech at CPAC last week , where he sought to deflect attention from his own political weakness by lambasting Democrats .
Who could have predicted it , he portrays Democrats as a veritable danger to the nation .
This is indistinguishable from the rhetoric of George Bush .
It is shameful and dangerous that Senate Democrats are blocking an extension of surveillance powers that enable our intelligence and law enforcement to defend our country against radical Islamic extremists .
... Senator Clinton and Senator Obama will withdraw our forces from Iraq based on an arbitrary timetable designed for the sake of political expediency , and which recklessly ignores the profound human calamity and dire threats to our security that would ensue .
... Senator Clinton and Senator Obama will concede to our critics that our own actions to defend against its threats are responsible for fomenting the terrible evil of radical Islamic extremism , and their resolve to combat it will be as flawed as their judgment .
After seven years of Bushagoguery , McCain knew his audience had been conditioned to expect red meat from a Republican president .
So he flung it at them in heaps .
The Senator from Arizona is the fake " moderate " who declared at the 2004 Convention that Republicans should not try to use national security issues to attack Democrats .
We must , whatever our disagreements , stick together in this great challenge of our time .
My friends in the Democratic Party and I 'm fortunate to call many of them my friends assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our government 's most important obligation ... I do n't doubt the sincerity of my Democratic friends .
And they should not doubt ours .
Guess what , Senator ?
The deal is off .
You 've learned divisiveness at the knees of the master , George W. Bush .
Now let 's see if Americans are as fed up with Republicans sowing discord as I suspect they are .
As it happens , Republicans themselves are increasingly horrified at the politics of divisiveness .
Oh , no , hah ... you took that the wrong way - not the kind of divisions that they 've stirred up in order to turn America inside out since 2001 .
No , none of that .
Republicans are agitated about divisiveness within their Party .
Chuck Smith , chairman of the Virginia Beach GOP and a McCain supporter , said party politics needs to change .
" We can't continue to divide , divide , divide , " he said .
Because the personal attacks on John McCain by fellow conservatives are getting out of hand .
That divide , divide stuff is supposed to be reserved for the rest of the country , not the Party .
So what if a lot of Republicans do n't think McCain can be trusted ?
They need to learn to pipe down , according to Republican leaders who 've been closing ranks lately trying to shield McCain from his critics .
It 's all very reminiscent of how Republicans have fought for the last two terms to shield George W. Bush from the recriminations he so richly has earned .
And we can expect more of the same from Republican partisans if McCain is elected to carry on Bush 's legacy of discord for a further four years .
He 'll be placed beyond all criticism , another sainted McCommander - in - Chief .
We could n't ask for a better sign that a McCain presidency would represent Bush Redux than the sudden emergence last month of a newly diagnosed psychological disorder , the " McCain Derangement Syndrome " .
During Bush 's first term , as their hero was piling fiasco upon fiasco , humiliated right - wingers advanced a daring medical theory :
The many criticisms leveled against the president were due not to his failures , outrages and lies , but rather to an otherwise undocumented mental disease , the " Bush Derangement Syndrome " , which left critics unable and unworthy to comment on the Great Man .
There was no evidence whatever to support any of the diagnoses of BDS , typically made at a great distance from the putative sufferers .
But after all that 's what made this medical breakthrough so daring .
And let 's not pretend to be surprised at the Republicans ' skill - set in the area of psychoses .
They 've been successful for many years in identifying mental illnesses that , they say , afflict various prominent Democrats .
The entire Republican Party is practically a hotbed of psychiatric research .
It 's all very twisted .
But there was a new twist several weeks ago when all of a sudden a similar disease was identified and named .
What a moment !
Having learned nothing from the left 's Bush Derangement Syndrome , the conservative movement 's big talkers spent the days before Super Tuesday indulging in a fiery display of McCain Derangement Syndrome .
For some of these folks , this is what medical insurance providers might call a preexisting condition , always on the verge of flaring up .
William Kristol is the Wit of the Weekly Standard , and held to be a " riot " in his own circles .
Even so , not all conservatives are quite mollified yet by the argument that opposition to McCain signifies that they 're ready for the booby hatch .
Partisans of John McCain say his conservative critics are " deranged . " ...
Enough .
It is not " deranged " to have concerns about McCain ’s positions and his political style ... Conservatives can reach differing views of McCain in good faith .
In fact some of the mentally suspect are downright indignant to find themselves at the receiving end of Republican smears !
McCain ’s supporters continue to mock thoughtful , good - faith critics as " deranged . " ...
I ’m not deranged , and neither are they ...
McCain ’s fans do their candidate no favors by telling him the only people who can save his candidacy are unhinged .
Well , be that as it may , I 'm pretty sure they 'll eventually embrace the idea of a " McCain Derangement Syndrome " if he should ever be elected president .
Because something gaudy and divisive would be needed to deflect attention away from the full horror of Years 9 - 12 of Bushemonium .
In a stinging ruling , a Los Angeles federal judge said immigration officials ’ alleged decision to withhold a critical medical test and other treatment from a detainee who later died of cancer was “ beyond cruel and unusual ” punishment .
The decision from U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson allows the family of Francisco Castaneda to seek financial damages from the government .
Castaneda , who suffered from penile cancer , died Feb. 16 .
Before his release from custody last year , the government had refused for 11 months to authorize a biopsy for a growing lesion , even though voluminous government records showed that several doctors said the test was urgently needed , given Castaneda ’s condition and a family history of cancer , Pregerson said .
But rather than test and treat Castaneda , government officials told him to be patient and prescribed antihistamines , ibuprofen and extra boxer shorts , the judge wrote in a decision released late Tuesday .
In summary , the judge wrote , the care provided to Castaneda “ can be characterized by one word : nothing . ”

Pregerson blasted public health officials ’ “ attempt to sidestep responsibility for what appears to be . . . one of the most , if not the most , egregious ” violations of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment that “ the court has ever encountered . ”
At this stage of the proceedings , “ the only question is whether ” the plaintiffs ’ allegations , if true , show that government officials “ were deliberately indifferent to his condition .
The court finds that they do , ” Pregerson said .
“ Everyone knows that cancer is often deadly .
Everyone knows that early diagnosis and treatment often saves lives , ” the judge wrote .
The government ’s own records , he emphasized , “ bespeak of conduct that transcends negligence by miles .
It bespeaks of conduct that , if true , should be taught to every law student as conduct for which the moniker ‘ cruel ’ is inadequate , ” Pregerson concluded in permitting the case to move forward .
Conal Doyle , an Oakland attorney who is co-counsel for Castaneda ’s family members , said the Salvadoran immigrant spent eight months in custody on a charge of possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell , then was transferred to immigration custody because he did not have legal residency .

He first informed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement medical staff at the San Diego Correctional Facility on March 27 , 2006 , that “ a lesion on his penis was becoming painful and growing , ” the judge wrote .
The next day , a physician assistant at the facility examined Castaneda and issued a treatment plan calling for a consultation with a urologist “ ASAP ” and a request for a biopsy , according to government records cited by the judge .
Over the next 11 months , several doctors , with increasing urgency , made the same recommendations .
For example , after conducting an examination June 7 , 2006 , Dr. John Wilkinson , an oncologist , wrote a report saying he strongly agreed that Castaneda had an urgent need for a biopsy and an assessment by a urologist because he might have “ penile cancer .
. . .
In this extremely delicate area . . . there can be considerable morbidity from even benign lesions which are not promptly treated . ”
That same day , Pregerson said , Dr. Esther Hui of the Division of Immigration Health Services acknowledged Castaneda ’s condition but said the government would not admit him to a hospital because her agency considered a biopsy “ an elective outpatient procedure . ”
Pregerson , who became a federal judge in 1996 , said evidence presented by the plaintiffs suggested that Hui , one of the defendants , characterized the surgery as elective so the federal government would not to have to provide or pay for it .
Advertisement
In February 2007 , after the American Civil Liberties Union intervened , a biopsy was finally scheduled .
A few days before the procedure , however , Castaneda was abruptly released , the judge wrote .
He went to the emergency room of Harbor - UCLA Medical Center and was diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma .
His penis was eventually amputated , and chemotherapy ultimately proved unsuccessful .
Four months before he died , Castaneda testified at a hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration , Citizenship , Refugees , Border Security and International Law , as his teenage daughter listened .
“ Mr. Castaneda ’s case was just outrageous , ” Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - San Jose ) , chairwoman of the subcommittee , said in an interview Tuesday .
Lofgren said one of the things she found most troubling was that “ bureaucrats ” at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Washington have the power to overrule recommendations of doctors who have actually seen the medical problems of detainees .
“ That is a recipe for disaster , ” she said .
Advertisement
Lori Haley , an ICE spokeswoman from Laguna Niguel , said in an e-mail that she could not comment on the Castaneda case but that the agency spent nearly $ 100 million on medical , dental and psychiatric care for detainees in fiscal 2007 .
The government had argued that its employees were immune from this lawsuit .
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office said the Justice Department might appeal Pregerson ’s ruling .
Last year , the U.S. Government Accountability
Office issued a report on medical care at immigration detention facilities that said officials at some of the sites “ cited difficulties in obtaining approval for outside medical and mental health care as . . . presenting problems in caring for detainees . ”
Doyle said Castaneda ’s death “ would have been prevented by the exercise of basic human decency . ”

Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson said the decision was legally significant and factually compelling .
“ This was not a detainee with a hangnail , ” she said .
“ You should not have to have your penis fall off to get medical treatment from the government . ”

The Honorable Hillary Clinton
United States Senate
Washington , D.C. 20510
Dear Sen. Clinton ,
When I stepped into the voting booth in the New York state primary Feb. 5 , I pulled the lever for Sen. Barack Obama , not you , my state ’s junior senator .
But I had misgivings .
Not any more .
Any doubts I had about the wisdom of my choice of Sen.
Obama vanished when you chose not to show up on Capitol Hill to vote on the critical cloture vote on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill .
As passed by the Senate , that bill would grant retroactive legal immunity for the telecommunication companies that aided the federal government in spying on Americans .
Although Sen. Obama ( and you ) did not vote on final passage ( a foreordained formality by this point ) , he showed up to vote on the issue of cloture .
He voted when it counted .
You did n’t .
For a year , while running for the Democratic nomination for president , you have repeatedly stressed the importance of voting .
While I care which way you would have voted , I care far more that you did not vote .
You told Iowans on Dec. 16 to vote :
Iâ€™m going to work as hard as I can to earn your support and your trust .
And I need every one who is ready for change to go to the caucuses on January 3rd. [ emphasis added ]
On Super Tuesday , you applauded Americans who voted :
Tonight , we are hearing the voices of people across America . …
Tonight , in record numbers , you voted not just to make history â€ ” but to remake America .
And you promised to stand up for us if we stood up for you :
I ’m asking you to stand up for me for one night and I will stand up for you throughout this campaign .
Standing up for our values , our principles , for the kind of change we need to bring the country together just as I did in New York .
Then I will stand up every single day in the White House .
[ emphasis added ]
But you did n’t .
Ninety - eight senators voted on a bill that would give the telecoms a free pass on their support of spying on Americans by their own government .
Perhaps , as my colleague Martin suggested earlier , you sought to have no record on the issue so that you could decry the outcome .
Or perhaps you remembered that Verizon ’s employees gave you $ 39,275 in 2007 alone , including $ 2,300 from chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg ; $ 4,600 from senior executive Kathryn C. Brown ; $ 2,300 from Verizon lawyer Jacquelynn Ruff ; and $ 4,600 from “ senior consultant ” Suzanne Smith .
( Of course , if you run Mr. Seidenberg through the Federal Election Commission database , you ’ll find he ’s spread thousands of dollars to Republicans and Democrats alike . )
Perhaps you remembered that Verizon is a donor heavyweight for politicians , having contributed through its “ Good Government Club ” more than $ 6.9 million since the late ’90s .
Perhaps you remembered that in 2007 alone you received $ 37,881 in contributions from employees of AT&T , including $ 4,600 from AT&T ’s vice president of federal relations , Peter G. Jacoby ; $ 1,300 from AT&T ’s director of government relations , Carol Wilner ; $ 4,600 from AT&T business development executive Ann Marie Triolo ; and $ 4,600 from AT&T vice president Denita Willoughby .
And perhaps you remembered that since the late ’90s , the AT&T Corp.
PAC has donated more than $ 3.2 million to politicians ; the AT&T Federal PAC has donated more than $ 11.5 million ; and the AT&T Wireless Services PAC has given nearly $ 600,000 .
But all that telecom money did n’t deter the others senators from voting ( although the role of telecom lobbying and largesse in how they voted is another issue ) .
Ninety - eight senators showed up to put their votes on the record .
Perhaps you had Potomac Primary fever and were tired from the night before , when you sat in a university lecture hall in Charlottesville , Va. , and declared that you were better able to cross “ the commander in chief threshold ” come election time .
You made a poor choice .
For whatever reason , you chose to pass up a chance to demonstrate that are “ the best change - maker I ever saw , ” as your husband called you Monday night during a speech at the Charlestown Retirement Community in Catonsville , Md .
The only change your failure to vote on FISA will create is increased support for your opponent , Sen. Obama .
End your campaign .
You have lost your remaining credibility .
Irritatedly ,
Denny Wilkins
· Campaigner had been told not to talk to foreign press · Fear of detention amid pre-Olympic crackdown
A prominent human rights lawyer has gone missing , presumed detained by the authorities , amid a crackdown on dissent ahead of the Beijing Olympics .
Teng Biao - who has defended Aids activists , Falun Gong practitioners and farmers fighting for their land - was last seen on Thursday , being bundled into a black car outside his home in Beijing .
He had recently been warned by police that he would be detained unless he stopped talking to the foreign media and writing about human rights abuses in the runup to the Olympics .
Shortly before he went missing , Teng told the Guardian that his passport had been seized , his phone bugged and his emails checked by the authorities .
He was warned that he also faced the sack from his job as a lecturer at the China University of Political Science and Law and risked detention .
" They told me I cannot accept any interview related to human rights and the Olympics .
I said I can not make such a promise .
I have a right to speak , " he said last week .
" I 'm not sure if they will arrest me tomorrow .
But I feel no fear . "
His wife , Wang Ling , said Teng left home at 8.25 pm , saying he would be back in 20 minutes .
About half an hour later , she heard shouting downstairs .
Two witnesses told her that a man had been pulled out of the family 's car and taken away .
" It is strange because my husband is a very nice man who had no personal conflicts with anyone , " she said .
" I do n't understand why this happened . "
Sources who met
Teng this week said the lawyer looked downcast and under pressure because police had threatened to charge him with inciting subversion of state power , which carries a sentence of several years in prison .
This accusation is often levelled at dissidents .
Last month , Hu Jia - a friend of Teng and a prominent civic rights and Aids campaigner - was arrested and is likely to face a similar charge .
Teng and Hu co-wrote an open letter last September that highlighted China 's failure to live up to its Olympic promise to improve human rights before the games , which will take place this August .
" When you come to the Olympic games in Beijing , you will see skyscrapers , spacious streets , modern stadiums and enthusiastic people .
You will see the truth , but not the whole truth , just as you see only the tip of an iceberg , " the pair wrote .
" You may not know that the flowers , smiles , harmony and prosperity are built on a base of grievances , tears , imprisonment , torture and blood . "
At least two other activists - Liu Jie and Yang Chunlin - have been put in prison or re-education camps after linking the Olympics to human rights campaigns or petitions against land seizures .
International human rights groups said they were deeply concerned about Teng .
" The detention of a member of the Beijing bar association signals an escalation in the repression against dissent ahead of the games , " said Nicholas Bequelin , of Human Rights Watch .
" We urge the International Olympic Committee to end its silence about the suppression of Olympic critics by the Chinese government . "
Teng was aware of the political sensitivity of the Olympics , which he believed was the reason why Hu was arrested this year .
" It is very , very dangerous for Chinese people to hold any kind of protest before the Olympics , " he said .
In theory , there 's just one set of copyright rules and they apply to everyone , from Sony Pictures to your neighbour 's eight - year - old who wants to photocopy his Spider - Man comics and sell them to the other kids .
Regardless of who wants to make a new Spider - Man comic , movie or other derivative work , that person has to hire a lawyer , have that lawyer call up Marvel Comics , set up a call or a face - to - face , negotiate a contract , sign it , pay a fee , and report on their ongoing uses , opening their books for auditing and inspection .
Sony Pictures can do this .
It can send lawyers to Marvel and Marvel will send its lawyers back to Sony .
Everyone gets to sit at a long table and hammer out the deal , then they issue a press release and go into production .
But little Timmy can't do it .
He never could .
And yet when you talk to comic book creators , they 'll tell you that they got started by drawing copies of other peoples ' work .
Musicians start by playing the music they love .
Painters start by copying other painters .
Filmmakers try to recreate the effects and scenes they 've been inspired by in big - screen releases .
Aping each other
This seems pretty basic : even primates watch each other and copy ( or , if you will , " ape " ) each other , so when one monkey figures out how to improve a potato by dipping it in salt water , the whole gang follows suit .
We copy each other to learn and to improve - it's one of the things that makes us human , because we 're a lot better at it than chimps .
It 's not just Timmy 's Spider - Man comic .
The babysitter brings over a bag of DVDs to keep the kids quiet ; you organise a singalong at the pub ; you make a mix tape as part of an awkward teenaged mating ritual : all these uses fall on the wrong side of copyright law unless they are preceded by a complex legal dance of the sort that mere mortals rarely even glimpse , let alone partake of .
Through most of copyright 's history , we had two de facto systems : industrial regulation ( governing what big companies did with each others ' stuff ) and folk - copyright ( the rules of thumb that most of us understood to be true ) .
Spider - Man knock - off
This meant that it was OK to photocopy a Dilbert toon for your cubicle wall , make a copy of a record for your pal , or publish your own low - rent Spider - Man knock - off in the school newspaper .
Folk - copyright did n't have a lot of legal authority - it was completely backwards on any number of subjects - but it worked .
The likes of Time Warner , Sony , Universal or EMI were n't going to bust you for what you got up to at the OAPs ' campfire singalong , and not just because they 'd look foolish for doing so .
It just was n't cost - effective to hunt down all the kids flogging fan - fiction Star Trek episodes in the dealer 's rooms of small regional science fiction conventions .
Aside from the negative PR , there was the sheer cost of wasting billable lawyer - hours on something that could n't possibly make you any money .
Then came the internet , which introduced two critical changes : it made it easier for folk - users of copyright to find each other and spread their creations and copies farther than ever , and it made it easier for enforcers to find them and threaten them , especially once tools like the " notice and takedown " regime in the European Union Copyright Directive and the US Digital Millennium Copyright
Act came on the scene .
YouTube dance
Now you have billionaire media empires behaving as though parents should get a licence for a Prince song before they upload a YouTube video of their adorable toddler dancing to it .
They are also acting as though fan fiction writers should be applying for a licence too - along with karaoke singers , would - be painters and , yes , the OAP picnickers who 've uploaded the shakycam video of last weekend 's knees - up in the church basement .
This is a genuinely radical idea : individuals should hire lawyers to negotiate their personal use of cultural material , or at least refrain from sharing their cultural activities with others ( except it 's not 's really culture if you 're not sharing it , is it ? ) .
It 's also a dumb idea .
People are n't going to hire lawyers to bless the singalong or Timmy 's comic book .
They 're also not going to stop doing culture .
New regime
We need to stop shoe - horning cultural use into the little carve - outs in copyright , such as fair dealing and fair use .
Instead we need to establish a new copyright regime that reflects the age - old normative consensus about what 's fair and what is n't at the small - scale , hand - to - hand end of copying , display , performance and adaptation .
A diverse and extremely sensible group of people are doing just this : the Access to Knowledge ( A2 K ) treaty is a proposal from the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) to set out the rights and responsibilities of archivists , educators and people who provide access to disabled users of information .
The drafting group - which is open to the general public - includes representatives of creators ' groups ( tellingly , no one from the corporations that buy creators ' works have taken part ) , disabled rights groups , technical standards bodies , civil rights groups , even medical rights groups like Médecins Sans Frontières .
A2 K is at the top of the WIPO agenda .
It 's the first breath of sanity in the copyright debate .
Let 's hope it's not the last one .
Oscilloscope hacks are generally reserved for the most extreme gaming geeks , but this version of " Scopetris " is something that any Tetris fan can appreciate .
Running on an oscilloscope decked out with custom hardware , the creator actually drew each piece , giving the board an interesting juxtaposition of the physical and the digital .
And it beats the hell out of Pong .
Here 's a vid of the gorgeous creation in action :
Since the images refresh at 100 Hz , the game runs as smooth as a baby 's … Scopetris .

After alleged beating , CBS asks if police are now ' targeting women ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This CBS legal analyst : ' Preposterous ' that fall caused woman 's horrific injuries
An incident involving a Louisiana woman who was allegedly beaten by a police officer after her arrest on suspicion of drunk driving has led CBS News to take a look at the broader question of whether police officers are specifically targeting women .
The alleged victim , Angela Garbarino , has claimed that Officer Wiley Willis beat her after turning off a police video camera .
The Caddo Parish district attorney and the U.S. Justice Department are both planning to investigate the case .
Willis asserts that Garbarino slipped and fell when he tried to prevent her leaving the room .
The Shreveport Police Union has come to Willis 's defense , saying that they believe his version of the story and charging that his dismissal following the incident did not follow protocol and violated his rights .
Legal analyst Lisa Bloom told CBS " it 's absolutely preposterous " that Garbarino 's horrific injuries -- which included two black eyes , a broken nose , a fractured cheekbone , and two lost teeth -- could have been sustained in a fall .
" When the incident started to escalate , he should have called in another police officer , " Bloom said of Willis .
" He could have cuffed her to the chair .
He could have used less restrictive means to control the woman if , indeed , she was getting physically abusive .
He 's a younger , much stronger male . "
CBS News has found that Willis had two lawsuits filed against him in 2006 , one by a woman who claims Willis held a gun to her son's head and threatened to shoot him and another by a woman who says she was arrested because she filed a complaint against Willis .
Bloom further sees the incident as part of a larger pattern .
" Wives of police officers have long claimed there 's a problem with police officers abusing women , " she stated .
The Louisiana case is the latest in a series of videotaped incidents of possible police brutality against women , the most recent of which was that of an Ohio woman forcibly strip - searched by police officers of both sexes .
In November 2006 , another Ohio woman was tasered while handcuffed .
" This has been a long ongoing problem , " Bloom concluded .
" What we have now is the introduction of the videotape , and women do n't have to just make a claim .
They have some proof . "

" Go see it , " says Moyers .
" Not in a while has the truth hit so hard . "
In 2002 , Dilawar , 22 , and his passengers were stopped at Bagram Air Base and held under suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack .
Five days later , his death from blunt force trauma would be ruled a homicide , as written on the death certificate , in English , given to Dilawar 's family with his body .
Captain Carolyn Wood , overseeing interrogation at Bagram , would be awarded a Bronze Star for " valor " and tapped to begin similar operations at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison .
Prisoners were assigned numbers , which were written on sheets of paper hung outside the airlocks in which they were kept , and directly on their bodies .
" Detainees were actually chained with their hands above their heads in these airlocks , " says Moazzam Begg .
" His number , 421 , was something that I could see often , because his back was towards me . "
" There were always officers coming and going through the facility , " says Eric Lahammer .
" We kind of joked about it as being the ' greatest show on earth ' ; everyone wanted to come and look at the ' terrorists . ' "

For their tests , the researchers used a genetic testing method not employed in clean rooms before , known as ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis , which allowed them to study and decode a genetic marker common to all bacteria .
The unique sequences of each type allowed the researchers to identify a greater number and diversity of bacteria than previously detected in the rooms .
While a few microorganisms , like those common on human skin , were found at all three sites , the study discovered that each room had a bacterial community largely unique to itself .
Many factors could be responsible for this diversity , the researchers said , including the differing types of air filters and cleaning agents used and the facilities ’ different geographic locations .
“ I was surprised by what we found , ” Dr. Venkateswaran said in an interview , “ and as we continue to sample additional clean rooms , we may be in for even more surprises . ”
Dr. Catharine A. Conley , a biologist who is the acting planetary protection officer at NASA headquarters , said the agency had long suspected that the organisms previously detected in clean rooms did not represent the full range that were there .
Current cleaning techniques kill most common microbes , she said , and the resulting lack of competition could contribute to the number and diversity of the durable survivors found by the genetic testing approach .
“ We know clean rooms can be much cleaner , and some are , ” Dr. Conley said , citing some used by the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries .
“ The problem is the cost .
They are very expensive to build and maintain . ”
Spacecraft going to areas where alien life is more likely to be found , like planets or moons with identifiable water , can be sterilized by a heat method that essentially bakes them for hours .
But , she said , this runs the risk of damaging components .
MIT メディアラボがプロジェクトを推進
子どもたちがOSS活動、プログラミング言語「 Scratch」が開く未来
本当の意味でコンピュータリテラシーがあるというのは、つまりプログラミングができるということだ――。“パーソナル・コンピュータ”という概念の生みの親で、先進的なプログラミング言語「Smalltalk」やGUIというインターフェイスの開発者としても知られるコンピュータ科学者のアラン・ケイ博士は、そう言い切る。コンピュータに囲まれて育ったわれわれの子どもたちは、コンピュータリテラシーを持つ初めての世代になるだろう、と。
ケイ博士の議論は 、 “ リテラシ ー ” という言葉がもともと指していた文字の読み書き能力の歴史を振り返れば説得力を持つ。今では小中学生でもケータイで文字を書き送っているが、文字の歴史のほとんどの期間、非専門家が文字を読み書きする時代が来るとは、誰も想像すらできなかった。文字は、一部の特別な訓練を受けた人々だけが扱いうるものだった。グーテンベルクの活版印刷技術の発明から数えても約500年。先進国で読み書きが一般化したのは最近のことだ。文字にしろコンピュータにしろ、新しいテクノロジを使いこなすには数世代を要する、というのがケイ博士の指摘だ。
いま現在専門家だけが行っているプログラミングも、いずれは誰もが行うようになる。できあいのソフトウェアだけを使っているわれわれ第1世代は、文字でいえば、読むのがやっとという世代に過ぎない。ただし、現在職業的に文章を書く人がいるのと同じで職業プログラマが完全に失業するわけではないだろうという。
ケイ博士は、こうした理念に基づいて、子どもたちにコンピュータリテラシーを教える教育を長年続けている。アップル在籍時代の1995年には教育向けのオブジェクト指向プログラミング言語、「Squeak」（スクイーク）を発表、各地で講演や教育活動を展開している。Squeakは画面上にブロックを並べることでオブジェクトや、オブジェクトに送るメッセージを設定でき、ビジュアルな環境でプログラミングできる。
Squeakの発展 系「 Scratch 」の日本語版が登場
MIT メディアラボのミッチェル・レズニック教授
ケイ博士のライフワークであるコンピュータリテラシー教育の系譜に連なるのが、先進的なコンピュータ研究で知られるMITメディアラボのミッチェル・レズニック（Mitchel Resnick）教授が推進する教育用プログラミング環境「Scratch」（スクラッチ）だ。
1月17日に東京で行われたMITメディアラボの研究成果発表の場に登場したレズニック教授は、現在教育が抱えている大きな問題の1つはカリキュラムや教材が前世紀初頭の古い社会を前提としていることにあると指摘する。現在、経済成長を支えているのは金融革命にしろITやバイオ、ナノテクなど技術分野にしろ、知的なイノベーションだ。しかし学校のカリキュラムは相変わらず知識偏重のままで、知的創造の訓練はない。むしろ、ブロックを組み替え、絵を描き散らして遊んでいる幼稚園児たちこそが、理想的な学習をしているのだという。
レズニック教授はいう 。 「 子どもたちは、まずあれこれと頭で考え、作り、そして遊びます。作ったものを、ほかの子どもたちと共有して、またそこで考える。そうしたサイクルの中で多くのことを学びます。こうしたモデルを物理的な環境だけでなく、仮想環境でも作りたかったのです」。教授がMITで属している研究グループの名前は「ライフロング・キンダーガーテン・グループ」、つまり生涯学習ならぬ、“生涯幼稚園”だ。
MIT メディアラボから世に出た物理的な教育用おもちゃでは、「 MINDSTORM」が挙げられる。センサーやアクチュエータを制御するプログラミングが可能なロボットとしてレゴ社から発売され、商業的にも成功を収めた。「電子的なおもちゃはいくらでもありますが、それらの多くは、あらかじめプログラムされたことしかできず、子どもたちは反応を見て楽しむだけです」。
ぬいぐるみを使ったデモンストレーション
そう話すと教授はおもむろに壇上のテーブルに用意してあった猫のぬいぐるみに歩み寄り、頭に手をかざした。「ニャー」。ぬいぐるみには光センサーが備わっており、一定以上の光量が検出されれば“ニャー”と鳴くとプログラミングしてある。こうしたおもちゃに触れて自分でプログラムすることで、子どもたちは科学技術に対する理解を深めるのだという。ツールを与えられた子どもたちは往々にして大人の想像を超える作品を作るものだという。
多くの電子的おもちゃが非プログラマブルであるのと同様に、PCの世界もゲームにしろウェブにしろ、子どもたちが創造的遊びができるツールは少ない。Scratchは、そうした数少ないツールの1つだという。
Scratchでは、命令は、すべて短冊状のブロックで表現される。この短冊を自由に並べて、「forever 」「 when 」「 if」などのループ・制御構造ブロックで囲むことで処理の流れを表現する。ループに新たに命令を追加すると、いちばん外側のループブロックが自然に大きくなるなど、非常に直感的なインターフェイスだ。例えば、マウスを左右にスライドすることで写真にマウスの移動量に応じたエフェクトをかけるといった処理が行える。
命令群はあらかじめ用意されているものだけでなく、追加開発することでハードウェアの制御も行える。例えばNECはMITメディアラボとの共同研究として、同社の小型ロボット「PaPeRo」向けの命令群を試作。Scratchを用いてPaPeRoを音楽に合わせて踊らせたり、人間の顔がある方や声がする方を振り向かせるなどのデモンストレーションを行っている。
Scratchの画面例。左の命令群から、中央のプログラム処理記述エリアにドラッグ＆ドロップしてプログラムする。色分けされていて、ブロック構造が一目瞭然
日本語対応版も登場。この例では右にある画像に対してアクションやエフェクトを定義している。マウスを移動すると顔写真に回転エフェクトがかかる。「ずっと」は無限ループで、C言語でいうwhile(!0 )に相当する
NECはMITとの共同研究で小型ロボット「 PaPeRo」 をScratchで操作するデモンストレーションを公開
YouTube型サイトでオープンソース的発展
Scratchには 、Scratch版YouTubeともいうべき、プロジェクト共有サイトがある。自分が作成したプログラムを公開して、他の子どもたちと共有する場だ。人気ランキングやコメント欄があるなど、今どきのコミュニティサイトだ。Scratchの画面上には「 Share」ボタンがあり、ワンクリックで自分のプロジェクトをアップロードできる仕組みが用意されている。
驚くのは、このコミュニティの活発さだ。レズニック教授によれば、昨年5月に英語版Scratchをリリースして以来、すでに6000を超えるプロジェクトが登録されているという。中には多くのクローンゲームがあり、テトリスに似たゲームもある。最初は白黒表示の素朴な実装だったものが、どんどんバージョンアップされ、カラー表示やスコア表示に対応したものが登場するなど、子どもたちがオープンソースコミュニティ的な「プログラムの共有と開発」を行っているのだという。
同サイトのユーザーの年齢層は12才にピークがあるものの、幅広い年齢層のユーザーがいるという。レズニック教授は、Scratchを子どもたちのためだけではなく、これまで自分でPCやハードウェアをプログラムする術を持たなかったあらゆる年齢層に対して提供していきたいと話す。
自分が作成したプログラムを公開、共有できるScratchのコミュニティサイト。参加者の年齢でいちばん多いのは12才、登録プロジェクト数は6000を超えるという
テトリスに似たゲームは、複数人によってバージョンアップが行われ、カラー化、スコア表示対応など機能が増えていった（左がオリジナルバージョン、右がカラー化したバージョン）。子どもたちがオープンソースコミュニティに似た活動を行っている
創造的な社会へ向け て
Scratchに限らずプログラミング言語用インターフェイスを用意すれば、エアコンやテレビ、HDDレコーダーといった家電を自由に操作することができる。現在、そうした手段が提供されていないのは技術的制約というよりも、「一般ユーザーにはプログラミングができない」という暗黙の前提があるからに過ぎない。子ども時代にScratchのような環境でプログラミングの概念を学んだ子どもが成長し、ユーザーの大半となれば、HDDレコーダーの足りない機能を自分で実装したいと考える人が増えるかもしれない。そうなればケイ博士がいうように誰もが何らかのプログラミングをする時代がやってくるだろう。レズニック教授はいう。「物理的な世界であろうと仮想的な世界であろうと、ありのままのものを使うだけでなく、次の世代の子どもたちには自分たちを取り巻く世界をコントロールできるようになってほしい。そうすることで、未来の偉大な思想家や開発者が創造的な社会を作っていく下地ができてくるのだと思います」。

Template Haskell : baby steps [ Mar. 4th , 2008 | 11:43 am ] pozorvlak
My post about design patterns and if - statements in Smalltalk yesterday got a very pleasing reaction , garnering some informative comments from knowledgeable people and making the front page of programming .
reddit .
I guess I should have checked my facts on Smalltalk semantics more carefully before clicking " Post " :-)
One comment that particularly interested me was this one ( sadly anonymous ) , which shows a rather cute trick for using Smalltalk - style keyword methods in Haskell : data Then =
Then data Else = Else if ' :: Bool ->
Then -> a -> Else -> a -> a if '
True Then t Else f = t if '
False Then t Else f = f
Now that 's pretty cool , and could even be useful for DSL implementation 1 .
But there 's a problem .
See the repeated code ?
data
Then =
Then data Else = Else
Here , let me show it to you the way it looks to me : data
Then =
Then data Else = Else Literally half the elements that are n't pure syntax on those lines are repeated .
What I 'd like to do is define a keyword function , and then just write keyword Then keyword Else Or , better , keywords Then Else Not a big deal , you might think , but what if you were writing a whole EDSL with many keywords ?
Or many different EDSLs ?
And it 's not just the repetition : by defining a keywords function , I 'd move the code up an abstraction level , making my intent clearer .
We could of course write data Keywords =
Then |
Else but then we lose the benefit of compile - time syntax checking of our EDSL .
Well , I guess our pseudo - keywords are syntactic sugar anyway , so it does n't really matter .
But still .
A few days ago , someone asked me for an example of code that 's repetitive in Haskell but would n't be in Perl , and here 's one .
In Perl , and probably in Python , I could write a keywords function .
It would be ugly , and would involve hairy symbol - table hacking or calls to eval , but the user would n't need to know that and I 'd only need to write it once ( never mind the fact that the " pseudo - keyworded functions " pattern would n't actually make any sense in Perl ... ) .
In Lisp or Ruby , I would n't need to write it at all , because I could use symbols instead .
But perhaps this kind of thing ( and other , more egregious examples ) are just the price we pay for Haskell 's type system , and are more than balanced out by greater opportunities for concision and abstraction elsewhere ?
Nah , bollocks to that .
We can do better .
Template Haskell to the rescue !
I was a bit nervous about trying Template Haskell again : the last time I tried it , I found it utterly impenetrable and poorly - documented , and could n't get even the simplest things to work .
Fortunately , my Haskell - fu seems to have improved in the mean time , because it made a bit more sense this time round - of course gensym - expansion is implemented as a monad :-)
If you 're not already familiar with Lisp macros , you 're probably doomed in any attempt to understand TH .
Go and read On Lisp and come back when you 've done so .
Actually , go and read On Lisp even if you are familiar with Lisp macros , it 's an awesome book .
There are , of course , important differences between Lisp macros and Template Haskell :
Though it comes with GHC , TH is not loaded as standard - you 'll have to call GHC with the - fth flag .
And - fglasgow - exts , but you should probably be using that anyway .
You ca n't use TH with Hugs .
flag .
And , but you should probably be using that anyway .
You ca n't use TH with Hugs .
Unless
I 've horribly misunderstood something , it should n't be possible to write valid macrotic code that does n't expand to valid Haskell .
Guarantee - oriented programming , baby .
It is , however , possible to write valid macrotic code which never terminates , resulting in non-terminating compilations .
There 's no defmacro .
Macro calls do n't look like function calls in Haskell .
To expand a macro call , use the splice notation : $ ( [ macrotic code here ] )
Different things should look different , I guess .
Nice nod to Unix / Perl variable interpolation there , by the way .

There 's an extensive ( not to say baroque ) set of types and constructors for representing Haskell syntax trees - this is rather less simple than representing Lisp code as s-expressions , unfortunately !
There 's a feature called " quasiquotation " , which is written with " Oxford brackets " : expressions are surrounded with [ | and | ] , declarations are surrounded with [ d| and | ] , and types are surrounded with [ t| and | ] .
Quasiquotation seems to work a bit like backquote in Lisp .
You write ordinary Haskell code in the brackets ( possibly with splices ) , and it returns an AST of that code .
Here 's an example from a GHC session : Prelude > :m Language.Haskell.TH Prelude Language.Haskell .TH > runQ [ d| data Fred a =
Fred a a deriving Show |]
Loading package template - haskell ... linking ... done . [ DataD [ ]
Fred [ a_0 ] [ NormalC Fred [ ( NotStrict , VarT a_0 ) , ( NotStrict , VarT a_0 ) ] ] [ GHC .
Show .
Show ] ]
Prelude Language.Haskell.TH > runQ [ | \x -> x + $ ( [ |3 | ] ) |]
LamE [ VarP x_1 ] ( InfixE ( Just ( VarE x_1 ) ) ( VarE GHC. Num .+) ( Just ( LitE ( IntegerL 3 ) ) ) )
Quasiquotation is nice , but it wo n't do everything you need : sometimes you need to construct ASTs by hand and splice them in .
Quasiquoted expressions are protected from variable capture , but hand - constructed ones are n't - consequently , there 's a facility to create gensyms ( uniquely - named variables that are guaranteed not to clash with the names of variables in your calling code ) .
This being Haskell , gensym generation is wrapped in a monad - specifically , the Q monad .
I was going to warn you that Q was a monad but not a functor ( grrr , gnash ) , but that seems to be fixed now .
Hurrah !
Q's also an instance of another typeclass , Quasi , which AFAICT abstracts the idea of " monad in which gensymming is possible " .
The function runQ , used above , " performs " an expression in Q ( ie , a possibly - gensym - containing AST ) in some other Quasi monad ( here , the IO monad ) .
, used above , " performs " an expression in Q ( ie , a possibly - gensym - containing AST ) in some other Quasi monad ( here , the IO monad ) .
There are complicated restrictions on where you can call TH code from : in particular , you can't run a function at compile time ( ie , in a splice ) if it 's defined in the same module .
There 's a feature called " reification " ( which the classically - educated will recognise as the Latin for " thingification " ) , which provides a reflection mechanism .
The reify function takes a Name and returns a data structure ( in the Q monad , natch ) giving you information about what that Name refers to .
This is a bit harder to explore , because you can't reify things in the IO monad ( as I understand things ) and so you can't play around with reification in GHCi .
The documentation 's better than it was , but it 's still pretty skeletal .
There are docs for Language .
Haskell .TH and its submodules in the online GHC library docs , but that 's little more than a list of type signatures .
There 's a bit more in the GHC manual , and a wiki page with some handy tips ( including the runQ trick used above ) .
There are some papers on the topic , including a couple by Ian Lynagh which include some useful examples .
The original paper on Template Haskell is available , which explains the rationale behind some of the design decisions made , but it suffers as documentation from the fact that papers are static and libraries are dynamic , and the interface seems to have changed substantially since it was written !
There 's another document written a year later , and containing some clarifications and changes , but that suffers from the dual problem that not all of it has been implemented yet .
Edit : there are also a couple of tutorials , here and here .
The first one 's quite good , but I have n't read the second one in detail yet .
For now , the best way of finding your way around the interface seems to be looking at the type signatures and the runQ trick , with a heavy dose of guesswork .
If I 've missed any docs , please let me know !
OK , on with the motley .
By the way , experts will probably find the next section a bit slow going : I 've skipped a lot of dead ends and mistakes that I made , but I 've left in useful steps which will probably seem hopelessly basic to you , in the hopes that other beginners like me might find them useful .
If an explanation of something is in there , it 's because I found it hard or confusing , so probably someone else will too .
Recall that we were trying to programmatically produce declarations of the form data Fred = Fred .
Let 's try it with quasiquoting .
Because of the restrictions on calling TH code , we 'll have to put it in its own module , so let 's put the following in Keyword .hs so the compiler can find it : module Keyword ( keyword ) where import Language .
Haskell .TH.Syntax keyword name = [ d| data $ ( name ) = $ ( name ) |]
Now compile : Prelude > :l Keyword.hs [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Keyword ( Keyword.hs , interpreted ) Keyword.hs :6:24 : parse error on input `$ (' Nope .
Looks like we 'll have to construct it by hand , then .
We want to construct a declaration , which is presumably something of type Dec , and the relevant constructor looks to be DataD , whose type signature is DataD Cxt Name [ Name ] [ Con ] [ Name ] .
Um .
The hell ?
Cxt is a synonym for [ Type ] , and that first Name is presumably the name of the type we want to construct .
Time for the runQ trick .
From the first example above , it looks like the first [ Name ] parameter expects a list of the parameters to the type : in this case , that should be empty .
Con is apparently the type representing constructors , and comes in four flavours : NormalC , RecC , InfixC and ForallC.
NormalC , I reckon , which takes a Name and a list of StrictTypes : the name of the constructor and whether or not it 's strict in each of its arguments ?
That fits with our results from the runQ test , anyway .
For this hack , we wo n't have any arguments to our constructors , so it does n't really matter .
The final argument , a list of Names , seems to be the list of typeclasses derived in the declaration : we 're undoubtedly going to need Show for debugging , and we might as well have Eq to save ourselves a bit of hassle .
Now we just need a way of constructing Names : I 'd come up with Name ( mkOccName name ) NameS before I noticed mkName :: String ->
Name .
So our resulting code is : {-# OPTIONS_GHC - fglasgow - exts - fth #-} module Keyword ( keyword ) where import Language .
Haskell .TH.Syntax -- keyword name = [ d| data $ ( name ) = $ ( name ) | ] -- DataD Cxt Name [ Name ] [ Con ] [ Name ] -- data Con = NormalC Name [ StrictType ] | ... keyword name = DataD [ ] name ' [ ]
[ NormalC name ' [ ] ] ( map mkName [ " Show " , " Eq " ] ) where name ' = mkName name Slap the following into Main.hs : {-# OPTIONS_GHC - fglasgow - exts - fth #-} import Keyword $ ( keyword " Fred " ) main = print Fred And ... Main.hs : 4:2 : Could n't match expected type ` Language .
Haskell .TH.Syntax .Q [ Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Dec ] ' against inferred type ` Language .Haskell.TH.Syntax.Dec '
Failed , modules loaded : Keyword .
Arse .
But at least Keyword .hs loaded OK .
Let 's try out the types of things with GHCi : * Keyword > :t keyword keyword :: String ->
Dec
So keyword takes a String and returns a Dec , as expected , but it seems that $ ( ) actually wants a Q [ Dec ] .
Apparently , [ | ... | ] returns an Expr ( * tests * - no it does n't , it returns a ( Quasi m ) => m Exp - there 's no type called Expr in the TH libraries that I can see ) , but [ d | ... | ] returns a ( Quasi m ) => m [ Dec ] , ie a list of declarations , with the whole list lifted into a Quasi monad .
Weird .
Still , easily fixed : we just surround the call to keyword with square brackets to make it a list , and call return on it to lift it into the monad .
Main.hs now becomes {-# OPTIONS_GHC - fglasgow - exts - fth #-} import Keyword $ ( return [ keyword " Fred " ] ) main = print Fred And now ... * Keyword > :l Main.hs [ 1 of 2 ]
Compiling Keyword ( Keyword.hs , interpreted ) [ 2 of 2 ]
Compiling Main ( Main.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : Keyword , Main .
* Main > main Fred Success !
But that $ ( return [ keyword " Fred " ] ) is a bit ugly .
Since we 're forced to define a list of declarations , we might as well forget about keyword , and call keywords directly .
In Keyword.hs : keywords names = return $ map keyword names and in Main .
hs : $ ( keywords $ words " Fred Barney Betty " ] )
Great - we 've now defined three keywords ( Fred , Barney and Betty ) using only a single line of code in the calling module , with no repetition of data .
But there 's one more niggle : those capitalised keywords are a bit retro .
How about we define lowercase functions fred , barney and betty which return Fred , Barney and Betty , then use the lowercase versions as keywords when writing in our EDSL ?
( Um , obviously some kind of DSL for describing familial relations in the Paleolithic town of Bedrock .
Bear with me ) .
We 'll need to lowercase the first letter : there 's undoubtedly a standard function for this , but my Hoogle - fu is too weak to find it , so we 'll have to write our own .
Easy enough .
import Char -- put this at the top of the file lower First " " = " " lower First ( x:xs ) = ( toLower x ) : xs
It looks like there 's no way of combining expressions and declarations into a single splice : fortunately , we want to define functions , and function definition is a declaration .
So we can write a function to define our lowercase constructor functions , and extend keywords to call it .
lcCons name = ValD ( VarP lcName ) ( NormalB ( ConE ( mkName name ) ) ) [ ] where lcName = mkName $ lower
First name keywords names = return ( map keyword names ++ map lcCons names )
And in Main.hs : $ ( keywords $ words " Fred Barney Betty " ) main = do print Fred print betty Let 's try compiling it .
* Keyword > :l Main.hs [ 1 of 2 ]
Compiling Keyword ( Keyword.hs , interpreted ) [ 2 of 2 ]
Compiling Main ( Main.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : Keyword , Main .
* Main > main Fred Betty Epic win .
Note that these lowercase pseudo - keywords could conflict with the existing keywords of Haskell : perhaps it would be better to have two keywords functions , one which generated the lowercase versions and one which did n't .
The final version of Main.hs is here , and the final version of Keyword .hs is here .
Not entirely straightforward , but we pretty much got there in the end .
Would it be worth posting these code samples to the TH wiki , and perhaps linking here ?
Anyway , it 's nice to have finally got this simple stuff to work : hopefully I 'll be able to get some more difficult things to work soon , and this should reduce the amount of frustration and needlessly duplicated code in my Haskell programming experience .
1 Did you know you can do this in ( plain ) TeX , too ?
\ def\fred # 1 barney # 2 betty { #1#2} \fred Hello there , barney Wilma betty !

Worlds first high performance Dirac video codec implementation available
San Francisco , USA , 6th of March 2008 : Today , the Schrödinger project has announced that it has made available the world 's first high performance implementation of Dirac .
Dirac is a royalty - free video codec created by BBC Research & Innovation and is the first mainstream codec using next generation wavelet technology .
The final specification of Dirac became available on 21st of January 2008 and now the Schrödinger project is proud to announce an implementation of that specification .
Schrödinger core is implemented in ANSI C with further assembly level optimisations privided through the liboil optimisation library .
The Schrödinger decoding and encoding components offer a stable ABI for developers which will enable easy integration of Dirac support for application and media framework developers .
The Schrödinger project also includes a set of GStreamer plugins as an example of how to use the Schrödinger library in a modern multimedia framework .
The release of the Schrodinger library will significantly reduce the the time required to include Dirac support in multimedia applications , therefore reducing the barrier to adoption substantially .
Thanks to collaboration with the Xiph.org foundation there is an official mapping for putting Dirac video into the Ogg container format underway , and the Schrödinger project also hosts a proposal for mapping Dirac into the popular MPEG - TS container format , which is currently being considered for certification by the MPEG working group .
We expect to see and provide mappings for a lot more container formats in due course .
With the release of the 1.0 version of Schrödinger we already provide top notch support for GStreamer .
GStreamer ( http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) is a cross-platform , open source multimedia framework that serves a host of multimedia applications , such as video editors , streaming media broadcasters , video conferencing and media players .
It is an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment as well as being used in a number of embedded devices such as the Nokia series of Internet Tablets , as well as being available on the Windows , Solaris and Mac OS X platforms .
" The release of Schrödinger 1.0 opens up many opportunities for applications requiring compressed video .
Dirac represents a great innovation in the design of video codecs , combining proven tools in unique and powerful ways and providing a high - quality royalty - free solution for the entire range of video compression .
Schroedinger delivers this to the use . " says David Schleef , leader of the Schrödinger project .
" At Novell we are excited about the availability of the Dirac video codec and plan to incorporate it into SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop , " commented Aaron Bockover , Lead Multimedia Engineer at Novell .
" As the adoption of our Novell desktop solutions are gaining traction in the marketplace and the importance of applications like our popular Banshee multimedia application grows , having access to bleeding edge open technologies like Dirac is essential .
Promoting openness and freedom in the marketplace is critical , and we commend the Schrödinger project on this release "
" We see a powerful open source ally in the BBC .
The recent completion of the Dirac specification and this week 's release of Scroedinger are solid steps forward for media in the Free world .
Congratulations all and we can't wait to see what comes next ! " " commented Monty Montgomery , creator of Ogg Vorbis and Xiph.org . "
" We want to congratulate the Schrodinger project on this first release , as a company specializing in the field of multimedia we are very happy to see such a high quality codec become available . " says Christian Schaller , Collabora Multimedia .
" The Dirac codec levels the playing field in the area of multimedia and have every opportunity to see rapid adoption . "
The Dirac codec was named in honour of famous theoretical physicist Paul Dirac .
The Schrodinger project ’s name pays homage to physicist Erwin Schrödinger who won the Nobel prize together with Paul Dirac in 1933 .
Companies and organisations looking who needs assistance with incorporating Dirac support into their systems and applications can contact David Schleef through his consultancy company Big Kitten LLC .

I 'm pretty sure 95 percent of the tabloid -y magazines this week ( and last week , and the week before , and next week ) are all about Britney Spears .
Does she have mental health issues ?
Did she get a restraining order against her paparazzo boyfriend ?
When was the last time she saw her kids ?
How many Rite Aids has she visited this week ?
And although Lindsay has been lying low ( for Lindsay ) , there 's still talk of whether or not she 's really sober and who she 's dating now and how bad her last movie was .
Then there 's dear Paris .
Making out with Jared Leto at Sundance .
Sigh .
There goes the very last bit of my teenage crush on Jordan Catalano .
These girls are far from the first to be scandalized in the tabloids , though .
Let 's take a look back at nine Hollywood scandals before Paris was a glimmer in her daddy 's eye .
In fact , before her dad Rick Hilton was a glimmer in HIS daddy 's eye " ¦ and some stories before Barron Hilton was a glimmer in Conrad Hilton 's eye .
OK , I 'll stop .
1. 1901 " “ Evelyn Nesbit
At the turn of the century , Evelyn Nesbit was one of the most sought - after models in New York and became one of the famous Gibson Girls .
Her modeling career turned to acting when she starred as one of the Floradora chorus girls at the age of 16 .
That 's where 47 - year - old married architect Stanford White started wooing her .
It 's said that he is the one who , uh , deflowered her .
He then moved on to younger , more virginal girls while Evelyn got pregnant " “ twice " “ by John Barrymore ( Drew 's grandpa ) .
Although Stanford
White was n't romantically involved with Evelyn at the time , they were still quite emotionally attached and he paid for her to go away and be treated for " appendicitis " .
It 's disputed as to whether she actually had the baby or had an abortion .
She married a jealous , terribly abusive man , Harry K . Thaw , at the age of 20 .
In 1906 , the couple ran into Evelyn's old lover , Stanford , at the rooftop theater of Madison Square Garden where Thaw shot Stanford point - blank in the face three times , yelling either " You will never see this woman again ! " or " You ruined my life ! " or " You ruined my wife ! "
There seems to be controversy over his actual words .
Evelyn was presented with a deal : if she testified that Thaw was only avenging her virtue because
White had raped her , Evelyn would receive a divorce settlement of $ 1 million .
She did , but was denied the money .
She tried to commit suicide several times over the course of the rest of her life , but ended up dying in a nursing home at the age of 82 in Santa Monica .
2. 1924 - Thomas Ince and William Randolph Hearst
Obviously Mr. Hearst is not without his share of scandal .
But murder ?
Maybe .
Actor , director , producer and screenwriter Ince was celebrating his 42nd birthday on Hearst 's yacht when he died .
The official reason is that he ate too much and drank too much and simply had a heart attack .
The rumor , though , is that Hearst shot him because either Ince was making a movie on Hearst 's mistress , Marion Davies , or Charlie Chaplin was and Hearst confused Ince for Chaplin on the dark boat .
I guess only a couple of people really know for sure .
His granddaughter Patty Hearst wrote her vision of how it happened in the novel Murder at San Simeon , but makes sure to let the reader know that she has no idea what really happened .
3. 1926 " “ Rudolph Valentino
If we think it 's hard for a public figure to be openly gay these days , imagine what an uproar even mere rumors would have caused in 1926 .
Valentino 's first wife , Jean Acker , was a lesbian who admitted she only married him to save her career .
He was n't aware of her sexual orientation until she locked him out of their hotel room on their wedding night and fled to her girlfriend 's house .
There were lots of rumors that his second wife also preferred women and that he was a homosexual who kept marrying lesbians so he did n't have to consummate any marriages ( neither rumor was true ) .
It was suggested that he had relationships with at least five other actors .
Journalists were constantly saying he was effeminate based on his style of clothing and hair .
He took great offense to this and even challenged a reporter when he noted that a vending machine in a men's bathroom in Chicago was dispensing feminine pink talcum powder and blamed it on Valentino 's influence .
Valentino challenged him to a boxing match ( the journalist declined ) .
Supposedly when he was suffering from a perforated ulcer on his deathbed in 1926 , Valentino asked the doctor if he thought he was a Powder Puff .
The doctor is said to have replied , " No , sir , you 've been very brave . "
4. 1927 " “ Marion Parker / Edward Hickman
William Edward Hickman terrorized L.A. in 1927 and 1928 when he kidnapped the daughter of a prominent local banker , Perry Parker .
His method was scarily simple : he waltzed into the 12 - year - old 's junior high school and told the administrator that Perry was ill and wanted to see his daughter .
The administrator probably should have realized something was up when Hickman a ) did n't know that Parker had twin daughters and b ) did n't know the names of either of them .
Nevertheless , the administrator handed over Marion for some reason .
Hickman demanded $ 1,500 in ransom money , which he promptly received .
Instead of sending Marion home safe and sound , though , he returned her minus her arms and legs and internal organs .
Police caught him a week later and Hickman was executed in October , 1928 .
5. 1932 - Peg Entwistle
Peg Entwistle was an actress whose career was n't going so hot .
In fact , her life really was n't going so hot .
Her widowed father was killed in a traffic accident shortly after the two of them immigrated to America from Wales .
His accident left her completely broke so she earned money by working on Broadway .
Unfortunately , the Great Depression hit and people could no longer afford to spend money on extras like the theater .
Peg started drinking heavily and headed to L.A. to pursue acting in April 1932 .
She received a role in the movie Thirteen Women , but her screen time ended up getting drastically cut .
Right around this time , RKO Pictures decided not to renew her contract and did n't even invite her to the September premiere of Thirteen Women .
The night of the premiere , she told her uncle ( whom she was living with ) she was taking a walk .
She headed for the famous 50 - foot Hollywood sign ( which still said Hollywoodland at the time ) , folded her coat , placed it on the ground next to her purse , climbed the maintenance ladder of the " H " and jumped .
Her body was found two days later ; sadly , her uncle said that the day she was found , a letter arrived offering her the lead role in a stage production .
Her character would have committed suicide in the final act .
6. 1934 " “ Mary Astor
Mary Astor might be one of the first child stars to be taken advantage of by her parents .
When she was only 14 , she started making movies with some big name people , including John Barrymore , and earned $ 500 a week .
She moved from Paramount to Warner Brothers to Fox , who increased her salary to $ 3,750 a week .
Her parents bought a mansion in the Hollywood Hills and lived the good life on Mary 's money .
She escaped her parents when she married Kenneth Hawks in 1928 , but the happiness would n't last long : he was in a fatal plane crash in 1930 , just about the time her movie career started going under because her voice did n't translate well to " talkies " .
She had a nervous breakdown and ended up marrying the doctor who attended to her .
By 1933 , she was pretty broke and had to get the Motion Picture Relief Fund to pay her bills .
Her parents did n't have much sympathy " “ they sued her in 1934 for more financial support .
She testified that all of her money had gone directly to their bank accounts even after her first marriage .
It was n't until Hawks died that Mary decided she needed to look out for herself .
She did , however , give them the home that they had purchased with her earnings .
She also gave them $ 1,000 per month .
When she hit hard times in ' 33 , she told her parents she could n't afford to support them unless they moved to a smaller house " “ the house they lived in was bigger and more expensive than the one Mary lived in with her family .
She also offered them $ 100 a month , plus food and utilities , but they refused to leave the mansion .
Mary said in her memoirs that in 1947 she sat with her delirious mother on her deathbed in the hospital .
Because of dementia , her mother spent hours complaining to Mary about her selfish , horrible daughter Lucile ( Mary 's real name ) .
Mary read her mother 's diaries after she died and said she was surprised to know how much her own mother hated her .
7. 1935 " “ Loretta Young
Everybody knows about Gable and Lombard , but Gable and Young ?
Yup .
Loretta Young and Clark Gable had an affair in 1935 while they were filming Call of the Wild , despite the fact that Gable was married to Texas socialite Ria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham ( say that 10 times fast ) .
Loretta disappeared to Europe to have the baby quietly ; nineteen months later she showed back up and said she had adopted a daughter , Judy .
When the baby got older , it was very clear that she looked exactly like Loretta Young with Clark Gable 's ears .
It was n't until 1958 that Judy confronted her mother , who , after throwing up , admitted that Judy was Clark Gable 's daughter .
Prior to Gable , Loretta had an affair with Spencer Tracy .
8. 1943 " “ Frances Farmer
Poor Frances Farmer was in and out of mental hospitals so often , she 's like the original Girl , Interrupted .
In 1936 , after only a year with Paramount , she had top billing in two B- movies , had married actor Leif Erickson and was cast in her first A - list movie opposite Bing Crosby .
She began to get frustrated that she was n't being cast in challenging roles , only " pretty girl " roles .
By 1939 she was becoming known for her erratic behavior and excessive drinking .
She and Erickson divorced in 1942 ( he remarried the same day ) .
She was arrested a few months later for driving with her headlights on in a war - time blackout zone .
Police suspected she was drunk and put her in jail overnight .
The following year , Frances was arrested at the Knickerbocker Hotel when her hairdresser said that Frances had dislocated her jaw in a fit of rage on set .
At her trial , she shoved a policeman down , hit another and threw an inkwell at the judge .
She was transferred to the psychiatric ward at L.A. General Hospital where she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia .
She was given shock therapy but escaped the hospital within nine months .
Eventually Frances was handed over to her mother 's custody , but that did n't work out so well - she assaulted her mother , who had her committed to Western State Hospital in Washington .
It was there that she received electro - convulsive shock treatment .
A few months later , in 1944 , it was announced that she was totally cured .
The talk of the town was that the " cure " was a lobotomy , but that has been denied by multiple sources .
Apparently the cure was n't permanent , because she was found wandering around Antioch , Calif. , Anne Heche - style , and was recommitted to Western State Hospital for another five years .
She did return to showbiz for several years but by 1964 she was having extreme mood swings again .
She died in 1970 of esophageal cancer .
9. 1953 " “ Gene Tierney
Former New York debutante Gene Tierney became incredibly successful on Broadway by the age of 20 .
She soon found herself in roles opposite Rory Calhoun , Rex Harrison , Tyrone Power , Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart .
It was Bogart who discovered how deep Gene 's mental problems ran while they were filming The Left Hand of God in 1953 .
He encouraged her to seek help , so when the movie wrapped she was admitted to Harkness Pavilion in New York and then the Institute of Living in Hartford , Conn. , where she received 27 shock treatments .
It was too much for her and she tried to escape the asylum , but she was caught and reinstitutionalized .
She tried to commit suicide in 1957 by jumping off of a ledge but was stopped just in time .
It was thought that her bipolar disorder was triggered when she gave birth to her first daughter , who was born deaf , partially blind and had some mental handicaps .
Tierney 's close friend Howard Hughes saw to it that her daughter received the best care possible .
Although she never admitted to an affair with Howard Hughes , she did have affairs with John F. Kennedy and Tyrone Power while separated from her husband , Oleg Cassini ( one of Jacqueline Kennedy 's favorite designers ) .
The Mississippi exits
The results of Mississippi's primary today show a sharp divide along racial lines , with overwhelming African - American support for Barack Obama , and a solid , though less sweeping , white majority for Hillary Clinton .
Though it may be tempting to link those results to the current , racially - charged moment of the primary , a more straightforward explanation is regional :
That polarization has been consistent across the Deep South , though only Alabama has had results this starkly divided .
Voters rated the economy the top issue .
Obama won the support of 91 % of African American voters -- who made up a far smaller share , 48 % , than they did in the 2004 primary , when well over half of the voters were black .
Clinton , meanwhile , won 72 % of the state 's white vote , which represented a slightly larger share of the overall Democratic electorate .
Those numbers come from early exit poll numbers are subject to minor revision .
Clinton won more narrowly -- by six percentage points -- among white independents , who made up 14 % fo the total electorate , according to the exit polls .
Reversing a trend common in the north , Clinton was dominant among the Republicans who made up 11 % of the voters in this primary .
In fact , Republicans were here strongest single group , giving her 85 % of their votes .
Elsewhere , Republicans and independents have flocked to Obama 's side .
Reversing another much - commented on trend visible in the March 4 primaries , a majority of voters who cited race as an important -- or the important -- factor in making their decisions sided with Obama .
Obama 's delegate margin is n't yet clear , and keep an eye on Politico.com for the returns .
MAPUTO ( Reuters ) -
The head of the Catholic church in Mozambique said on Wednesday he believed some European - made condoms were deliberately tainted with the HIV / AIDS virus to kill African people .
“ I know of two countries in Europe who are making condoms with ( the ) virus on purpose , they want to finish with African people as part of their program to colonize the continent , ” Archbishop Francisco Chimoio told Reuters .
“ If we are not careful we will finish in one century .
“ I also know some companies who are manufacturing anti-retroviral drugs already infected with the virus , also in order to finish quickly the African people ” , Chimoio said .
He declined to name the European countries in question or the source of his allegations .
The Catholic Church , followed by 17 percent of Mozambique ’s population , opposes the use of condoms .
“ People must choose what they want between death and I propose to them that ( abstinence ) is the best way to fight HIV / AIDS , ” Chimoio said .
More than 16 percent of Mozambique ’s 19 million people , mostly economically active adults aged between 14 and 49 , are infected with HIV / AIDS .
About 500 infections are recorded every day , according to the health department .
Diogo Milagre , deputy executive chairman of Mozambique ’s National Council for the Fight Against AIDS , said the government ’s efforts to combat the scourge were hampered by a struggling health infrastructure and staff shortages .
“ Now over 50 percent of Mozambique ’s hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients while infections are sky - rocketing ( but ) we have n’t lost the battle yet as we are now changing our approach , ” he said , declining to comment on Chimoio ’s charges .
“ We need to study this phenomenon very carefully particularly cultural aspects with we believe are fuelling infections on several fronts at once , ” Milagre said .
The United States has failed to uphold its international obligations to protect the human rights of migrants , subjecting too many to prolonged detention in substandard facilities while depriving them of an adequate appeals process and labor protections , a United Nations investigator said Friday .
In the international body ’s first scrutiny of U.S. treatment of its 37.5 million noncitizen migrants , U.N. investigator Jorge Bustamante took particular aim at what he criticized as the “ overuse ” of detention for immigrants .
Noting that the annual detainee population has tripled in nine years to 230,000 , he called on the United States to eliminate mandatory detention for certain migrants and instead expand the use of alternatives , such as electronic ankle bracelets .
Bustamante , who visited Los Angeles last year during a three - week fact - finding mission , also urged that migrants be given the right to legal counsel , more impartial hearings and improved holding facilities , particularly for women and children .
“ The United States lacks a clear , consistent , long - term strategy to improve respect for the human rights of migrants , ” said his report , which was presented Friday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva .
Bustamante serves as the body ’s special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants .

In a statement to the council , the U.S. delegation called the report disappointing .
The report “ focuses only on a narrow slice of the migrant population in the United States and makes no effort to recognize notable , positive aspects of U.S. migration policy , ” the statement said .
“ This results in an incomplete and biased picture of the human rights of migrants . ”
The delegation said the United States had one of the world ’s most generous immigration policies and offered more than 11 million migrants green cards , citizenship , asylum , refugee resettlement and temporary protected status between 2000 and 2006 .
The United Nations estimates that global migrants number 200 million , with the United States by far the largest haven , with 35 million as of 2000 .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Kelly Nantel also criticized Bustamante , saying he did not adequately consider the voluminous information provided him by U.S. officials documenting migrant protections in place here .

Those include the right to seek administrative review of detention and deportation decisions , along with access to federal courts to challenge removal orders .
Bustamante “ has made a number of inaccurate or misleading claims and has drawn sweeping conclusions that appear to be based on anecdotal evidence from a small sample of individuals , for which he fails to provide appropriate evidence and reasoning , ” Nantel said .
At the U.S. government ’s invitation , Bustamante visited seven cities last year to interview dozens of migrants , community activists , immigration attorneys and senior government officials .
He toured the U.S. - Mexican border and visited a federal detention center in Arizona , but he was denied access to other facilities in Texas and New Jersey .
In his two - day visit to Los Angeles in May , Bustamante said he was concerned about “ rising anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States ” and took testimony about worker abuse , government raids , family separations and other issues .
In his report , he wrote that xenophobia and racism toward migrants had worsened since the Sept. 11 attacks , with a particularly devastating effect on children , Afro-Caribbean migrants , and those perceived to be Muslim or ethnic South Asians and Middle Easterners .

But the report said that two federal laws passed in 1996 accounted for the biggest changes toward a stricter approach in U.S. immigration policy .
Among other things , the laws increased the number of people subject to mandatory , prolonged and indefinite detention , including those who commit an expanded list of crimes such as minor drug offenses , the report said .
The laws also reduced avenues of appeal and limited judges ’ discretion to grant migrants the right to remain in the United States .
The growing reliance on detention tears families apart and costs U.S. taxpayers $ 1.2 billion a year , the report said .
In contrast , alternatives such as electronic monitoring are far cheaper -- about 20 % of the cost of detention , according to a 2006 congressional report .
Human rights activists hailed the report as an important and independent voice that brings public attention to problems faced by migrants .
“ The U.S. touts the importance of human rights abroad , but rhetoric does n’t match the reality at home , ” said Chandra Bhatnagar of the American Civil Liberties Union in New York .
“ All we are asking is to bring human rights home . ”

But he does not view the experience as a culture clash .
Rather , he said , it reflected mean and stingy treatment by his host family , whose broken English made it difficult to communicate .
" The weight loss concerned me , but I wanted to stick out the whole year , " he said in an interview at his family 's home outside Augusta .
Friends and teachers at his English - speaking school in Egypt urged him to change his host family , but he stayed put after being told the other home was in a dangerous neighbourhood of Alexandria .
After returning to the US , he was hospitalised for nearly two weeks .
The 17 - year - old has regained about 9kg , but his parents say he's not the same boy he was when he left under the auspices of AFS Intercultural Programs .
" He was outgoing , a straight - A student , very athletic .
Now , he 's less spontaneous and more subdued , " said his mother , Elizabeth McCullum , who was shocked when she met her son at the airport on January 9 and saw he had lost one - third his weight .
Jonathan McCullum 's parents said the exchange program should have warned them that students placed with Coptic families would be subject to dietary restrictions .
Marlene Baker , communications director at AFS headquarters in New York , declined to discuss McCullum 's experience .
She referred calls to the program 's lawyer in Portland , Patricia Peard , who said she could not comment on McCullum 's case because of the potential for a lawsuit .
McCullum said his host family gave him only meager amounts of food , and his condition worsened during the last seven weeks , when the family observed a fast limiting the amount of animal protein he was given .
The host family was a couple with two younger boys and a daughter who was in the U.S. on an AFS exchange .
McCullum said the parents gave him the smallest food portions , hid treats in their bedroom and complained that the cost of his upkeep was more than they spent for their daughter when she was home .
The host father , Shaker Hanna , rejected McCullum 's story as " a lie , " suggesting that he made it up because his parents were hoping to recover some of the money they paid for his stay as compensation .
" The truth is , the boy we hosted for nearly six months was eating for an hour and a half at every meal .
The amount of food he ate at each meal was equal to six people , " Hanna said .
He added that the boy was active , constantly exercising and playing sports .
Hanna , an engineer , said his family went out of its way to prepare special foods , including fish and chicken , for McCullum during the fast periods .
McCullum disputes that .
The family served meat early in his stay , he said , but that ended during the fast period .
He said he never got breakfast and his first food of the day usually was a small piece of bread with cucumbers and cheese that he would take to school for lunch .
There was a late - afternoon dinner consisting of beans , vegetables and sometimes fish , and a snack of bread later in the evening .
McCullum sometimes bought food , but at one point was reduced to stealing it from a supermarket .
He was caught , but the store accepted the small amount of money he had and let him go .
Still , McCullum did not complain to his parents .
His father suspects he may have fallen victim to Stockholm syndrome , in which people start to feel a sense of loyalty to those who victimize them .
McCullum 's parents first sensed that something was amiss shortly before Christmas , when they got emails from their son and one of his teachers about seeking a new host family .
They also saw a picture of him on Facebook indicating he had lost a lot of weight .
In early January , the teacher sent another e-mail saying McCullum was " in bad shape " and " really , really NEEDS to go home . "
The McCullums said AFS provided false assurances that he had seen a doctor and was in excellent health .
AFS , a nonprofit formerly known as American Field Service , is one of the largest and oldest organizers of student exchanges .
Since its founding as an ambulance corps during World War I , the agency has arranged exchanges for 325,000 American and foreign students from more than 50 countries .
The McCullums said AFS discourages parents from telephoning or e-mailing their kids abroad , believing the distraction would run counter to the program 's goal of immersing them in local culture .
" They told us to have as little contact as possible , and we bought into it , " Elizabeth McCullum said .
She said she had confidence in AFS , regarding it as " the gold standard " of exchange programs , but now is aware that things can go terribly wrong .
The Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students , a nonprofit advocacy group , said the exchange programs are rampant with instances of abuse and neglect .
" This is not an isolated incident .
I 'm aghast but I 'm not shocked , " the committee 's director , Danielle Grijalva of Oceanside , Calif. , said after hearing McCullum 's story .
The McCullums are considering a lawsuit .
David McCullum expressed concern about the long - term physical and psychological effects on his son .
" Someone needs to be held accountable , and I would like someone to say , ' I 'm sorry . ' "
Jonathan McCullum is recovering and recently went snowboarding with friends .
He plans to return to school in the fall , rejoin the soccer team and eventually study to be a doctor .
Despite the ordeal , he has not soured on foreign travel :
He wants to visit Zimbabwe this summer as part of a volunteer program to build homes and trails .

At the time , many people complained of being ill
From the BBC Archive : Impact triggers panic
That is the conclusion of scientists who have been examining samples of the space rock and the 15 m - wide crater it dug out in Carancas last September .
The discovery of a water - filled hole , following reports of a fireball in the sky , made headlines around the world .
Now experts say the event challenges conventional theories about meteorites .
This has nothing to do with the mass panic that famously followed the impact ; rather it has to do with the science of space impacts .
Usually , only meteorites made of metal survive the passage through Earth 's atmosphere sufficiently intact to scoop out a crater .
But the object which came down in the Puno region of Peru was a relatively fragile stony meteorite .
During the fiery descent through Earth 's atmosphere , these are thought to fragment into smaller pieces which then scatter over a wide area .
Yet pieces of the estimated 1 m - wide meteorite are thought to have stayed together during entry , hitting the ground as one .
Details of the work were unveiled at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
Surprising speed
Peter Schultz told the conference that the meteorite was travelling at about 24,000 km/h ( 15,000 mph ) at the moment of impact - much faster than would be expected .
" This just is n't what we expected , " said Professor Schultz , from Brown University in Providence , US .
" It was to the point that many thought this was fake .
It was completely inconsistent with our understanding of how stony meteorites act . "
Typically , fragments shoot off in many directions as the meteorite hurtles towards the ground - the so - called " pancake " model of atmospheric descent .
Professor Schultz believes fragments from the Carancas meteorite , which crashed to Earth on 15 September last year , may have stayed within the speeding fireball until they struck the ground .
This might have been due to the meteorite 's high speed .
At the velocity it was travelling , fragments could not escape the " shock - wave " barrier which accompanies the meteorite 's passage through the atmosphere .
Instead , the fragments may have reconstituted themselves into another shape , which made them more aerodynamic .
Consequently , they encountered less friction during their plunge to Earth , holding together until they reached the ground .
" Although [ the meteorite ] is quickly broken up , it is behaving like a solid mass , " Professor Schultz told the conference .
Dr Thomas Kenkmann , from Humboldt University in Berlin , Germany , offered an alternative view of the Carancas impact .
His modelling of the event suggests it was probably caused by a meteorite travelling at low speed and a slanting angle .
Under this scenario , the space rock would have broken into just a few pieces rather than many - the largest of which would have gouged the crater .
Some scientists , however , remain doubtful of either interpretation .
After his conference talk , Dr Kenkmann was pressed by one scientist on whether a magnetic survey of the crater had been carried out to look for signs of an iron , rather than a stony , projectile .
Fact and fiction
The crater is located on a dry riverbed near Lake Titicaca , on the border with Bolivia .
The 3 m - deep depression filled with water from below ground in the first 15 - 30 minutes after the impact .
At the time , scores of local people who visited the crater complained of headaches , vomiting and nausea .
Some commentators had speculated that a chemical reaction might have released toxins such as sulphur and arsenic .
But mass hysteria is thought to be the most likely explanation .
Professor Schultz said he hoped his work would " distinguish fact from fiction " .
He commented : " Reports about arsenic , bubbling [ of water in the crater ] and sickness were probably overblown .
People were frightened , but some were also afraid they were under attack from a nearby country . "
Eyewitnesses reported a cloud of dust travelling outwards from the impact site after the meteorite fell .
Reports of numerous livestock deaths are believed to have been exaggerated , though the researchers confirm that a bull 's horn was ripped off in the impact .
Professor Schultz added that the Carancas event raised the possibility there were many other small craters caused by stony meteorites which go unrecognised .
Large buried iron meteorites are easier to detect , while pieces of stony meteorite become intimately mixed with terrestrial soil .
" Maybe there are more of these things and we just do n't recognise them because they 're rock .
When these things get pounded into cement , you wo n't see them , " Professor Schultz explained .

The two craters at the bottom of the frame are located in Mercury 's giant Caloris Basin , a thousand mile wide depression formed billions of years ago when Mercury collided with a comet or asteroid .
For scale , the larger of the two is about 40 miles wide .
Both craters have dark rims or " halos " and the one on the left is partially filled with an unknown shiny material .
Craters come in all shapes and sizes , some more bizarre than others .
Recent photos of Mercury have revealed two new categories of crater that scientists are puzzling over how to explain .
When NASA 's MESSENGER spacecraft flew by the planet Jan. 14 it snapped pictures of several craters with strange dark halos and one crater with a spectacularly shiny bottom .
" The halos are really exceptional , " said MESSENGER science team member Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado .
" We 've never seen anything like them on Mercury before and their formation is a mystery . "
Two of the craters are located in Mercury 's giant Caloris Basin , a thousand - mile - wide depression formed billions of years ago when Mercury was struck by a comet or asteroid .
The larger of the two is about 40 miles wide .
Both craters have dark rims or " halos , " and one is partially filled with an unknown shiny material .
Chapman offered two possible explanations for the halos :
1. The Layer Cake Theory :
There could be a layer of dark material under the surface of Caloris Basin , resulting in chocolate - colored rims around craters that penetrate to just the right depth .
If such a subterranean layer exists , however , it can not be unique to the Basin .
" We 've found a number of dark halos outside of Caloris as well . "
2. The Impact Glass Model : Thermal energy from the impacts melted some of Mercury 's rocky surface .
Perhaps molten rock splashed to the edge of the craters where it re-solidified as a dark , glassy substance .
Similar " impact melts " are found around craters on Earth and the moon .
If this hypothesis is correct , future astronauts on Mercury exploring the crater rims would find themselves crunching across fields of tiny glass shards .
Chapman noted that the moon also has some dark haloed craters .
" Tycho is a well - known example , " he said .
But lunar halos tend to be subtle and / or fragmentary .
" The ones we see on Mercury are much more eye - catching and distinct . "
The difference may be gravity .
Lunar gravity is low .
Any dark material flying out of a crater on the moon travels a great distance , spreading out in a diffusion that can be difficult to see .
The surface gravity of Mercury , on the other hand , is more than twice as strong as the moon's .
On Mercury , debris can't fly as far ; it lands in concentrated form closer to the impact site where it can catch the attention of the human eye .
None of these explanations account for the shiny - bottomed crater .
" That is an even bigger mystery , " Chapman said .
Superficially , the bright patch resembles an expanse of ice glistening in the sun , but that 's not possible .
The surface temperature of the crater at the time of the photo was around 400 degrees Celsius .
Perhaps the shiny material is part of another subsurface layer , bright mixed with dark ; that would be the Marbled Layer Cake Theory .
" I have n't heard any really convincing explanations from our science team , " he said .
" We do n't yet know what the material is , why it is so bright , or why it is localized in this particular crater . "
Fortunately , MESSENGER may have gathered the data researchers need to solve the puzzle .
Spectrometers onboard the spacecraft scanned the craters during the flyby ; the colors they measured should eventually reveal the minerals involved .
" The data are still being calibrated and analyzed , " Chapman said .
If they do n't solve the mystery , scientists hope MESSENGER's two upcoming flybys — one in Oct. 2008 and another in Sept. 2009 — will do the trick .
Eventually , Chapmain said , " we 'll get to the bottom of this mystery , " and probably many more mysteries yet to be revealed .
OnAsia
MOST foreigners visit Mysore to see its many palaces , testaments to bygone royal splendour .
But the city , south of Bangalore , is also a good place to observe monuments to India 's modern might .
One of its suburbs contains a lush campus with a collection of futuristic buildings : the Global Education Centre , one of the world 's largest corporate - training facilities , operated by Infosys , a leading Indian information - technology ( IT ) services firm .
Visiting the centre , you would think that for India 's IT businesses , the sky is the limit .
Rarely has an industry grown so rapidly for so long .
It has boasted annual growth rates of nearly 30 % in the past ten years , with revenues now nearing $ 50 billion , about 5.4 % of India 's GDP .
But some in India are starting to worry that the industry is heading for a fall .
At the very least , analysts say , the industry 's leading firms — Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) , Infosys and Wipro , to name only the three largest — need to do more to adapt their business models as the industry matures .
The “ IT ” in India 's IT industry has always been something of a misnomer .
True , most of its more than 1.6 m employees sit in front of computers , writing software for Western firms , remotely maintaining their computers and electronically handling some of their operations .
But the business is mostly about people and processes .
The very essence of India 's IT firms is their ability to marshal huge local workforces to supply high - quality services .
One of their biggest innovations has been to borrow ideas from manufacturing and apply them to services , by building a sophisticated human supply - chain , for instance .
They have also focused on certification and continuous improvement — a result of having to be , at least initially , better than their Western rivals in order to win business , says Girish Paranjpe , the boss of Wipro 's consulting arm .
Today more Indian than American firms meet the highest internationally recognised standards for software development .
All this has enabled Indian firms to take advantage of a rare , if not unique , set of market conditions .
On the demand side , Western companies needed to cut costs , but their computer systems still required a lot of human labour .
On the supply side , there was an army of well trained , English - speaking engineers demanding only a fraction of a Western salary .
Fast fibre - optic links brought both sides together and a favourable exchange rate made this global connection even more attractive : customers paid in dollars , and employees were paid in rupees .
The result was a “ low - risk , high - margin business ” , says Kiran Karnik , the outgoing president of Nasscom , the industry 's trade group .
To increase sales , firms could hire more people without caring too much about productivity , with the result that growth in revenue correlated closely with growth in headcount .
So why the concern ?
Indian IT faces a host of threats , says Sudin Apte of Forrester Research , a consultancy , who argues that the industry needs to reinvent itself .
The most immediate difficulty is the rapid appreciation of the rupee against the dollar in recent months ( see article ) .
Since its low in mid-2006 , it has gained 16 % .
This has made a liability out of what had been a big asset for Indian IT firms — making most of their sales in America .
The strong rupee has also thrown other structural problems into relief .
These fall into three categories .
What goes up ...
First come the familiar problems .
One is India 's clogged and insufficient infrastructure : workers in Bangalore can spend four hours a day in traffic .
Then there are the tax breaks that subsidise the industry , some of which expire in 2009 .
There is also a growing talent shortage .
Indian engineering schools award around 200,000 diplomas each year , and produce around 250,000 graduates , but only half are employable by the IT industry .
Employees have learnt to switch jobs for better pay , and salaries are going up by 10 - 15 % a year .
For senior staff , they will soon reach Western levels .
Second , competitors are starting to emerge .
IT industries in other parts of the world , such as Central Europe , may never match India 's in size , but they can still pick off valuable contracts .
Meanwhile , foreign IT firms have been beefing up their Indian subsidiaries .
In 2002 the six biggest — including Accenture , IBM and HP — had fewer than 10,000 employees in total in the country .
Their combined Indian workforce now exceeds 150,000 .
This enables them to rival the Indian firms in scale and cost , while exploiting their stronger brands and international scope .
The third category concerns future threats .
In the short term a slowdown in IT spending looms as America 's economy weakens .
In the longer term Indian firms must keep abreast of technological changes .
Many of the services they now provide will eventually be automated ; this is already starting to happen , for example , in software testing .
Western firms , meanwhile , increasingly want Indian providers to do more than just keep systems running ; they want help in developing new solutions to business problems — something few Indian firms are set up to do .
The question is whether the industry 's business model can cope with these threats even as the potential for growth in its established markets declines .
According to calculations by CLSA , a French - Asian investment bank , Indian IT firms will soon have a share of nearly 20 % of their addressable market 's value and almost 40 % of its volume .
They will also struggle to make their existing business more efficient : most fat has already been cut .
Many think that Indian IT firms need to move into new , higher - margin services and to cut the link between revenues and headcount , for instance by offering more consulting , developing more intellectual property and making acquisitions abroad .
To be fair , the leading firms are already doing this .
Infosys now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from consulting , says its new boss , S. Gopalakrishnan ; and Wipro recently paid $ 600 m for Infocrossing , an American firm , the largest in a series of acquisitions by Indian firms .
But is the industry moving fast enough ?
Nasscom 's Mr Karnik says no , but he thinks there is still time to change things .
Partha Iyengar of Gartner , another consultancy , sees more urgency .
He expects slower growth and lower margins if the big firms are not making most of their money in consulting and other high - margin areas within three or four years .
This will be hard , he says : today 's focus on people , processes and profits may keep many firms from reaching the next level .
But , he says , India 's IT firms have shown before that they can change if they really need to .
Even if the heavyweights stumble , smaller firms are ready to take up the baton .
For example , MindTree Consulting was founded 1999 in anticipation of the very threats that have now materialised .
However potent these threats prove , they have already demonstrated that for all the talk of the world being flat , economic gravity still applies .
Does financial security simply mean not having to worry about money ?
That ’s too simple to define such a broad meaning of “ financial security ” .
You might not have to worry about money during a great time where jobs are everywhere , and your country ’s economy is doing very well , and earning money is so easy .
But will you start worrying when it is recession time ?
Would you worry about money if your family members were hit by a deadly disease ?
Would you worry about money if suddenly you are unable to climb off your bed in the morning and need to stay on bed for the rest of your life ?
Financial security is about knowing and feeling safe that whatever disaster arrives , you know you wo n’t have financial trouble .
Except for some extremely rich folks , financial security does not seem to be that simple .
Photo by spushnik
Can we define financial security simply by putting up a number ?
Would a million dollars give you security ?
Or you wo n’t be feeling financially secured unless you have 10 million dollars assets ?
I think merely giving it a number does n’t define it fairly neither .
Ask These Questions to Test Your Financial Security Level
What happens to my children , my parents , my spouse and my family if I passed away suddenly ?
What if both you and your spouse passed away at the same time ?
Will everything be well taken care of ?
Am I prepared for the next recession ?
What happens if I lose my job today ?
If you are able to answer all the questions above in a positive manner , congratulations !
You are definitely financially more secured than 80 % of the population in the world .
Five States - of - mind of Being Financially Secured
As shared by Michael Mihalik , financial security consists of four things :
Being debt - free Being in control of your expenses Consistently increasing your savings / assets / net worth on a monthly basis
Not being forced to work at a job you dislike just to pay the bills
For a broader and more comprehensive definition of being financially secured , I would like to add another important state - of - mind : being well thoroughly protected .
When you know and feel that you are financially secured , here is what happens :
Never worry about debt
You do n’t have to be debt - free to feel secured .
But knowing that no matter what happens , you will be able to pay off your debt makes you feel safe .
Let ’s say you still owe a lot of mortgage payment .
If you lose your job today , can you still pay the mortgage for the next 24 months ?
The answer is yes , if
you have a substantial reserve fund .
you are a capable person and finding a new job just require a few weeks time
you have other source of income
What if a car hits you today and you lose your ability to earn an income ?
Can you still afford the loan installment ?
The answer is yes if you are well protected with life insurance .
Being in Control of Your Expenses
It is a very dangerous statement if you say “ I ca n’t control my expenses ” !
Yes , I know you can control your expenses .
Some people say :
I need to spend the money to please my wife
I need to buy those things to please my kids
I need vacations because my jobs is too stressful
If money is spent on anything that ’s not within your budget plan , you have lost control over your spending habit .
All the above are just cheap excuses .
Another situation is when a family member needs that money which is not within your budget .
For examples :
your mother need medical aid
your child needs a lot of money to study overseas , but all you had saved for him is just enough for local colleges .
your brother need to borrow from you because his business is going south .
These are problems that can not be tackled easily .
But with proper planning , wise decisions can be made to prevent that .
Why should your brother risk your money to rescue his company ?
Why ca n’t your child compromise to enter local colleges ?
Why did n’t you buy medical insurance for your mother in the first place ?
Consistently Increasing your Net Worth
The best reward of proper budgeting is to see your net worth grow day by day .
When you know that you are getting richer every minute , it just motivates you to do even better .
I have shared many principles on how to growth your wealth before .
These articles might interest you :
Not being forced to work at a job you dislike just to pay the bills
Work takes up 1/3 of your weekdays .
If you are stuck with a job you hate , I can imagine how miserable your life is .
If you want a joyful life , you should have a job you are passionate about , beside having a spouse you are deeply in love with .
The freedom to do whatever you want ( legally ) is so precious .
I am not yet rich , but I feel secured in this area about jobs .
I have a full list of what I can do to make money , and none of them are things that I dislike .
The fact is that I do n’t worry about losing my job , because I have many jobs that I like to do .
Here is my list :
Financial planning services – I really ca n’t see how it may fail because I have hundreds of clients .
This business is a long term relationship between the planner and clients .
My customers are so diversified that some of them are engineers , lawyers , businessmen , managers etc .
Music production – I do music arrangement .
Sometimes I am selective about the projects I want to work on .
Making money online –
My online income is not much , but I know I wo n’t starve if I turn full time doing blogging and internet marketing .
Live performance – one of my best friend , who is a professional pianist often asks me to play gigs .
Now I seldom perform because I want to spend more time with my son and wife at night .
But if everything turns into a disaster , I can still go out to perform , and give music lessons .
Please do n’t feel that I am bragging .
I am certainly not earning a lot at this moment .
But I have fun all the time , during work and out of work .
I just want to urge you to build up your own financial security , in your own passionate fields .
You should turn your passion into money making machines , and never worry about losing your job anymore .
Being well thoroughly protected
When you are well protected , you can be rest assured that all your dependents can still live on at the same lifestyle if you passed away suddenly .
Some areas that people often overlook :
Have your will well planned and written up
Have a living trust set up to provide education , maintenance , guardian allowance in case of double tragedy
Have your business well protected with key person assurance , liability cancellation plan , and also a funded buy sell agreement if necessary
Have your own insurance properly planned , and get the best benefit with the most affordable premium
Have all your dependents insured as well .
Please realize that a seriously illed family member will eat up your nest egg too .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A woman who claims she was ordered by federal airport screeners to remove her nipple rings with pliers demanded an apology from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration on Thursday .
Attorney Gloria Allred ( L ) and her client Mandi Hamlin pose with a mannequin and nipple rings in her Los Angeles office after a news conference March 27 , 2008 in this photograph provided by Allred .

Mandi Hamlin , 37 , also called for an investigation into the February 24 incident in Lubbock , Texas , saying that snickering male agents violated TSA policy by forcing her to remove the jewelry .
“ I felt surprised , embarrassed , humiliated , scared and angry , ” Hamlin told reporters at the offices of her Los Angeles attorney , Gloria Allred .
“ This situation was totally out of control .
I will not sit quietly .
No one deserves to be treated this way . ”
The TSA , a unit of the Department of Homeland Security that was set up after the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 , said it was investigating the incident but that agents were trained to search people with piercings in “ sensitive areas ” with dignity and respect .
“ TSA is well aware of terrorists ’ interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body , therefore we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm we discover , ” the agency said in a written statement .
The TSA said incidents of female terrorists hiding explosives in “ sensitive areas ” were on the rise and provided a picture of a “ bra bomb ” that was used in training its agents .
Allred said the incident began when Hamlin , who has a number of piercings , set off a hand - held metal detector and told a TSA officer that her nipple rings were the problem .
A small group of TSA officers gathered around Hamlin , Allred said , and told her she would have to remove the jewelry from her nipples if she wanted to board her flight .
Hamlin went behind a curtain and removed one of her nipple piercings but could not budge the other , tearfully telling the officers it could not be taken out without pliers , Allred said .
“ As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing behind the curtain , she could hear a growing number of predominantly male TSA officers snickering in the background , ” the attorney said .
Allred said TSA policy called for a pat - down under such circumstances but did not require the piercings to be removed .
Some environmental groups have pushed for plug - in hybrids , called PHEVs , or plug - in hybrid electric vehicles , as a way to save on gasoline , thus curbing emissions .
But some experts say plug-ins may not be the ultimate answer to cutting pollution , if the electricity used to charge them comes from coal - fired power plants .
That is also a concern to Toyota , which has asked researchers to determine not only whether consumers would be willing to pay for a plug - in , but also the effect it would have on the environment , James Lentz , the president of Toyota Motor Sales , said in an interview Sunday .
Nonetheless , G.M. , Toyota and Ford Motor , the world ’s three biggest car companies , all are developing plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Along with the Volt , G.M. has said it plans to produce a plug - in version of its Saturn Vue hybrid .
Ford has not yet given details of its plug - in hybrid , which it first discussed in 2006 .
Indeed , Toyota executives initially questioned the practicality of plug - in hybrids , saying consumers preferred the convenience of hybrids that did not have to be recharged .
Toyota has sold more than one million hybrids worldwide , including more than 800,000 Prius cars .
But the automaker announced last July that it was testing plug - in hybrids on public roads in Japan .
It also is testing them in France , Toyota officials said Sunday , and it has given prototype versions of plug - in hybrid vehicles to university researchers in California .
MOMBASA , Kenya ( Reuters ) - Bethan , 56 , lives in southern England on the same street as best friend Allie , 64 .
A Kenyan man walks with an unidentified tourist at the Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach in the coastal town of Mombasa November 15 , 2007 .
Hard figures are difficult to come by , but local people on the coast estimate that as many as one in five single women visiting from rich countries are in search of sex .

They are on their first holiday to Kenya , a country they say is “ just full of big young boys who like us older girls . ”
Hard figures are difficult to come by , but local people on the coast estimate that as many as one in five single women visiting from rich countries are in search of sex .
Allie and Bethan -- who both declined to give their full names -- said they planned to spend a whole month touring Kenya ’s palm - fringed beaches .
They would do well to avoid the country ’s tourism officials .
“ It ’s not evil , ” said Jake Grieves - Cook , chairman of the Kenya Tourist Board , when asked about the practice of older rich women traveling for sex with young Kenyan men .
“ But it ’s certainly something we frown upon . ”
Also , the health risks are stark in a country with an AIDS prevalence of 6.9 percent .
Although condom use can only be guessed at , Julia Davidson , an academic at Nottingham University who writes on sex tourism , said that in the course of her research she had met women who shunned condoms -- finding them too “ businesslike ” for their exotic fantasies .
The white beaches of the Indian Ocean coast stretched before the friends as they both walked arm - in - arm with young African men , Allie resting her white haired - head on the shoulder of her companion , a six - foot - four 23 - year - old from the Maasai tribe .
He wore new sunglasses he said were a gift from her .
“ We both get something we want -- where ’s the negative ? ”
Allie asked in a bar later , nursing a strong , golden cocktail .
She was still wearing her bikini top , having just pulled on a pair of jeans and a necklace of traditional African beads .
Bethan sipped the same local drink : a powerful mix of honey , fresh limes and vodka known locally as “ Dawa , ” or “ medicine . ”
She kept one eye on her date -- a 20 - year - old playing pool , a red bandana tying back dreadlocks and new - looking sports shoes on his feet .
He looked up and came to join her at the table , kissing her , then collecting more coins for the pool game .
“ JUST UNWHOLESOME ”
Grieves - Cook and many hotel managers say they are doing all they can to discourage the practice of older women picking up local boys , arguing it is far from the type of tourism they want to encourage in the east African nation .
“ The head of a local hoteliers ’ association told me they have begun taking measures -- like refusing guests who want to change from a single to a double room , ” Grieves - Cook said .
“ It ’s about trying to make those guests feel as uncomfortable as possible ...
But it ’s a fine line .
We are 100 percent against anything illegal , such as prostitution .
But it ’s different with something like this -- it ’s just unwholesome . ”
These same beaches have long been notorious for attracting another type of sex tourists -- those who abuse children .
As many as 15,000 girls in four coastal districts -- about a third of all 12 - 18 year - olds girls there -- are involved in casual sex for cash , a joint study by Kenya ’s government and U.N. children ’s charity UNICEF reported late last year .
Up to 3,000 more girls and boys are in full - time sex work , it said , some paid for the “ most horrific and abnormal acts . ”
“ PREYING ON POVERTY ? ”
Emerging alongside this black market trade -- and obvious in the bars and on the sand once the sun goes down -- are thousands of elderly white women hoping for romantic , and legal , encounters with much younger Kenyan men .
They go dining at fine restaurants , then dancing , and back to expensive hotel rooms overlooking the coast .
“ One type of sex tourist attracted the other , ” said one manager at a shorefront bar on Mombasa ’s Bamburi beach .
“ Old white guys have always come for the younger girls and boys , preying on their poverty ...
But these old women followed ... they never push the legal age limits , they seem happy just doing what is sneered at in their countries . ”
Experts say some thrive on the social status and financial power that comes from taking much poorer , younger lovers .
“ This is what is sold to tourists by tourism companies -- a kind of return to a colonial past , where white women are served , serviced , and pampered by black minions , ” said Nottinghan University ’s Davidson .
“ LIVE LIKE THE RICH ”
Many of the visitors are on the lookout for men like Joseph .
Flashing a dazzling smile and built like an Olympic basketball star , the 22 - year - old said he has slept with more than 100 white women , most of them 30 years his senior .
“ When I go into the clubs , those are the only women I look for now , ” he told Reuters .
“ I get to live like the rich mzungus ( white people ) who come here from rich countries , staying in the best hotels and just having my fun . ”
At one club , a group of about 25 dancing men -- most of them Joseph look - alikes -- edge closer and closer to a crowd of more than a dozen white women , all in their autumn years .
“ It ’s not love , obviously .

“ It ’s a social arrangement .

Some big companies have had a surprise during their earnings conference calls this quarter -- and it has nothing to do with the weak economy .
At least seven times just the past three weeks , a mystery caller has cleverly insinuated himself into the normally well - manicured ritual of the quarterly calls .
As top executives of publicly traded companies respond to securities analysts ' questions about their balance sheets , he impersonates a well - known analyst to get called upon .
Then , usually declaring himself to be " Joe Herrick ...
When we left Part 2 I had fixed 23 bugs and released the next version , DotNetInvoice 2.1 , to the existing customers .
The release included a fix for every known issue .
Customers felt supported , and a few new sales rolled in .
Things were looking up until the end of the first month rolled around .
What Sales ?
The funny thing ( not funny “ haha , ” but funny like you feel after eating Sushi from a street cart in Mexico ) was that after four weeks of sweating bullets , fixing bugs , and dealing with angry customers , sales were quite a bit below previous months .
Given the extensive conversations I had with the former owners I was confident their numbers were correct .
But I could not for the life of me explain the sudden drop in sales .
After emailing a few customers I began to put it together : when the developers had released version 2.0 a few months earlier they had a large block of the 1.0 customers lined up to purchase it .
In fact , many of them pre-purchased the product at a discount .
When the product released the flood gates opened , revenue shot up , and gobs of version 2.0 went out the door .
The month I took over was one month after sales had stalled and the bug backlash began .
My timing was impeccable .
The end result ?
I overpaid for the product .
It was n’t a huge amount of money , but it did sting .
Present Day
Flash forward seven months .
With two more releases under my belt and a heck of a lot of marketing , monthly revenue is nearly triple its previous levels , and DotNetInvoice 2.3 is a solid piece of software .
Written in ASP .
NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005 , it includes source code and a 30 - day money back guarantee .
In the last seven months my team has implemented dozens of new features and performed some major refactors ( important when selling an open source product ) .
We even received a 4 - star review from asp.netPRO magazine .
My Advice When Acquiring a Software Package
Spend a lot of time working with the code .
I ’m a five year veteran of .NET and I had a pretty in - depth look at the code before making an offer .
The code was clean , consistent , and worked as expected .
What I did n’t do was perform a complete install and thoroughly test the software ( or hire someone to thoroughly test it ) .
It would have taken several hours to get into the meat of the app and really get my hands dirty , but I trusted that since the code was clean that it functioned well .
Bad assumption .
Email current customers .
You ’re spending a lot of money on a product that , even if you ’ve spent time testing , could still have fatal flaws only noticed by someone who ’s used the product for months .
Ask for 5 email addresses and contact customers , asking them everything : how they purchased the software , how much they paid for it , how helpful the support has been , how many bugs they ’ve encountered , and how many have been fixed .
The answers will be invaluable when extending an offer .
Attack the demo .
Do n’t be smitten by the emotional aspect of a demo ( such as the glitz of AJAX or a slick design ) .
Get in there and break the thing .
Enter thirty digit dollar amounts , try a SQL injection attack , or lob rotten tomatoes at it from 10 paces .
If the code was well written , the back end should gracefully handle any garbage you throw at it .
If not , drop that offer by a few percentage points .
Investigate revenue and expenses for the previous 6 months .
Look back as many months as you can .
If a month is not available assume it was terrible and adjust your offer accordingly .
Take the average monthly revenue from the previous 6 - 12 months to eliminate seasonal or “ new version ” peaks .
If the product is relatively new , assume revenue will drop after the first 2 - 3 months .
If there ’s a lack of information , assume the worst .
As a general guide , products like this tend to sell for between 12 and 30 months of revenue .
Fix bugs quickly to earn customer trust .
If you discover your new product has bugs , fix them quickly to show customers you mean business .
One advantage to acquiring the product was that everyone was patient with me since I was learning the product along with them .
Customers were surprisingly respectful because I was willing to spend the time to help them .
Remember that these customers are your lifeblood .
Even though they ’ve already paid for the product , they can help you in more ways than you realize .
Early on , they know the product better than you do .
Clean up around the edges .
It ’s very possible you will inherit a solid product that ’s rough around the edges , such as one lacking documentation or a decent user interface .
Providing installation instructions or improving the look of the application are ways to impress present and future customers .

Inspired by “ engineering screw - ups ” on Gearslutz , here ’s a list of recording and mixing bloopers that made it past the mixing room onto the final release .
These are n’t performance missteps , where the band missed a cue , or the singer came in too soon .
There are certainly countless examples of those but most were included intentionally , to add character or realism .
Rather , the flubs below highlight mistakes in recording or mixing that could have been corrected before the track was released .
Some of the mistakes probably went unnoticed .
Some , I ’m sure , were noticed and begrudgingly accepted because of a deadline .
But reassuringly for us amateurs , they all prove that even the pros are n’t perfect .
Botched Edits
Eric Clapton – Blues Power
The edit in question happens at 0:09 in the clip below .
I scratch my head every time I hear it .
So many questions :
What went through the mixing engineer ’s head ?
Why did n’t Clapton object ?
What ’s powpower ?
Recording and mixing engineers traditionally build a vocal track by “ punching in ” ( re- recording a rough spot ) and “ comping ” ( building a single vocal track from the best parts of multiple takes . )
Before digital editing , this was a manual procedure prone to timing errors .
So the example above , recorded in 1970 , is forgivable ( although puzzling , because it ’s so obvious . )
Today , however , it ’s common practice to digitally automate the punches and comps , which means the next two examples really should n’t have happened :
Radiohead – You
You was the first track on their first album , so the band surely aimed to make an impact .
And without question , Thom Yorke bellowing high A for 8 seconds is a great hook , perhaps even the song ’s defining moment … until you realize that his wail is comped from shorter sections .
Listen for the cut at 0:05 :
Incubus – Made For TV Movie
Notice how the vocal timbre changes in the middle of the word “ yeah ” , after “ eyes deceive me . ” I ca n’t fathom how this edit made it to mastering .
Unlike the Radiohead example , which is only obvious on close listen , this cut simply sounds distracting !
John Lennon – Working Class Hero
Here , the tonality changes completely at 0:10 , and again at 0:30 .
Lennon supposedly recorded a demo on his home tape recorder , and at mix time , he and Phil Spector ( who produced the track ) preferred the emotion in the home recording for one verse only .
Strange noises
Led Zeppelin – Since I ’ve Been Loving You
This is a cop-out .
There are “ perfect takes , ” for sure , but for a professional ( or a self - described genius like John Lennon ) there ’s no such thing as a take so perfect it ca n’t be recreated .
This is the best example of John Bonham ’s notoriously squeaky bass drum pedal .
Jimmy Page discussed the squeak in a 1993 Guitar World interview :
The only real problem I can remember encountering was when we were putting the first boxed set together .
There was an awfully squeaky bass drum pedal on “ Since I ’ve Been Loving You ” .
It sounds louder and louder every time I hear it ! [ laughs ] .
That was something that was obviously sadly overlooked at the time .
The Beatles – I ’m Looking Through You
( Note : I boosted the high frequencies in this clip to highlight the pedal sound . )
Some lessons I ’ve learned from The Beatles :
All you need is love .
The walrus was Paul .
If you drop a tambourine while recording , stop the tape and re-record .
I can see this slipping by unnoticed because it almost sounds musical .
Almost .
But listen to the clip a few times , and it becomes obvious just how out of place that tambourine is .
( For more details , check out What Goes On , a fantastic reference for the little nuances like these in Beatles recordings . )
Christina Aguilera – Beautiful
As Aguilera sings , you ’ll hear a faint rhythm track in the background .
This is headphone bleed – sound leaking from her headphone monitor into the microphone .
( Note : I boosted the high frequencies on this track to make the bleed more obvious . )
Dave Pensado , who mixed Beautiful , discusses the noise here :
The song was about being beautiful and honest in EVERY way .
That bleed is honest .
It was one of the most honest vocal performances I had EVER heard .
It was actually the scratch vocal .
This is another cop-out .
Mixing engineers have their own version of the fourth wall , and Pensado broke it with this mix .
Honest or not , the bleed reminds listeners of the technology used to record , and that distracts us from Aguilera ’s performance .
Technical screw-ups
Pink Floyd – Great Gig In The Sky
As Rick Wright holds the last piano chord , the tape speed wobbles for a second :
The Police – Roxanne
This was not done on purpose , as some claim , to fit the song on side A of the vinyl album .
( LPs ran up to 30 minutes per side , and Dark Side Of The Moon ‘s A - side was less than 19 minutes . )
Rather , this is a simple tape speed glitch .
This clip plays two phrases from the 2nd verse of Roxanne .
Compare the reverb tail at the end of “ night ” and “ right . ”
The first decays naturally and cleanly , the second ends abruptly .
The Dixie Chicks – The Long Way Around
Most likely , this is the result of a vocal punch - in or comp , where the reverb was recorded directly to the track , rather than added during mix - down .
( The moral : Do n’t print your effects to tape too early !! )
Does Natalie ’s voice sound odd to you on the word “ parents ? ”
Lessons
Autotune is a powerful tool , to be sure , and used on the right material , it can enhance a recording .
But here , it ’s noticeable and distasteful : Natalie has a great voice , and the engineers did her a disservice by not re-recording the note .
I like to think there ’s a special seat in hell reserved for those who abuse Autotune this way .
These clips hold a couple of lessons for amateur producers and home recordists :
1 ) You do n’t need to be perfect .
The pros know this .
Most mistakes will simply go unnoticed , some mistakes add character , and sometimes a looming deadline trumps all .
2 ) That said , there ’s no excuse for releasing sub - par material when you have the time and the skills to improve it .
The Incubus , Dixie Chicks , and John Lennon examples especially are obvious to the point of annoyance , and mostly just make the mixing engineer seem lazy !

Internet Software Patents by Philip Greenspun in February 2008
To judge by the number of lawyers who have been contacting me lately to serve as an expert witness in patent lawsuits , it seems that Internet applications have entered the litigation phase .
My first Expert Witness Job
Though sympathetic to their case , I turned down their generous offer because I preferred to spend my time engineering new things , not arguing about old things .
A couple of months later , I got dragged into the case via subpoena .
Now I was an unpaid material witness .
Because I was the actual developer of one - click ordering , not just an expert poring over old documents and publications , I would have to testify at least about what I knew .
One - click ordering is as simple as the checkbox that you see on most Web sites to " keep me logged in " .
The server sends the browser a " persistent cookie " that the browser returns every subsequent time the user requests a page , even if the computer has been restarted in the interim .
That way the server ( online store ) can identify the browser ( customer ) and re-use the payment and shipping information from the previous order .
I was asked " Why did n't you patent this yourself , if you developed it first ? "
My reply was " It only took me an hour to build ; if I went down to the patent office after every hour of programming , I would n't get very much done . "
Fortunately , the case was settled and I never had to appear in court .
I decided that maybe next time it would be smarter to take the money and get paid for the work .
A Pattern Emerges
A good example is U.S. Patent 5367627 , filed in 1993 and issued in 1994 .
Imagine you have a computerized database of spare parts for different products .
A customer calls and says " I need some parts for my Canon 1000 copier " .
The computer system , rather than showing the sales person all million parts in the system , shows the sales person only those parts that will fit the Canon 1000 . "
The idea of not flooding the sales person 's screen with a million irrelevant and incompatible parts is patented .
The owner of the patent is suing everyone who sells spare parts in this straightforward manner and , even though the patent did not mention the Web ( three years old at the time of filing ) , claiming that it covers automated Web - based sales as well .
Here 's how one could rewrite the claims ...
Claim 1a ) take model number from customer
1b ) database of which parts go with which model
1c ) picking at least one part from the database ( 1 b )
1d ) making a " proposal " to the customer ( web page ? ) with a part to buy
Claim 2 ) same as claim 1 but explicitly ask for the " manufacturer 's part number " for the equipment ( how claim 1 was supposed to work without this , I do n't know )
Claim 3 ) receiving " feature information " instead of a mode number
Claim 4 ) selecting equipment type and then equipment manufacturer , e.g. , " copier " and then " Canon "
Claim 5 ) printing out the proposal
Claim 6 ) including in the proposal some extra information about the parts ( " specifications " )
Claim 7 ) showing the price of a part
Claim 8 ) showing " graphical information " ( picture of the part ? )
Claim 9 ) " text information " in the proposal ( why this is different from Claim 6 ? specifications are usually text )
Claim 10 ) putting an animation in the proposal
Claim 11 ) " graphically illustrating features " in the proposal ( how different from 8 ? )
Claim 12 ) showing a comparison of features between two different parts that are both compatible , e.g. , " 500 - sheet paper tray holds 2X as much paper as 250 - sheet paper tray "
Claim 13 ) using text to do the comparison ?
How different is this from 12 ?
How else could you do it ?
Graphically maybe .
Claim 14 ) using graphics to describe the two different features
Claim 15 ) using a portable PC for the whole deal ( laptop ? )
You might ask " How would you do the ' 627 patent without a computer ? "
Here is a process :
Answer phone by saying " Canon parts and supplies .
Good morning " .
Ask customer what model copier he owns , e.g. , " Canon 1000 " and basically what he needs , e.g. , " toner cartridge " .
Go to filing cabinet .
Pull out folder marked " Canon 1000 " .
Leaf through to a page describing " Toner Cartridge 1000 for Canon 1000 " and " Toner Cartridge 1001 , Long Life , for Canon 1000 " .
Suppose that each page has photos of the cartridges , illustrations of how to put them into the copier , and a price .
Using paper and pen , write cover letter to customer saying " Thank you for calling Canon .
There are two replacement toner cartridges compatible with your Canon 1000 copier .
Attached are product sheets on each .
Please call back with a purchase order or credit card number if you wish to order one . "
Fax everything to the customer .
This seems to cover claims 1 through 9 and maybe 11 .
To cover claim 10 , mail a VHS video tape to the customer .
To cover claims 12 and 13 , include an extra sentence in the cover letter : " Note that the long life cartridge can print twice as many pages . "
To cover claim 14 , draw two stacks of paper , one twice as large as the other , with a caption saying " the long life cartridge wo n't run out until you 've used twice as many pages . "
To cover claim 15 , deal with the customer via email , write the cover letter in a word processor , and scan all of the documents from the filing cabinet , creating folders on the desktop with names that are the same as the names from the filing cabinet folders .
How come the patent examiner grants patents on stuff that a 12 - year - old Visual Basic programmer would probably implement without too much thought ?
A patent examiner is only permitted to spend about 12 hours looking at a patent .
If he or she cannot find prior art within those 12 hours , the patent is issued .
Mostly patent examiners look at other patents , but sometimes they search academic journals and popular magazines .
Still , if you had 12 hours to search , including time spent writing correspondence to the applicant , would you be able to find a publication on how to use a file cabinet with hanging folders ?
Looking at the file history for some of these patents , one sometimes finds the examiners citing " In Re Venner ( 1958 ) " that you can't patent the simple replacement of a manual activity with an automated one .
But then eventually the patent is allowed with some narrowing of the claims .
Are computer nerds smarter today than they were in the 1960s ?
If programmers get dumber every year , how come we 're smart enough to keep discovering clever new things to patent , things that those pioneers in computer science did n't dream of ?
We can buy all of our books on amazon.com and the early Internet pioneers could n't go shopping online because they were n't smart enough to envision online shopping , right ?
The answer is that the early Internet pioneers did envision essentially every service available on the present - day Internet .
They wrote about it and distributed those writings to tens of thousands of people .
They demonstrated prototypes , sometimes to rooms full of more than 1000 people , and distributed films of those demos .
The only reason that we believe ourselves to be innovative is that we are too lazy to go to the library and read what was done in the 1960s .
If those old guys were so smart , why did n't they build amazon.com , eBay , and Google ?
Well , many of them died before the 50,000th person obtained Internet access .
There was n't much point in having an online store when there were only 50 or 100 computers on the Internet .
Annotated Timeline of Internet and e-commerce
early 1960s : packet - switched computer networking developed
1962 : Licklider proposes " Intergalactic Computer Network " based on packet switching
1968 : Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull , in a lab at Harvard , developed a virtual reality and augmented reality system with a head - mounted display , tracking of the user 's head position and gaze direction .
This system was extensively described in publications and depicted in films and photographs .
There is nothing in a modern virtual reality video game that is not an obvious consequence of Sutherland 's research supplemented by improved CPU and memory chips .
December 1968 : Douglas Engelbart demonstrates , to an audience of more than 1000 people in San Francisco , nearly all of the features of modern computing , including the mouse , collaborative work mediated by a computer or computer networking , email , hypertext , audio and video conferencing to facilitate shared work on a computer document ; Engelbart mentions in this talk that his collaborator is currently logged in as another user on a time - shared mainframe computer but could soon be connected over the ARPAnet .
There is nothing in the modern World Wide Web that is not an obvious consequence of this demo supplemented by improved CPU and memory chips .
The demo was filmed and distributed ( low quality version )
November 21 , 1969 : ARPAnet , which grew into Internet , launched
1980 : Michael Dertouzos writes " The Information Marketplace " , published in several versions , talking about how by 2000 commerce will depend on networked computer systems " which number in the ten millions " .
These computers are communicating " business data , electronic memos , and still images " .
Dertouzos predicts " Advertising is done in reverse , by a service that responds to consumer inquiries with products and services that match . "
Dertouzos figures 30 % improvement annually in memory and performance , a little slower than " Moore 's Law " .
1982 : France - wide expansion of the Minitel .
April 1 , 1987 : U.S. TIME magazine writes " In France , home computers make it unnecessary to leave the house , even to find a spouse .
You wish to order some fresh foie gras ?
Find a lost dog ?
Book a seat at the opera ?
Sell your old car ?
Do the shopping from your armchair ?
Meet your dream man , or woman ?
In France , those are among more than 4,000 services available through Teletel , a home videotex service ...
June 4 , 1987 , The Engineer , " Doing the weekly shopping from the comfort of your home has its appeal , as the French have found out " :
A few months from now some 3 million people in France will be able to shop for their consumer goodies from their armchairs .
Using an electronic terminal provided free of charge by the French telecom authority , the Direction Generale de Telecommunications ( DGT ) , they will be able to call up a database of goods , indexed in terms of brand , functions and price , select what they want and pay for it instantly by credit card .
February 16 , 1989 , Atlanta Journal and Constitution , " Grocery Shopping By Computer Takes Byte Out of Lines " : Customers turn on their computers and a list of all available items is displayed with boxes allowing them to put in the number of each item they request .
The prices are displayed on the computer terminal , and sale prices are substituted weekly .
Subtotals are displayed , and customers also can go to specific aisles , such as the babyfood / care aisle , and pull up a menu of all available products .
To shop for soup , for example , a customer pulls up that listing and can choose from menus of bouillon , chunky , condensed or a category of other soups .
If the shopper calls up condensed soups , it will display products like Campbell 's Soup / Chicken Noodle , 19 oz. , $ 1.39 .
1990 : World Wide Web adopted primarily by scientists for the distribution of technical information
1991 : Shopping well established on CompuServe , Prodigy , and other proprietary networks within the U.S .
1993 : With the introduction of NCSA Mosaic , a text - plus - pictures Web browser that runs on a lot of different operating systems , consumers begin using the World Wide Web in significant numbers .
1994 : ecommerce sites developed to bring Minitel - and CompuServe - style shopping to the public Internet
Conclusion
They could n't build our modern world for us back in the 1960s because the hardware had n't caught up .
If you 'd given them 50 million quad - core 2 GHz Pentium with 4 GB of RAM and 30 Mbps Verizon FiOS connections to every home , they would have built you all of the services of the modern Internet and probably many that would have been better .
What would happen if you gave present - day computer programmers those same powerful hardware gifts ?
We did that experiment .
Our modern day best - and - brightest built Microsoft Windows Vista ( TM ) .

While the Old - timers accurately foresaw much of todayýs common technology , they missed the boat in two important areas : user interface , and implications of Mooreýs law .
Even as late as the early 80ýs Ken Olsen and the brain trust at DEC didnýt think that there would be a computer in every home ý that was certainly fringe thought in the 60ýs .
I used the Minitel system when I lived in France ý91-ý94 and while it was useful , the tiny text screen at low speed has no comparison to the utility of say , Google Maps .
Minitel can be used a couple of hours a week to accomplish a practical need like ordering a train ticket , not hours per day to read , communicate , interact , and publish .
The ability to interact visually makes such a dramatic in improvement in human productivity .
Contrast the iPhone practicality to the green screen 3270 user interface .
60ýs computing was about processing large amounts of data , with the rare exception about making computers personal , portable , connected and interactive .
Science fiction dreaming is different than engineering how to build todayýs common systems .
Finally , one of Bill Gatesýs greatest insights was the economic implication of Mooreýs law ý all processing , memory ( and disk and network bandwidth ) would eventually be free , so the value is all in the software .
In 1975 , no one thought you could maintain a software - only company .
Today , everyone takes for granted that software companies like Microsoft and Google have among the highest market capitalizations around .
At its current size and weight , Microsoft clearly no longer attracts the best and brightest .
Vista proves your aforementioned theory of human endeavor ý that the most exciting work is elsewhere than adding another 30 lines per day to a 50,000,000 line behemoth .
-- David Wihl , February 15 , 2008
I am similarly underwhelmed by Vista .
However , it does n't seem fair to compare Vista to the work of Doug Engelbart .
Engelbart was trying to change the world .
Vista was only trying to be a compatibility environment for a particular application suite .
Do n't be fooled by Microsoft 's need to market it as something more .
It would be better to evaluate XO running on OLPC .
I 'm not sure it would completely vindicate modern achievements , but it at least has a few new ideas .
-- Pete Gontier , February 15 , 2008
I 'm reminded of Ted Hoff , who told my father that Intel never considered patenting the microprocessor because it seemed so obvious .
" Computer on 200 chips " becomes " computer on 20 chips " , then " computer on 2 chips " and finally " computer on a single chip " .
Nothing novel , really .
I believe Dr. Hoff has been supporting himself for the last two decades as an expert witness in patent disputes .
-- Curt Hagenlocher , February 15 , 2008
We have to remember that the patent system exists for the benefit of the public , not the inventor .
The opportunity to profit from exclusive use of something ( that can otherwise be duplicated at essentially zero cost ) presumably motivates people to innovate .
And society benefits .
So the question we should be asking is : " Would Amazon ( or Phil ) have developed one - click ordering without the possibility of a patent ? "
With this and other obvious - in - 20 - minutes - to - the - first - capable - person - to - face - the - problem " innovations " , the answer is clearly yes .
How can we codify such a common - sense test into patent law ?
That 's the real issue .
-- Steve Strickland , February 15 , 2008
Patents can also work against the public good .
The Wright Brothers patented the first airplane with a patent so broad that the entire technology moved to Europe until the patents expired .
Marconi , of radio fame , was so appalled by this that he put together one of the first patent pools and the Radio Corporation of America ( RCA ) .
If I remember , there was an aluminum patent that was so effective as to create a situation that was remedied by a " must license " decision under anti-trust law .
If you actually look at who makes the money from a new technology , it is usually the second round of folks who bring in the resources once all the innovation has been done for them .
There were no textile millionaires in the industrial revolution .
In fact , most of the innovators made modest livings , and a good number of them died broke .
( Check out Farewell to Alms for some good numbers on this ) .
-- sas @mit-ml , February 15 , 2008
" there were no textile millionaires in the industrial revolution " Actually there were - lots of them .
It 's just that in those days a few thousand pounds was the equivelant of millions in today 's money .
The north of England ( Bradford , Manchester etc ) and parts of Scotland ( especially Dundee and Perthshire ) were centres of textile production that saw massive exports across the globe .
The industrial revolution , do n't forget , lasted a long time .
But even at the start , people were getting rich out of it .
The ' jute barons ' of Dundee built massive factories and communities .
I live in a tenement block once occupied by workers in the textile industry , and there are hundreds more nearby .
Virtually all the people who lived here worked for very rich men who got their wealth as a result of the industrial revolution and its effect on textile production .
-- Jonathan Baldwin , February 16 , 2008
Something that could help would be an " Open Source " inventors pool .
It could be an area in a Wiki for great ideas and inventions that people want to share and get credit for , with the realization that they are n't going to patent them .
They would be in the public domain in a place that would eventually be included in patent searchs , a repository of prior art .
People could also contribute other prior art , with links to references .

" While the Old - timers accurately foresaw much of today 's common technology , they missed the boat in two important areas : user interface , and implications of Moore 's law "
Not so .
Regarding UI : In As We May Think ( 1945 ) , Vannevar Bush described an interface that is stunningly recognizable as web browsing .
Doug Engelbart 's work in the '60s ( from which sprang the GUI , as Phil mentioned ) was single - mindedly focused on providing the best user interface for what he called " knowledge workers " .
Some of his UI features , such as those for condensing text passages for quick skimming , are still unmatched .
Direct manipulation showed up in Ivan Sutherland 's Sketchpad ( 1963 ) , whose constrained drawing features are also still unmatched .
Windowed UI and WYSIWYG editing came with the Xerox Alto ( 1973 ) .
Even today , Photoshop and its clones still use the UI invented by Bill Atkinson for MacPaint ( 1983 ) .
And many believe that Atkinson 's HyperCard ( 1987 ) is what the web should have been .
The two decades between Englebart 's 1962 opus and the release of the Macintosh in 1984 were far and away the most fertile period of UI innovation .
Most progress since then has been simply the wide - scale adoption of those ideas .
Regarding Moore 's law : Look at the section " A Simple Vision of the Future " in Alan Kay 's Early History Of Smalltalk .
You will see a man who intimately understood Moore 's Law , even in the late ' 70s .
-- Bret Victor , February 24 , 2008
Most of the responders show their age in the focus of their quite accurate comments .
However , on the origins of computer possibilities , one can go back to the late 1940s and all of 1950s and find most of the things being discussed in various science fiction stories from that era .
The silly one that comes to mind is Dick Tracy 's communicator watch .
That was really the first mention , I can recall , outside of science fiction of the cell phone and related technologies .
Not so silly any more ?
Much of what the latter day " innovators " have discovered were found in that era , especially in the more hard core science magazines such as " Analog " .
Those stories range from the silly to the sublime .
It is a shame that so much of that literature has been lost or worse cooped without attribution .
It would be interesting to see the effect of bringing those stories into the patent wars .
General Extension
I find the ideas that " futurists " are offering to be old stale ideas from that era and earlier .
Much of the credit for inspiring new technologies that is given , justly since the older literature is forgotten , to " Star Trek " and other newer SciFi productions is a reprise of the ideas from that era .
Heinlein's old short story , " The roads must roll " predicted the , probably patented , people movers we find in airports and other places .
I forget the author but " Satellite E - One " predicted private ventures to move into space , I only remembered that due to the title popping up as I typed .
There are many others .
One final observation .
When we finally first landed on the moon , many older science fiction readers were not so terribly excited .
They just asked , " What took us so long ? "

Why It Wo n’t Work
Sony BMG spokesperson :
We ’re pleased to announce we are the final major music corporation to release electronic tracks without that pesky DRM !
All you have to do is leave your house , go to a selected retail outlet , buy a special card there , go back to your house , scratch off the back of the card to find a code , go to our special MusicPass Web site , enter said code , and download one of the 37 titles we have available , from Celine Dion to the Backstreet Boys !
Kid # 1 : Or , in the time it takes me to jump through all those hoops , I could just download all 37 of those albums off of Pirate Bay .
Kid # 2 : Or , I could just scratch off the back at the store , record the pin number , go home and download the album through a Tor connection , so you ca n’t trace my IP number .
Kid # 1 : Also , what ’s with this first slate of artists ?
Celine Dion ?
Backstreet Boys ?
Kenny Chesney ?
Barry Manilow ?
Are you high ?
Sony BMG dude :
They appeal to the sort of mainstream consumer who will see the convenience of our revolutionary music cards !
Kid # 2 : Like my mom ?
Dude , she ’s not going to buy a card .
She ’s going to buy a CD .
Because she ’s at the CD store .
Where she can buy CDs .
Sony BMG dude :
They also make lovely gifts !
Kid # 1 : If she gets one as a gift , all she ’s going to do is ask me how the heck she ’s supposed to use it .
And then she ’s going ask me to get the download for her .
Like I ’m not busy .
And you know what I ’m going to do ?
I ’m going to return the card for cash , and then I ’m going to download the album off of Pirate Bay , because you ’ve confused and upset my mom .
And annoyed me .
Sony BMG dude : Uh .
Kid # 2 : So to recap , what you ’ve got here is a system that makes people leave their house in order to download music at their house , and makes them go to a store to get music that they could get at the store , somewhere else .
Sony BMG dude : Er .
Kid # 1 : Why do n’t you just sell non-DRM ’d MP3s off Amazon , like every other major music corporation ?
Sony BMG dude : Well .
Kid # 2 : You do n’t actually want to sell unprotected MP3s , do you ?
You want to be able to say you ’re doing it , but really , you want to make it so ridiculously inconvenient that people keep just keep buying CDs and DRM ’d tracks off iTunes .
Just admit it , bro .
Sony BMG dude ( pointing ) : Look !
It ’s Celine Dion !
And Barry Manilow !
( runs away as kids avert their eyes in terror )
Poor , stupid deluded Sony BMG .
This MusicPass thing : six months at the outside .
It seems that the £ 200 ultraportable Asus Eee PC can do no wrong .
The size of a paperback , weighing less than a kilogram , with built - in Wi-Fi and using Flash memory instead of a hard drive for storage , the Eee PC has been winning positive comments not just from hyperventilating hardware reviewers , but also from ordinary people who have actually bought it .
According to an ( admittedly biased , because it was self - selecting ) online survey of 1,000 users on the independent Eee PC site eeeuser.com , around 4 % were dissatisfied with their purchase , 33 % found the system pretty much what they expected and 62 % thought it was even better than they had hoped .
Looking through the thousands of postings in eeeuser .
com 's user forums , the same comments keep coming up : it 's so small , the build quality is high , it boots up quickly , it just works .
In fact , it 's hard to find many negative points .
Most are about the placing of the right - hand shift key , the small size of the keyboard , the limited battery life and the slightly awkward mousepad .
One thing that is almost never mentioned as a problem is the fact that the Eee PC is running not Windows , but a variant of GNU / Linux .
Better in store
Until now , the received wisdom has been that GNU / Linux will never take off with general users because it 's too complicated .
One of the signal achievements of the Asus Eee PC is that it has come up with a front end that hides the richness of the underlying GNU / Linux .
It divides programs up into a few basic categories - Internet , Work , Learn , Play - and then provides large , self - explanatory icons for the main programs within each group .
The result is that anyone can use the system without training or even handholding .
This combination of good functionality and out - of - the box ease of use with a price so low that it 's almost at the impulse - buy level could prove problematic for Microsoft .
Until now , there has been no obvious advantage for the average user in choosing GNU / Linux over Windows on the desktop , and plenty of disadvantages .
The price differential has been slight , and there has always been the problem of learning new ways of working .
The Asus Eee PC changes all that .
Because the form factor is so different , people do n't seem to make direct comparisons with the desktop PC , and therefore do n't expect the user experience to be identical .
The price differential between the basic Eee PC running GNU / Linux and one running Windows XP is now significant as a proportion of the total cost .
One of the main suppliers of the Asus Eee PC , RM , sells the GNU / Linux version with 4 Gb of storage and 512 Mb of RAM for £ 199 .
The cheapest machine running Windows XP costs £ 259 , 30 % more , not least because Microsoft 's operating system needs more storage and memory - 8GB and 1GB respectively .
It is that difference , far more than any cost of licensing Windows , which means that Linux - based machines can remain consistently cheaper .
That disparity seems likely to increase when Microsoft phases out Windows XP at the end of June .
Vista costs more than Windows XP and it requires a minimum of 15 GB of storage for installation of even the most basic version .
In order to run Vista on the Eee PC , users will need to buy models - currently non-existent - with much more Flash memory .
At least Moore 's Law should mean that the price of memory chips will continue to plummet .
For example , in 2001 $ 8 ( £ 4 ) would have bought you around 8 MB of Flash memory , whereas in 2011 it will buy you 8GB , according to projections by Gartner .
As a result , Alan Brown , Gartner 's research director for semiconductors , says the price of ultraportables like the Eee PC " could decline about 15 % within three years to between £ 160 and £ 170 " .
The UK company Elonex has already set an even lower price point : it has just announced its own ultraportable , called The One , which offers most of the features of the Eee PC for £ 100 .
Other companies that have launched , or announced , similar machines running GNU / Linux include Acer , Everex , and the Australian company Pioneer Computers ; even HP seems to have one on the way .
At least one manufacturer of traditional portables is worried by the downward trend in prices .
According to Cnet , Sony 's Mike Abrams commented : " If [ the Eee PC from ]
Asus starts to do well , we are all in trouble .
That 's just a race to the bottom . "
This makes the relative cost of systems running Microsoft 's products greater .
The argument that its software is " worth more " because it has more features is unlikely to cut much ice as users discover that functionality of the kind offered by Firefox and OpenOffice.org is fine for most everyday uses - the target market for these new small devices .
Moreover , the rise of free browser - based online services such as Gmail and the Google Docs office suite means you can get by with just Firefox .
The situation in developing countries is even worse .
Not only must Microsoft and its partners compete with new low - cost portable GNU / Linux systems specifically designed for these markets , like the XO - 1 from the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project or Intel 's Classmate PC , but they must also sell against unauthorised copies of Microsoft 's products , which are routinely available on the streets for a few dollars .
To combat this , Microsoft has started selling copies of Windows for around $ 3 in these markets .
Size does matter
Although this kind of bargain basement pricing helps make its products competitive with low - cost alternatives like open source or unauthorised copies , Microsoft 's profit margin is cut close to zero .
That 's not necessarily a disaster for a company with huge cash reserves , but it could be dire for one planning to take on billions of dollars of debt - as Microsoft has said it will need to do in order to finance the acquisition of Yahoo .
What if it is forced to extend this kind of pricing to western markets in order to match the cheap GNU / Linux systems in this " race to the bottom " ?
The first effects may already be being felt .
Notably , last week Microsoft cut the cost of retail copies of Vista , apparently because people do n't see it as a necessary upgrade at the prices charged .
While the vast majority of Windows " upgrades " will still come through people buying new PCs , as corporate customers hold back , the erosion of Microsoft 's ability to set prices for its operating system - and perhaps more importantly its hugely profitable Office suite - could spread deep into its product suite .
And if people do n't think that the extra features of Vista are worth the price , at least at retail , it makes the argument that Windows is " worth more " than Linux harder to sustain .
It 's an interesting - and , for Microsoft , critical - question just how low the price of these " basic but good enough " portables can go .
The original target price of the OLPC machine was around $ 100 , but its designer , Mary - Lou Jepsen , already thinks she can do better .
She says that a $ 75 system is " within reach , " and she set up a new company , Pixel Qi , to help realise that vision .
In the process , she hopes to spawn an entirely new generation of computers .
" We 'll have decent , highly portable , rugged , multi-use computers everywhere .
That poses constraints on the circumstances of use - the input aspects and the screens , the networking and the software , all will have to evolve . "
If they 're to be cheap enough for many people in developing countries to buy , these systems will almost certainly be using open source , but Jepsen does n't see the zero price tag as its main advantage : " The true and large value of free [ software ] is the ability to change and customise it . "
In other words , Microsoft could give away its software , and it still could n't compete with the truly open , customisable nature of free code .
It seems that the only way Microsoft can hope to get people using its software on this new class of low - cost , ultraportable machines is by going fully open source itself .

I 'm not a fan of Democrats appearing on FOXNews .
I think it legitimizes a propaganda outlet stacked against Democrats and allows them to frame the issues .
However , if Democrats who agree to appear on FOX do what Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida does here , then more power to them .
Brit Hume desperately wants to paint the jam the Florida delegates are in as the fault of Florida State Legislature , despite the fact that it was really pushed by the Republican - led majority .
So Hume tries to paint Wasserman - Schultz into a corner and she brooks no quarter from him and refuses to let him control the framing .
Go Debbie !

DWS : Well , I think when you ’re talking about fairness , we have to remember this was started by the Republican - led legislature here , that actually set the date of our primary .
So the victims here in all of …in the decision by the DNC to strip us of our delegates are Democratic voters in the state of Florida .
BH : Can I stop you there …just let me stop you there for a second , if I can .
DWS : Sure
BH : In the Florida state senate , who introduced the bill to move the primary forward ?
DWS : The bill was introduced by a Democratic member , a new Democratic member of the state senate …
BH : And , and , and in the legislature , in the legislature , Senate and House as well , how many Democrats voted against it ?
DWS : No , well , that ’s an inappropriate line of questioning , Brit , because …
BH : But wait a minute , inappropriate or not , could you just answer it , answer the question ?
DWS : Can I answer your question ?
BH : Yeah , how many ?
DWS : I would like to answer your question without you asking me another one , if you do n’t mind .
The legislation that was originally sponsored was amended into an overall election package that included the major provision to ensure that we could have manual recounts and a paper trail .
So this was a major election package that a change in the date of our primary was included in .
So the vote total was unanimous , but that was because there was no one in the Florida legislature was going to vote against changing our voting system so that you could have a paper trail and make sure that every vote could be counted , unlike our touch screen voting system right now , which does n’t allow for that .
So to try to hang a unanimous vote on the fact that Democrats supported that , that ’s misleading .
They supported it because they certainly were n’t going to vote against making sure there was a paper trail in Florida .
When George W. Bush signed the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act into law last week , he again thumbed his nose at Congress by taking a second now - familiar step :
He issued a “ Signing Statement ” – a declaration that effectively asserts his authority to ignore parts of the law he disagrees with .
His action brought harsh criticism from dozens of legal scholars and advocacy groups who point out that U.S. presidents have the authority under the Constitution to veto or approve acts of Congress – but not to modify them .
Bush 's latest Signing Statement declares his right to ignore sections of the law establishing a commission to investigate U.S. contractor fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan , expanding whistleblower protections , requiring that U.S. intelligence agencies respond to congressional requests for documents , banning funding for permanent bases in Iraq , and prohibiting funding of any actions that exercise U.S. control over Iraq 's oil revenues .
One Administration critic , United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) -- the country 's largest anti-war coalition with over 1,400 member groups – characterized Bush 's action as “ arrogant and unconstitutional ” and called on Congress to convene hearings to impeach the president .
Bush ’s use of Signing Statements has become one of the hallmarks of his Administration .
The UFPJ charged that during the past seven years , the same kind of language used by Bush last week “ has been the precursor to numerous violations of law by his administration , including sections of law banning the use of torture and banning the use of funds to construct permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq .
The president has signed laws blocking funding for the construction of permanent bases in Iraq six times , but never stopped the construction . ”
And , in a recent statement , The Constitution Project ’s “ Coalition to Defend Check and Balances ” – a bipartisan group of legal scholars and former Republican and Democratic presidential advisors – declared : “ To restore our system of checks and balances , Congress can , and must , exercise its responsibility as a separate and independent branch of government .
Congress has a clear constitutional obligation to make the laws , and when it has made such laws , to ensure through oversight that the executive branch is enforcing those laws and is otherwise carrying out its responsibilities in a manner consistent with the laws and the Constitution ”
Last month , a senior Department of Justice ( DOJ ) official testified before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that the president is free to violate any laws until the Supreme Court rules otherwise .
However , the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to legislate and requires the president to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed . "
A year earlier , a blue - ribbon American Bar Association task force composed of constitutional scholars , former presidential advisers , and legal and judicial experts urged Congress to adopt legislation enabling its members to seek court review of signing statements that assert the President ’s right to ignore or not enforce laws passed by Congress and demanded that the President veto bills he feels are not constitutional .
Since he took office in 2001 , the president has vetoed only one bill -- a measure to expand health care for children of poor families .
Another Bush critic , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , declared , “ When Congress sends a law to the president for signature it is not asking for his comments .
The Constitution does n’t provide for the president to cherry pick which laws – or which parts of the laws – he will enforce .
The Founding Fathers of our country designed a system that works when Congress writes the laws and the president implements them , ” said the ACLU ’s Caroline Fredrickson .
“ The president needs to respect the separation of powers , ” she added .
Arguably , the most controversial of Bush ’s Signing Statements rejected the so - called McCain Amendment in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2006 , which categorically prohibits cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees by all U.S. personnel , anywhere in the world .
In his Signing Statement , the President asserted that he was free to construe that provision “ in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power . ”
Bush ’s Signing Statements cover not only the so - called war on terror , but also a wide array of bills passed by Congress , ranging from affirmative action programs to requirements of statistical compilations by executive agencies to establishing basic qualifications for executive appointees .
The use of Signing Statements , however , did not start with George W. Bush .
In recent U.S. political history , they have been used by Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush , and Bill Clinton as a tool to express constitutional and other objections to legislation , influence judicial interpretation , and otherwise advance policy goals .
Earlier presidents , beginning with James Monroe , the nation ’s fifth chief executive , have issued such statements .
Monroe signed a bill mandating a reduction in the size of the army and prescribed the method by which the president should select military officers .
But a month later , he issued a statement declaring that the president , not Congress , had the Constitutional authority to appoint military officers .
In 1830 , President Andrew Jackson signed an appropriations bill providing for a road from Detroit to Chicago , but issued a statement insisting that the road was not to extend beyond Michigan .
President Abraham Lincoln wrote that he was signing one bill on the understanding that the bill and the joint resolution explaining it were " substantially one . "
He attached to his Signing Statement a draft veto message he had prepared before the joint resolution was adopted .

" If you can't beat 'em , join 'em , " appears to be Verizon Wireless ' new motto as it today announced an impressive " open access " plan for its network that will go into effect next year .
Any application can run on any device from any developer and will have full access to Verizon spectrum , so long as it can properly connect to the network .
Google , can you hear us now ?
In a conference call this morning , Verizon 's top brass insisted that the news had nothing to do with political pressure or with the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction ( which will require some winners to abide by such open access rules ) .
However , they also made clear that Verizon 's open solution will be in place in 2008 , not in 2011 ( when the new 700M Hz spectrum owner could conceivably start bringing a new network online ) .
Here 's how it will work : early next year , the company will publish the technical standards needed to connect to the Verizon network .
It will also host a conference with device developers to learn more about their needs and to help with any problems that arise .
Verizon has also dropped another $ 20 million into its certification lab , and any device maker who wants to connect to Verizon 's network will first need to be certified for proper network connectivity procedures .
Nothing else will be checked .
All applications , operating systems , and runtime environments are supported so long as the devices connect properly to Verizon 's CDMA network ( they can make use of either the company 's cellular and PCS bandwidth ) .
The fee for certification of devices will be " surprisingly reasonable , " we 're told , and the program will be open to anyone .
One Verizon exec went so far as to say that if someone builds a device in their basement on a breadboard , Verizon will test it and activate it .
Smaller players will definitely be able to get in on the action , something that has n't previously been possible .
According to Verizon , the move is driven by two things : more sophisticated customer needs and an explosion in innovation .
Verizon , which has traditionally certified all devices and apps that run on its network , increasingly finds itself unable to market devices to appeal to every customer niche .
While it will primarily remain a full - service carrier that sells subsidized handsets directly to customers , Verizon is adding this second connectivity option for customers who want it .
John Stratton , Verizon 's chief marketing officer , noted that Verizon will support far more than simply handsets , and it hopes that the move to open its network will unleash an explosion of wireless innovation .
Everything from wireless water meters to digital cameras to game devices can feature Verizon connectivity without needing a Verizon - built or approved device .
The only limits will be " subject to the imagination of the marketplace , " said Stratton .
Bandwidth caps ?
VoIP blocking ?
Forget it .
Verizon insists that under the new program , all apps really will be allowed and no caps will be imposed so long as people are willing to pay for the bandwidth being used .
The announcement " shows that the competitive market responds to market forces , " said CEO Lowell McAdam , but Verizon 's timing suggests that more than market forces were at work .
Government rules seem to have played a part as well .
The open access plan was revealed only days before the deadline for companies to announce official interest in the upcoming 700M Hz spectrum auction .
That auction will feature open access rules ( pushed by Google and others ) on a big chunk of its spectrum , and Verizon was n't real thrilled about those rules back in September , when it sued the FCC over them ( it later relented and pulled the lawsuit ) .
Now , it is embracing open access on all of its existing spectrum .
But those open access rules would have been required for all devices ; Verizon 's own plan is being offered as a complement to its traditional , full - service model , and it expects that most customers will be happy with the access they get now .
Those who are n't , but would love access to the coverage provided by Verizon , can now access the network using whatever devices fit their own needs .
The move also comes as Google announced its intentions both to bid on such spectrum and to release its Android open - source handset OS .
Verizon 's move looks like a canny attempt at undermining some of the interest that has surrounded these announcements , but it 's not as though Google has a real desire to become a national network operator of some kind ; if the wireless carriers voluntarily open their networks to Google apps and services , that 's the most important thing .
In that sense , it appears that the pressure for openness brought by companies like Skype and Google and thinkers like Dr. Tim
Wu have paid off .
Microsoft is also supporting the move .
In a statement , the senior vice president of the Mobile Communications Business , Pieter Knook , said that " Microsoft is very excited to see Verizon Wireless make such a bold move to satisfy the demands of wireless consumers .
As people 's mobile needs become more sophisticated and varied , they will require smarter and more adaptable mobile devices .
We are proud to support any open access that puts more power in people 's hands to connect them to the information they want when and where they want it . "
The move is sure to generate tremendous interest on the part of device makers and the geekerati alike .
So long as Verizon maintains its reputation for having the best national coverage of the major networks ( and can keep prices reasonable ) , it has little to fear even from other wireless operators who open their networks as well .
The result could be a huge win for those consumers willing to pay full price for wireless devices that do what they want them to do .
Much of this will depend on pricing models , of course , but Verizon had nothing to share ; the details are still being worked out .
The future of Britain 's most famous dolphins is at risk from oil and gas exploration , conservationists say .
The bottlenose dolphins of the Moray Firth in Scotland are the best known and most studied dolphins in the UK .
They entertain onlookers with their energetic playing and feeding , and are regularly seen near the shore .
In 2005 they were given their own sanctuary under European law .
But the Government says it is " likely " to grant a licence for sub - seabed oil and gas exploration in the sanctuary , which means the dolphins will be seriously disturbed , according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) .
It says that if oil and gas production goes ahead they will face the threats of waste discharge and oil spills .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The dolphins of the Moray Firth are magnificent and intelligent animals , but they are also incredibly vulnerable .
It is unthinkable that the Government should even consider allowing oil and gas into their sanctuary , " said Sarah Dolman , who manages the WDCS Moray Firth campaign .
" Oil and gas exploration and development includes intense noise caused by very loud seismic exploration , the placement of rigs and associated pollution and drilling , and finally , in decades to come , the removal of the rigs when the supply is exhausted .
Should one licence be allowed , others will surely follow .
This means increasing and ongoing disturbance for the dolphins .
We do not want this precedent to be set . "
She added : " These animals are already facing many threats , including pollution , coastal development , increased boat traffic , food shortage and illegal driftnet fishing .
Oil and gas exploration within a habitat vital for their survival could be the straw that breaks the camel 's back . "
The bottlenose dolphins of the Firth are a small , isolated and vulnerable group – there are only about 130 – which is why a special area of conservation ( SAC ) under the EU habitats directive was designated in 2005 to protect them in their core habitat .
This offers very strong protection under European law .
But seabed exploration blocks in the SAC have been suggested as part of the Government 's 24th offshore oil and gas licensing round , when oil companies bid for licences .
The Energy minister , Malcolm Wicks , has indicated that they may be granted , after a period of consultation which ends next month .
The Government 's argument appears to be that there has been exploration work in the area in the past , which did not seem to harm the dolphins , but conservationists reject this .
" This is a test of whether or not we can have marine wildlife protection " , said Mark Simmons , head of science at theWDCS .
" Oil and gas development in an area that has been set specially aside for dolphin protection is entirely inappropriate .
I think most people in the world would agree with that . "
The Moray Firth dolphins are often seen from the shore at Chanonry Point , near Inverness .
They survive on a diet of fish .
They animals range from 1.9 metres to four metres long , can weigh up to 650 kg , with the dolphins of the Moray Firth being among the largest found anywhere in the world .
Each dolphin in the Moray Firth population is individually identifiable by the markings on its dorsal fin .
Researchers photograph the animals and later compare the images taken with the catalogue of known dolphins to find out which have been seen , where and with which other dolphins .
This builds up a picture of the social structure of the group and also tells us more about the animals ' core habitat .
The WDCS wants the public to protest , and is organising an online petition to Mr Wicks in an attempt to halt the development .
A rich variety of rare wildlife
* The Moray Firth is a triangular inlet of the North Sea that cuts into the north - east of Scotland .
It is the largest inlet of its type in Scotland and has 500 miles of coastline , much of which is cliff .
And given the Firth 's rich variety of wildlife ( it is an EU special protection area ) the coast makes an excellent vantage point for seeing animals rarely seen in or around the UK .
Common dolphins , minke whales and harbour porpoises have all been spotted from the shores of the Firth .
Yet it is the bottlenose that causes great excitement .
With more than 130 of the animals that can measure up to 4 m in length in the area , it is not unusual to be able to see them rising from the icy waters .
The creatures have earned added fame in recent years as protection groups have offered the public the chance to " adopt a dolphin " .
It is not just wildlife in which the Moray Firth is rich , however .
The Beatrice oil field is already established in the outer Firth and , with resources ebbing , developers are looking for other mineral - rich parts of the area to exploit .
Campaigning has been relatively peaceful across the country Zimbabwe 's security forces have been put on full alert ahead of Saturday 's general elections , amid opposition fears of poll - rigging .
Tanks have been patrolling the streets of the capital , Harare .
Armed soldiers have been deployed in other towns .
President Robert Mugabe is facing his strongest challenge since he gained power at independence in 1980 , with two other candidates in the running .
Mr Mugabe insists the vote is fair and everyone should abide by the results .
' Dare '
The chiefs of Zimbabwe 's police , army , prison service and intelligence services gathered in Harare to warn that violence would not be tolerated .
We have been warned that if we vote Mugabe out , there will be war
Villager in Masvingo province
Moment of truth Hope , despair for bloggers Augustine Chihuri , commissioner general of the police , said : " The defence and security forces of Zimbabwe are on full alert from now onwards covering the election period and beyond . "
He said they would " thwart all threats to national security " .
Mr Chihuri also said candidates would not be allowed to declare victory before official results were announced .
On Thursday , Mr Mugabe warned opponents not to protest if they lost .
" Just dare try it , " he said at one of his final rallies .
Mr Mugabe and wife Grace push for votes in Harare A BBC contributor in Masvingo in south - eastern Zimbabwe says there is an increased military presence and fly - pasts by Chinese - made fighter jets .
One 54 - year - old villager told him : " We have been warned that if we vote Mugabe out , there will be war . "
Another Masvingo resident said he would not be cowed by intimidation : " We do not mind even if they deploy soldiers at polling stations - it 's time for Mugabe to go . "
Some 100 soldiers armed with assault rifles are also patrolling in the eastern city of Mutare .
Ghost voters
In his final campaign rally , Mr Mugabe , 84 , repeated his accusation that the opposition were Western puppets .
" This is a vote against the British .
The fight is not against the MDC [ Movement for Democratic Change ] ... the MDC is just a puppet , a mouthpiece of the British , " he told 6,000 people on the outskirts of Harare , according to Reuters news agency .
OPPOSITION POLL CONCERNS
Surplus ballot papers printed
Tens of thousands of " ghost voters " Police allowed inside polling stations
More polling stations in rural areas State media bias Food aid only given to Zanu - PF supporters Chiefs used to campaign for Zanu -PF
Campaign in pictures Q&A : Zimbabwe elections
The MDC denies these charges and says it is fighting to save Zimbabwe 's economy .
The country has the world 's highest inflation rate at more than 100,000 % and just one adult in five are believed to have regular jobs .
Former Finance Minister Simba Makoni , who is running as an independent candidate , said repairing the economy could take " 10 to 15 years " .
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Mr Makoni are Mr Mugabe 's strongest challengers .
On Thursday they issued a joint statement expressing severe concerns about the poll .
They said they had still not received full nationwide voters ' lists that could be verified , and suspected there were many thousands of " ghost voters " .
The MDC says that in Hatcliffe , just north of Harare , some 8,000 people had been registered to vote in a small area where there are only 36 houses .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's a country without hope with a dictator who will stop at nothing to remain in power .
Barry Verona , Ex pat - now Canada
The BBC's Southern Africa correspondent , Peter Biles , says one major worry is that there may not be enough polling stations in urban areas .
He says there is also concern about equal access to the media .
The government has accused Britain and the US of already having decided that the elections will not be free and fair .
However , campaigning has been relatively peaceful , with none of the widespread intimidation of opposition activists seen in polls in recent years .
Both Mr Makoni and Mr Tsvangirai have been able to hold rallies across the country .
A total of 5.9 million people are eligible to vote in Saturday 's joint local , senate , assembly and presidential polls .
A candidate must win more than 50 % of the presidential vote to avoid a run-off in three weeks ' time .
But Mr Mugabe says land and control of economic resources are the main issues .
He blames the UK and the US want to remove him from power to reverse his seizure of white - owned land .

Trendy degrees such as media studies , tourism and complementary medicine have come bottom in a survey of how students rate their courses .
The Government - funded poll of 177,000 students gave the highest ratings to traditional disciplines such as history and classics .
Undergraduates were least likely to be satisfied with the quality of their courses if they studied degrees derided in some quarters as " Mickey Mouse " .
The least contented students were taking courses such as cinematics , photography , imaginative writing , complementary medicine and media studies .
Just 74 per cent of undergraduates doing these degrees said they were satisfied .
Other courses with below - average ratings included publicity studies and tourism , transport and travel .
In contrast , satisfaction ratings for physics and chemistry were 90 per cent , for history 91 per cent , English 87 per cent and classics 93 per cent .
The findings came in a survey of final - year students who were asked to rate their courses for quality of teaching , feedback , academic support , resource and organisation .
The university with the most satisfied students emerged as the Open University , where 95 per cent declared themselves happy with their courses .
It was closely followed by Prince William 's alma mater , St Andrews , on 94 per cent , Buckingham on 93 per cent and Oxford on 92 per cent .
Cambridge students did not fill in enough questionnaires to take part .
Other institutions , including some former polytechnics and specialist art or music colleges , fared less well with scores as low as 53 per cent .
The figures showed that overall , nearly one in five students - 19 per cent - did not believe their courses were up to scratch .
The same proportion did not consider their courses to be " intellectually stimulating " .
A higher proportion - nearly four in ten - were unhappy with the way their work was marked and the feedback they received .
University chiefs suggested this was because they had grown used to re-sitting exams they fail at school .
Leeds University vice - chancellor Michael Arthur , chair of the National Student Survey steering group , said : " Even when you do get essays back in a very timely fashion and with detailed comments - at least detailed in the eyes of those providing them - students still do n't necessarily regard that as good feedback .
" A theory is that there is really quite a significant difference between the type of assessment and feedback that occurs earlier in life through your secondary education and that that occurs at university .
" There are multiple opportunities to resit assessments to improve your score and universities do n't usually work in that way . "
Shadow universities secretary David Willetts said : " This is further evidence that the quality of the student experience is under threat .
" Parents and students need to be confident that their top - up fees are paying for greater teaching commitment . "

We here at BGR love Apple products as much as the next guy , but we think this crossed the line a little bit .
Thanks to tip from a close friend of the Boy Genius Report , we ’ve uncovered a truly amazing exchange between Apple and a customer .
The customer , an owner of a recently water - damaged MacBook Pro , called Apple customer care to get information about repair costs .
Accepting full responsibility for the water damage , the customer was still subjected to confusing and contradictory information about the repair .
Frustrated with his experience , he took matters into his own hands , emailing sjobs@apple.com ( a widely acknowledged direct line to high - level Apple customer care ) .
The customer ’s email is as follows :
Dear Steve Jobs ,
I wanted to write and express my concern about some recent problems that I have had with Apple Care .
This week , my MacBook Pro unfortunately sustained water damage .
I understand this is entirely my fault but it is still something I would like to get fixed .
After three or four calls I was finally able to get a straight answer .
While I was happy to get a straight answer , I was not at all happy with the answer .
It is very worrisome to me that the only way to get my computer fixed is to pay almost $ 300.00 up front with no guarantee that this will fix the problem .
I was horrified to learn that their is no system to assess the problem and bill once all damage is known .
I am reluctant to put money into a problem that could easily grow .
I have had three Apple computers in a row .
I love using them but I am not sure if my replacement will be one .
I feel powerless in the situation and the whole experience has turned me off of the Apple company .
Sincerely ,
Xxxxxx Xxxx
Reasonable ?
We think so .
Shortly after , the customer received the following response :
Xxxxxxx ,
This is what happens when your MacBook Pro sustains water damage .
They are pro machines and they do n’t like water .
It sounds like you ’re just looking for someone to get mad at other than yourself .
Steve
We find that response totally comical !
Do n’t you ?
While we ’re guessing Steve Jobs himself was n’t on the other end of this , it ’s certainly a direct response from the @apple.com domain , which is only available to employees of the company .
This means that someone directly representing Apple was responsible for this stunt .
Come on , Apple .
Seriously , this is n’t a good way to treat your customers , though you do get major points for the witty and comical response .

The Commissioner declared that Adam Streisand has no legal basis to claim that his is Britney Spears new lawyer .
At RubyConf today , Stuart Halloway ’s Refactotum workshop led to a brief but excellent discussion on the various approaches for testing private methods in Ruby .
Ideas ranged from the typical solution of using # send ( which wo n’t work once Ruby 1.9 lands ) to Ryan Davis ’s technique of simply making everything public .
Evan Phoenix , on the other hand , suggested a solution that avoids the soon - to - be - brokeness of using #send while still allowing you to benefit from the inherent intent expressed by defining a method as private .
To demonstrate , let ’s assume we have the following ( admittedly contrived ) class :
class Ninja private def kill ( num_victims ) " #{num_victims} victims are no longer with us . " end end
So how can we make sure that the private method is doing what we want , and do so while testing it in isolation ?
Why not temporarily define a new public method that simply passes through to our elusive private method ?

Coolearth HQ ( TGW ) – Cool Earth Solar has raised $ 21 million for its innovative solar ‘ balloons ’ .
The design of the company ’s product is extremely unique .
Solar ‘ balloons ’ are suspended on wire structures , which frees the land below for other activities , like farming .
The balloons can withstand the elements and up to 100 mph winds .
Because its design uses relatively cheap and readily available components , these solar concentrators can generate electricity at a cost comparable to that of natural - gas plants .
According to Cool Earth Solar , the technology is 25 x cheaper than installed solar panels .
Cool Earth Solar uses a technique called concentrated solar photovoltaics , in which light is magnified onto solar cells to maximize output .
This reduces the number of panels needed in a given area .

We love it when people spend huge amounts of effort building machine , or software packages that end up doing something pretty irrelevant .
It ’s exciting to see how adventurous the human spirit can be .
Given this , we were delighted to see that ‘ angelabuilds ‘ ( Angela Juan ) has build a machine to use an etch - a - sketch as a clock .
Using the wheels at the lower corners of the etch - a - sketch , the machine automatically rotate the two knobs to sketch the time in numbers on the etch - a - sketch .
Then , when the next minute needs drawing , it automatically turns the whole etch - a - sketch over , blanking the screen , getting it ready for drawing the next time .
All when you could just go out and buy a clock for a £ 1 or so .

Increasingly a thing of the past ?
The poll , by The Sleep Council , found that many people admitted checking texts , surfing the internet , or playing games in bed .
It suggests one in four people now regularly sleeps in a different bed from their partner , and many often go to bed at different times .
The average midweek bedtime is between 10 pm and 11 pm , says the survey .
The survey shows that more than half of us regularly feel so tired at work that we would like to go home , with one in eight people feeling that way three or four times a week
Dr Jessica Alexander
The Sleep Council
Jessica Alexander , from the The Sleep Council , which is funded by the bed industry , said : " Busy night time routines are driving couples ' bedtimes and even their bedrooms apart .
" Nine per cent of those questioned admitted to always sleeping separately from their partner . "
One in ten of the 1,400 people questioned said their bedtime routine included saying prayers - but charging up mobiles and other gadgets was a higher priority , with 22 % mentioning this .
Some traditions are still going strong , however , with pyjamas still the most popular choice of nightwear .
Two out of five people said they rarely went to bed at the same time as their partner , and one in three said bed was a good place to make phone calls , or send texts and emails .
One in five visited social networking sites such as Facebook while propped up with pillows , or listened to their MP3 players .
Some bedtime drinks are also not guaranteed to aid sleep - while water , cocoa and other milky drinks are still popular , 9 % of those surveyed said that coffee was a nightcap , with another 9 % opting for alcohol .
All of which adds up to a potentially poor night 's sleep , says the council .
" The survey shows that more than half of us regularly feel so tired at work that we would like to go home , with one in eight people feeling that way three or four times a week , " said Jessica Alexander .
' Not necessarily bad '
Denise Knowles , from Relate , the marriage guidance charity , said that sleeping apart was not necessarily a bad thing for couples .
" It does depend whether , even though they 're sleeping in different beds , they 're still having sex - in some ways , it could be like dating again : ' Your place or mine ? '.
" In fact , sleeping in different beds can be a very considerate thing to do , if there is something like bad snoring which is keeping the other person awake . "
However , she said that one in ten people who contacted Relate cited computer gaming or the internet as a contributor to the troubles in their relationship .
" If you are spending a lot of time on the computer or games machine , it could be detracting from your relationship , and you should ask yourself why you 're doing that , and not spending time with your partner . "
Professor Jim Horne , from the Sleep Research Centre in Loughborough , said that while there was some evidence that computers and televisions in the bedroom disrupted the sleep of children , this was not necessarily the case for adults .
" I do n't think there is any evidence we are sleeping less now than we ever did , " he said .
WASHINGTON  The House voted Thursday to issue contempt citations against the White House chief of staff and a former White House counsel for refusing to cooperate in an investigation into the mass firings of federal prosecutors .
The vote to hold Joshua B. Bolten , the chief of staff , and Harriet E. Miers , the former counsel , in contempt of Congress followed bitter partisan wrangling on the House floor , including a Republican walkout from the chamber , and moved House Democrats closer to a constitutional showdown with President Bush .
The 223 - to - 32 vote to issue the contempt citations , the first approved by Congress against the executive branch since the Reagan administration , is likely to move the dispute to a federal courtroom , with House lawyers calling on a judge to enforce subpoenas against Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers .
The Senate is weighing similar contempt charges against Karl Rove , President Bush ’s former political adviser .
Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers were subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee for information about their part in the dismissal of several United States attorneys last year for what appear to have been political reasons .
The uproar over the firings led to bipartisan calls in Congress for the resignation of former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , who abruptly stepped down last summer .
Democrats Just As Embarrassingly Craven As You Expect
As I 've mentioned , there 's quite a lot Congress can do to prevent Bush from attacking IranÃ ƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â‚ ¬Âif they want to .
So if we find ourselves at war with Iran , it wo n't just be Bush 's responsibility .
It will also belong to a Democratic - controlled Congress .
One of the most powerful of Congress ' tools would be to attach a prohibition of such an attack without their approval to an emergency supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq .
Bush might veto it , but he'd pay a political price for it .
And to Nancy Pelosi 's credit , she at least pretended she wanted to add such language to the House version of the current supplemental .
To her enormous discredit , she 's now folding :
Top House Democrats retreated Monday from an attempt to limit President Bush 's authority for taking military action against Iran as the leadership concentrated on a looming confrontation with the White House over the Iraq war .
Officials said Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of the leadership had decided to strip from a major military spending bill a requirement for Bush to gain approval from Congress before moving against Iran .
Conservative Democrats as well as lawmakers concerned about the possible impact on Israel had argued for the change in strategy .
Here are the only specific Democrats the article cites :
Rep. Shelley Berkley , D - Nev. , said in an interview there is widespread fear in Israel about Iran , which is believed to be seeking nuclear weapons and has expressed unremitting hostility about the Jewish state .
" It would take away perhaps the most important negotiating tool that the U.S. has when it comes to Iran , " she said of the now - abandoned provision .
" I did n't think it was a very wise idea to take things off the table if you 're trying to get people to modify their behavior and normalize it in a civilized way , " said Rep. Gary Ackerman of New York .
That 's a great argument .
Obviously the proposed language would n't " take away " the possibility of the U.S. using force .
It would only take away the possibility of Bush using force without Congressional approval .
In other words , both Berkley and Ackerman want Iran to believe Bush might attack them even if Congress opposes it .
In this , Berkley and Ackerman are regressing from their votes in 2002 to give Bush authority to attack Iraq .
Now they want Bush to be able to attack Iran without even asking their opinion .
Live by the community , die by the community .
Digg founder Kevin Rose 's decision this week to bow to the unyielding demands of his site 's members – rather than the unyielding demands of copyright law – sets the stage for a bet - the - company legal battle between the popular social - networking news site and Hollywood .
After initially complying with a cease - and - desist order to remove posts citing the encryption key for the HD DVD format , the site was deluged with protests and Rose quickly reversed course .
But the outpouring of nerd outrage has continued , and Digg has suddenly found itself leading the charge against the full might of the movie studios , even as it fends off sellout charges from its own members .
( For the latest news on the great Digg / HD DVD fight , check the Epicenter blog . )
The battle highlights both the futility of digital rights management , or DRM , schemes espoused by movie studios as a bulwark against piracy , and the divided allegiances of geek insider community sites like Digg , which stand to lose as much by alienating giant media companies as they do by bowing to their demands , particularly in the hot - button arena of copyright law .
Posts citing the offending code , the hexadecimal series " 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 " that unlocks AACS encryption used on HD DVDs , have multiplied across the web .
Widespread acts of civil disobedience have seen parody posts featuring the code in Photoshopped images , a song and in the answers to a series of questions posed as a riddle .
" This is the revenge of user - generated content , " said Fred von Lohmann , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
At issue in the showdown are broad prohibitions on circumventing copyright - protection schemes that make it illegal to bypass technical restrictions wrapped around movies and music , even if users do so simply to play the media on the device of their choosing , make a backup copy or otherwise use the content legally .
These rules were enshrined in federal law by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 .
The showdown started when AACS Licensing Administrator , a media consortium that created and licenses the AACS disc - encryption scheme , sent notices to a selection of hosting providers and websites over the last two weeks , informing the sites they were hosting content that violated the DMCA 's prohibition on sharing circumvention technology .
( Disclosure : Reddit , which along with Wired News is owned by Wired Digital , received and attempted to comply with a cease - and - desist order from an attorney representing AACS Licensing Administrator more than a week ago . )
By refusing to pull posts disclosing the AACS encryption key , Rose has opened the door to charges of trafficking in circumvention technology .
That 's a civil violation that allows a judge to set damages between $ 200 and $ 2,000 per instance , raising the possibility of a crippling court judgment .
Legal experts interviewed for this article said Digg stands almost no chance of winning this contest in court .
The circumvention provision was first tested in 1999 when young Norwegian hacker Jon Johansen posted code - – called DeCSS – that also unlocked DVDs .
While Johansen triumphed in two suits against him , hacker magazine 2600 lost a trafficking lawsuit when an appeals court upheld a ruling that even links to the code on other websites violated the law .
2600 eventually removed the links from its website , but never faced a fine .
Digg 's potential liability is unclear .
An exact Google search Wednesday afternoon on the hexadecimal code revealed 45,800 hits on the internet at large .
A site search on Digg , by contrast , revealed 1,340 hits .
Assuming that number and violations at the top of the damages range , the bill would reach $ 2.68 million .
One question that has received scant attention so far is the validity of the cease - and - desist orders themselves .
According to the DMCA , trafficking in a " circumvention device " is banned .
If the hexadecimal code is determined to be merely instructions , and not a device , then the AACS Licensing Administrator 's claims of violations could fail .
Stanford University law professor and intellectual property expert Mark Lemley said he believes Digg will lose the case , but would face significantly greater legal risks if the Justice Department stepped in to file criminal charges based on the notion that Digg allowed the posts for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain .
In that case , the violations would be criminal and the damages could go as high as $ 1 million each .
" I could imagine a court reaching to extend liability based on the argument that you are doing this to build loyalty and make more money , " Lemley said .
" That argument carried the day in the case against Napster , but even then it's not clear this is a bet - the - farm situation . "
Wendy Seltzer , a fellow at Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society who founded the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse , which collects and posts take - down notices , added that it 's possible that posters would be individually targeted and that Digg has a good argument that it could n't keep up with the torrent of offending posts .
" A court might take some cues from the safe - harbor provisions for copyright violations and let web hosts provide content without screening it , " Seltzer said .
" The law should n't be read to force site providers into the binary options of either shutting down or facing liability . "
The take - down letters came more than two months after the HD DVD crack first hit the net in February , when a hacker posted it to the Doom9 anti-DRM forums .
That key , combined with the right software and disc title information , enables technically savvy users to do what they will with HD DVD content .
The AACS consortium began updating encryption keys in April to stop the hack from working on discs produced in the future , though any new keys are likely to be comprised quickly .
On April 16 , the organization announced that " it has taken action , in cooperation with relevant manufacturers , to expire the encryption keys associated with the specific implementations of AACS - enabled software .
Consumers can continue to enjoy content that is protected by the AACS technology by refreshing the encryption keys associated with their HD DVD and Blu-ray software players .
This refresh process is accomplished via a straightforward online update . "
Ostensibly , the key expiration would happen through the inclusion of new keys on new discs .
In order to play them , HD DVD player owners would need to download a firmware update to their players .
The AACS Licensing Administrator claims that even though this latest leaked key is a processing key ( that works on all AACS - protected HD DVD discs ) , as opposed to a title key ( unique to a specific disc ) , it will still be possible to update players with the new key using the normal update process .
The AACS Licensing Administrator did not respond to requests for comment .
Digg is n't the only major website pulled into the HD DVD hex - code controversy .
On April 27 , an unnamed user received a take - down notice from Google stating that one of his publicly available Google Notebook pages contained the sequence of hex codes used for decrypting HD DVD movies .
His notebook item linked to a Digg page covering the banned code .
Google 's note stated that it would delete the user 's entire notebook if the offending entry was not removed by April 30 .
Google also noted that it was doing this in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , in response to a take - down notice it had received .
Interestingly , the Google e-mail stated that the notice the company received would be posted to ChillingEffects.org .
( The cease - and - desist notice appears to be this one . )
The user started a WordPress blog and posted the take - down notice , along with the offending code .
As of Wednesday , that blog was gone , with a note saying that the authors of the blog have deleted it .
In the meantime , it appears that Google has not yet made good on its threat .
As of Wednesday afternoon , the offending notebook page – including the banned code – was still online .
On Tuesday , Wikipedia deleted and locked a page referencing the encryption key to prevent the former secret from being posted again , though the number is still visible as the page name .
The Wikipedia page on HD DVD was also locked .
While Digg would seem to have a mass of support from rank - and - file web surfers , many would - be allies are begging off the fight .
Fark founder Drew Curtis , whose humor site seems the natural place to look for Photoshopped images of the cracked HD DVD processing key , has posted an explanation of why , unlike Digg , Fark has complied with take - down notices and removed posts that contained the key :
" We 're not a Silicon Valley venture - capital funded behemoth startup , " he wrote .
" Fark is self - funded and run out of my living room ....
Fark is n't in a financial position to stand up and take on the MCA / MPAA / WTFOMG in a head - to - head legal battle , they 'll crush us into fine paste . "
Rose 's actions are anything but selfless .
After taking down a Digg user 's post that contained the HD DVD key , the Digg community made its displeasure felt .
At several points the Digg homepage contained nothing but posts with titles that included the code .
James Dee , 27 , an ad agency manager from Toronto , said he was banned from Digg after he made about four posts with the code , and was blocked from using the site even after Rose announced his reversal .
" My issue is with the arbitrary enforcement of some rules with no oversight , " Dee said .
" I find it amusing that they can reverse their position but leave users in the cold . "
Faced with a spiraling rebellion , Rose saw the writing on the wall .
Rather than fight his enormous ( and uncontrollable ) user base , Digg threw in the towel .
" But now , after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments , you ’ve made it clear , " Rose write on the Digg blog .
" You ’d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company .
We hear you , and effective immediately we wo n’t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be . "
" If we lose , then what the hell , at least we died trying . "
Although legally dangerous , the reversal in some ways is a return to Rose 's roots .
Just months ago , he was distributing hacking demonstrations freely to all on his video show , thebroken .
Part of the video podcast network
Rose started after his G4TV days , Revision3 still offers free downloads of thebroken , as well as his more popular show , Diggnation .
Thebroken only lasted four episodes , but the amount of hacker tips and social - engineering guides contained within those shows have made the show a classic piece of internet video history .
Rose and his associate Dan Huard traded 40 - ounce malt liquor bottles , played gangsta rap and hacked computers and humans with glee .
Just before the hi-jinks began , a warning would appear on screen : " The following depicted acts may be illegal in some states / countries and is intended for informational use only .
Never break the law . "
After that , most of what viewers are shown could be termed illegal , or at least inadvisable .
At one point during the last episode , co-host Ramzi showed viewers how to break the DRM on a music CD using QTFairUse6 .
After successfully breaking the DRM , Ramzi says , " The DRM is destroyed ! "
Later in the episode , Rose and Huard showed viewers how to illegally copy a game for use on the Xbox 360 using hacked firmware .
Finally , in a scene that is possibly the most ironic considering yesterday ’s HD DVD event on Digg , Rose and Huard are shown standing in front of a Blockbuster store .
Rose says , " Hello , welcome to Blockfister , the easiest way to get DVDs absolutely free . "
Then they instruct viewers to take the DVDs Blockbuster sends you in the mail , decrypt them ( a screenshot is provided showing the decryption process ) , copy them and then send the illegal copy back to Blockbuster .

I tried upgrading to the latest GUI :
ipkg remove asterisk14 - gui
ipkg install asterisk - gui
but had some problems with the CDR reader .
While the
interface seems a little nicer , i would stay with
asterisk 14 - gui for now .
August 27 2008
I reinstalled asterisk on the slug today using
my instructions .
It all seemed to work OK !
I did make a couple of minor changes : I added some
code under the Platform step to automatically start
asterisk on reboot ; I also updated the version numbers
of the asterisk software for the ipkg install step .
FWD is no linger free .
It can still be used
as an example of SIP trunking .

Animal behaviourist Kevin Richardson has such an intimate bond with big cats that he can spend the night curled up with them without the slightest fear of attack .
Richardson , 32 , who is based in a wildlife conservation area near Johannesburg in South Africa , works his unusual magic on other species too .
Cheetahs , leopards and even unpredictable hyenas hold no threats for him .
Scroll down for more ...
So instinctively in tune is he with these beasts , whose teeth are sharp enough to bite through thick steel , that mother hyenas even allow him to hold their newborn cubs without pouncing to the rescue .
But lions are his favourite .
He lavishes them with unconditional love , he says , treating each individual differently , speaking to them , caressing them and , above all , treating them with respect .
Scroll down for more ...
A former student of human physiology who once worked with pre and post - operative human patients , Kevin turned to animals ten years ago when he came to the conclusion that he could trust a lion over one of his own kind every time - well , nearly every time .
A close encounter with an aggressive four - year - old male in the early days taught him a lesson he has not forgotten .
The animal pinned him to the ground and started biting him until something about Kevin 's passive attitude stopped him in his tracks .
Scroll down for more ...
Kevin says he is most confident with animals he has known since birth , but claims he can become close friends with any lion less than a year old , when it is still flexible enough to accept him as part of its own pride .
" I have to rely on my own instincts to gauge an animal or a situation , and I will not approach a creature if something does n't feel right , " he says .
" I do n't use sticks , whips or chains , just patience .
It may be dangerous , but this is a passion for me , not a job . "
Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul is getting the cold shoulder from RedState.com . *
Photo : Associated Press / Nick Wass *
A leading conservative blog says it 's heard more than enough from Ron Paul supporters , thank you .
RedState.com announced Tuesday that all but veteran users are henceforth prohibited from posting messages supporting the long - shot Republican presidential candidate , whose fans have emerged as an usually vocal and motivated presence on internet forums .
" Effective immediately , new users may not shill for Ron Paul in any way shape , form or fashion , " wrote Leon Wolf , one of RedState 's bloggers .
" Not in comments , not in diaries , nada . "
" If your account is less than six months old , you can talk about something else , you can participate in the other threads and be your zany libertarian self all you want , but you cannot pimp Ron Paul , " he added .
" Those with accounts more than six months old may proceed as normal . "
Erick Erickson , RedState 's CEO and editor - in - chief , told Wired News that the decision was sparked by a flood of repetitive pro-Paul messages on forum threads by 20 to 30 Paul supporters , along with some off - color comments .
New users are still welcome to join the site and post comments relevant to ongoing discussions , and even to express support for Paul , said Erickson .
But he said he 'd delete the accounts of those who pepper the discussions with repeated plugs for the candidate .
" These people are not part of the Republican coalition .
It 's somewhat naive to think that these people will stay in the race with Republicans when Ron Paul is no longer in the race , " said Erickson .
" RedState is a private entity and they are free to do as they wish , " said Paul spokesman Jesse Benton in an e-mail .
" Our campaign is not involved in their decision or the work of independent individuals who use their service .
It is ironic , however , that an outlet that bills itself as a clearinghouse of conservative ideas would eschew supporters of the one true conservative in the race . "
With more than 300,000 unique visitors a month and 1.5 million monthly page views , Redstate has a smaller readership than its leading Democratic - leaning counterparts .
But it 's nevertheless influential in the conservative world , making the Paul ban a controversial move .
" The problem for me is that it 's much more than a conservative blog – it's an icon of the blogosphere , " worried David All , a Republican internet - strategy consultant in Washington , D.C .
" This does n't hurt Paul 's credibility as much as it does Redstate 's , " wrote blogger Ed Morrissey on his blog Captain 's Quarters .
" While Paul 's supporters tend towards the annoying and repetitive , they have less impact because we can easily engage them and counter their arguments .
Banning them simply for their support for a candidate seems more like an admission that RedState lacks that ability . "

Ron Paul : How a Fringe Politician Took Over the Web
Des Moines --
With 40 percent of Iowa 's Republican caucus voters expected to come from the ranks of conservative Christians , peace activists occupied Mike Huckabee 's campaign headquarters in Iowa 's capital city today with signs asking the former Baptist minister , " Who Would Jesus Bomb ? "
Eight members of the Iowa Occupation Project and Voices for Creative Nonviolence arrived at Huckabee 's Locust St. campaign office early Monday afternoon , waiting for the former Arkansas governor 's reply to a letter delivered two months ago that sought his pledge to completely withdraw from Iraq within 100 days of assuming office ; halt all military actions against Iraq and Iran ; fund the rebuilding of Iraq as well as health , education and infrastructure needs in the U.S. ; and " ... the highest quality health care , education and jobs training benefits for veterans of our country 's Armed Services . "
Brian Terrell , director of the Catholic Peace Ministry in Des Moines , said approximately 35 reporters , including a number of international journalists , were at Huckabee 's office during the protest .
Terrell said in addition to the " Who Would Jesus Bomb ? " banner , the eight protesters held signs that read , " End Iraq War " and " No War with Iran , " sang the refrain from " Auld Lang Syne , " chanted ŒWho Would Jesus Bomb ? ' and then read names of Iraqis and U.S. soldiers killed in the war .
Sgt. Vincent Valdez of the Des Moines Police Department said officers responded to an early afternoon complaint from the Huckabee Campaign office and arrested Robert Braam , Mona Shaw and Kathy Kelly , on charges of trespassing .
He said the three were among a group " holding signs , singing and reading aloud , basically making a disturbance . "
Valdez said the officers had no trouble making the arrests and the three were taken to the Polk County jail .
In a news release issued earlier by the Des Moines Catholic Worker , Kelly , co-director of VCNV , was quoted as saying , " We 're very respectful of the Iowa caucus process and the long history behind it but we feel quite strongly that the issues of this war must be inserted into the process of narrowing down the candidates for the presidential election . "
Huckabee spokesperson , Eric Woolson , could not be reached for comment after several attempts .

What 's in a name ?
Before Michael Buday married his fiancée , Diana Bijon , he decided to honor her family by bucking tradition and taking her last name .
But , it was n't so easy .
Under California state law , he needed to pay more than $ 300 , go to court , file a petition , and publicly advertise his name change for four weeks in a local newspaper .
If he had simply gone along with tradition , it would have cost only $ 50 to $ 80 .
So Buday , 29 , went to court , along with the ACLU , to change the law .
They recently announced their plans to sue the California Department of Health Services , which oversees marriage licenses and name changes .
After years of fighting for women 's rights , the ACLU is now battling for equal rights for men .
California is one of 44 states with unequal name change laws for people getting married .
Right now , only six states -- Georgia , Hawaii , Iowa , Massachusetts , New York and North Dakota -- explicitly allow a man to change his name through marriage with the same ease as a woman can .
California is not the only state with a high price tag for a groom 's name change .
In Illinois , a man wishing to take his wife 's surname must fork over $ 246 for a petition and another $ 150 to publish the change in a newspaper .
Connecticut 's price is slightly lower , at only $ 150 for a court petition .
According to the ACLU , the obstacles facing a husband who wishes to adopt his wife 's last name violate the equal protection clause provided by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution .
" California has the perfect marriage application for the 17th century , " said Mark Rosenbaum , legal director of the ACLU of Southern California .
" The laws reflect a mind - set that the wife is to be subordinate to the husband . "
In California , a surname change for the husband is not even an option during the marriage process .
Instead , the man must go through a regular name change process , as if he were changing his first name from Bob to Jim .
When contacted , the California Department of Health Services would not comment on the current state of the law .
" At every junction , the message is ' select the name of the husband , ' " Rosenbaum said .
Buday was unavailable for comment , but he was quoted in an ACLU press release as saying , " It 's not about the money , it 's about the principle of families being able to make their own decisions .
Diana 's dad has become my father figure , and I want to honor that . "
Gloria Allred , a top women 's rights attorney in Los Angeles , fully supports the ACLU 's efforts .
" In California we have made a deliberate effort to try to remove from state laws and regulations any distinctions or burdens made on gender , " she said .
As for Buday 's personal decision to adopt his wife 's last name , Allred adds that " the point is not if he wishes to change his name , but that he has a right to do it . "
Buday , she says , is set apart from most men because " he is secure enough " to take his wife 's surname .
Of course civil rights lawyers back Buday , but what would an etiquette coach say ?
Jodi Smith , head of Mannersmith etiquette consulting , also backs him .
" I do see this as a gender equality issue , " she says .
" Now that women are considered ' real ' and ' legal ' people , last names should be a matter of choice . "
Will the male name swap soon become a trend ?
No data exists on how common the practice is .
But many couples in recent years have chosen to combine their last names .
For instance , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ( born Antonio Villar ) and his wife , Corina Raigosa , combined their names when they were married in 1987 .
Although Buday must still legally use his " maiden name , " the couple reportedly signed their Christmas cards as Mr. and Mrs. Bijon .
New TSA Report
A classified 2006 TSA report on airport security has been leaked to USA Today .
( Other papers are covering the story , but their articles seem to be all derived from the original USA Today article . )
There ’s good news :
This year , the TSA for the first time began running covert tests every day at every checkpoint at every airport .
That began partly in response to the classified TSA report showing that screeners at San Francisco International Airport were tested several times a day and found about 80 % of the fake bombs .
Constant testing makes screeners “ more suspicious as well as more capable of recognizing ( bomb ) components , ” the report said .
The report does not explain the high failure rates but said O’Hare ’s checkpoints were too congested and too wide for supervisors to monitor screeners .
At San Francisco , “ everybody realizes they are under scrutiny , being watched and tested constantly , ” said Gerald Berry , president of Covenant Aviation Security , which hires and manages the San Francisco screeners .
San Francisco is one of eight airports , most of them small , where screeners work for a private company instead of the TSA .
The idea for constant testing came from Ed Gomez , TSA security director at San Francisco , Berry said .
The tests often involve an undercover person putting a bag with a fake bomb on an X - ray machine belt , he said .
Repeated testing is good , for a whole bunch of reasons .
There ’s bad news :
Howe said the increased difficulty explains why screeners at Los Angeles and Chicago O’Hare airports failed to find more than 60 % of fake explosives that TSA agents tried to get through checkpoints last year .
The failure rates — about 75 % at Los Angeles and 60 % at O’Hare — are higher than some tests of screeners a few years ago and equivalent to other previous tests .
Sure , the tests are harder .
But those are miserable numbers .
And there ’s unexplainable news :
At San Diego International Airport , tests are run by passengers whom local TSA managers ask to carry a fake bomb , said screener Cris Soulia , an official in a screeners union .
Someone please tell me this does n’t actually happen .
“ Hi Mr. Passenger .
I ’m a TSA manager .
You know I ’m not lying to you because of this official - looking laminated badge I have .
We need you to help us test airport security .
Here ’s a ‘ fake ’ bomb that we ’d like you to carry through security in your luggage .
Another TSA manager will , um , meet you at your destination .
Give the fake bomb to him when you land .
And , by the way , what ’s your mother ’s maiden name ? ”
How in the world is this a good idea ?
And how hard is it to dress real TSA managers up like vacationers ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 10/24 ) :
Here ’s a story of someone being asked to carry an item through airport security at Dulles Airport .
EDITED TO ADD ( 10/26 ) : TSA claims that this does n’t happen :
TSA officials do not ask random passengers to carry fake bombs through checkpoints for testing at San Diego International Airport , or any other airport . [… ]
TSA Traveler Alert :
If approached by anyone claiming to be a TSA employee asking you to take something through the checkpoint , please contact a uniformed TSA employee at the checkpoint or a law enforcement officer immediately .
Is there anyone else who has had this happen to them ?

USNews via Atrios :
People wondering why Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suddenly moved to reduce the bank borrowing rate by three quarters of a point should know that in private he has expressed growing pessimism about the economy .
Whispers has learned that has told people in recent weeks that the economic situation some see falling into recession will be much worse than he has admitted to publicly .
We ’re told by those who ’ve heard him that he says the first six months of this year will be “ bad , ” an adjective that some interpret this as signaling there is better than a 50 - 50 chance for a recession .
Even worse , the former Princeton prof believes the ensuing recovery will be “ weak ” because of persistent problems in the housing market that will result in subdued consumer spending .
How can the faltering bonds between Israel and Diaspora Jewry be strengthened ?
The Prime Minister ’s Office has been recently considering initiatives to accomplish just such a goal with a project entitled “ enhancing the bond between Israel and world Jewry , and the affiliation of Jews aboard to the State of Israel . ”
A conference was furthermore held this week on this new Jewish initiative , organized by Cabinet Secretary Oved Yehezkel with the support of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Drifting Apart Prof. Dror : Israel , world Jewry drifting apart Ynet President of Jewish People Policy Planning Institute points to wearing of relationship between Jews in Diaspora , Israel ; says Jewish state is ' no longer viewed as safe - haven , source of pride ’
Prof.
Dror : Israel , world Jewry drifting apart
World Jewry in dire straits
The conference was replete with grim statistics highlighting the bleak state of world Jewry , and its waning connection to the State of Israel .
Half of Jews abroad are intermarrying , and a staggering 50 % of Jewish American youngsters said they would not care much if Israel ceases to exist .
In fact , only 20 % of Diaspora Jews consider themselves as “ having strong ties to the state of Israel ” .
The bottom line arrived at during the conference is thus that Israel is rapidly “ losing ” its bonds with Diaspora Jews .
Furthermore , the conference also concluded that the state of world Jewry is also in dire straits .
A new survey conducted by the ADL in six European countries uncovered that 50 % of their population feels that Jews are disloyal to their country .
German Jews revealed that they are subjected nearly daily to anti-Semitic slurs .
Israel thus , maintained participants at the conference , must approach Jews abroad in a sense of unity , shared destiny and open communication , rather than just appealing for aid and support .
To that end conference delegates proposed the establishment of a committee , chaired by Yehezkel , Herzog and Bielski that will examine practical measures Israel can take to reach out to Jewish communities abroad .
Among some of the measures that have already been proposed are launching a PR campaign that will “ market ” Israel as an advanced , modern country that is eager to absorb new Jewish immigrants from across the globe , increased government funding for initiatives such as Birthright Israel and Taglit that allow youngsters to visit Israel and encounter young Israeli peers , as well as the establishment of Jewish cultural centers abroad that will showcase various Israeli artists and singers and provide Hebrew lessons for the local Jewish community .
Professor Shenhar also proposed establishing an International Jewish University in Israel that can attract Jewish students from across the globe .
' Tactical mistake ' to focus on me , Bush warns Democrats David Edwards
Published : Sunday February 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This According to the man currently holding the seat that Democratic Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama aspire to , it would be a " tactical mistake " to focus on him .
President Bush spoke with Chris Wallace about the 2008 Presidential campaigns on Fox News Sunday , and for the first time , indicated support for John McCain publicly .
John McCain is a " true conservative , " President Bush says , although the presumptive Republican presidential nominee may have to work harder to convince other conservatives that he is one of their own .
Bush said the Arizona senator , who he once opposed in a heated GOP primary years ago , " is very strong on national defense . "
" He is tough fiscally , " Bush added .
" He believes the tax cuts ought to be permanent .
He is pro-life .
His principles are sound and solid as far as I 'm concerned . "
But when asked about criticism of McCain by conservative commentators Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter , the president said , " I think that if John is the nominee , he has got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative and I 'll be glad to help him if he is the nominee . "
Bush said some of the criticism of the Arizona senator was the result of " probably , some personal animosity toward me .
You can't please all the people all the time . "
Asked during the interview about GOP candidate Mike Huckabee 's criticism of his foreign policy , Bush said : " I 'm sure that you can find quotes from people running for office that sound like they 're at odds with me .
But the point  what really matters in a campaign what are the basic beliefs . "
Regarding attacks on his performance from Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , Bush said , " If the Democrat party feels like they can win an election by focusing on me , I think they 'll be making a huge tactical mistake . "
Of Obama , the president said , " I certainly do n't know what he believes in . "
Bush said he disagrees with those who have accused former President Clinton of racism for his attacks on Obama and said he can understand why his predecessor " wants to campaign hard for his wife . "
The president dealt with a number of other topics during his conversation with moderator Chris Wallace .
The interview was taped Saturday at the Camp David presidential retreat and Fox released a transcript in advance of the broadcast .
_ On the economy : " I think the experts would tell you we are not in recession .
...
But I will tell you that the signs are troubling enough that we all came together and got a robust ( economic stimulus ) package out . "
Bush is scheduled to sign the legislation Wednesday .
Beyond that , he said , " We just have to play it by ear . "
_ On the legality of waterboarding and other techniques used to interrogate suspected terrorists : " Whatever we have done was legal , and whatever decision I will make will be reviewed by the Justice Department to determine whether or not the legality is there . "
_ On the long - term U.S. relationship with Iraq : " We will be there at the invitation of the Iraqi government .
...
We wo n't have permanent bases .
I do believe it is in our interests and the interests of the Iraqi people that we do enter into an agreement on how we are going to conduct ourselves over the next years . "
_ On Iran : " I feel pretty good about making sure that we keep the pressure on Iran .
To pressure them so that they understand they 're isolated .
To pressure them to affect their economy .
To pressure them to the point where we hope somebody rational shows up and says , OK , it 's not worth it anymore . "
_
On targeting suspected terrorists by allowing surveillance of phone calls and e-mails of people inside the U.S. : " It 's been a difficult issue for me because I am  listen , I no more want to trample the civil liberties of the American people than anybody else does .
On the other hand , I understand the nature of these people .
And I understand the complexities of trying to protect the American people . "
_ On speculation about his relationship with his father , the first President Bush , and its possible impact on his own presidency : " It 's shallow .
Shallow psychobabble .
... A bunch of people obviously got too much time on their hands . "
_
On his legacy : " As far as history goes and all of these quotes about people trying to guess what the history of the Bush administration is going to be , you know , I take great comfort in knowing that they do n't know what they are talking about , because history takes a long time for us to reach . "

Tourists gather by the Trevi fountain in Rome in this file photo from August 12 , 2003 .
REUTERS / Tony Gentile
ROME ( Reuters ) - Water supplying
Rome ’s world - famous Trevi Fountain was cut off when a builder across town damaged a 2,000 - year - old pipe , the local water company said on Wednesday .
Water had been flowing into central Rome through the “ aqueduct of the virgin ” since 19 BC , but it mysteriously dried up earlier this month , cutting supplies to several fountains , including the Baroque masterpiece Trevi .
A search using a waterborne video camera through the ancient pipe tracked the blockage to a house in the high - end Parioli neighbourhood on the other side of the Villa Borghese park , where builders were making a private underground car park .
A spokesman for the ACEA water company said the builder had broken the pipe , then tried to mend it with concrete , but instead had filled it in .
“ We ’re undergoing technical checks and reckon it will take a couple of months to repair , ” he said .
Tourists at Trevi -- where Anita Ekberg frolicked in the 1960s film La Dolce Vita -- did not notice the damage as the fountain was on recycle mode rather than drawing water direct from the pipe .
But many smaller Rome fountains spluttered to a halt and the Trevi Fountain itself will soon need to have its water replaced .
While ACEA works on repairing the pipe -- and seeks damages against the builder -- it will divert water from another , younger pipe .
The “ aqueduct of Paul ” has been bringing water to Rome from a lake north of the city only since 2 AD .
Louise pictured with her son , Ben , had major surgery .
Credit : Apex
Louise Banks , aged 23 from Exeter , collapsed regularly when exercising but was told it was epilepsy .
When she was 16 , trainers at her local gym realised she had a serious problem , but the condition was not diagnosed until January this year .
The one and a half inch ( 4 cm ) hole has now been repaired by surgeons .
Louise , who has a four - year - old son , first knew something was wrong at the age of eight when she collapsed at her primary school and was sent to hospital .
She was diagnosed as " a fainty child " and sent back to school .
Louise 's case is quite unusual , especially as her heart has also coped with the added strain of pregnancy
Ellen Mason , British Heart Foundation
By the age of 14 she could feel her heart stopping and starting again with a jump up to 70 times a day .
When she joined a gym aged 16 the training instructors were stunned to see her heart rate drop when she used a running machine .
They urged her to see a doctor but , again , her condition was misdiagnosed .
She nearly died during the birth of her son , Ben , because her heart fluttered erratically .
Ultrasound
Only now , at the age of 23 , has she discovered the problem was a massive hole in the heart .
It was spotted in January when she saw a new GP at her local practice .
He sent her for an ultrasound scan - the first she had had , which revealed the unusually large hole between two chambers of the heart .
It was allowing oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood , causing her to collapse .
Louise , who lives with her partner Matthew Folland , underwent a six - hour operation to close the hole at Southampton General Hospital .
She has been left with no lasting effects apart from a 10 - inch ( 25 cm ) scar on her chest .
" I always knew there was something wrong , I could feel my heart start and stop .
It was like a baby wriggling in my chest , " she said .
" I do n't feel angry with the doctors for missing it - I would rather have been operated now than 23 years ago when science was n't so advanced . "
Louise , who now wants to train as a paramedic , plans to organise a ball to raise funds for charity , at which she will be able to dance properly for the first time .
" I 'm looking forward to my new life .
It will be great to be able to dance without collapsing . "
Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation said large holes in the heart are normally diagnosed at a much younger age .
" Louise 's case is quite unusual , especially as her heart has also coped with the added strain of pregnancy .
" Louise was fortunate to have a doctor who noticed her symptoms , because carrying on untreated with a hole in the heart of this size would have eventually put intolerable strain on her heart .
She added : " Medical technology has advanced since Louise was born , especially in the area of prenatal screening , so it seems likely that a hole in the heart of this size would be detected at an earlier stage nowadays . "
We have seen the interesting sewerages of Japan Canada & Germany .
But that 's not the whole world .
Here are some pictures of other parts of the world that shows the reality too .
Just by closing the eyes the day does n't turn to night .
We did receive a lot of comments when Japanese sewers were posted , some said its like space ship while others said it looks like a sci- fi inspiration gallery , like something out of The Fifth Element , like levels on Halo & all , now lets see what you got to say on these sewers where humans are staying in inhuman conditions .

Paul , the Texas congressman who distinguished himself as the only Republican presidential candidate opposing the Iraq war , gained a devoted following , harnessing the power of the Internet to raise more cash than more mainstream rivals .
But that same anti-war , libertarian bent that gave Paul national recognition nearly came back to bite him at home .
Paul , who ran for the White House as a libertarian in 1988 but gained more of a following this year as a Republican , did not suspend his presidential campaign , but was forced to scale back his national operation to focus on the race for his Congressional seat in Texas .
" I do think the presidential race has exposed some of his values and principles that are not in line with his district , and that exposure has done him harm at home , " Republican primary challenger Chris Peden said of Paul .
But in the end , Peden fell short , allowing Paul to resume his presidential campaign , although Senator John McCain , R - Ariz . , wrapped up the nomination with a sweep of wins in Ohio , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Paul 's native Texas .
Challenger : ' Republican of Convenience '
Peden , Paul 's challenger and a CPA and city councilman in Friendswood , Texas , said Paul 's national campaign awakened voters in the 14th District to exactly how much of a firebrand Paul is .
" He 's a lifelong libertarian , " Peden said in a telephone interview prior to Tuesday 's vote .
" He is only a Republican of convenience , not a Republican of conviction .
He 's a libertarian who runs as a Republican because a libertarian can't get elected in this district . "
Despite calls from his supporters , Paul insists he will not run for president as an independent .
But he has pledged to continue his Republican presidential bid , knowing full well that the odds — and delegate math — are now firmly against him .
Peden attacked Paul for missing votes in the House while he campaigned for president , not spending enough time in the 14th District and most important , for choosing ideological high ground over doing the job of a congressman , which is enacting legislation .
But even his opponent — and , apparently , his constituents — still respect the job Paul is doing in Congress .
A year ago , Peden wrote a laudatory letter about Paul and his decision to run for president — a letter Paul read aloud at campaign events .
In a fundraising letter to supporters when he shifted gears from his presidential to Congressional race , Paul feared voters may reject his bid for reelection in favor of a more traditional conservative .
" The D.C. neocons think their old dream is about to come true , " he wrote .
" They think they can defeat me in the Republican congressional primary in Texas , March 4 .
And you know what ?
They may be right . "
Fortunately for Paul — and his band of revolutionaries — they were not .
Is Tooth Cleaning a Scam ?
One of my earliest and happiest memories was being released from a hospital oxygen tent when I was a small child .
I had developed pneumonia and was in pretty bad shape .
They not only kept me under an oxygen tent for several days at St. Luke ’s Hospital in Kansas City , but they also gave me massive amounts of tetracycline .
The good news is that I recovered .
The bad news is that from then on , my teeth have had pretty severe tetracycline staining .
This is not just surface discoloration — my enamel through and through is grayer than I ’d like .
I tell you this because I ’ve always had an uncomfortable relationship with my teeth , and this feeling might bias my view of dentists .
I do n’t like going to my dentist ’s office every six months and having my teeth cleaned .
Recently , as I was sitting in the chair , a thought occurred to me .
I began to wonder if there was such a thing as “ evidence - based dentistry . ”
In my book Super Crunchers ( naked self - promotion ) , I wrote an entire chapter about evidence - based medicine — which is , in part , an effort to test whether medical treatments are statistically proven to be effective .
I figured there had to be a parallel movement in dentistry , and maybe someone had analyzed whether hygienist teeth cleaning helps or not .
Thank God for Google .
It turns out there is an entire journal called “ Evidence Based Dentistry . ”
And in just a few minutes , I was looking at a formal Cochrane review titled “ Insufficient evidence to understand effect of routine scaling and polishing . ”
The review looked for evidence to answer two related questions :
The first is , do scale and polish procedures [ having your teeth cleaned ] lead to any difference in periodontal health compared with no scale and polish ?
Second , does the interval between these scale and polishing procedures make any difference ?
The results were not heartening for those of us who have suffered through dozens upon dozens of cleanings .
The meta analysis of qualifying studies suggested that the evidence was mixed , at best .
For example , there is not strong evidence that hygienist cleaning reduces gingivitis :
[ T ]he authors of the only study that found differences in gingivitis scores ( at 6 , 12 and 22 months ) deemed those differences clinically irrelevant … .
One reasonable reaction to this is to simply reject the Cochrane review methodology .
Evidence - based medicine ranks the quality of different types of evidence — and tends to give inordinate weight to randomized control trials .
Indeed , Cochrane reviews often give no weight to the results of any non-randomized clinical study .
As the review acknowledges :
[ This Review ] carries with it the limitation inherent in most of these reviews , of including only randomized clinical trials .
For this particular question , the quantity of non-randomized trials identified in the exclusion list suggests that an independent review of this more ‘‘ risky ” literature might be profitable .
But another reaction is to question whether it is really necessary to put dental patients through so much financial and physical discomfort .
Dentists , like other agents ( real estate agents , car sales people ) , do not have the best economic incentives when advising how much to clean .
My dad always told me that dealership rust - proofing was a scam to give dealerships some extra cash without providing your car with any extra protection .
Could getting your teeth cleaned be the economic equivalent to having a car dealership rust - proof your car ?
Like I said before , this post is probably just working out some wounded inner child issue .
( And let me be clear that I ’m not calling into question the value of brushing and flossing your teeth , or visiting your dentist regularly to check for cavities , as well as other potential problems ) .
But it ’s food for thought .
The next time your dentist asks you to make an appointment to have your teeth cleaned , you might reasonably ask , “ Why ? ”
A type of gene mutation long known to extend the lives of worms , flies and mice also turns up in long - lived humans .
Researchers found that among Ashkenazi Jews , those who survived past age 95 were much more likely than their peers to possess one of two similar mutations in the gene for insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R ) .
The mutations seem to make cells less responsive than normal to insulinlike growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) , a key growth hormone secreted by the liver .
In past studies , IGF1 disruption increased the life span of mice by 30 to 40 percent and delayed the onset of age - related diseases in the animals .
The finding suggests that the IGF1R mutations confer added " susceptibility " to longevity , perhaps in concert with other genetic variants , the research team reports in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA .
" This is the tip of an iceberg of potential genetic alterations or mutations that are associated with longevity , " says study co-author Pinchas Cohen , a professor and chief of endocrinology at Mattel Children 's Hospital at U.C.L.A. ( University of California , Los Angeles ) .
IGF1 is well known among longevity genes .
A regulator of growth and differentiation , it has a strong effect on body size , accounting for size extremes in dogs , for example .
Animals fed restricted calorie diets live longer and show lower levels of IGF1 .
( Also implicated are changes in activity of the sirtuin or SIRT protein family . )
When engineered specifically to produce less of the hormone , they do n't grow as large , but their life span is 30 to 50 percent longer .
The case in humans was less clear .
Searching for clues , researchers turned to a group of 384 Ashkenazi Jewish seniors with a family history of longevity , aged 95 to 108 ( average age 97.7 ) , recruited by Cohen 's collaborator Nir Barzilai , director of the Institute for Aging Research at Yeshiva University 's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City .
A control group of 312 living and dead individuals ( average age 67.8 ) , also Ashkenazi Jews , had no family history of longevity .
The team could not compare the two groups directly .
" The problem with studying centenarians , " Cohen notes , " is the control group died 30 years ago . "
Their solution was to look at each group 's offspring , looking for signs of inherited mutations .
They found that among the offspring of centenarians ( approximately 70 years old ) , the women were an average of 0.98 inch ( 2.5 centimeters ) shorter than female children of the control group .
Scanning the genes of these shorter offspring , researchers discovered two IGF1R mutations possessed by nine of the centenarians but only one of the control subjects .
Blood levels of IGF1 level were 35 percent higher in these centenarians who had mutations than in the control group ( although their heights were not significantly different ) .
Cohen says the body may increase production of the hormone to try to make up for a less sensitive receptor .
Males may be unaffected by the mutation , he says , because other genes make them more susceptible to IGF1 .
The hormone somatostatin can reduce IGF1 circulation in humans , but Cohen cautions against being too hasty in fingering IGF1as an anti-aging miracle .
" It 's likely that centenarians have not just one lucky gene , but several , " he says .
He adds that he and Barzilai are examining other genes such as the one for human growth hormone , which stimulates IGF1 production .
" Until we know what cocktail it should really be , " he says , " do n't try it at home . "

Hurley was speaking for a whole bunch of Lost fans when he said that , and thanks to a strike - shortened Season Four ( only eight episodes in the can ) we 're wondering just how many answers we 're going to get .
Unfortunately , we 're pretty sure not even the writers have answers to the mysteries we want solved most ... or at least not good ones .
" OK , that thing in the woods - - maybe it 's a monster , maybe it 's a pissed - off giraffe .
I do n't know !
The fact that no one is even looking for us , yeah , that 's weird , but I just go along with it because I 'm along for the ride !
Good old fun -time Hurley !
Well , guess what ?
Now I want some friggin ' answers ! "
5 What 's the deal with Walt ?
Amid the ragtag team of survivors , somewhere between the quasi - superhero doctor and the background - dwelling Scott ( or is it Steve ? ) on the screen time ladder , there used to be a small black kid named Walt .
Several episodes early on hinted at mental powers allowing for everything from weather control to the ability to attract wild , often dangerous , animals with the power of his thoughts .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Later he returned in a vision , to provide the survivors of Flight 815 with important information through the somewhat dickish use of backwards talking .
At one time Walt seemed to be key to the fate of the survivors .
Unfortunately for the show 's producers , while time on the island moved at the leisurely pace of a month - or - two every season , the actor portraying Walt , Malcolm David Kelley , had this annoying tendency to age a full year with every calendar year that passed .
Walt in Season One , Season Two , and an artist 's rendering of his projected appearance in Season Six .
The answer was to write Walt and his father , Michael , out of the show , which came to fruition when they boated into the wild blue yonder at the end of Season Two , leaving behind a whole pile of unanswered questions .

Some theories :
In what is widely regarded as the most retarded of the fan theories , it has been speculated that Walt and Aaron , the recently born child of Claire , are both magical children and will prove to be the countering " dark " and " light " forces of the island .
At first blush , the theory hangs together perfectly , especially since the black / white contrast has been prevalent throughout the show 's run .
However , we have since found a snag in this theory : through some diligent research , we have come to discover that not all black people are evil by default .
Also , Aaron 's just a baby , and while pre-teens may not be the toughest sons - of - bitches in the world , if this struggle comes to pass , we 're laying heavy money on Walt simply punting Aaron into submission .

Others think
Walt can merely astral project himself ( meaning he can have out - of - body experiences at will ) as part of his magical superpowers .
Though this does little to explain why his voice is a full octave lower with each appearance .
We 're sorry , but if you were hoping for a non-magical answer to this one , you 're probably out of luck .
If you were looking for all your answers to come from sound science , try some other show , like CSI .
OK , bad example .
Will They Tell Us ?
You 'd better hope so , because Michael ( played by Harold Perrineau ) will be back for Season 4 , and if Walt does n't come with him , we can all look forward to another season of Michael looking disheveled and shouting " Walt ! " several hundred times .

Of course , Walt returning does n't in any way guarantee he 'll bring answers with him .
Do n't be surprised if the writers spend all their time trying to explain why the supposed 10 - year - old grows a fuller beard than Jack .
The ZCam is the first low - cost , consumer videocamera that can capture video with depth information and probably the first real challenger to Nintendo 's Wiimote : with its 3D capture abilities it will allow you to play Wii - style without using any controls whatsoever .
In fact , it is so precise that it will even recognize your finger gestures to fire a weapon or manipulate your computer like in Minority Report , but without gloves or any other external device :
Advertisement
The camera has sensors that are able to measure the depth for each of the captured pixels using a principle called Time - Of - Flight .
It gets 3D information " by emitting pulses of infra-red light to all objects in the scene and sensing the reflected light from the surface of each object . "
The objects in the scene are then ordered in layers in the Z axis , which gives you a grayscale depth map that a game or any software application can use .
According to manufacturer 3DV
Systems , the depth resolution is quite good : it can detect 3D motion and volume down to 0.4 inches , capturing at the same time full color , 1.3 megapixel video at 60 frames per second .
While there have been professional cameras with depth capture in the past , this is the first time that a device of such characteristics is cheap enough to be built into any game system or computer .
Advertisement
As you can see in the video , the ZCam is completely different from the EyeToy or any other normal 2D webcam .
Even while it's not as precise and flexible as a real full 3D motion tracking system , the videos show that it can indeed provide with a new level of interactivity in video games and any application — like computer user interface manipulation .
While the results could be quite impressive , I 'm not convinced about some of the applications .
The flight simulator , for example , seems to work great .
However , unlike boxing , I have the feeling that I would n't be able to control a plane without actually grabbing something .
Of course , I can pick anything to give me that feeling , just like a Nintendo Wiimote .
But then again , in flight simulator games you want an actual joystick , so the " phantom " feeling of not having force feedback is the same for the ZCam and the Wiimote .
For any other game , like first person shooters , this kind of technology could be really good if it lives up to its promise and developers can fully exploit it .
Its virtues could be even easier to apply in computer applications .
The demonstration in the video , with the guy manipulating Vista with hand gestures , gives you a very good idea .
As I use my iMac 24 to type this , I wish I can just wave my hand in the air quickly to consult a PDF , like Minority Report 's Tom Cruise but without jumping in the sofa and scaring Oprah .
Or touching , moving and clicking the mouse .

Since the ZCam is a piece of circuitry that can be integrated anywhere , and without taxing the CPU , I do n't see why companies like Apple or Dell would n't adopt them for future desktop and portables .
However , the technology has just been officially announced this week and it 's too soon too tell .
Whatever happens , it 's good to see such a device coming to the market .
Hopefully , we will see it in action with real world applications soon .

Faith groups want more aid for poor nations BAY AREA
An array of Bay Area religious leaders banded together Wednesday to announce plans to lobby Congress to increase foreign aid to poor countries for at least the next seven years .
The unprecedented lobbying effort was paired with a call to the Bay Area 's myriad faith communities to join in what the religious leaders see as the defining issue facing the globe today .
" It 's inconsistent and hypocritical to say our gospel is for all peoples of all nations , but ... we 're not committed to the welfare of those people , " said Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco George Niederauer .
The University of San Francisco , a Jesuit university , hosted the gathering Wednesday of interfaith leaders .
Representatives from Jewish , Muslim and Wiccan groups attended , as did leaders from a slew of Christian denominations .
Organizers focused their attention on those living in the world 's most extreme poverty , the roughly 2.6 billion people who live on less than $ 2 per day .
They include roughly 1.1 billion people who fight for survival on less than a dollar a day .
The interfaith coalition wants the U.S. government to increase its foreign aid spending up to a total of 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product by 2015 .
Doing so would reach goals established in 2000 by the U.N. Millennium Summit .
Currently , the United States spends $ 35.8 billion , or 0.2 percent of its GDP , on foreign aid .
The group is calling for a 5 percent annual increase - which would still leave it at roughly 0.28 percent of the GDP by 2015 , far short of its goal .
Several of those gathered at the luncheon said the anti-poverty initiative requires a rethinking of the nation 's values .
A video shown during the event featured economist Jeffrey Sachs , who said the Pentagon 's daily budget of $ 1.5 billion is enough to provide five years of malaria protection for all of Africa .
George A. Wesolek , director of public policy for the Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco , said it is embarrassing that the richest country in the history of the world would spend so little on foreign aid to help the poor .
" That 's a scandal , " he said .
The Rt. Rev. Marc Andrus , the Episcopal Bishop of California , said poverty abroad is far greater than what is seen in the United States .
But addressing global poverty should not be at the expense of anti-poverty efforts in the Bay Area - such as in the Bayview , Hunters Point and the city of Richmond .
" The theological underpinning is that you believe that God is abundant enough that we do n't have to choose between working locally and working globally , " said Andrus , who leads roughly 27,000 members and 80 congregations in six Bay Area counties .
" You can do both . "
Andrus , Niederauer and University of San Francisco President Stephen Privett will travel to Washington , D.C. , to meet with Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , chairman of the Senate subcommittee on State , Foreign Operations and Related Programs .
Helping arrange the meeting is Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , a member of Temple Emanu - El , the Bay Area 's most influential synagogue , which has played a leading role in raising awareness about foreign aid spending for the poor .
The group wants passage of Senate Bill 2433 , which has already drawn support from some social conservatives as well as liberals .
The bill would require development of a comprehensive strategy to ease extreme poverty worldwide .
Niederauer said that reaching out to politicians is a way to remind them that they need to represent their constituencies - and not an effort to become involved with any particular candidates or parties .
" We care about the issues , " he said .
" Politics is about people . "

As you know , here at TPM we ’ve been really curious what happened in the Republican caucus in Washington state .
For probably the first time in all the primaries and elections I ’ve ever watched , the folks running the election decided to stop counting the votes with 13 % of the votes uncounted .
And this was n’t a 70 - 30 blow out , but a tight race where the two top vote getters were separated by less than 2 % of the vote .
Then this morning , state party chair Luke Esser decided to declare McCain the winner .
Now , when we were watching this last night and I was trying to examine the tea leaves this morning , I was assuming they ’d come forward with some story that there was some hang up with the votes or some mechanical issue .
Whether it would be true is another matter .
But you ’d think they ’d at least come up with a good story .
But state party chair Luke Esser said that he just thought it was the right thing to do .
According to Esser , sometime overnight Esser did some sort of back of the envelope statistical analysis of the the margin of McCain ’s lead ( 1.8 % ) and the number votes left uncounted ( 13 % ) and decided that Huckabee did n’t have a chance and he ’d shut the thing down and declare McCain the winner .
So was that a good idea ?
Here ’s Esser ’s rationale …
â Maybe it would have been safer if I had n’t said anything .
But it was an exciting and historic day for the state and I thought if I was confident about what the outcome would be I should share that with the people who had gone out to their caucuses .â 
So it was just such a rollicking good time Esser figured he owed the participants a decision as long as he was confident what the outcome would be .
I ’m really not sure I ’ve ever heard anything that ridiculous .
In terms of consequence , Bush v. Gore it ai n’t .
This is a relatively small contest in a nomination campaign that appears to be over .
But this is something you ’d expect either from Soviet history or a farcical passage in a Faulkner novel .
And let ’s not forget the context .
Huckabee starts the day with a blowout win in Kansas .
That evening he gets the largest number of votes in Louisiana .
Then in the third contest he ’s neck and neck with John McCain and looks like he may win all three contests of the day — a shut - out for the all - but - declared nominee .
Then as it ’s going down to the wire , the head of the state party decides he ’s seen enough and calls it for McCain .
Here at TPM , as we watched the rate of the reporting slow to halt on Saturday evening , we joked amongst ourselves that with McCain already getting beaten by Huckabee twice that day maybe the organizers of the election figured that if they just held out long enough people would just forget they ’d held a caucus .
But as it got later and later we started to wonder if it was n’t a joke .
I still find it pretty hard to imagine these bozos would try something quite this brazen .
And it may well be an electoral tempest in a teapot .
But this one looks and quacks like a duck .
So someone should give it a much closer look .
Late Update :
It seems that Washington State GOP chair Luke Esser spent most of the day avoiding calls from the Huckabee campaign .
And when he finally got back to them he told a lawyer for Huckabee ’s campaign that they ’d probably count the rest of the votes some time next week .
When the lawyer , Lauren Huckabee , the candidate ’s daughter - in - law , requested that a Huckabee lawyer be present when the remaining votes were counted , Esser hung up on her .
Before the hang up , Huckabee also asked Esser about the DIY statistical analysis he did to conclude that he should call the race ( Esser ’s expertise in statistics apparently stems from previous work as a state prosecutor and a sports writer ) .
Was there an analysis of what precincts the remaining votes came from ?
According to Huck campaign manager Ed Rollins , Esser admitted that he did n’t know which precincts the remaining votes came from .
Some historical claims are irrefutable : Hitler was a dick ; Einstein was a brilliant sex maniac .
A few other claims , however , are not quite as black and white .

Few people know that when he was n't giving moving speeches , he was locking his wife in his basement .
In Mindblowers , by Jim Rhine , we learn that for the last four years of her life Henry 's wife was chained in her basement , possibly in a straitjacket and forbidden to see her children .
It is n't unreasonable to conclude that the following conversation may have , at some point , occurred .
Alright , honey , I 'm going out for some beer and stronger chains .

Here 's a quote from Gandhi : " I do not consider [ name omitted ] to be as bad as depicted .

If you guessed Adolf Hitler , you 're right and also totally insane for guessing that .

Two days ago , we were informed that the current situation in Iraq is a “ by - product of the success of the surge . ”
As the crisis deepens , with widescale defections and heated street - fighting breaking out and the need for US bombing missions and US armor entering into the fray , Captain Ed has some revised talking points .
I am sure you will all be shocked to learn that the blame for this can be place solely on war critics and those god damned Brits :
That ’s why this is n’t a collapse of the American surge , but a demonstration of the folly of premature withdrawal .
The lack of fortitude on Iraq left a vacuum that created bigger problems and more serious fighting than tenacity did .
Had we listened to the war ’s critics in 2005 and 2006 , gangsters would have swallowed the entirety of Iraq , and we would have a second Somalia in southwest Asia .
While just a few days ago the current violence was a sign of the success of the surge , now we are assured that it is not a sign that the surge is failing .
At this rate , by Monday of next week , there will be helicopters circling Saigon and we will learn that the real culprits are Code Pink and Cindy Sheehan .
It is simply amazing that the people who were just wrong , wrong , wrong about everything just keep on talking as if they have any credibility .
I have come to at least recognize I do n’t know what the hell is going on , and this realization goes a long way in keeping me from looking like a total moron .
Granted , this is the kind of thing that is hard to analyze using scale models and a sand table , so maybe we should cut our citizen journalists some slack .

WASHINGTON  The Humane Society of the United States sued the Agriculture Department on Wednesday for creating a “ loophole ” that it said is permitting potentially sick cows into the food supply .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Washington , accused the department of violating procedural requirements when it created the provision , giving the meat industry a financial incentive to send unhealthy cattle to slaughter .
As evidence , the Humane Society cited its widely publicized undercover videotape of workers at the Westland / Hallmark Meat Company in Chino , Calif. , abusing cows that appeared unable to walk .
Jonathan R. Lovvorn , a lawyer for the Humane Society , said that when the agency weakened the ban last year , it “ did so without really telling people that that ’s what they were going to do and without explaining how this complies with their obligation to protect consumers and ensure humane treatment . ”
The lawsuit is likely to fuel tensions between the Humane Society and the Agriculture Department that have been growing since the video was publicly released in late January .
The release led to the biggest beef recall in history , 143 million pounds , more than a third of which had been shipped to federal nutrition programs like school lunches .
You all know how much Alex and I love to experiment with anal play on him .
We have graduated from fingering his tight little hole to using butt plugs to stimulate his prostate .
With some very sexually satisfying moments for both of us .
I love to watch him take a butt plug up inside his ass inch by inch until it hits the hilt and locks in to position .
The look on his face at it hits the sweet spot and the hardon he gets when it ’s in place deep inside his rectum .
It turns me on seeing him enjoy my anal ministrations on him .
I suppose it makes me feel like I ’m in control , instead of being the recipient of his phallus .
Yes , that ’s what it is .
A feeling of empowement over your guy .
I know I can give him a blowjob and let him come in my mouth or masturbate him until he comes all over his own stomach but this feels different , to actually enter him instead of giving him external stimulation .
Does that make sense ?
Well last night we did something which I have been waiting for months to be able to try .
Thanks to the super people at Barbara Kelly we have been sent a package of toys to review and amongst them was … shall I tell you ?… I think I ’ll keep you in suspense just a little longer …
… a strap - on .
I have always wanted to fuck a girl with one but never had the opportunity .
It intrigued me to know just what it feels like to possess a cock and be able to fuck someone with it .
Now I had my chance , I wanted Alex ’s virginal ass .
I removed the Posable Partner strap on from it ’s box .
It was a black one with an elastic harness .
The cock itself was very nice to the touch , flexible but stiff enough to penetrate the tightest of pussies or asses . 😉
The rubber compound feels soft to the touch , almost like skin .
The cock is mounted on a hard plastic mount with a soft backing which sits against your groin and to my surprise stays in place during use .
As I attached the straps to the cock I began to feel my heart beat increase and my excitement became apparent by my rapid breathing .
I could n’t wait to try it on as soon as I had adjusted the straps to fit .
I pulled the harness up over my hips and the cock settled in to place on my pubis .
It felt strange having a cock sticking out from my groin but nice .
😉
I shook my hips and watched in bounce around just like a real one .
Alex laughed and said “ You like that do n’t you ? ” “ I love it ! ” , I replied , trying not to sound too enthusiastic .
Lol
Looking down and taking the cock in my hands I could just imagine how if feels to be a guy and wank off .
I ran my hand up and down the shaft and played with the tip .
I was getting in to this now .
“ Do you want to try it ? ” …
… ” Who on ? ” , I asked .
“ Me , who do you think ” , came Alex ’s reply .
“ YES ! ”
I did n’t want to assume that Alex was ready for this , as we are still in the early stages with anal play .
If anything I thought I would be trying it out and imaging a girl fucking me hard from behind .
Perhaps one day … 😉
That was an offer I could n’t refuse .
Alex rose up on to his knees and pointed his ass at me .
I opened the bedside drawer and took out the tub of petroleum jelly .
I thought it would be nice and viscous and good preparation for anal entry .
I scooped a good ball of jelly on to my fingers and ran it around the tip of the strap on .
I then ran my fingers down the shaft spreading the jelly all over the cock , I have to admit I got a little carried away and began to wank the cock .
Alex broke me from it ’s spell by raising himself on to his knees and pointing his ass at me .
I was now very , very excited and I could feel my juices oozing down my legs .
My heart was racing and I felt slightly light headed , intoxicated by the moment .
The moment I had waited so long for .
Alex ’s ass looked so inviting and his balls so full and ready to explode .
I moved in behind him holding the cock in my right hand , just like a guy .
Strange but it felt natural as I pushed the tip against his puckered anus and watched it contract and then open as I pushed gently against it and slipped the tip inside .
This girl felt empowered , sexual , almost animal as she eased the cock inside that tight little ass .
I must have been smiling from ear to ear as I had the moment I had only dreamed about .
Everything had been leading up to this heated , sexually charged moment and I was going to enjoy every moment of it .
Alex gasped as I pushed deeper inside him , taking it slowly , not wanting to force myself on him .
I could see the PJ had collected in a white collar around the cock and realised that we needed more lube to enable me to fuck his ass .
I reached over to the drawer again and with my fingertips just managed to grab hold of the melon flavoured lube in there .
My cock was still buried in Alex ’s ass as I retrieved the lube .
I pulled the top off and turned the bottle upside down and in good porn fashion let the lube dribble down his crack and on to my cock .
JESUS !
This was making me so aroused .
I poured more lube on to the dick and placed the bottle down .
I resumed my inward thrust and watched as Alex swallowed me up .
“ You control it , push against me and take it at your own pace ” , I suggested being very tentative about hurting him .
“ OK ” , came Alex ’s reply .
He began to push against my groin and eat more of that rubber dildo , releasing moans of ecstasy as his ass was filled .
With a final thrust from me he took the whole of my length and let out a cry of pleasure as he bowed his head .
It felt so good to know that I was doing this , me…me fucking his ass .
“ Fuck me ! ” , he demanded .
Who was I to disagree ?
I pulled away from his ass at the same time extracting the cock , inch by inch and then I carefully pushed it back in again .
I did this several times , watching Alex arch his back with the gripping sensation of anal penetration .
I grabbed hold of his hip with my left hand as I moved slowly in and out of him .
I did n’t think Alex could make such sounds but he was audibly getting off on this .
What am I saying , so was I , my pussy was aching , no begging to be fucked .
I have to admit I felt like ramming hard in and out of him but controlled myself , there would be plenty of time for that .
😉
Alex asked me to pull out of him as he wanted to fuck me and by then I was so aroused despite the fact that I was enjoying fucking his asshole I wanted to feel his cock inside me .
Slowly I withdrew from his colon and watched as his anus shut behind me like a trapdoor .
Alex wasted no time and turned to face me .
His erection was huge and there was a string of clear fluid hanging from the tip of it .
Cum had been dribbling out of him the whole time I was working on his ass .
I took his hardon in my hand and sucked off the residue .
I eased the strap on off over my hips and placed it on the bedside cabinet .
“ Alex fuck me hard ” …

SÃO PAULO : Imagine a modern metropolis with no outdoor advertising : no billboards , no flashing neon signs , no electronic panels with messages crawling along the bottom .
Come the new year , this city of 11 million , overwhelmed by what the authorities call visual pollution , plans to press the “ delete all ” button and offer its residents unimpeded views of their surroundings .
But in proposing to transform the landscape , officials have unleashed debate and brought into conflict sharply differing concepts of what this city , South America ’s largest and most prosperous , should be .
City planners , architects and environmental advocates have argued enthusiastically that the prohibition , through a new “ clean city ” law , brings São Paulo a welcome step closer to an imagined urban ideal .
The law is “ a rare victory of the public interest over private , of order over disorder , aesthetics over ugliness , of cleanliness over trash , ” Roberto Pompeu de Toledo , a columnist and author of a history of São Paulo , wrote in the weekly newsmagazine Veja .
“ For once in life , all that is accustomed to coming out on top in Brazil has lost . ” ….

Actor Nicolas Cage has filed a Tax Court petition ( No. 934-08 ) contesting the IRS 's determination that he personally owes $ 814,000 , and his Saturn Productions of Los Angeles company owes $ 988,000 , in taxes , interest , and penalties for 2002 - 2004 .
From Forbes :
The IRS says movie star Nicolas Cage used a company he owns to wrongly write off $ 3.3 million in personal expenses , including limos , meals , gifts , travel and his Gulfstream 1159A turbojet .
...
The feds hit Cage both ways , denying Saturn a deduction for the disputed expenses while taxing Cage individually on the perks as salary and " constructive dividends . "
Cage 's business manager , Samuel J. Levin , says in an e-mail that the expenses were proper as " customary in the entertainment industry " and were partly based on the actor 's " security needs . "
Think of the top officials of the Bush administration as magicians when it comes to Iraq .
Their top hats and tails may be worn and their act fraying , but it does n’t seem to matter .
Their latest “ abracadabra , ” the president ’s “ surge strategy ” of 2007 , has still worked like a charm .
They waved their magic wands , paid off and armed a bunch of former Sunni insurgents and al - Qaeda terrorists ( about 80,000 “ concerned citizens , ” as the president likes to call them ) , and magically lowered “ violence ” in Iraq .
Even more miraculously , they made a country that they had already turned into a cesspool and a slag heap  its capital now has a “ lake ” of sewage so large that it can be viewed “ as a big black spot on Google Earth ”  almost entirely disappear from view in the U.S .
Of course , what they needed to be effective was that classic adjunct to any magician ’s act , the perfect assistant .
This has been a role long held , and still played with mysterious willingness , by the mainstream media .
There are certainly many reporters in Iraq doing their jobs as best they can in difficult circumstances .
When it comes to those who make the media decisions at home , however , they have practically clamored for the Bush administration to put them in a coffin - like box and saw it in half .
Thanks to their news choices , Iraq has for months been whisked deep inside most papers and into the softest sections of network and cable news programs .
Only one Iraq subject has gotten significant front - page attention :
How much “ success ” has the president ’s surge strategy had ?
Before confirmatory polls even arrived , the media had waved its own magic wand and declared that Americans had lost interest in Iraq .
Certainly the media people had .
The economy  with its subprime Hadithas and its market Abu Ghraibs  moved to center stage , yet links between the Bush administration ’s $ 2 trillion war and a swooning economy were seldom considered .
It mattered little that a recent Associated Press / Ipsos poll revealed a majority of Americans to be convinced that the most reasonable “ stimulus ” for the U.S. economy would be withdrawal from Iraq .
A total of 68 percent of those polled believed such a move would help the economy .
Anyone tuning in to the nightly network news can now regularly go through a typical half - hour focused on Obamania , the faltering of the Clinton “ machine , ” the Huckabee / McCain face - off on Republican Main Street , the latest nose - diving market , and the latest campus shooting without running across Iraq at all .
Cable TV , radio news , newspapers  it makes little difference .
The News Coverage Index of the Project for Excellence in Journalism illustrates that point clearly .
For the week of Feb. 4 - 10 , the category of “ Iraq Homefront ” barely squeaked into tenth place on its chart of the top - ten most heavily covered stories with 1 percent of the “ newshole . ”
First place went to “ 2008 Campaign ” at 55 percent .
“ Events in Iraq ”  that is , actual coverage of and from Iraq  did n’t make it onto the list .
( The week before , “ Events in Iraq ” managed to reach # 6 with 2 percent of the newshole . )
True , you can go to Juan Cole ’s Informed Comment Web site , perhaps the best daily roundup of Iraqi mayhem and disaster on the Web , and you ’ll feel as if , like Alice , you had fallen down a rabbit hole into another universe .
( “ Two bombings shook Iraq Sunday morning .
In the Misbah commercial center in the upscale Shi’ite Karrada district , a female suicide bomber detonated a belt bomb , killing 3 persons and wounding 10 .
About 100 members of the Awakening Council of Hilla Province have gone on strike to protest the killing of three of them by the U.S. military at Jurf al - Sakhr last Sunday , in what the Pentagon says was an accident .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that officials in Baquba are warning that as families are returning to the city , they could be forced right back out again , owing to sectarian tensions . ” )
But how many Americans read Juan Cole every day or any day ?
On that media homefront , the Bush administration has been Houdini-esque .
Left repeatedly locked in chains inside a booth full of water , George W. Bush continues to emerge to declare that things are going swimmingly in Iraq :
“ 80,000 local citizens stepped up and said , we want to help patrol our own neighborhoods ; we ’re sick and tired of violence and extremists .
I ’m not surprised that that happens .
I believe Iraqi moms want the same thing that American moms want , and that is for their children to grow up in peace .
The surge is working .
I know some do n’t want to admit that , and I understand .
But the terrorists understand the surge is working .
Al - Qaeda knows the surge is working . ”
Having pulled the “ surge ” rabbit out of his hat  even stealing the very word out of the middle of “ insurgent ” 
Bush then topped that trick by making Iraq go away for weeks , if not months , on end .
Talk about success !
Forever and a Day
If you ’re wondering why in the world this matters  after all , wo n’t the Democrats get us out of Iraq in 2009 ?
 then you have n’t come to grips with Bush ’s greatest magic trick of all .
Though a lame - duck president sporting dismally low job - approval ratings , he continues to embed the U.S. in Iraq , while framing the issue of what to do there in such a way that any thought of a quick withdrawal has Poof ! fled the scene .
Admittedly , somewhere between 57 percent and 64 percent of Americans , according to Rasmussen Reports , want all U.S. troops out of Iraq within a year .
We ’re not talking here about just the “ combat troops ” which both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seem prepared to withdraw at a relatively stately pace .
( Obama has suggested a 16 - month schedule for removing them ; Clinton has only indicated that she would start withdrawing some of them within 60 days of coming into office . )
Combat troops , however , represent perhaps half of all U.S. military personnel in Iraq  and Republicans are already attacking even their withdrawal as cut - and - run- ism , if not outright treason .
Americans may not have noticed , but the policy that a large majority of them want is no longer part of polite discussion in Washington or on the campaign trail .
The spectrum of opinion in the capital , among presidential candidates , and in the mainstream media ranges from Sen.
McCain ’s claim that even setting a date for withdrawal would be a sure recipe for “ genocide ”  and that ’s the responsible Right  to those who want to depart , but not completely and not very quickly either .
The party of “ withdrawal ” would still leave American troops behind for various activities .
These would include the “ training ” of the Iraqi military .
( No one ever asks why one side in Iraq needs endless years of “ training ” and “ advice , ” while the other sides simply fight on fiercely . )
In addition , troops might be left to guard our monstrous new embassy in Baghdad , or as an al - Qaeda - oriented strike force , or even to protect American security contractors like Blackwater .
Hard as it is for the audience to separate the mechanics of a magician ’s trickery from the illusion he creates , it ’s worth a try .
Before the surge began in February 2007 , as five combat brigades were dispatched mainly to Baghdad , there were perhaps 130,000 American forces in Iraq ( as well as a large contingent of private security contractors  hired guns  running into the tens of thousands ) .
The surge raised that military figure to more than 160,000 .
The Bush administration ’s latest plans are to send home the five combat brigades , but not all the support troops that arrived with them , by the end of July .
This will still leave troop levels above those of February 2007 .
At that point , as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates suggested only last week , the administration is likely to “ pause ” for at least one to three months to assess the situation .
In other words , when Americans enter their polling places this Nov. 4 , there will probably still be more troops in Iraq than at the beginning of 2007 .
Time magazine typically put the matter this way :
“ The pause , which could last up to several months , would be designed to ensure that the smaller U.S. footprint in Iraq does n’t embolden insurgents to reignite the civil war that ripped the country apart in 2006 and the first half of 2007 . ”
That smaller footprint , however , will be marginally larger than the one that preceded the surge .
So consider this a year - long draw - up , not a drawdown .
In the meantime , though the mainstream media has hardly noticed , the Pentagon has been digging in .
In the last year , it has continued to upgrade its massive bases in Iraq to the tune of billions of dollars .
It has also brought in extra air power for an “ air surge ” that has barely been reported on here  and nobody in Washington or on the campaign trail , in the Oval Office or the Democratic Party , has been talking about drawing down that air surge , even though there has recently been a spate of incidents in which Iraqi civilians , and some of those “ concerned citizens ” backing American forces have died from U.S. air strikes .
The Bush administration is also quietly negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement with the weak Iraqi government inside Baghdad ’s Green Zone .
It will legally entrench American forces on those mega - bases for years to come .
In a recent op - ed in the Washington Post , Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice denied that the administration was trying to bind a future president to Bush ’s Iraq policies .
( “ In short , nothing to be negotiated in the coming months will tie the hands of the next commander in chief , whomever he or she may be . ” )
This , however , is obviously not the case .
The agreement is also being carefully constructed to skirt the status of a “ treaty , ” so that it will not have to be submitted to the Senate for ratification .
All of this , in the grand tradition of Vice President Cheney , might be thought of as the Bush administration ’s embunkerment policy in Iraq .
In the surge year , when administration officials and top commanders speculated about withdrawal , they increasingly emphasized the Herculean task involved and the need to take the necessary time to carefully remove every last piece of military equipment in - country .
“ You ’re talking about not just U.S. soldiers , but millions of tons of contractor equipment that belongs to the United States government , and a variety of other things , ” Secretary of Defense Gates told Pentagon reporters last July .
“ This is a massive logistical undertaking whenever it takes place . ”
As Time magazine ’s Michael Duffy described it , included would be “ a good portion of the entire U.S. inventory of tanks , helicopters , armored personnel carriers , trucks , and humvees .
They are spread across 15 bases , 38 supply depots , 18 fuel - supply centers and 10 ammo dumps , ” not to speak of “ dining halls , office buildings , vending machines , furniture , mobile latrines , computers , paper clips , and acres of living quarters . ”
Some top military commanders claimed that it would take up to 20 months just to get part of the American force out .
More recently , it has been suggested that it would take “ as many as 75 days ” for each combat brigade and all its equipment to depart  and this would , of course , be done one brigade at a time .
When it comes to withdrawal , the highest priority now seems to be frugality in saving all U.S. property .
In other words , as the Bush administration continues to dig in , each of its acts makes leaving ever more complicated .
If the subject at hand were n’t so grim , this would be hilarious .
An analogy might lie in an old joke : A boy murders his father and mother and then , arrested and brought to court , throws himself on the mercy of the judge as an orphan .
The administration that rashly invaded Iraq , used it as a laboratory for any cockamamie scheme that came to mind , and threw money away profligately in one of the more flagrantly corrupt enterprises in recent history , now wants us to believe that future planning for drawdowns or withdrawals must be based on the need to preserve whatever we brought  and are still bringing  into the country .
In the land the Bush administration “ liberated , ” violence remains at a staggering daily level ; electricity is a luxury ; the national medical - care system has been largely destroyed ; perhaps 4.5 million Iraqis have either fled the country or become internally displaced persons ; approximately 70 percent lack access to clean water ; and 4 million , according to the UN , do n’t know where their next meal is coming from .
Yet , even with such a record before us , the logic of the moment in Washington and in the media remains clear :
The last thing we should be doing is getting out of the country with any alacrity .
After all , if we do , a disaster , a bloodbath , even genocide might happen .
Put another way , the most self - interested party in the “ withdrawal ” debate continues to set the terms of that debate .
Imagine if , in football , the quarterback calling plays for his team also had the power to assess penalties , declare first downs , and decide whether a ball was caught in or out of bounds .
In the meantime , since the antiwar movement remains relatively moribund , there are no “ out now ” or “ bring the troops home ” chants ringing in the streets of our country .
You have to look to the fringes for perfectly reasonable suggestions on getting out .
Take Professor Immanuel Wallerstein , who wrote an essay , “ Walking Away : The Least Bad Option , ” which you wo n’t find in your local paper .
To him , “ walking away ” would mean “ a statement by the U.S. government that it will withdraw all troops without exception and shut down all bases in Iraq within say six months of the date of announcement . ”
He adds : “ U.S. withdrawal would mark the first step on the long and difficult path to healing the United States of the sicknesses brought on by its imperial addiction , the first step in a painful effort to restore the good name of the United States in the world community . ”
Right now , however , any form of “ walking away , ” itself a polite euphemism for retreat from a desperate stalemate or even a lost war , is off that “ table ” on which this administration has so often placed “ all options . ”
As a result , if either Clinton or Obama were to win the next election , enter office in January 2009 , and follow his or her present plan  a relatively long period of drawdown not leading to full withdrawal  he or she would , within months , simply inherit the president ’s war .
At that point , the present war supporters would turn on the new president with a ferocity the Democrats are incapable of mustering against the present one , attacking her or him as a cut - and - runner of the first order , even possibly even a traitor .
We Don’t Do Permanent
Sen .
John McCain made a small stir recently by saying that he does n’t care if American troops stay in Iraq “ 100 years ” as long as “ Americans are not being injured , harmed , or killed . ”
In fact , as Mother Jones ’ David Corn reported , the senator later elaborated on that statement , adding “ a thousand years , ” “ a million years . ”
The president and various top administration officials have offered similar , if more restrained formulas , speaking vaguely of “ years ” in Iraq , or a “ decade ” or more in that country , or simply of the “ Korea model , ” a reference to our garrisoning of the southern part of the Korean peninsula for well over half a century with no end yet in sight .
Of course , this administration has already built its state - of - the - art mega - bases in Iraq as well as a mega- embassy , the largest on the planet , to suit such dreams .
Yet in April 2003 , the month Baghdad fell to American forces , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld first denied that the U.S. was seeking “ permanent ” bases in Iraq .
Ever since then , administration officials have consistently denied that those increasingly permanent - looking mega - bases were “ permanent . ”
Just the other day , the president again told Fox News , “ We wo n’t have permanent bases [ but ]
I do believe it is in our interests and the interests of the Iraqi people that we do enter into an agreement on how we are going to conduct ourselves over the next years . ”
Dana Perino , White House press spokesperson , offered further clarification by indicating that we do not actually have permanent bases on Planet Earth , even in Korea more than half a century later .
“ I ’m not aware , ” she said , “ of any place in the world  where we have a base  that they are asking us to leave .
And if they did , we would probably leave . ”
( She made a singular exception for Guantanamo . )
Consider this a philosophic position .
Evidently , we do n’t do permanent because all things are evanescent ; everything must end .
Where , after all , are the Seven Wonders of the World ?
Mostly gone , of course .
Such a position might be applied to far more than the permanency of bases .
Let me offer two linked predictions based on impermanency :
As a start , the surge - followed - by - pause solution the Bush administration whipped up is a highly unstable , distinctly impermanent strategy .
It was never meant to do much more than give Iraq enough of the look of quiescence that the president ’s war could be declared a modest “ success ” and passed on to the next president .
It relies on a tenuous balancing of unstable , largely hostile forces in Iraq  of Sunni former insurgents and the Shi’ite followers of cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , among others .
It is unlikely to last even until the November presidential election .
And let ’s remember that those on the other side(s ) are just as capable of reading drawdown  and election  schedules , of gauging weakness and strength , as we are .
It ’s likely that by the fall the surge effect will have worn off  signs of this are already in the air  and Iraq will be creeping back onto front pages and to the top of the TV news .
Given that Sen. McCain is so tightly linked to the surge ’s “ success , ” as well as the war itself , he is likely to prove a far weaker Republican candidate than now generally imagined .
Similarly , it may be far harder to Swift Boat the Democrats over Iraq by this fall  if , that is , the Democratic presidential candidate does n’t move so close to McCain on the war as to take the sting out of his situation .
Already , as Gary Kamiya has written at Salon.com , the Democrats ’ “ timid , Republican - lite approach to Iraq and the ‘ war on terror ’ has put the country to sleep Indeed , polls show that the main reason the public has such a low opinion of Congress is that it failed to force Bush to change course in Iraq . ”
Iraq is a deeply alien land whose people were never going to accept being garrisoned by the military of a Western imperial power .
It was always delusional to think that our situation there could be “ enduring , ” no matter how many permanent - looking structures we built .
It is no less delusional for Sen.
McCain to imagine a 100 - year garrisoning  in fact , one of any length  in which Americans will not be “ injured , harmed , or killed . ”
The time for withdrawal from Iraq has long passed .
In those endless years in which withdrawal did n’t happen , the Bush administration definitively proved one thing :
We are incapable of “ solving ” Iraq ’s problems , “ building ” a nation there , or preventing an endless string of horrific things from occurring .
After all , it was under U.S. occupation and in the face of the overwhelming presence of American forces that Iraq devolved and massive ethnic cleansing occurred .
It was during the months of the president ’s surge in 2007 , with U.S. troops flooding the streets of the capital , that many of Baghdad ’s mixed neighborhoods were most definitively “ cleansed . ”
It is a delusion to believe that the U.S. military is a force that stands between Iraqis and catastrophe .
It is a significant part of the catastrophe and , as long as Washington is committed to any form of permanency ( however euphemistically described ) , it can not help but remain so .
Every day that passes , the Bush administration is digging us in further , even though surge commander Gen.
David Petraeus recently observed that “ there is no light at the end of the tunnel that we ’re seeing . ”
Every day that passes makes withdrawal that much harder and yet brings it ineradicably closer .
Getting out , when it comes , wo n’t be elegant .
That ’s a sure thing by now ; but , honestly , you do n’t have to be a military specialist to know that , if we were determined to leave , it would n’t take us forever and a day to do so .
It is n’t actually that hard to drive a combat brigade ’s equipment south to Kuwait .
( And there ’s no reason to expect serious opposition from our Iraqis opponents , who overwhelmingly want us to depart . )
When withdrawal finally comes , the Iraqis will be the greatest losers .
They will be left in a dismantled country .
They deserve better .
Perhaps an American administration determined to withdraw in all due haste could still muster the energy to offer better .
But leave we must .
All of us .

Colliding waves in the North Atlantic can shake the Earth .
Colliding waves , like these ones off the coast of Greenland , create seismic vibrations .
Igor Shkvorets
Researchers have located an area between the Labrador Sea and Iceland where waves collide and send vibrations to the ocean ’s floor , creating a hum that can be detected for thousands of kilometres .
The results , published this week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A1 , confirm an old prediction that oceans can be powerful generators of seismic activity .
Often called a seismic hum , the signature buzz of wave - generated ' microseisms ' has been observed since the early twentieth century , when seismologists began installing seismometers capable of detecting their slow vibrations : a typical microseismic wave can last more than 10 seconds .
First dismissed as noise in the data , ocean microseisms have recently been heralded as a powerful way of probing the properties of the Earth 's crust .
Most microseismic vibrations are generated near coastlines , where waves pulling back from the coast hit the next set of waves coming in .
During the winter months , however , waves from sea storms produce seismic vibrations that can be many times more powerful .
Swell beginnings
Seismic sensors in Europe , North America , Iceland , and Greenland have long pointed to the North Atlantic as a possible hotspot for microseisms .
To investigate , seismologist Sharon Kedar of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , and his colleagues used information from satellites and buoys to connect what was happening on the ocean ’s surface to the vibrations they detected on dry land .
The researchers pinpointed a microseismic hotspot stretching from the Labrador Sea to south of Iceland .
In this zone , autumn and winter winds kick up rough ocean waves that travel in opposite directions .
The wavelength of the colliding surface waves and the 2 - kilometre depth of the water here create a strong resonance , with the surface and bottom of the ocean forming the ends of a giant , water - filled organ pipe .
The pressure from the periodic collisions creates sizeable seismic vibrations that can be detected on the coasts of North America , Greenland , and Europe .
The researchers looked for a similar hotspot in the North Pacific , but found that the ocean column under stormy waters was too deep to show a similar effect .
Making waves
The model predicting deep sea generation of seismic vibrations is more than 50 years old2 , says Kedar , " but this is the first real confirmation " that the model is correct .
" Until now , we did n’t have a good understanding of where that noise is coming from .
People had the expectation that the sources were random in place and time , but they are not , " he says .
The work could help advance growing efforts track changes in the Earth ’s structure with microseisms , says Kumar .
" This is really a first in terms of connecting real ocean - model data , which is done by oceanographers , to the seismic data , which is the realm of solid - earth scientists , " says seismologist Toshiro Tanimoto of the University of California , Santa Barbara , who uses networked seismometers to image the Earth ’s interior .
" They have shown for the first time that the two different data sets point to the same place . "

Determining the effect of waves generated closer to shore on the ocean ’s hum remains a tricky problem , because many complex factors — including beach slope and tide — affect the size and frequency of these waves and the pattern of wave collisions .
The researchers say a more complete model is still on the horizon .
A dolphin has guided two stranded whales to safety after human attempts to keep the animals off a New Zealand beach failed , a conservation official said .
" I 've never heard of anything like this before , it was amazing , " Conservation Department officer Malcolm Smith said .
The actions of the dolphin , known for playing with people in the water at Mahia Beach on the east coast of the North Island , probably meant the difference between life and death for the whales , he said .
Mr Smith had been working for over an hour - and - a - half to save the two pygmy sperm whales , which had repeatedly become stranded despite his attempts to push them back out to sea .
A dolphin , named Moko by locals , appeared and guided the whales to safety after apparently communicating with them , he said .
The whales , a three - metre female and her 1.5 - metre male calf , were apparently confused by a sandbar just off the beach and could not find their way back to open water .
Mr Smith had been alerted at daybreak by a neighbour about the two stranded whales on Mahia Beach near his home .
" Over the next hour and a half I pushed them back out to sea two or three times and they were very reluctant to move offshore , " he said .
" I was starting to get cold and wet and they were becoming tired .
I was reaching the stage where I was thinking it's about time to give up here , I 've done as much as I can . "
In that situation , whales are often humanely killed to end their suffering .
Moko to the rescue
Mr Smith said Moko arrived on the scene and he could hear the whales and the dolphin making noises , apparently to one another .
" The whales made contact with the dolphin and she basically escorted them about 200 metres parallel with the beach to the edge of the sandbar , " he said .
" Then she did a right - angle turn through quite a narrow channel and escorted them out to sea and we have n't seen those whales since .
" What the communication was I do not know , and I was not aware dolphins could communicate with pygmy sperm whales , but something happened that allowed Moko to guide those two whales to safety . "
Soon after , Moko was seen playing with swimmers on Mahia Beach , one of her favourite activities since she took up residence at the beach nearly a year ago .
The two - metre bottlenose dolphin has become well known for her antics at Mahia , which include playing in the surf with swimmers , approaching boats to be patted and pushing kayaks through the water with her snout .
" She likes people with flippers on , she 's attracted to them , she 's attracted to kayaks and boogy boards as well , and that 'll keep her occupied for some time , " Mr Smith said .
Such close interaction with humans is very rare among dolphins but not unknown .
" She 's become isolated from her pod obviously for one reason or another , but obviously made Mahia home just at the moment . "
Mahia gets up to 30 whale strandings a year , most of which end with the whales having to be put down .
" I do n't know if next time we have a whale stranding we can get her to come in again .
She certainly saved the day for us and the whales this time . "

Design Patterns
In software engineering , a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design .
A design pattern is n't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code .
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations .
Uses of Design Patterns
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested , proven development paradigms .
Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation .
Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns .
Often , people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems .
These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems .
Design patterns provide general solutions , documented in a format that does n't require specifics tied to a particular problem .
In addition , patterns allow developers to communicate using well - known , well understood names for software interactions .
Common design patterns can be improved over time , making them more robust than ad - hoc designs .
These design patterns are all about class instantiation .
This pattern can be further divided into class - creation patterns and object - creational patterns .
While class - creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process , object - creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done .

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition .

Structural object - patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality .

Prabhakaran mourns a cub
THE Sri Lankan government , and the majority ethnic - Sinhalese population that backs it , are gloating over the death of S.P. Tamilselvan , political commissar of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , in an air raid on November 2nd .
To them it is proof that the Sri Lankan army has gained the upper hand under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa , the president , and his brother , Gotabhaya , the defence secretary .
They believe the latter 's boast that his forces know the whereabouts of the Tigers ' leaders , and that they will be killed one by one .
To government loyalists , Sri Lanka is well on the road to an “ honourable peace ” in its 25 - year war , based on the total defeat of the Tigers , who have been fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in the north - east of the island .
Things look very different to neutral observers .
They see an accentuation of the Sinhalese - Tamil divide , not its mitigation ; an escalation of the war , which saw fierce fighting in the north on November 7th ; and a further setback to efforts to reopen peace talks and draft a devolution package that would satisfy moderate Tamils .
They also point out that the Tigers ' daring assault on the Anuradhapura air - base last month , in which 24 out of 27 aircraft were either destroyed or damaged , showed they could infiltrate , stalk and maul a prized prey in the Sinhalese heartland .
The government paints Tamilselvan as not a politician but a soldier , whose elimination was justified by the norms of war .
Only recently , he had commanded Tiger soldiers in the northern theatre .
Keheliya Rumbukwella , a government spokesman , alleged that , during peace talks abroad , Tamilselvan had clandestinely negotiated arms deals .
And while the government wanted to discuss the core political issues in the ethnic conflict , Tamilselvan raised peripheral issues to derail the talks .
Ordinary Tamils are too scared to comment .
But their leaders insist that Tamilselvan was a political leader and not a legitimate military target .
Tamil newspapers said that his “ assassination ” could kill peace efforts and intensify the war in the north and east , where hundreds of Tamils , and many Muslims , have been killed in the past year , and about 300,000 displaced by shelling and air - raids .
If the government is gearing up for war in the Tigers ' northern strongholds , the Tigers are breathing fire too .
Their brutal leader , Velupillai Prabhakaran , said the assassination had only strengthened the group 's resolve .
The fear is of renewed terrorist attacks in the south , especially in Colombo , the capital , where President Rajapaksa has ordered a tightening of security .
One disturbing development is a revival of interest in Sri Lanka 's Tamil issue in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu , just across the 30 km - wide ( 19 - mile ) Palk Strait .
In the 1980s , its Tamils , now numbering some 60 m , helped house , finance , train and arm Sri Lankan Tamil militants .
The state 's chief minister , M. Karunanidhi , opened a can of worms by penning a poem praising Tamilselvan and talking of the “ Tamil brotherhood ” binding Tamils across the globe .
This revived memories of the late 1980s , when he was also chief minister and openly supported the Tigers .
The main opposition party in Tamil Nadu , the All - India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , condemned Mr Karunanidhi's condolence message , saying that he had broken the law by praising a member of a proscribed group .
The Tigers were banned in India after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi , a former prime minister , in 1991 .
Tamilselvan 's death has revived the issue of Tamil ethnicity in Tamil Nadu , which could help whip up support for the Tigers there .
This is worrying Sri Lanka .
At least one newspaper has asked the government to take the matter up in Delhi .
Meanwhile , the detention in London , on a charge of travelling on a forged passport , of the former Tiger commander known as Colonel Karuna , was another cloud for the government .
Colonel Karuna split from the Tigers in 2004 .
The United Nations and human - rights groups have since accused the government of complicity in crimes committed by him in Tamil - speaking parts of eastern Sri Lanka .
He is alleged to have extorted money and recruited children for his armed group , which is alleged to have army backing .
He was reportedly allowed to leave Sri Lanka clandestinely , as he had become an embarrassment to the government .
But on going to join his wife and children in London he was detained by the immigration authorities .
As human - rights groups pursue him , he risks a high - profile investigation and trial that might embarrass both his former Tiger comrades and his new government masters .
Did someone say “ prophetic ” ?
There ’s no point denying it : neocons tend to be Jewish .
There are plenty of prominent exceptions  William Bennett , the former education secretary , and Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the late United States senator , diplomat , White House aide and sociologist , were both Roman Catholics  but neoconservatism ’s priorities , which range from strong support for Israel to vehement opposition to affirmative action , are heavily influenced by the values , interests and collective historical memory of the Jewish people .
Heilbrunn carries this conceit to the outermost boundaries of good taste by dividing his book into sections whose names are derived from the Old Testament : “ Exodus , ” “ Wilderness , ” “ Redemption ” and “ Return to Exile . ”
Heilbrunn , a senior editor at The National Interest , is himself a lapsed neocon who spent the 1990s writing hard - line foreign policy articles for that magazine , then but no longer a neocon redoubt , and also for The New Republic , a centrist - liberal magazine somewhat sympathetic to neoconservative arguments , especially concerning the cold war and the Middle East .
( Truth in book reviewing compels me to note that I worked there a decade before Heilbrunn did , but we ’ve never met . )
Heilbrunn confesses in the book ’s prologue that he found neoconservatism “ supplied me with a beguiling but ultimately artificial clarity about the world that was hard to shake . ”
His front - row seat gives him an easy familiarity with his subject , but in this case that seems less help than hindrance , because the author ’s disillusioned perspective feels a tad insular , and occasionally shades into snideness , the most egregious example being a labored postscript set eight years in the future ( the former undersecretary of defense for policy , Douglas Feith , “ had become dean of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service , where he had instituted a new course on the British Empire and Winston Churchill ” ) .
In addition to indulging in such inside jokes , Heilbrunn ca n’t resist turning some of the neocons ’ more tendentious rhetorical devices ( example : “ It is no accident that ... ” ) on the neocons themselves .
This may constitute just deserts , but it has the unfortunate side effect of punishing the reader .
The first half of Heilbrunn ’s book relates neoconservatism ’s origins and its journey to the brink of political power in the late 1970s .
It ’s a familiar tale , told better in “ The Neoconservatives : The Men Who Are Changing America ’s Politics , ” published in 1979 by Peter Steinfels ( then the executive editor of Commonweal and now a columnist on religion for The New York Times ) .
Steinfels came at the neocons from farther to the left than Heilbrunn and consequently was more critical .
But the Steinfels book was also more rigorously analytic and , strangely , more generous in granting neocons their due as thinkers .
Chalk it up to the narcissism of small differences .
As best I can make out , Heilbrunn retains most of the foreign - policy views that he held before but applies them with greater judiciousness , and can no longer bear the sight of those who do n’t .
( The neocons ’ domestic policies seem to interest Heilbrunn not at all ; he scarcely mentions them . )
From both Steinfels and Heilbrunn , we learn that neoconservatism was the final stop of an ideological journey for a group of New York intellectuals , typically the children of Jewish immigrants , that began during the early 1940s in Alcove 1 of the cafeteria at City College .
Alcove 1 was the gathering place for a group of brilliant young Trotskyists that included Irving Kristol , Seymour Martin Lipset , Nathan Glazer and Melvin Lasky .
Along with Irving Howe , who would later break with Trotskyism but not with the left , and Daniel Bell , who never accepted Marxist orthodoxies in any form , the Alcove 1 Trotskyists waged intellectual battle with the Stalinists in Alcove 2 , who vastly outnumbered them .

More than half the 295 women who died during or after pregnancy between 2003 and 2005 were overweight or obese .
Experts say the number of deaths - from a total of two million pregnancies - is low but the trend is very worrying .
The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths ( CEMACH ) report calls for more support and advice for obese women before and during pregnancy .
Obese pregnant women are probably at four or five times greater risk of suffering maternal death than a woman of normal weight - and the same for their babies dying
Dr Gwyneth Lewis
Maternity tsar
Calculate your BMI
Gwyneth Lewis , CEMACH director and the government 's maternity tsar , said the figures showed that childbirth was very safe in the UK .
But she said the growing evidence of a link to obesity was a cause for concern .
The figures suggest that a modest amount of extra weight in pregnancy carries little extra risk , but obesity poses a significant problem .
Fifteen per cent of the mothers who died were morbid or super - morbidly obese .
Dr Lewis said : " Obese pregnant women are probably at four or five times greater risk of suffering maternal death than a woman of normal weight - and the same for their babies dying . "
She is concerned many women are not aware of the risk associated with obesity .
Overall , the UK has one of the lowest rates of maternal death in the world .
However , the death rate in the UK has begun to rise .
In 2003 - 05 it stood at almost 13.95 per 100,000 births , up from 13.07 in 2000 - 02 , and just 9.83 in 1985 - 87 .
With obesity levels predicted to soar experts say it is vital that women are fully aware they should try to get to a healthy weight before trying to conceive .
The report says excess weight not only puts a woman at risk of medical complications , it can mask symptoms and cause logistical problems .
In one case , there was a delay in spotting that a woman was at risk of seizures , because a blood pressure cuff could not fit around her arm .
New equipment
At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead , consultant obstetricians are already seeing a shift in their clinics and delivery suites .
Dr Helene Brandon said around a third of the pregnant mothers they see are obese , and in an average year they care for several women with a body mass index ( BMI ) of more than 50 .
Dr Brandon 's maternity unit has a new operating table
That would place those women in the highest risk category of super - morbidly obese .
The maternity unit has had to buy a new operating table that can hold up to 40 stone ( 254kg ) in weight .
It is regularly in use , as around half of obese pregnant women end up having a Caesarean section .
The operation usually requires at least one extra assistant for the surgeon to help manage the bulk of the patient .
Dr Brandon said obese patients face higher risks of certain complications .
She said : " The most common ones are dangerously high blood pressure , heart disease such as angina which could cause a heart attack in pregnancy - and obese patients are much more prone to bleeding . "
Struggle with weight
Several miles away on an estate in Jarrow one of her patients , Maria Thornton is working hard to reduce the risks to herself and her baby .
Maria is six months pregnant and weighs 19 - and - a- half stone ( 124kg ) .
She has had a lifelong struggle with her weight , and had gastric band surgery several years ago .
In her last pregnancy , Maria developed diabetes because of her weight , which brought home to her the risks to her own health from obesity .
Although she is now well informed about the potential health problems Maria is shocked that obesity is emerging as a factor in maternal deaths .
She said : " It is really quite scary .
You know there are risks , but you do n't think of them in terms of fatality - you kind of think it makes the pregnancy harder or you 've got more obstacles to overcome .
" But to hear that it can cost you your life at the end of the day is quite frightening . "
Now Maria is going several times a week to the sure start scheme in Perth Green to use the gym .
As a result of regular exercise she has only put on three pounds ( 1.36kg ) in this pregnancy , following the medical advice that obese women should aim to maintain their weight .

Press the same day Gawker posted the video , it was the 25th - best - selling book on Amazon.com on Sunday .
The timing of the imbroglio has been fortunate for Gawker Media .
A Gawker editor , Choire Sicha , and two other bloggers resigned last month , and several articles in print publications , including The New York Times , have examined whether Gawker ’s relevance and popularity were waning .
But according to the Internet tracker Site Meter , unique visitors to the six - year - old site more than doubled , to more than 13.6 million so far this month , from 6.7 million last January , because of popularity of the posts related to Mr. Cruise and to the actor Heath Ledger .
Some former Gawker bloggers have criticized a new compensation system that on top of a base rate pays $ 7.50 for every 1,000 views that posts generate .
If one of Mr. Denton ’s bloggers had posted the Tom Cruise video , his or her haul thus far would be more than $ 17,000 .

Here is the text of Newsweeks 1975 story on the trend toward global cooling .
It may look foolish today , but in fact world temperatures had been falling since about 1940 .
It was around 1979 that they reversed direction and resumed the general rise that had begun in the 1880s , bringing us today back to around 1940 levels .

T here are ominous signs that the Earth ’s weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production – with serious political implications for just about every nation on Earth .
The drop in food output could begin quite soon , perhaps only 10 years from now .
The regions destined to feel its impact are the great wheat - producing lands of Canada and the U.S.S.R. in the North , along with a number of marginally self - sufficient tropical areas – parts of India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Indochina and Indonesia – where the growing season is dependent upon the rains brought by the monsoon .
The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard - pressed to keep up with it .
In England , farmers have seen their growing season decline by about two weeks since 1950 , with a resultant overall loss in grain production estimated at up to 100,000 tons annually .
During the same time , the average temperature around the equator has risen by a fraction of a degree – a fraction that in some areas can mean drought and desolation .
Last April , in the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded , 148 twisters killed more than 300 people and caused half a billion dollars worth of damage in 13 U.S. states .
To scientists , these seemingly disparate incidents represent the advance signs of fundamental changes in the worlds weather .
The central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions , the earths climate seems to be cooling down .
Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend , as well as over its specific impact on local weather conditions .
But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century .
If the climatic change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear , the resulting famines could be catastrophic .
“ A major climatic change would force economic and social adjustments on a worldwide scale , ” warns a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences , “ because the global patterns of food production and population that have evolved are implicitly dependent on the climate of the present century . ”
A survey completed last year by Dr. Murray Mitchell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reveals a drop of half a degree in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968 .
According to George Kukla of Columbia University , satellite photos indicated a sudden , large increase in Northern Hemisphere snow cover in the winter of 1971 - 72 .
And a study released last month by two NOAA scientists notes that the amount of sunshine reaching the ground in the continental U.S. diminished by 1.3 % between 1964 and 1972 .
To the layman , the relatively small changes in temperature and sunshine can be highly misleading .
Reid Bryson of the University of Wisconsin points out that the Earth ’s average temperature during the great Ice Ages was only about seven degrees lower than during its warmest eras – and that the present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average .
Others regard the cooling as a reversion to the “ little ice age ” conditions that brought bitter winters to much of Europe and northern America between 1600 and 1900 – years when the Thames used to freeze so solidly that Londoners roasted oxen on the ice and when iceboats sailed the Hudson River almost as far south as New York City .
Just what causes the onset of major and minor ice ages remains a mystery .
“ Our knowledge of the mechanisms of climatic change is at least as fragmentary as our data , ” concedes the National Academy of Sciences report .
“ Not only are the basic scientific questions largely unanswered , but in many cases we do not yet know enough to pose the key questions . ”
M eteorologists think that they can forecast the short - term results of the return to the norm of the last century .
They begin by noting the slight drop in overall temperature that produces large numbers of pressure centers in the upper atmosphere .
These break up the smooth flow of westerly winds over temperate areas .
The stagnant air produced in this way causes an increase in extremes of local weather such as droughts , floods , extended dry spells , long freezes , delayed monsoons and even local temperature increases – all of which have a direct impact on food supplies .
“ The world ’s food - producing system , ” warns Dr. James D. McQuigg of NOAA ’s Center for Climatic and Environmental Assessment , “ is much more sensitive to the weather variable than it was even five years ago . ”
Furthermore , the growth of world population and creation of new national boundaries make it impossible for starving peoples to migrate from their devastated fields , as they did during past famines .
Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change , or even to allay its effects .
They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed , such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers , might create problems far greater than those they solve .
But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies .
The longer the planners delay , the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality .

Visiting Cambridge ( Massachusetts [ USA ] ) for a party at Y - combinator made me jealous about how much more vibrant the hacker / startup scene is in the Boston area than it is in the New York area .
Or maybe it just seems that way , because Paul Graham and his crew have done a remarkable job of attracting a first rate flock of smart young entrepreneurs by providing seed funding for a bunch of new startups .
I probably talked to a couple of dozen people and they all seemed really , really smart and enthusiastic .
Is New York just lame compared to Boston ?
Or does it just seem that way ?
Why is that … is it because of MIT ?
or all the other high tech stuff going on there ?
Is it the high cost of living in New York ?
Or the fact that we have too many distractions , and it ’s not a good place to concentrate on making a startup ?
Or maybe it ’s because investment banks , hedge funds , advertising agencies , and media companies suck up all the oxygen ?
One bright young Harvard grad I met at the party has a job as the full - time , personal system administrator maintaining the PC of a famous hedge fund manager …
( Dude , come work for Fog Creek … we can waste your talent in a much more laid back environment . )
Multitasking in the Workplace
New York Times :
Big screens are good , interruptions are bad , etc .
The stuff about how long it takes to pick up a train of thought after being interrupted is really cool ; I ’ve been claiming this based on my own experience but I never had anything remotely scientific to prove it .
You can read the original papers by Gloria Mark on her web site .
She also tries to pin down whether it ’s more productive to be “ collocated ” or not , by which , I think , she ’s comparing the number of interruptions suffered by people in private offices vs. open spaces .
The bizarre thing she claims , which could be true , is that open - space - dwellers actually get voluntarily interrupted less because people can quickly see whether they ’re interruptible or not .
She does mention that open - spacers do frequently decide to “ interrupt themselves ” to participate in another conversation that they overheard , something which is probably net beneficial for the team ’s productivity but which drives me crazy .
I keep claiming that private offices are more productive than open space plans or cubicles , but the one advantage of open space which people keep bringing up is all the accidental , serendipitous knowledge transfer that takes place when everyone overhears everyone else .
I think it ’s not worth the productivity loss caused by an increased number of interruptions .
This summer when we had four interns building a new product , we had to put them all in a single open space because we ran out of offices ( oops ) .
Watching the four of them work together , you could clearly see that ad - hoc , impromptu conversations were somewhat valuable , but you could also see that anything that interrupted one person ( e.g. when I wandered over to discuss some tiny issue with one of the interns ) it ended up interrupting everybody — those tiny issues inevitably became conversations with everybody , thus interrupting 3 people who had no reason to be interrupted and who would take an average of 25 minutes to return to what they were doing .
Also , I think that private offices have remarkable benefits in terms of your ability to attract and retain talent and people ’s general happiness at work , which leads to increased productivity because you ’re hiring better people and they ’re happier .
We ’re doubling the size of the Fog Creek offices as soon as we can , and our goal remains to put every developer in a private office .
The car was made famous in the film Back To The Future
Enlarge Image
The last of the vehicles - made famous in the film Back To The Future - rolled off the production line near Belfast 25 years ago .
However , the number of enthusiasts seeking the car has meant a limited number may be built in the US .
The company was based at Dunmurry .
Almost £ 80 m of public money was spent in the hope of creating 2,000 jobs .
More than £ 20 m in legal fees was spent by the government in legal action against the auditors of the failed company , which collapsed in 1982 .
Manufacture of the DeLorean DMC - 12 car began at the Dunmurry plant in 1981 , with fewer than 9,000 cars rolling off the production lines before its closure the following year .
Despite the firm 's failure the car , with its unpainted stainless steel skin and gull - wing doors , gained a cult following .
' Market for the car '
The vice president of the Delorean Motor Company in Texas , James Espey , said the car had an enduring appeal .
" A lot of people are interested in the car because of the story behind the car , " he said .
" A company started by John DeLorean - a guy who quit General Motors to start his own company to show them how to do it .
" Admittedly John has a much stronger reputation here in the ( United ) States ... but he still created a fantastic car .
" You can't have any conversation about the car without talking about the impact of the whole series of Back To The Future movies . "
John DeLorean died in March 2005 aged 80
Mr Espey added : " There are guys who were in their teens when they first saw the movie , who are now in their late 30s or early 40s , who are at that point in life when they can get the car they wanted when they were a kid .
" We feel quite confident that there is a market for between 20 - 25 hand - built made to order cars each year , without question .
Right now , we have a nine - month waiting list for cars . "
About 8,600 cars rolled off the production line in Dunmurry , but only 6,500 remain in existence .
John DeLorean died in March 2005 aged 80 .

It ’s what ’s for dinner .
We pride ourselves on our devotion to the principle of equality here in the United States , so it ’s time to put our values where our mouths are , so to speak .
Pigs , chickens , cows , and the like already endure abject suffering so we can consume their flesh , so it is only fair that we include “ man ’s best friend . ”
How could they better prove their deep loyalty to us than by sacrificing their lives to feed us ?
There is plenty of room on our plates to accommodate a few slices of Lassie .
Even here in our resource - hog of a nation people experience hunger .
Why not run a hundred million or so Rovers through the meat industrial complex each year ?
We have no reservations about torturing and slaughtering billions of other sentient beings to satiate our lust for meat .
Research has indicated that pigs are actually more intelligent than dogs and thus would be more conscious of their misery .
So there is no valid moral objection .
Our capacity to immunize ourselves from conscience and compassion as we greedily devour the flesh of non-human animals ( who experienced pain beyond the scope of our imaginations so that we might savor their cooked remains ) will serve us well if we implement this solution to the problem of hunger ( both here and abroad ) .
In some nations , dog meat is already prized as a delicacy , so we ’d be in for a real treat !
Being the good little capitalists that we are , we need to determine the most profitable means to deliver “ dog food ” to our tables .
After all , we are all about the “ freedom ” to generate profit and protect our sacrosanct property rights .
We do manage to slightly conceal our greed and selfishness with a thin veneer of faux compassion — hence our “ helping solve world hunger ” rationale .
Yet we know that ultimately the dogs we butcher will simply be another means to enhance the wealth of the power elite so that the excess can trickle down to the rest of us .
Obviously , the “ good folks ” running Tyson and Smithfield Foods will need a large infusion of canines to seed the factory farms they will construct to begin mass production and distribution of dog meat .
A federal law requiring dog owners to sell their pets to these benevolent corporate entities at a fair price , a strident effort to capture strays , and emptying animal shelters will certainly give them the “ livestock ” they need to ramp up production to please our palates .
Since consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this wonderful addition to our culinary choices , it will make sense to use federal tax dollars to subsidize our meat packers ’ acquisition of their initial stock AND their construction of the facilities necessary to add such a delicious addition to our menus .
Fast food restaurants , the progenitors and principal beneficiaries of factory farming , need to get on board with our newest source of meat very quickly .
It will be essential that McDonald ’s roll out something along the lines of a McBark at the very early stages of this endeavor .
Burger King ’s version might be called the Whoofer .
Branding issues aside , the shock troops of the animal flesh consumption industry will need to divert their formidable resources toward selling consumers on eating their former companions .
Once we have the dogs and factory farms in place , we will need to implement the actual logistics of breeding , raising , and slaughtering our former pets and future meals .
Since dogs are intellectually superior to cattle yet slightly inferior to pigs , perhaps we would be wise to model our canine processing system after the pork industry .
We will need to keep large numbers of bitches in a state of near perpetual pregnancy .
To keep costs low , we will want to cram as many of these mother dogs into as small a space as possible .
They do n’t need to turn around or even move really .
As long as we supply them with a cheap source of food ( i.e. ground - up waste product from the slaughter house floor — theirs will truly be a “ dog eat dog world ” ) , water , and heavy doses of antibiotics , they will remain fertile enough to yield substantial numbers of pups and healthy enough to eat later .
Given their intellect , the dogs will probably suffer similar mental disturbances as pigs do in such confined quarters , which means they will become dangerously aggressive and a threat to themselves and others .
Hence we will need to remove their teeth .
Anesthetizing them would create an unnecessary expense , so we will simply put them in restraints , yank out their choppers , and cauterize them to stop the bleeding and prevent infection .
If our dogs ( male and female alike ) suffer wounds in their miniscule holding pens whilst they await their turn to fill our stomachs , we wo n’t waste time or money tending to them .
Pigs suffer through the loss of body parts , broken legs , and ulcerated wounds , so there ’s no reason to increase our costs by tending to the injured .
A certain percentage of our stock will die , but they will provide fodder for the survivors .
The stench emanating from the cankerous sores , feces , urine , and rotting corpses will be immense , but like their brethren pigs who also have highly developed senses of smell , the dogs will simply need to live with the fetid air and pneumonia they develop .
As human beings , our desires for meat and profit preclude the possibility of ending the unnecessary suffering we inflict upon sentient creatures .
Once a dog has been appropriately aged and fattened to maximize taste and profit , we will load it onto a ventilated truck packed with as many dogs as possible without causing significant numbers of deaths by trampling or asphyxiation .
Handlers will be trained to beat uncooperative dogs into submission with heavy steel rods .
Or for those workers who have “ bleeding hearts , ” they can humanely stick electric cattle prods into the dogs ’ rectums .
Upon arrival at the slaughter facility , the dogs who have n’t frozen to death or died of heat exhaustion , thirst , or suffocation will be man- handled off the truck ( so as to keep them submissive ) and forced to the kill floor .
“ Downers ” ( dogs too injured or sick to walk ) will be dragged to their deaths .
Euthanizing dying dogs will be out of the question because then we could not legally sell their flesh for consumption .
Ridiculous animal welfare laws will require that we stun the dogs before we kill them , but there is no legal mandate that we make certain they are unconscious .
As with pigs , many dogs will probably remain conscious as they are scalded to death in the tanks that will soften their skin and remove their fur ( or they may feel the searing pain of the blow torch if we opt to go that route to remove their hair ) .

Hr 1955 was passed on the House Floor October 23rd , 2007 .
Since that date , there is still a “ press blackout ” in effect , and now , while most of America thought HR 1955 / S 1959 was in committee pending further review until it was brought up for a vote in the Senate ; None of us were aware that this Bill is taking on a life of its own , and some parts of this measure are already being implemented !
I found an article from The Nation this morning , and what it describes is the enacting of certain parts of this Bill , even though it has n’t become law yet .
Maybe this is part of the reason there ’s been a press blackout in regard this Bill , and now that it is effecting our colleges and resembling something out of Soviet Russia ’s past , it ’s time to get this out in the open and find a way to circumvent the press blackout so Americans will become aware that once again , the government is running programs that undermine what our colleges are attempting to accomplish and are threatening free speech on our campuses :
Repress U by MICHAEL GOULD - WARTOFSKY [ from the January 28 , 2008 issue ]
Free - speech zones .
Taser guns .
Hidden cameras .
Data mining .
A new security curriculum .
Private security contractors .
Welcome to the homeland security campus .
From Harvard to UCLA , the ivory tower is fast becoming the latest watchtower in Fortress America .
The terror warriors , having turned their attention to “ violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism prevention ” –as it was recently dubbed in a House of Representatives bill of the same name –have set out to reconquer that traditional hotbed of radicalization , the university .
But wait , there ’s more : DHS has founded and funded six of its very own “ Centers of Excellence , ” research facilities that span dozens of universities from coast to coast .
The latest is a Center of Excellence for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism , the funding for which cleared the House in October .
The center is mandated to assist a national commission in combating those “ adopting or promoting an extremist belief system …to advance political , religious or social change . ”
It ’s not a secret that the Pentagon , for its part , hopes to turn campuses into recruitment centers for its overstretched , overstressed forces .
The Defense Department has built its own database for just this purpose .
Known as Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies , this program tracks 30 million young people , ages 16 to 25 .
According to a Pentagon spokesperson , the department has partnered with private marketing and data - mining firms , which in turn sell the government reams of information on students and other potential recruits .
( Emphasis added . )
MUCH MORE
This Bill was passed in the House , however still sits in “ committee ” in the Senate .
Is it legal to begin implementing a Bill before its been passed into law ?
Is it moral and thus “ legal ” to run a program in our colleges like this without the public being aware that they are in operation ?
The above excerpts do not do the story justice and the above referenced article contains a huge amount of information in regard the transition (s ) that are taking place on our campuses ; it ’s an excellent read and if you ’ve read this much , please make sure and read the full article from The Nation .
Couple that with an article which was posted on January 20th , Spychief Plan To Police Internet Is Likely Tied To S 1959 , Thought Crime Prevention Bill and it becomes clear that even though this Bill is supposedly in committee , its intent and dogma is being implemented whether it ’s been signed into law or not .
Why ?
The American people have a right to know where and how their tax money is being spent , and parents that are plowing hard earned money and savings into their children ’s education should be aware that they may be sending their kids into a hotbed of political opportunism that our Neo- conservative government is attempting to capitalize upon at the taxpayers expense .
Whatever the government is attempting to accomplish with S 1959 , it ’s obvious that they consider it important enough to circumvent the press and appear to be implementing parts of this program very quickly and quietly , a sure sign that civil rights and freedom are being compromised in the name of national security .
When this issue was first being discussed , an argument that was often presented was that “ it ’s still in committee ” and “ most of these Bills do n’t get our of committee anyway . ”
Evidently , those arguments do n’t pertain to S 1959 - and whether it ’s in committee or not , parts of it are being implemented , some aspects which are being set - up to monitor all of our personal computer communications and now it ’s reaching into our colleges …
Now that we know Homeland security is moving forward with S - 1959 , it ’s time to reinvigorate our resistance and objection to a program that is unconstitutional on its face and appears hell - bent on destroying the last bit of privacy and freedom that Americans possess .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People who just ca n’t stop eating may be able to blame their genes , at least in part , U.S. researchers said on Monday .
They said up to 50 percent of the population carries a gene variation that may give them extra pleasure from eating -- and may explain why they are willing to work twice as hard for snacks as the other half of the population .
The gene affects dopamine , an important message - carrying chemical , or neurotransmitter , associated with behavior and movement .
“ This gene is not just associated with overeating , ” said Jennifer Temple , a neuroscientist at the University at Buffalo in New York who worked on the study .
“ It has been associated with drug addiction , alcohol abuse , gambling .
It is associated with reward decisions , ” Temple added in a telephone interview .
Writing in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience , Temple and colleagues described an experiment in which they gave people access to many tasty snacks , including chips and chocolate .
Their volunteers thought they were taste - testing the food , but Temple ’s team watched to see who ate the most .
They also ran genetic tests on their 74 unwitting volunteers , looking for variations in two genes that affect dopamine levels .
One gene appeared to have no effect on eating .
But the Taq1 A1 variation had a noticeable effect .
People carry two copies of each gene , one from the mother and one from the father .
Nearly half the population has one A1 and one A2 version , while the other half has two copies of A2 .
It is rare for someone to have two A1s .
People with two A2s experience feelings of reward easily , while people with A1 may have to work harder to feel good , the researchers said .
FOOD REWARD
Temple ’s team set up a simple test to see who would work the hardest for snacks -- a computer test in which they had to click a mouse .
People could win points they could trade for treats , and could quit at any time .
“ People that had the ( A1 variation ) and who were obese worked twice as hard as people who were either not obese or who were obese and did n’t have the gene , ” said Temple .
“ They worked twice as hard to get the food . ”
The finding may help explain why so many people will continue to eat even when they are not hungry , said Temple .
Not everyone may choose food as their reward , she added .
Her team plans to do more studies to see if some people may in fact get more of a reward from gambling , or drugs .
“ We are actually repeating this study in a larger sample where we are also going to be looking at more genes , ” Temple said .
It may be that either genes or environment decide what a person ’s reward of choice is -- food or drugs or gambling .
The team has found evidence that chemically manipulating dopamine levels alters eating behavior , which may help in the development of better diet drugs .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House Judiciary Committee on Monday filed a lawsuit against White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers aimed at forcing them to provide information about the firings of nine U.S. attorneys .
White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten has refused to testify in the House Judiciary Committee probe .
The White House promptly labeled the suit " partisan theater . "
The suit follows Attorney General Michael Mukasey 's announcement last month that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal contempt charges against Miers and Bolten over their refusal to testify or provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee .
In a 36 - page filing , attorneys for the House asked the U.S. District Court in Washington to compel Miers " forthwith to appear and testify before the committee " and to " enjoin Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten forthwith to produce to the committee ... all responsive documents . "
The filing said the documents demanded are " critical to the investigation " of White House political involvement in the firings .
The White House had invoked " executive privilege " on behalf of Miers and Bolten in refusing to heed the demands of the committee , setting up a classic battle between the executive and legislative branches of government .
Both sides expressed confidence they would prevail in the coming court battle .
" The House is taking action today to uphold the rule of law and to protect our constitutional system of checks and balances , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement .
" The Bush administration cannot conceal information and prevent Congress from carrying out its oversight and lawmaking responsibilities . "
In a statement , Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said , " We will not allow the administration to steamroll Congress . "
Conyers , who led the fight to subpoena Miers and Bolten , added , " I do not take this step lightly .
Unfortunately , this administration simply will not negotiate toward a compromise resolution , so we must proceed . "
The White House chalked the lawsuit up to politics .
" It 's been almost a year of wrangling on that front , and now they 've continued to focus on partisan theater , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
" The confidentiality the president receives from his senior advisers and the constitutional principle of separation of powers must be protected from overreaching , and we are confident the courts will agree with us . "
The White House has said the firings of the U.S. attorneys were legal .
But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted and why -- remain unanswered .
Critics of the move have said prosecutors who were not sufficiently supportive of Bush were targeted .
Pelosi had asked Mukasey to look into whether Bolten and Miers committed contempt of Congress in the investigation into the firings .
Pelosi said the two were unresponsive to Congress ' inquiry , while the White House has argued that contempt laws do n't apply to the president or any of his staffers who invoke executive privilege .
Mukasey , a Bush appointee , agreed .
" The department has determined that the noncompliance by Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers with the Judiciary Committee subpoenas did not constitute a crime , " Mukasey wrote in a February 29 letter to Pelosi .
" Therefore the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers . "
Mukasey 's response drew quick criticism from Pelosi and other Democrats .
" By ordering the U.S. attorney to take no action in response to congressional subpoenas , the Bush administration is continuing to politicize law enforcement , which undermines public confidence in our criminal justice system , " Pelosi said in a statement .

LOS ANGELES , Nov. 2 — Hollywood ’s two decades of labor peace shattered Thursday night , as movie and television writers declared they would embark on an industrywide strike for the first time since 1988 , when both writers and Teamsters walked out .
The writers ’ union announced this afternoon that the strike would begin on Monday morning .
Unless there is a last - minute settlement , the strike will pit union writers , whose position has been eroded by reality television and galloping technological change , against studios and networks that are backed by big corporate owners like General Electric and News Corp. , but are also unsure of the future .
The walk - out threatens an instant jolt to television talk shows like “ Late Show With David Letterman , ” which rely on guild writers to churn out monologues and skits .
“ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , ” “ The Colbert Report , ” “ Late Night With Conan O’Brien , ” and “ The Tonight Show With Jay Leno ” will all revert to repeats on Monday , at least for the time being .
And if the strike drags on , audiences could see the eventual shutdown of soap operas , TV series and movie productions , as they exhaust their bank of ready scripts .

The co-pilot of a packed Heathrow - bound plane had to be dragged screaming from his cockpit after apparently suffering a mental breakdown in mid-air .
Horrified passengers on the flight from Canada saw the man being pinned down by fellow crew members as he yelled loudly and demanded to " speak to God " .
The co-pilot was shackled by his ankles and handcuffed to a seat as the jet was forced to make an emergency landing at the Republic of Ireland 's Shannon Airport .
Scroll down for more ...
Passengers then saw him being led off the plane with his feet still bound and muttering to himself .
He was taken by ambulance to a nearby psychiatric ward , and his wife was last night by his side at the hospital as investigators sought to find out what triggered the drama at 35,000 ft over the Atlantic .
The incident occurred just an hour from landing at Heathrow and the captain had to take solo command of the controls .
Although the co-pilot would , in the normal course of events , routinely fly and even land the Boeing 767-333 , bosses at Air Canada yesterday said that at no point had any of the 146 passengers on board , including three infants , been endangered .
One of the passengers on Flight AC848 from Toronto to Heathrow , Sean Finucane , said the co-pilot was taken into the cabin in restraints in front of business - class passengers 15 minutes before the aircraft began its descent .
He told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation : " He was very , very distraught .
He was yelling loudly .
" His voice was clear so he did n't sound drunk or anything .
He was swearing and asking for God and very distressed .
He basically said he wanted to talk to God .
" When they tried to put his shoes on later , he swore and threatened people .
He was very , very distressed . "
Scroll down for more ...
Another passenger , Chris Robson , told how he had woken to the sound of many footsteps hurrying to the front of the plane about fiveanda - half hours into the flight .
He said that one of the crew announced to passengers : " We have a medical emergency . "
Mr Robson , a global training adviser , was sitting just yards from the co-pilot as he was being restrained by crew and passengers , including an off - duty member of the Canadian military , outside the galley , just behind the cockpit .
Mr Robson said of the co-pilot : ' He was clearly someone not in control of his senses .
" The captain came on and said the flight was being diverted to Shannon .
" I saw the crew all around a man on the floor outside the galley .
It appeared they were restraining him .
He was looking around .
He was swearing and yelling . "
Mr Robson added that others on board said they heard the rambling First Officer say " he wanted to talk to God ... that the plane was low on fuel " .
He said that later , as the co-pilot was being escorted off the plane by airport police , members of the Irish Garda and two paramedics , he had his eyes closed and was mumbling to no one in particular : " It 's OK .
You can text me .
You can e-mail me . "
After the landing at Shannon Airport at 7.30 am on Monday , passengers had to wait about seven hours before another flight crew arrived from Heathrow to fly them to London on the same plane .
Air Canada spokesman John Reber said : " It would be inappropriate for us to specify the cause of the illness , whether physical or psychological .
" The captain and crew followed correct operational procedures when the co-pilot fell ill .
" At the time nobody 's safety was compromised .
He is in the care of health professionals who will determine the extent of his illness .
Air Canada has sent a pilot to accompany the man 's wife . "
Captain Andy Wilson , president of the Air Canada Pilots Association said : " Although the illness of flight crew is rare , pilots are fully trained for such an event . "
A spokesman for regulators Transport Canada said they would interview the flight crew and airline .
She said commercial pilots must undergo medical check - ups every six months but a psychiatric evaluation is not done unless it is deemed necessary .
Mr. Obama had visited Washington only a handful of times before taking office , and he was fresh enough to its ways that he bubbled over about his first trip on Air Force One in June 2005 .
He fretted about getting lost on his first trip to the White House , for a reception the day he was sworn in , and later marveled that there were flat - screen televisions in the Lincoln Bedroom .
But he remained ambivalent about the city and its institutions .
Unlike many senators with young children , he did not move his family to the capital .
He rarely spent more than three nights in Washington  aides would reserve tickets on several flights to make sure he got home to Chicago after the final Senate vote of the week .
Mr. Obama found the Hill a difficult place to fit in , and it was not always clear that he wanted to .
He was 43 when he arrived , younger than most of his colleagues  whose average age was 60  and even many senior staff members .
Unlike senators who come up through the House , he did not have an existing network of friends , and while some members of Congress bunk with others , he lived by himself in one of the nondescript new boxes along Massachusetts Avenue .
On the nights he was in town , he typically went alone to a Chinatown athletic club  not the Senate gym  or attended events on the Hill .
And for all his efforts to play down his celebrity , Mr. Obama was exceptional , and it was hard for him or anyone to ignore the aura and sense of history around him .
He was only the third black senator elected since Reconstruction .
His memoir was on The New York Times ’s best - seller list for 54 weeks .
And Washington society was eager to embrace him  a Capitol Hill newspaper ranked him as No. 2 on its list of most beautiful people .
Etching a Path
Mr. Obama was also pulling in big money .
He created a political action committee , the Hopefund , to increase his visibility and help other Democrats .
It raised $ 1.8 million the first year .
In the Senate , meanwhile , he was discovering the realities of being a senator  that not every bill is perfect ( or perfectly unacceptable ) and that most votes required balancing the good and bad .
Mr. Obama wanted to vote to confirm John G. Roberts Jr. for the Supreme Court , for example  he thought the president deserved latitude when it came to appointments  but Mr. Rouse advised against it , pointing out that Mr. Obama would be reminded of the vote every time the court made a conservative ruling that he found objectionable .
Mr. Obama took few bold stands and diverted little from the liberal orthodoxy he had embraced in the Illinois Senate .
His voting record in his first year in Washington , according to the annual rankings by National Journal , was more liberal than 82.5 percent of the Senate ( compared with , for example , Mrs. Clinton ’s 79.8 percent that year ) .
At first glance , it is business as usual at the great sandstone temple of Angkor Wat .
Through a drape of evening haze , the ancient Cambodian superstructure sees another batch of tourists process across its moat and marvel at its grandeur .
Local teenagers waggle cool drinks in the faces of passers - by and auto - rickshaw or " tuk - tuk " drivers loudly vie for business .
It looks like what it is – a boom town .
But the modern commercial success of the high - profile complex , on the site of the ancient city of Angkor , may be – literally – on shaky ground .
According to heritage experts carrying out restoration work at the temple , which is one of the biggest sets of religious ruins in the world , a plethora of new hotels , cashing in on the country 's near - exponential rise in tourist numbers , is sapping gallons of water from beneath nearby urban areas .
They say this could upset the delicate foundations on which Angkor Wat sits and could lead to parts of it – including its famous celestial apsara , or carved nymphs – taking an unheavenly tumble to earth .

Philippe Delanghe , the culture programme specialist at Unesco's Phnom Penh office , said this week : " There is a very important balance between the sand and water on which the temple is built .
And if that balance is taken away then we might have trouble with collapse .
" The growth in the number of hotels around Angkor Wat has meant that more and more holes are being drilled into the earth to extract water from the water table .
And this has profound consequences for this important mix .
" We saw something similar with the weakening of the stability of ruins in Indonesia two years ago , and there is the possibility that we will see something like this here . "
Mr Delanghe added that the long - term consequences of unstable ground beneath the monument could include cracked ceilings and falling pillars .
" If it becomes so damaged then we will have no tourists , " he added .
Locally , it is easy to see why comments such as these go down as badly as , say , a tumbling nymph .
The temple , which is venerated enough to appear on the national flag , is the jewel in Cambodia 's heritage crown .
Not only is it in the best condition of any such structure at the Angkor site : it has been tightly linked with Cambodia 's history for nearly a millennium .
It is thought to have been built as a funerary temple for King Suryavarman II ( who died in 1152 ) to honour Vishnu , the Hindu deity with whom he identified .
The sandstone blocks from which it was constructed were quarried more than 30 miles away and floated down the Siem Reap river .
Recent research suggests that Angkor – of which this temple was surely the centrepiece – was an urban settlement that covered some 700 square miles , comparable in size to Greater London , and therefore the world 's largest medieval city .
With cultural attractions like this , it is little wonder that tourism is such an important source of revenue for the impoverished and ( until 10 years ago ) war - blighted nation .
In many parts of Cambodia , a £ 100 annual income is still enough to live on .
In 1993 , when Angkor was first added to Unesco 's World Heritage List , the militant Khmer Rouge were still active in certain areas .
Just 7,600 souls ventured to the temple complex that year .
Since then , however , Cambodia has become " safe " in the eyes of the international community , and package tours have landed in fleets .
In 2007 , about two million tourists visited Cambodia , with half stopping at Angkor Wat .
With tourist traffic continuing to increase by about 20 per cent year on year , some three million people are expected to visit the country in 2010 .
The temple has become a must - see stop on any tour of south - east Asia .
Such popularity is , clearly , a mixed blessing .
At the nearby town of Siem Reap , there are now hundreds of garish hotels and guest - houses , with many more in the pipeline .
Wealthy travellers can stay in the centrally located Le Meridien , replete with its Romanesque swimming pool , for about $ 300 ( £ 150 ) a night , before heading out for a swift nine holes at the Nick Faldo - designed Angkor Golf Resort .
Most of the restaurants serve Western food , and the Associated Press has reported that several notable old buildings have been razed to the ground to make room for fresh accommodation .
" The identity Siem Reap had for centuries is gradually disappearing , or maybe almost disappeared , " Teruo Jinnai , the director of Unesco 's office in Cambodia , said recently .
" You have restaurants , massage parlours , hotels , and it 's very sad to see that . "
The crowds also take their toll on the local built heritage .
" Pollution from buses , which often leave their engines running to supply air conditioning , will cause darkening of the stone , " said Mr Delanghe .
Further to this , the five - tiered Phnom Bakheng hilltop temple , an important relic of the ancient Khmer civilisation like Angkor Wat , sees some 3,000 tourists climb up its narrow stone staircases every evening .
At its summit people can view a picturesque sunset over Angkor Wat .
But on the way there , the punters are wearing through its precious sandstone carvings , which they use as handholds during the climb .
John Stubbs , of the World Monuments Fund , said last year : " It simply cannot survive this daily assault .
Unless it is completely closed off for essential repairs , Phnom Bakheng will suffer critical damage . "

The growth of Siem Reap is causing other problems , too .
" This tremendous growth added to population increase has been exacerbating pressure on infrastructure , " a 2005 World Bank report said .
" Energy , water , sewage and waste are all significant problems ...
Most guesthouses reportedly dump used water directly into the river , causing noticeable river pollution . "
E. coli , the bacteria found in human faeces , has begun seeping into local wells .
Sadly , the most high - profile victim of Cambodia 's success in tourism could well be Angkor Wat itself .
The World Bank report added that " one of Angkor 's temples is reportedly falling into a sinkhole , suggesting that the underground aquifers may be rapidly disappearing " .
The monument in question was the Bayon temple , famous for the delicate faces carved on to its 54 towers .
It is reportedly still collapsing into the sandy ground and visitors can observe its sinking foundations and widening cracks .
The cultural specialists now claim that if it is happening there , it could happen anywhere .
Mr Jinnai said this week : " Test wells have conclusively proven that the ground water level is definitely lowering in Siem Reap town .
While it is not yet considered at a dangerous level , if the water intake doubles or triples then it is going to get really dangerous around the city and this could well affect historic monuments such as Angkor Wat in the long term . "
And even the former Japanese ambassador Fumiaki Takahashi , who during his recently ended tenure , bemoaned the lack of control surrounding water extraction in Siem Reap .
It was the Cambodian government 's " urgent task " to control such things , he explained , because " if you take too much water , it might affect the Angkor site .
In the long run , the underground water will go down and the site would sink . "
Soeung Kong , deputy director general of the Aspara Authority , which oversees Angkor 's upkeep , has urged people to keep a level head about this potential damage .
He told Agence France Press : " The harm to the temples is unavoidable .
We are trying to keep that harm to a minimal level . "
The Japan International Cooperation Agency ( Jica ) is collaborating with Unesco over recommendations for water management .
One Jica report has suggested the removal of underground water from near Phnom Kraom , a hill near the edge of the Tonle Sap lake about 7.4 miles to the south , as an alternative to the town 's own groundwater .
The plan has won the backing of Cambodia 's deputy tourism minister , Thong Khon .
Another solution put forward is the promotion of temples away from Angkor Wat , to relieve the pressure on it .
This will be helped as infrastructure networks are built , such as a new road to Koh Ker , which boasts a collection of temples and towers to the north of Siem Reap .
Another idea being considered by officials would be to limit access to the temple compound using a reservation system ; such solutions would at least minimise the risks of direct damage by tourists .
Any of these systems could combine well with Heritage Watch , which promotes sustainable tourism in Siem Reap .
The organisation certifies local companies as " heritage - friendly " or not .
Such a label indicates the adherence to such things as clean environmental policies , support for the local economy , or contributions toward preservation .
But overall , Mr Delanghe stressed that much more research was necessary before any particular path could be backed .
Unesco is due to come up with its final suggestions for the future in May .
In all likelihood these recommendations , Mr Delanghe said , would include the suggested assembly of a central database to monitor the amount of water being extracted in Siem Reap .
" As long as we do n't have the data we do n't know what is going on , " he warned .
But back at Angkor Wat , we do .
Dusk has fully descended .
Tourists are being expelled from the site , and are being told , helpfully enough , to stop sitting on the ruins , lest they damage them with their rucksacks .
One by one they file out from its inner sanctum : past the Statue of Vishnu , through the suitably gargantuan Elephant Gate , to make their careful way back across the sandstone causeway to the parked cars beyond .
For now , the temple 's future remains secure .
The fleet of vehicles start their engines , fire up their air conditioning , and slowly make their way back to the growing sea of neon that is Siem Reap .

A new Silicon Valley startup called International Data Security ( IDS ) has sent some big waves through the data storage industry by announcing ( PDF ) its intent to set up a fleet of data - serving cargo ships .
These floating data centers will come equipped not only with standard storage services like SAN ( Storage Area Network ) and NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) , but also with amenities such as private offices , overnight accommodations , and galley services .
To save money , IDS is purchasing decommissioned ships that were scheduled to go to the scrapyard , then refurbishing them in drydock .
According to founder Ken Choi , the first ship — which will also house the new IDS headquarters — is scheduled to come online in April , and it will be parked at San Francisco 's Pier 50 along with its sister ships .
Each ship has approximately 200,000 square feet of usable space .
The company plans to deploy as many as 22 ships in North America and 50 ships worldwide .
IDS has plans to make use of the seagoing nature of their data centers for more than just Homer Simpson - esque parties in international waters .
The ships will use sea water for cooling the servers , which IDS says will will eliminate the need for external cooling solutions and shave 30 percent from their total energy consumption .
In addition to the standard data center backup generators , the ships will use their own built - in generators to provide additional power .
During disaster scenarios , these generators can run off the ship 's fuel , providing nearly a month of continuous operation .
IDS says they will be able to outfit a ship and have it docked in New York or San Francisco in a matter of months .
IDS Floating data center mockups
Because the ships are designed to carry standard shipping containers , there are all sorts of interesting possibilities for the deployment of complete data solutions , such as Sun 's Project Blackbox or Google 's own portable datacenter project .
In addition to these esoteric applications , the IDS ships will also provide more mundane services such as colocation for web site hosting and Internet Service Providers .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
The superheroes of “ Justice League of America ” will have to hang up their costumes , because the Hollywood writers strike prevents Warner Bros.
from sorting out problems with the movie ’s script .
The feature , starring DC Comics staples such as Superman , Batman and Wonder Woman in live - action flesh , was to have been a special - effects extravaganza for the studio .
George Miller ( “ Happy Feet ” ) was attached as director .
Word leaked in the fall that the script , by the husband - and - wife team of Kieran and Michele Mulroney , was good but that subsequent rewrites , including the latest by Miller , had pacing issues and took the project in the wrong direction .
With the 11 - week writers strike in full swing , the studio decided it was best to wait to iron out the problems .
Adding to the woes were questions of tax - incentive qualifications in Australia , where Miller was preparing to shoot .
The project ’s costs were escalating , and the script would need an overhaul if the movie did n’t qualify for discounts .
The decision to put the project on hold now frees up the actors who had been cast in such roles as Superman ( Scott Porter ) , Batman ( Armie Hammer ) , Wonder Woman ( Megan Gale ) , Green Lantern ( Common ) and the Flash ( Adam Brody ) .
Extensions on their contracts expired Tuesday .
The studio is not afraid of losing the actors because playing iconic superheroes in “ Justice ” is seen as a starmaking turn .
“ Justice ’s ” delay is considered good news for Christopher Nolan ’s camp .
The director is in post - production on “ The Dark Knight , ” the sequel to “ Batman Begins , ” and is said to have been unhappy with the “ Justice League ” movie because its version of Batman clashed with his one , starring Christian Bale .
Nolan has been resisting directing a third “ Batman ” movie , though the studio would relish the possibility and could begin heavy courting .

The worst risk I would have encountered — I think ! — is just being ignored .
Realistically there was zero probability of being granted an interview with an official of the relevant ministry , and a less - than - zero chance that he or she would have anything to say beyond the equivalent of “ no comment . ”
In the story , I quote several observations by Andrew Lih , now of Hong Kong University .
Something I did n’t quote from him was a view he obtained from a Chinese official on this very topic :
" In China , we do n’t have software blocking Internet sites .
Sometimes we have trouble accessing them .
But that ’s a different problem .
I know that some colleagues listen to the BBC in their offices from the Webcast .
And I ’ve heard people say that the BBC is not available in China or that it ’s blocked .
I ’m sure I do n’t know why people say this kind of thing .
We do not have restrictions at all . ”
This was from Yang Xiaokun , First Secretary , Permanent Mission of China to the United Nations Office at Geneva .
You see the problem .
The Western press is full of stories about civilians in China ( and reporters in particular ) being confronted for their inappropriate use of the Internet .
Have you run into similar problems ?
Do you find yourself taking extra precautions when using the Internet ?
When living in Shanghai , and now in Beijing , my wife and I have lived in “ serviced apartments ” where perhaps many of the residents are foreigners .
In some ways , the Internet services there have been better than those enjoyed by typical Chinese people .
For instance , after the Christmas earthquake , in 2006 , that dramatically affected connections between most parts of Asia and the rest of the world , our apartment building in Shanghai was up and running comparatively quickly because it rented ( expensive ) satellite connections .
But when it comes to firewalls and other forms of interference , we ’ve been subject to the same problems as other users within China .
The precautions I ’ve taken have been these : first , I operate through a VPN ( in my case , WiTopia ) , which as I explain in the story encrypts transmissions through the Firewall .
Second , I rely on Skype for online chats since those too are safely encrypted .
And , although this probably is n’t necessary when I ’m using a VPN , when using webmail I go to secure sites — for instance , https://gmail.com rather than normal http :// , for an extra layer of encryption .
As I say , this is probably overkill .
I never use Internet cafés in China — I can use my Blackberry for e-mail in a pinch .
How does the Chinese search engine Baidu differ from Google.cn ?
There is an important technical difference between the two operations .
Baidu ’s servers are physically inside China .
This makes them very fast — queries do n’t have to go overseas or be processed by the cumbersome Great Firewall filters .
Moreover , Baidu pre-scrubs its search contents to meet the strictures of the Chinese government .
So there is no question of some troublesome material — say , about Taiwan — showing up in Baidu ’s results .
Google , meanwhile , is using its “ real ” index from servers outside China .
This means that Google ’s searches are often slower than Baidu ’s and more likely to run into problems because of touchy material .
Baidu ’s advertising campaign has heavily stressed its role as the “ real , ” authentically Chinese search engine , while Google is the foreign interloper .
Until recently this has given Baidu a big lead in the Chinese market , but Google appears at the moment to be making gains .

Leahy : Gonzales ' legalistic ' response needs ' full candor ' not ' word parsing '
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This Attorney General Alberto Gonzales responded to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee over what some Democrats have called his untruthful Congressional testimony in a letter released late Wednesday .
Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said Gonzales ' " legalistic " response was unsatisfactory and gave him an end - of - the - week deadline for " full candor . "
" The Attorney Generals legalistic explanation of his misleading testimony under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week is not what one should expect from the top law enforcement officer of the United States , " Leahy said .
The Vermont Democrat said he hoped Gonzales would use his next response to " clarify the many issues on which he appears not to have been forthcoming and to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people the whole truth .
In his response , Gonzales followed the outline of an administration explanation that was first floated in Sunday 's New York Times .
Gonzales acknowledged that certain aspects of the Bush administration 's expanded spying program " did precipitate very serious disagreement . "
But Gonzales said in testimony before Congress earlier this year he was referring to a still classified aspect of the program , not Bush 's authorization of warrantless wiretapping between Americans and suspected terrorists abroad .
Gonzales testified July 24 before the Judiciary Committee about a late - night visit he and Andrew Card made to John Ashcroft 's hospital bedside in March 2004 .
James Comey , Ashcroft 's former deputy , testified in May that Gonzales 's and Card 's visit was meant to overturn Justice Department objections to the two - year - old domestic spying program , which seemed to undercut Gonzales 's assertion that there was no " serious disagreement " about the program .
In Wednesday 's letter , Gonzales said he was " deeply concerned " with the accusations his " testimony was misleading . "
Gonzales acknowledged that in the wake of Sept. 11 , President Bush " authorized the NSA to undertake a number of highly classified intelligence activities .
... [ and ] all of them were authorized in one presidential order , which was reauthorized approximately every 45 days . "
The Ashcroft hospital visit apparently occurred toward the end of one of these 45 - day periods .
At that time , according to Gonzales ' letter , Comey was acting attorney general while Ashcroft was in the hospital recovering from surgery , and the Justice Department refused to reauthorize the broad executive order " because of concerns about the legal basis of certain of these NSA activities .

Mars rover scientists have launched a new long - term study on the Martian atmosphere with the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer , an instrument that was originally developed at the University of Chicago .
Thanasis Economou , Senior Scientist at Chicago 's Enrico Fermi Institute , suggested the new study after observing that the APXS instruments aboard NASA 's twin Mars rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , had recorded fluctuations in the argon composition of the Martian atmosphere .
" The amount of argon in the atmosphere is changing constantly , " Economou said .
During warmer seasons , approximately 95 percent of the Martian atmosphere consists of carbon dioxide .
Nitrogen accounts for almost 3 percent and argon for less than 2 percent .
But when winter sets in at one of the poles , carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere to form a polar cap , causing a low - pressure system that moves air toward the pole .
Argon stays in the atmosphere and becomes enhanced because it freezes at a much lower temperature , Economou said .
An instrument on NASA 's Odyssey orbiter around Mars found that on the Mars south pole during the winter , the argon concentration is six times higher than during the warmer seasons .
" The amount of argon that comes with the air mass stays in the atmosphere , " he explained .
" Carbon dioxide drops , so the ratio of argon to carbon dioxide is increasing constantly until the next season . "
With the onset of warmer spring and summer temperatures , the frozen carbon dioxide evaporates back into the atmosphere , causing a high - pressure system that pushes the air mass back toward the equator .
" The fact that we see a signal at all means there 's a lot of mixing between the polar air and the air at the tropics , " said Ray Pierrehumbert , the Louis Block Professor in Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago , who specializes in the evolution of climate on Earth and Mars .
" It gives you a way of inferring aspects of the Martian circulation that you can't observe at all with any other instrument that 's out there , " he said .
Scientists are coupling the APXS measurements with additional data collected by the orbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft .
The APXS measures the number of argon atoms at the rover 's location between the instrument and the ground - a distance of a couple of centimeters ( a few inches ) .
Odyssey 's gamma-ray spectrometer , meanwhile , measures the argon in a column of air extending from the upper atmosphere to the Martian surface , but over an area spanning several hundred kilometers ( a couple hundred miles )
Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004 .
Until now , their APXS instruments have focused on measuring the chemical content of rocks and dust sitting on the ground .
During the mission 's first 90 days , for example , Opportunity 's APXS contributed to the identification and analysis of abundant sulfate salts and other minerals suggestive of once - moist environments on the vast plain known as Meridiani Planum .
" It means that at some point the site was soaked with liquid water , " Economou said .
Opportunity 's APXS also performed a key analysis of the first meteorite ever discovered on Mars .
When Opportunity encountered Heat Shield rock in 2005 , " it looked like a meteorite , but it was confirmed with the APXS , " Economou said .
It was the first of at least four meteorites that Opportunity has discovered .
" If you go to Antarctica you find lots of them because you can spot them , " he said .
" On Mars also , when you have these large , flat areas that have just sand and sand dunes , nothing else , and you now see some suspicious rock , you know that it 's not from there . "
Either it is debris that has been ejected from an impact crater , or a meteorite .
In recent months , the APXS on the Spirit rover measured the composition of soils consisting of 90 percent pure silica , which could have formed in a hot - spring environment or some other process involving water .
The finding presents some of the best evidence yet that water once existed at Gusev crater .
" This is a remarkable discovery , " said Cornell University 's Steve Squyres , who heads the Mars rovers ' science instruments team .
" The fact that we found something this new and different after nearly 1,200 days on Mars makes it even more remarkable .
It makes you wonder what else is still out there . "
Opportunity now has traveled more than six miles through some difficult sandy terrain to reach Victoria Crater , which measures half a mile in diameter .
Rolling up to the edge of the crater , the rover has taken images of the layered sediments , various rock types and accumulations of sand visible at the base of the walls .
NASA engineers have scouted a possible route that Opportunity could safely follow onto the crater floor .
A dust storm in the region has delayed plans to send Opportunity into the crater .

It 's always nice to get a little something back from the tax man , especially around this time of year .
But the recent opening of a new hotel in Christchurch , New Zealand , has proved to be a deliciously sweet moment for a local property developer who has been engaged in a running battle with the inland revenue department for the past 13 years .
On location ... bedrooms are compact with designer touches
Hotel SO has 284 rooms , 190 of which can best be described as compact , but featuring designer touches such as graphic repeat patterned wallpaper and mood - enhancing lighting .
Following the models of the Hoxton Hotel in London or Yotel at Gatwick Airport , unwanted amenities such as mini-bars and Corby trouser presses have been replaced by the smart features , such as wireless access and MP3 sockets in the rooms , that many modern travellers now so crave .
Room sizes are smaller , but the savings are being passed on to guests , with doubles starting from a very reasonable NZ$ 89 ( £ 32 ) a night .
So far , so not especially ground - breaking .
But what is special about Hotel SO is the location .
Not so much the central Christchurch position , but the fact that it is in the building that once housed the inland revenue department that pursued developer Dave Henderson into bankruptcy .
The financial wrangle has been documented in the film We 're Here To Help , which was released in New Zealand to coincide with the opening of the hotel on November 6 .
But if you can't wait for the UK release , here 's a brief synopsis of what happened .
In 1994 , Henderson dispatched his girlfriend to the tax offices to submit an application for a NZ $ 65,000 ( £ 23,723 ) rebate .
Inappropriate comments were made to the girlfriend , and Henderson felt obliged to defend her honour .
Result : a Kafka - esque twist in which the tax office audited his books and issued a claim for NZ$ 1 m ( £ 365,159 ) .
A four - year legal battle in the high courts followed , the claim was eventually overturned and Henderson received his original NZ $ 65,000 refund .
At which point , most people would probably be happy to retire to a quiet corner and lick their wounds , along with the insides of a couple of bottles of champagne .
Revenge tasted sweeter to Henderson , however , so he bought the building , put his name over the door and evicted the tax department .
He then set about raising the NZ$ 40 m ( £ 14,606,388 ) to develop the space into Hotel SO , and is now looking to roll out more in Auckland and possibly London and New York .
So , really , we owe a debt of gratitude to the New Zealand inland revenue , the tax department that just likes to keep giving .
I did n't know Sean Hannity worked for the IRS too .
The IRS is investigating the United Church of Christ over a speech Sen. Barack Obama gave at its national meeting last year after he became a candidate for president , the denomination said Tuesday .
In a letter the denomination received Monday , the IRS said " reasonable belief exists " that the circumstances surrounding the speech violated restrictions on political activity for tax - exempt organizations .
The denomination has denied any wrongdoing .
Obama , a member of Trinity United Church of Christ , spoke about faith and public life at the denomination 's June 2007 General Synod in Hartford , Conn .
The UCC had invited Obama to speak a year before he announced he was running for president because of his involvement in the denomination , Guess said .
Church leaders consulted with lawyers before the event on following IRS rules .
Before Obama spoke , a top church official told the crowd that the senator 's talk was not a campaign - related event and that no leaflets or other signs of political support would be allowed ... read on
MIKE PERRY , a 31 - year - old rower , trained by himself in Ann Arbor , Mich. , for six years while his wife attended medical school .
Now he is a member of the United States rowing team and hopes to be selected in a couple of months to compete in the Summer Olympic Games .
These days , he works with a coach and a team , and for the first time he is also going to a gym twice a week and lifting free weights for his upper and lower body , and doing a lot of core exercises , he said .
His coach insists upon it .
Mr. Perry , though , said he cannot tell whether weight lifting is helping his performance .
His 29 - year - old teammate , Mark Flickinger , thinks weight lifting has helped him .
He said it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of training by rowing on the water and weight lifting at the gym .
But , he added , after three years of working with weights  including lifting to failure , the point at which he cannot do another repetition  he has become a better athlete .
The training “ improved my P.B. ’s by a substantial margin , ” he said , referring to personal bests , his best performances .
OAKLAND , California – Hans Reiser , the Linux developer accused of murdering his wife , had nearly $ 9,000 and his passport with him when authorities detained him three weeks after his wife went missing in 2006 , a police officer testified here Thursday .
The officer , Jesse Grant , said that the authorities were exercising a search warrant on Sept. 28 , 2006 and took a host of clothed and unclothed photos of the defendant in the Oakland police station to chronicle whether he had been in struggle .
The wife , Nina Reiser , was last seen Sept. 3 , 2006 , after she dropped off the divorcing couple 's children to his house in the Oakland hills for the Labor Day weekend .
The clothed pictures , which were displayed to jurors on a large monitor , showed an overweight Hans Reiser with a small mark on his chest and back .
The defendant is about 40 pound slimmer now .
He sat in court with the same dark coat he has donned for months , often peppering his attorney with questions .
" Other than those acne or a scratch , you did n't find any other marks that indicate a struggle that day ? " defense attorney William DuBois asked Grant , who was under cross examination .
" Correct sir . "
UPDATE at bottom of the jump .
He said he detected a small mark on his chest and back , which was photographed and shown to the jury .
He later added that " There were some small marks , but nothing of significance . "
The officer also testified the defendant flatulated in his face when the authorities were snapping nude photos of him Sept. 28 , 2006 .
The officer said Reiser told him : " ' You 're about to experience chaos ' and , for lack of a better term , he farted in my face . "
Jurors snickered and the defendant grinned .
" Did you make a report of that ? "
DuBois asked the officer .
" No .
But it stays vividly in my head . "
DuBois asked him whether the department had any other " persons of interest . "
The officer responded that the authorities checked out Anthony Zografos , the woman 's boyfriend at the time she vanished .
The officer , however , said Hans Reiser " was probably the main one at a certain point . "
" I was assigned to interview Anthony Zografos , " Grant added .
Under direct examination , he testified that the battery of the defendant 's cell phone was removed .
( Prosecutor Paul Hora has told jurors during his opening remarks in November that the whereabouts of a person with a dead cell phone cannot be traced .
Nina Reiser 's cell phone , which authorities found in her van a few miles away from the defendant 's house , also had its battery removed . )
The defendant , operator of Namesys , has pleaded not guilty and faces a life sentence if convicted .
He remains jailed without bail .
He claims his wife moved back to Russia , where the divorcing couple met , and abandoned her two young children , now 6 and 8 .
The jury is being excused for the day and testimony will resume Monday .
UPDATE
After the break , the lawyers haggled with each other in open court over exhibits and other procedures .
The jury had left .
At one point , the defendant was by himself at the defense table .
Testimony resumes Monday .
Wired News ' Norman Quebedeau moved to the vacant jury box and captured the images on this jump .

San Francisco is one push of the pedal closer to offering residents and visitors a bike - sharing program in an effort to ease traffic congestion and to promote health through exercise .
More than a dozen European cities have government - sponsored programs in which bikes are provided for people to share .
Last month , Paris started the most ambitious program yet , providing more than 10,000 bikes at 750 stations and expecting that the program will be double in size by year 's end .
Now , hilly San Francisco is gearing up for a program of its own .
A proposed city contract with Clear Channel Outdoor Inc. that gives the company advertising rights on transit shelters also would require the company to set up a bike - sharing program if the city opts for one .
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the contract this month .
The cost to use such a program would be free or nominal , San Francisco leaders say , pointing to the Paris project as a possible model .
In Paris , particularly in the heart of the city , bike - docking stations are set up within a few hundred feet of each other .
A one - day pass costs about $ 1.40 ; a weekly pass nears $ 7 ; an annual pass runs about $ 41 .
Inexpensive rental rates are charged on top of that , although the first half - hour of each trip is free .
A deposit of about $ 200 is required in case the bike is n't returned .
The bikes are unlocked with a swipe of a credit card or a pre-paid card .
More than 100,000 Parisians have bought a one - year pass since the program started in July , and city officials report that the bikes have been taken on nearly 4 million trips .
The contract with Clear Channel falls under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Transportation Agency , which would have to tell Clear Channel to start the bike - sharing program .
Mayor Gavin Newsom said that if he wins re-election he will urge the MTA to act on the option .
" The appetite for the system is there , and people will naturally gravitate toward it , " said Newsom , who lobbied for the bike - sharing provision in the contract .
He said that San Francisco residents want City Hall to make good on the official goal of reducing auto congestion and air pollution , and that biking is a good way to help do that .
And the easier the city makes it for people to use a two - wheeler , the more likely they will , Newsom and other advocates say .
" People will think twice about the need to get in their car and go five or 10 blocks , " the mayor said .
Michael Poremba , a cycling enthusiast who lives in San Francisco and works in Redwood City , was in Paris in August and said he was amazed at what he saw .
" Everywhere you looked , people were riding the bikes , tons of people , " he said .
" I think it could work really well here , " said Poremba , a 38 - year - old data architect .
" If people need to go on a quick errand , they could just grab a bike and go . "
The sturdy , three - speed , gray bikes used in Paris cost around $ 2,000 apiece .
They 're embedded with electronic tracking devices , and a computerized system monitors the inventory at each station .
The company in charge of Paris ' outdoor ads , JC Decaux , paid the startup costs for the program and is responsible for maintaining it .
The company has the exclusive right to 1,600 Parisian billboards .
Under the proposed San Francisco contract , Clear Channel would pay the MTA at least $ 306 million over the next 20 years and , if asked , fund and maintain a bike - sharing program .
In return , Clear Channel would get the advertising rights on bus shelters and free - standing street kiosks .
What the proposed contract does n't spell out is the scope of the bicycle program .
Details such as how many bikes and stations would be included , where they would be located , what kind of technology would be used , whether there would be user fees and , if so , how much they would be , would be addressed in a separate agreement .
Liability issues also would need to be decided .
Paul DeMaio , a bike - sharing consultant in Washington , D.C. , said San Francisco should think big .
" It certainly would be in San Francisco 's best interest to have thousands of bicycles to make it a viable transportation mode , " he said .
Convenience is one of the keys to success , said Rachel Kraai , the programs manager for the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition .
People use the bikes in the popular European programs to run errands , grab a bite during their lunch hours or to get from a train station to their office , she said .
It 's those mini trips , Newsom said , that will help San Francisco " create a more - sustainable transportation system . "
DeMaio said programs in Paris , Lyon , Barcelona and other cities that marry advanced technology with pedal power are the third generation of the concept .
The first generation , which San Francisco toyed with in the 1990s and other cities have experienced with mixed results , consists of placing a bunch of donated bikes - often painted yellow - around the city and letting people ride them for free , leaving them for the next user when they 're done .
But that utopian vision often fails :
The bikes are regularly vandalized or stolen .
The next generation of programs involve bikes stored in designated locked racks so at least people would know where to locate them , DeMaio said .
Such programs can be found in Copenhagen and Helsinki , where users pay a minimal deposit when they pick up the bikes and get the deposits back when they return them - much like the system some grocery stores use for their carts .
The third generation of bike - sharing programs is high - tech , with electronic payment , tracking and locking systems .
San Francisco is not the only major city in the United States eager to start such a bike - sharing program .
Washington , D.C. , is moving forward with one , and officials in Portland , Ore. , and Chicago have expressed interest .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who visited Paris last month , said his administration is exploring a bike - sharing endeavor , but he told reporters on his trip abroad that he did n't know how it would translate in the Big Apple where bike theft is widespread , liability is a big worry , and there are n't a lot of bike lanes .
Newsom said he 's heard similar concerns from people in his own city government , but he said if Paris could work it out , so can San Francisco .
Newsom said it is unclear how long a full - scale program could take to develop .

Microsoft must now pay a record 899 m euros ( $ 1.4bn ; £ 680.9 m ) after it failed to comply with a 2004 ruling that it abused its dominant market position .
The ruling said that Microsoft was guilty of not providing key code to rival software makers .
EU regulators said the firm was the first to break an EU anti-trust ruling .
The fines come on top of earlier fines of 280 m euros imposed in July 2006 , and of 497 m euros in March 2004 .
" Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU competition policy that the Commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision , " Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement .

An investigation concluded in 2004 that Microsoft was guilty of freezing out rivals in products such as media players , while unfairly linking its Explorer internet browser to its Windows operating system at the expense of rival servers .
The European Court of First Instance upheld this ruling last year , which ordered Microsoft to pay 497 m euros for abusing its dominant market position .
DISPUTE TIMELINE
March 2004 : EU fines Microsoft 497 m euros and orders it to release key Windows code to rival software developers September 2004 : Microsoft tries to have the ruling temporarily suspended April 2006 : Microsoft appeals the ruling in the European Court of First Instance September 2007 : Microsoft loses its appeal
Last week , the firm announced that it would open up the technology of some of its leading software , including Windows , to make it easier to operate with rivals ' products .
" As we demonstrated last week with our new interoperability principles and specific actions to increase the openness of our products , we are focusing on steps that will improve things for the future , " Microsoft said .
Further cases
But the firm is still being pursued by Brussels .
Last month , the European Commission launched two new anti-competition investigations against Microsoft into similar issues .
The first will look at whether there are still problems regarding Microsoft abusing its dominance of the PC market to grab market share of the internet .
The Commission will also investigate the continued interoperability of Microsoft software with rival products .
Below is a selection of your comments :
Why should Microsoft have to pay fines for something like this ?
All manufacture and trade is competition whether you want to accept it or not .
If you fine Microsoft for competition then you have to fine every company and firm in Europe for competing with other companies and trying to be better than them .
Some are always going to be better and you can't stop it from happening .
Elias Lammi , Vammala , Finland
Last time I checked Microsoft was worth somewhere in the region of $ 350bn , so a fine of $ 1.3 bn is nothing ; it 's less than 0.3 % of their overall wealth and hardly a deterrent .
Should the EU feel the need to do this again , they should strive to impose a fine that has a more noticeable effect on the company 's turnover .
Something that would make the board members and share holders sit up and take notice .
Stephen Sweeney , London
Microsoft have every right to compete the way they want .
If they reveal the key window code , how can they sustain competitiveness .
Did any other company teach them the code ?
No , it is one of the rare resource , where others failed in acquiring such ideas and intellectual capital .
I hope EU is not going to fine Microsoft for not helping its competitors to acquire working culture which embedded down the company .
zubair , Melbourn / Australia
Not enough .
Microsoft has been getting away with uncompetitive behaviour for far too long .
They should no longer be allowed to sell any product without publishing every line of source code .
Brian Beesley , UK
I think it is a bad ruling because Microsoft is being charged for not sharing their OWN code they wrote .
Microsoft has every right not to share what they wrote .
There 's many other platforms out there for companies to write code for .
There are many alternatives to web browsers and media players to download off the internet to begin with , so I do n't see how this is a problem .
Nathan Vorgang , West Lafayette , IN , USA
I believe that the fine is too small for Microsoft .
Mohammad Bashir , Philadelphia , PA USA
I find it amazing that we have such ridiculous laws !!
Why are we punishing a company for being good ??
It 's not Microsoft 's fault that no - one else has come up with products that can compete ...
Andy , Bracknell
Microsoft MUST be brought to account for its ' practice of dominating by exclusion .
If the company , Microsoft , continues to practice in a manner which refuses to be competitive , then it should be excluded from the EU .
Nicholas Carton , USA
Nicholas Carton , Saint Louis , Missouri USA
I find it amazing that the EU can put sanctions on a company , who are to them '' anti-competition ' '
Yet have a complete monopoly on money in the form of the Euro .
If it did n't make me laugh , it 'd make me cry !
Richard Wilkins , Westbury , Wiltshire , Uk .
Definitely agree with the European Commission , even though I am employed as a microsoft . net developer .
Iain , Truro / UK
I very much agree with the decision of the European Commission .
Microsoft , throughout its history , has been guilty of abusing its de facto dominance of pc operating systems .
The US Federal Government has always favoured the company 's interests over the customers and so the market abuse has continued .
Microsoft must learn to compete rather than try to snuff out or take over competitors and companies with technology that they want .
R W Bater , Sutton Coldfield , West Midlands
I do not agree with the EU .
Whom is the judgement awarded too ?
The EU or does it go to the Microsoft competitors ?
What happened to innovations and property protection ?
Like a number of things coming out of Brussels it does not make sense .
Hans K Vieregge , Aviemore , Great Britain
I am glad that Microsoft have been fined , if they had made the code open suorce , then they would not have been the main target for hackers , and may have ended up with a better product .
How many times have you heard of Linux software being hacked ?
its not !!
as all the lines of code are open source .
If you have a problem with Linux you can actually converse with the person who wrote the code .
This is not possible with Windows .
If you use Linux or a Unix based operating system , you will be less likely to be hacked .
Ian , London
I think the fines are ridiculously high and that the EU is going after Microsoft because its a good American business .
Sure Microsoft was a little arrogant but the fines are way to high .

Nick Clegg has been Lib Dem leader for three months
Nick Clegg speech
Lib Dem leaders have traditionally made proportional representation the price of a deal with other parties in the event of a hung parliament .
But in his first speech as leader , Mr Clegg went further by demanding a shake - up of the whole political system .
He also flagged up the possibility of the Lib Dems offering tax cuts at the next general election .
" If we want a better Britain , with opportunity for everyone , we 've got to have fair taxes .
Cutting income tax by 4 p in the pound is a great start
Nick Clegg
John Pienaar 's view on Clegg
" Cutting income tax by 4 p in the pound is a great start .
" But we must never stop thinking about how we make taxes fairer . "
The party is considering a tax on the homes of the super rich to pay for cuts lower down the income scale .
Mr Clegg received a three - minute standing ovation for his speech at the party 's spring conference in Liverpool .
He spoke for more than 50 minutes without notes , overcoming a few initial signs of nervousness to deliver an impassioned plea for political change .
He told delegates electoral reform " was n't enough " and he wanted to " redesign " Britain 's political system for the 21st Century .
The speech was being sold as an attempt to move on from a damaging row over the EU treaty which saw the resignation last week of three frontbenchers .
I will never allow the Liberal Democrats to be a mere annexe to another party
Nick Clegg
Views on Clegg speech
Mr Clegg joked that if the party had wanted to rebel in the past they would have had to " borrow MPs from the other parties " .
But he made no further mention of the EU treaty debate , focusing instead on portraying the Lib Dems as an " anti-establishment " force that can smash Britain 's two - party system .
He called for a new crackdown on sleaze - with by - elections for MPs who break the rules .
And he vowed to fight for an " end to big money politics " - proposing a £ 25,000 limit on political donations .
He also addressed the question of alliances with other parties head - on , saying he would never join a Conservative or a Labour government .
" I will never allow the Liberal Democrats to be a mere annexe to another party .
" But am I interested in building a new type of government ?
Yes .
The future of hundreds of thousands of children sold down the river because the Labour party sold its soul and became the second Conservative party
Nick Clegg
" Based on pluralism instead of one party rule ?
Yes .
" A new system , that empowers people not parties ?
Yes .
" We want a new , more liberal Britain . "
Aides refused to be drawn on the precise details of the new " pluralistic " government Mr Clegg wanted .
But they said the party was no longer interested in having a " few cabinet ministers sitting in a Tory or Labour government " - but wanted a constitutional convention to examine all aspects of how Britain is governed .
Mr Clegg also focused on education and health in his speech - issues he believes matter more to ordinary voters than Europe .
He also pledged to build a " people 's NHS " with treatment within a specified waiting time or guaranteed private care .
In his speech , Mr Clegg mounted a sustained attack on his political opponents .
Tax cut claim
HAVE YOUR SAY
He should never say that he is not prepared to form a coalition with either the Labour or the Conservatives .
Change often is created from within and not necessary whilst in opposition C , UK
" Alistair Darling stole a policy from the Tories and announced an inheritance tax cut that will help only the richest 6 % of people .
" And do you know where they found the money ?
" If the reports are true , they scrapped a plan they 'd been developing all summer .
" A plan to cut child poverty .
" The future of hundreds of thousands of children sold down the river because the Labour party sold its soul and became the second Conservative party .
" Money taken from the poorest kids and given to the richest adults , no questions asked .
" Gutless , heartless , incompetent . "
He also attacked the Conservatives , saying Tory leader David Cameron for peddling " sham politics from a party bereft of belief , that will say anything to get elected " .
And he accused shadow chancellor George Osborne of " having more positions than the Kama Sutra " on Northern Rock .

Sea cucumber makes hard plastic go soft
A new material inspired by sea cucumbers can change easily from hard and rigid to soft and floppy , US researchers say .
When wet , the material changes from a stiff plastic to a rubber - like state in seconds , and it can change back just as quickly , the researchers report today in the journal Science .
It 's a feature they say may make it suited for medical implants .
The material mimics a trick that sea cucumbers perform .
The invertebrate sea creatures can quickly change the stiffness of their skin , forming a kind of armour in response to a threat .
" We used the skin of these sea cucumbers as the basis of a new class of artificial material that can change their mechanical properties on command , " says Professor Chris Weder , a researcher at Case Western Reserve University .
Weder and colleagues plan to use the material in medical applications , such as pliable brain electrodes used in treatments for people with Parkinson 's disease , stroke or spinal cord injuries .
The material could be stiff to make implanting it easier , then become flexible in the water - rich brain to more closely resemble surrounding tissue .
" If you look at the tissue of the brain , it is much , much softer than the typical electrode you would implant , " Weder says .
Experimental studies have shown electrodes that remain stiff can degrade surrounding tissue over time .
The new material is designed to overcome this mechanical mismatch , Weder says .
What 's it made from ?
The material is made from two compounds : a rubber - like polymer and tiny cellulose fibres that add stiffness .
Where the cellulose fibres cross , they form hydrogen bonds that make the whole material hard .
" These nanofibres are glued to each other wherever they intersect .
If you add water , the water will unglue those intersections , " says Weder , adding that the water acts as a hydrogen de-bonding agent .
Weder and colleagues glued and unglued the fibres in several experiments .
The researchers are testing the material in animals to see how it affects brain tissue .
Weder says the material also has potential for other biomedical implants , like stents .
He says the same principles could be used to develop electrically switchable materials , such as a type of ankle or body cast that could be stiff or flexible as needed .
And it could even be used in law enforcement .
" Think of an electrically switchable bulletproof vest that would be comfortable to wear , but that you could switch on to become bulletproof , " he says .

Murray Rothbard was the master of reducing complicated theories to their very essence while retaining theoretical rigor , and this essay is a case in point .

Its continued relevance speaks to an aspect of the Austrian theory that other theories can't boast .
It is a real theory that applies across time and place , and its persuasive power is not contingent on the particulars of any individual boom bust cycle .
CHICAGO  Jose Fernandez said he decided some time ago that on his salary as a restaurant worker , he was better off without his 1996 Toyota 4 Runner .
He hoped to make a nice bit of cash from its sale .
Before he could do that , though , someone beat him to extracting value :
A thief sneaked under the sport utility vehicle with a battery - powered saw , slicing from the Toyota ’s underbelly what may be one of the most expensive small parts of the auto world : the catalytic converter , an essential emissions - control device made with small amounts of metals more precious than gold .
Who knew ?
Mr. Fernandez did n’t .
Inside the lobby of the New Windy City Mufflers and Brakes shop , Mr. Fernandez said he had heard a rumor that catalytic converters had suddenly become the rage on the black market here , but he did not believe it until his went missing on a well - lighted North Side street .
Theft of scrap metals like copper and aluminum has been common here and across the country for years , fueled by rising construction costs and the building boom in China .

( CNN ) -- Debra Lafave , the former Florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student , violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker , a Florida judge found Thursday .
Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager .
She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18 .
But the judge did not send Lafave to jail , saying the violation was " not willful and substantial . "
" Please do n't come back , " he scolded .
Dressed in a tailored , black pantsuit , Lafave said she had " innocent " physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18 .
Watch Lafave in the courtroom »
At the time , she and the 17 - year - old hostess worked at Danny Boy's , a small restaurant in the Tampa , Florida , area .
Lafave , 27 , pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14 - year - old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation .
Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors .
A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court , prompting the prosecutor to observe , " I think she 's accounted for . "
Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation .
She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just " girl talk . "
Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers .
" I do n't speak that way about my personal life , " she said .
But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a " small group setting . "
While other co-workers socialized outside work , Lafave said , the 17 - year - old was not included in those outings .
Asked why she hugged the young co-worker , Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family .
The contact came , she said , " out of my good nature , that 's the way it worked . "
The contacts that led to Thursday 's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave 's court - ordered supervision .
She received a verbal reprimand a year ago , according to testimony .
When the behavior continued , her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation .
She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother 's beauty shop .
In the past , Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment .

Thousands of new offshore wind turbines could power every home in Britain by 2020 , the government announced today , as it set out new wind - energy plans .
John Hutton , the business secretary , proposed the creation of up to 33 gigawatts of offshore wind energy at a European energy industry conference in Berlin .
He called for companies to invest in large - scale farm development to generate enough power for up to 25 m homes in the next 12 years .
That would require around 7,000 turbines , or one every half - mile , Hutton told the BBC's Politics Show yesterday .
He admitted that " tough choices " would have to be made if the UK wanted to respond to climate change and become more self - sufficient .
" It is going to change our coastline , yes , for sure , " he said .
" There is no way of making the shift to a low - carbon technology without there being change and for that change to be visible and evident to people .
" We 've got a choice as a country about , you know , whether we rise to this challenge of change or whether we stick our head in the sand and hope it 's going to go away . "
The expansion will be subject to a strategic environmental assessment , which Hutton also launched today .
Currently just 2 % of Britain 's power comes from renewable energy sources , and wind provides less than half a gigawatt .
Hutton 's proposals got cautious backing from opposition parties .
" We 're an island nation - there 's a lot of wind around , " the shadow business secretary , Alan Duncan , told the Politics Show .
" We should use that offshore capacity for generating electricity that 's clean and secure . "
The Liberal Democrats ' environment spokesman , Chris Huhne , welcomed a " change in tone " from the government .
But the Lib Dem leadership candidate warned : " Ministers need to pay households to install microgenerators and also invest in big schemes like the Severn Barrage which alone could generate 5 % of our electricity needs . "
Michael Rea , the chief executive of the Carbon Trust , also said that " cost reduction is now the name of the game " .
" Offshore wind [ energy generation ] is set for huge growth but this will require substantial investment before it can be realised at this scale , " said Rea .
John Sauven , the executive director of Greenpeace , said that the plans amounted to a " wind energy revolution " but said premium prices had to be guaranteed for clean electricity .
He also called for Labour to " drop its obsession with nuclear power " .
" Hutton is proposing nothing less than a wind energy revolution , but it wo n't become a reality on the back of a speech , " he said .
" If we are finally to exploit the massive energy resources we have available to us on this windy island , there will now need to be a revolution in thinking in Whitehall , where the energy dinosaurs have prevailed for too long . "
" We need the government to guarantee premium prices for clean electricity so industry can take risks to get tens of thousands of turbines built and installed out at sea .
" And Labour needs to drop its obsession with nuclear power , which could only ever reduce emissions by about 4 % at some time in the distant future . "
He said Britain needed to slash its electricity emissions by 2020 , " and wind power , not nuclear , should get the money and support " .
" That 's the test , and we wait to see what government does next , " he added .
Friends of the Earth 's renewable energy campaigner , Nick Rau , said : " We are delighted the government is getting serious about the potential for offshore wind , which could generate 25 % of the UK 's electricity by 2020 .
" There is a lot more renewable energy out there – from big wave and tidal power projects to roof - mounted solar PV panels .
If we make the most of these abundant resources we could generate almost half of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
" The government must now set out what support mechanisms it will put in place to deliver on its proposals and make the most of other renewables .
It must also increase investment in the development of new renewable technology , including bigger and more efficient wind turbines . "
" We should also be cooperating with our European neighbours to make the most of our shared resources , for example by developing a European super - grid or large scale wind farms in the North sea . "
But the vice president of the Royal Academy of Engineering , Dr Sue Ion , said that wind power could only provide about 20 % of the country 's electricity to preserve grid stability .
" Laudable though the targets are , we urge government to think about the practicalities of deploying these technologies ; the engineering effort to build 7,000 large offshore turbines by 2020 would be enormous , unprecedented and is probably underestimated , " she said .
Ion said that the academy would be starting a new study on the engineering challenges of offshore wind projects , which would report next year .

A smear campaign against Oscar - winning French actress Marion Cotillard is now in full swing , with the establishment media attempting to hide the fact that her comments about 9/11 echo the sentiment of hundreds of widely - respected intelligence and scientific experts in addition to public opinion .
Cotillard ’s statements about the suspicious collapse of the WTC buildings mirror those of a 20 - year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence veteran .
In February 2007 , 20 - year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer , the second - ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence , and former CIA clandestine services case officer Robert Steele went on record as saying that , " Dick Cheney saw this as a gift of heaven , and organized the 9 - 11 exercises so as to have complete operational control of the U.S. government , and he " let it happen . "
Steele also directly accused WTC complex leaseholder Larry Silverstein of having advance knowledge of the attacks and rigging the WTC towers and Building 7 with demolition charges , " In order to clear the area for rebuilding and get the $ 7 billion in insurance money . "
Marion Cotillard basically echoed Steele ’s sentiment when she stated , " It ( the WTC complex ) was a money - sucker because they were finished , it seems to me , by 1973 , and to re-cable all that , to bring up - to - date all the technology and everything , it was a lot more expensive , that work , than destroying them . "
By dredging up statements made by Cotillard over 12 months ago , the spin doctors had hoped to isolate and ridicule the actress and make an example out of her while debunking 9/11 truth at a point in time where the official story holds about as much credibility as a used car salesman .
But the move will undoubtedly backfire because the establishment has failed to account for the fact that the majority of Americans and indeed global citizens doubt the official 9/11 story .
An October 2006 New York Times / CBS poll found that a paltry 16 % of Americans thought the government was telling the truth about 9/11 and the intelligence prior to the attacks , meaning 84 % doubted the accuracy of the official story .
A May 2006 Zogby poll found that over 70 million Americans supported a new investigation into 9/11 and less than half of the American public trusted the official 9/11 story or believed the attacks were adequately investigated .
The figure supporting a new investigation rose to 51 % of Americans in a September 2007 poll .
In addition , the same poll found that 67 % also faulted the 9/11 Commission for not investigating anomalous collapse of World Trade Center 7 .
As far back as August 2004 , another Zogby poll established the fact that half of New Yorkers believe there was government complicity in 9/11 .
The media is attempting to smear Cotillard as an anti-American French nutcase by making out that doubting the official 9/11 story is some kind of poisoned chalice and tantamount to holocaust denial .
The fact is that the 9/11 cover - up is so out in the open that most people with two brain cells to rub together know it ’s a con .
Cotillard is not going off on a mad tangent and endangering her career , she is merely saying what the majority of other people think .
During a French television interview , Cotillard said the public had been lied to about the terror attacks and highlighted the bizarre collapse of the twin towers in comparison with other buildings , specifically Madrid ’s Windsor Building , which burned intensely for over 24 hours yet did not implode like the WTC .
" We see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes .
Are they burned ?
They [ sic ] was a tower , I believe it was in Spain , which burnt for 24 hours .
It never collapsed .
None of these towers collapsed .
And there [ in New York ] , in a few minutes , the whole thing collapsed , " said Cotillard .
Hours after the comments were picked up by news outlets across the world , a reactionary media smear campaign was initiated , despite the fact that Cotillard actually made the statements over a year ago , and we were told that Cotillard ’s future Hollywood success was apparently " in jeopardy " .
Quite how expressing an opinion that matches with hundreds of other professors , scientists , former presidents , high government officials and intelligence veterans puts someone ’s career " in jeopardy " is not explained in the myriad of ad hominem hit pieces that have already surfaced over the course of the past 24 hours .
The Parliament of Japan , the former President of Italy , widely - respected CIA veteran Robert Baer and even American music icon Willie Nelson have all questioned 9/11 in recent months .
Since the attacks , a top former member of Tony Blair ’s cabinet , Germany ’s Secretary of Defense and the founder of Reagonomics have all slammed the official story – along with a cacophony of former government , military , intelligence and political professionals .
The Hollywood Today website cites the comments of 9/11 first responder " Mike Lennon " who calls the comments “ ignorant and despicable ” and encourages people to picket Cotillard ’s upcoming movie with Johnny Depp .
To assert that questioning the official 9/11 story is harmful to the victims is a tired old propaganda ruse that has been tried on many occasions in the past by establishment media hacks .
The fact is that the majority of victim ’s family members doubt the official story and have been pushing for a new investigation for years – as attested to by Bill Doyle , head of the largest victim ’s family support group .
In addition , 9/11 firemen and first responders were themselves the victims of an admitted government cover - up in the very hours after 9/11 when they were told that the toxic asbestos - laden air was safe to breathe – an official lie that has cost the heroes of 9/11 at best lifelong debilitating illnesses and at worst their lives .
The media ’s attempt to make an example out of Cotillard by digging up year - old comments in an organized smear attack campaign smacks of total desperation as the gatekeepers try to act as the little Dutch boy and block up the holes of the gaping official 9/11 story .

George Bush was due to make a speech .
He was looking for a theme that would give it some substance .
Something that would divert attention away from his fiascos in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Something simple , optimistic , easy to swallow .
Somehow , the idea of a " meeting " of leaders to promote the Israeli - Palestinian " process " came up .
An international meeting is always nice  it looks good on television , it provides plenty of photo - opportunities , it radiates optimism .
We meet , ergo we exist .
So Bush voiced the idea : a " meeting " for the promotion of peace between Israel and the Palestinians .
Without any preceding strategic planning , any careful preparations , anything much at all .
That ’s why Bush did not go into any details : no clear aim , no agenda , no location , no date , no list of invitees .
Just an ethereal meeting .
This fact by itself testifies to the lack of seriousness of the entire enterprise .
This may shock people who have never seen close up how politics are actually conducted .
It is hard to accept the intolerable lightness with which decisions are often made , the irresponsibility of leaders and the arbitrary way important processes are set in motion .
* * *
From the moment this idea was launched , it could not be called back .
The President has spoken , the initiative starts on its way .
As the saying goes :
One fool throws a stone into the water , a dozen wise men cannot retrieve it .
Once the " meeting " had been announced , it became an important enterprise .
The experts of all parties started to work frantically on the undefined event , each trying to steer it in the direction which would benefit them the most .
Bush and Condoleezza Rice want an impressive event , to prove that the United States is vigorously promoting peace and democracy , and that they can succeed where the great Henry Kissinger failed .
Jimmy Carter failed to turn the Israeli - Egyptian peace into an Israeli - Palestinian peace .
Bill Clinton failed at Camp David .
If Bush succeeds where all his illustrious predecessors have failed , wo n’t that show who is the greatest of them all ?
Ehud Olmert urgently needs a resounding political achievement in order to blur the memory of his dismal failure in the Second Lebanon War and to extricate himself from the dozen or so criminal investigations for corruption that are pursuing him .
His ambition knows no bounds : he wants to be photographed shaking the hand of the King of Saudi Arabia .
A feat no Israeli prime minister before him has achieved .
Mahmoud Abbas wants to show Hamas and the rebellious factions in his own Fatah movement that he can succeed where the great Yasser Arafat failed  to be accepted among the world ’s leaders as an equal partner .
This could , therefore , become a great , almost historic conference , if
* * *
If all these hopes were something more than pipedreams .
None of them has any substance .
For one simple reason : no one of the three partners has any capital at his disposal .
Bush is bankrupt .
In order to succeed at Annapolis , he would have to exert intense pressure on Israel , to compel it to take the necessary steps : agree to the establishment of a real Palestinian state , give up East Jerusalem , restore the Green Line border ( with some small swaps of territory ) , find an agreed - upon compromise formula for the refugee issue .
But Bush is quite unable to exert the slightest pressure on Israel , even if he wanted to .
In the US , the election season has already begun , and the two big parties are bulwarks standing in the way of any pressure on Israel .
The Jewish and Evangelistic lobbies , together with the neocons , will not allow one critical word about Israel to be uttered unpunished .
Olmert is in an even weaker position .
His coalition still survives only because there is no alternative in the present Knesset .
It includes elements that in any other country would be called fascist ( For historical reasons , Israelis do n’t like to use this term ) .
He is prevented by his partners from making any compromise , however tiny  even if he wanted to reach an agreement .
This week , the Knesset adopted a bill that requires a two - thirds majority for any change of the borders of Greater Jerusalem .
This means that Olmert cannot even give up one of the outlying Palestinian villages that were annexed to Jerusalem in 1967 .
He is also prevented from even approaching the ‘ core issues " of the conflict .
Mahmoud Abbas cannot move away from the conditions laid down by Yasser Arafat ( the 3rd anniversary of whose death was commemorated this week ) .
If he strays from the straight and narrow , he will fall .
He has already lost the Gaza Strip , and can lose the West Bank , too .
On the other side , if he threatens violence , he will lose all he has got : the favor of Bush and the cooperation of the Israeli security forces .
The three poker players are going to sit down together , pretending to start the game , while none of them has a cent to put on the table .

The majestic mountain seems to be getting smaller and smaller by the minute .
It ’s against the laws of nature : the closer we get to it , the smaller it seems .
What looked to many like a veritable Mt. Everest first turned into an ordinary mountain , then into a hill , and now it hardly looks like an anthill .
And even that is shrinking , too .
First the participants were to deal with the " core issues . "
Then it was announced that a weighty declaration of intentions was to be adopted .
Then a mere collection of empty phrases was proposed .
Now even that is in doubt .
Not one of the three leaders is still dreaming of an achievement .
All they hope for now is to minimize the damage  but how to get out of a situation like this ?
As usual , our side is the most creative at this task .
After all , we are experts in building roadblocks , walls and fences .
This week , an obstacle larger then the Great Wall of China appeared .
Ehud Olmert demanded that , before any negotiations , the Palestinians " recognize Israel as a Jewish state . "
He was followed by his coalition partner , the ultra - right Avigdor Liberman , who proposed staying away from Annapolis altogether if the Palestinians do not fulfill this demand in advance .
Let ’s examine this condition for a moment :
The Palestinians are not required to recognize the state of Israel .
After all , they have already done so in the Oslo agreement  in spite of the fact that Israel has yet to recognize the right of the Palestinians to a state of their own based on the Green Line borders .
No , the government of Israel demands much more : the Palestinians must now recognize Israel as a " Jewish state . "
Does the USA demand to be recognized as a " Christian " or " Anglo - Saxon state " ?
Did Stalin demand that the US recognize the Soviet Union as a " Communist state " ?
Does Poland demand to be recognized as a " Catholic state " , or Pakistan as an " Islamic state " ?
Is there any precedent at all for a state to demand the recognition of its domestic regime ?
The demand is ridiculous per se .
But this can easily be shown by analysis ad absurdum .
What is a " Jewish state " ?
That has never been spelled out .
Is it a state with a majority of Jewish citizens ?
Is it " the state of the Jewish people "  meaning the Jews from Brooklyn , Paris and Moscow ?
Is it " a state belonging to the Jewish religion "  and if so , does it belong to secular Jews as well ?
Or perhaps it belongs only to Jews under the Law of Return  i.e. those with a Jewish mother who have not converted to another religion ?
These questions have not been decided .
Are the Palestinians required to recognize something that is the subject of debate in Israel itself ?
According to the official doctrine , Israel is a " Jewish and democratic state . "
What should the Palestinians do if , according to democratic principles , some day my opinion prevails and Israel becomes an " Israeli state " that belongs to all its citizens  and to them alone ?
( After all , the US belongs to all its citizens , including Hispanic - Americans , African - Americans , not to mention " Native - Americans . " )
The sting is , of course , that this formula is quite unacceptable to Palestinians because it would hurt the million and a half Palestinians who are Israeli citizens .
The definition " Jewish state " turns them automatically into  at best  second class citizens .
If Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues were to accede to this demand , they would be sticking a knife in the backs of their own relatives .
Olmert & Co. know this , of course .
They are not posing this demand in order to get it accepted .
They pose it in order that it not be accepted .
By this ploy they hope to avoid any obligation to start meaningful negotiations .
Moreover , according to the deceased Road Map , which all parties pretend to accept , Israel must dismantle all settlements set up after March , 2000 , and freeze all the others .
Olmert is quite unable to do that .
At the same time , Mahmoud Abbas must destroy the " terror infrastructure . "
Abbas ca n’t do that either  as long as there is no independent Palestinian state with an elected government .
I imagine Bush tossing and turning in his bed at night , cursing the speechwriter who put this miserable sentence into his mouth .
On their way to heaven , his curses must be mingling with those of Olmert and Abbas .
* * *
When the leaders of the Jewish community in Palestine were about to sign the Declaration of independence on May 14 , 1948 , the document was not ready .
Sitting in front of the cameras and history , they had to sign on an empty page .
I am afraid that something like that will happen in Annapolis .
And then all of them will head back to their respective homes , heaving a heartfelt sigh of relief .
Action alert :
Do n't let the EU sanction DRM
Take action : Sign the Open Letter demanding that Viviane Reding retract her statement in support of DRM .
Yesterday , Viviane Reding , European Union commissioner for information society and media , issued a report sanctioning a " transparent " DRM framework for the EU .
This irresponsible and senseless report comes just a day before Sony BMG announced that they would join Warner Music Group , EMI , and Vivendi's Universal Music Group in selling DRM - free music downloads in the United States .
Help us take action now by reading and signing our open letter .
Our signed letter will be sent to the commissions office , and will add weight to the dozens of phone calls that will be made next week to her office demanding that she retract her statement and letting her know that we oppose any attempt by the EU to sanction , promote , or endorse DRM technology platforms .
MARTINSBURG , West Virginia ( CNN ) --
Hardly a day that goes by that you wo n't find Tracey Wygal working out at the gym .
Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a " clean diet , " keeping a food journal and exercising .
The 30 - year - old middle - school teacher does cardio exercise , strength trains and follows what she calls a " clean diet . "
That 's quite a change for a woman who tipped the scales eight years ago at 295 pounds .
Wygal first started gaining weight in her early teens .
A fast - food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds , and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds .
" It was my first year out of college , and that number , along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese , was very frightening , " remembers Wygal .
" I went to several doctors , trying to get them to prescribe a weight - loss pill . "
But none of her doctors would give her the quick fix she was looking for .
Instead , a physician handed her a 1,600 - calorie - a- day diet and told her to start moving .
At first , Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive .
Even though her weight was rapidly approaching 300 pounds , she believed she had a pretty good diet and an active lifestyle .
As her weight crept up , Wygal grew more frustrated , and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life .
She started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought .
Watch more from Tracey Wygal on her weight loss success . »
Fact Box Tracey Wygal 's success strategy
1. Keep a food diary .
Write down everything you eat and drink .
Calculate total calories at the end of the day .
Be consistent in your diet .
2 . Be consistent in your exercise .
Create a set gym / workout schedule .
Vary only when absolutely necessary .
3 . Find a gym that accommodates your lifestyle ( hours of operation , day care options , equipment , classes offered , etc. ) .
4 . Change your outlook on food .
Instead of equating food with happiness or enjoyment , view it as purely as nourishment or fuel for your body to function .
5 . Be realistic in your goals and program .
Know that it will take time to make considerable change , and do n't give up !
6 . Stop making excuses and make it happen !
Make YOUR health a PRIORITY in your life .
" I was amazed by how many calories I was eating , " Wygal said .
" The food diary showed me that I really needed to get my food intake under control and helped me maintain my diet realistically . "
She also started exercising .
At first , Wygal says , she was too embarrassed to go to a gym , so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment .
" It was all I could do at first .
I did n't give up , though , " she said .
" Gradually , my endurance improved .
After losing about 30 pounds , I decided to join a small gym . "
Several months later , Wygal was ready to take the next step .
She hired a trainer and began a short strength - training program .
That 's when something clicked .
Instead of feeling intimidated , Wygal started to love her workouts and the physical changes taking shape with her body .
Ready to take the next step , she joined a larger gym , began researching different workouts and got into weight training .
Over the next three years , she lost 120 pounds and dropped seven dress sizes .
Wygal , who 's 5 feet 10 inches tall , says the fear of gaining weight motivates her to stick to her diet and exercise regimen because she never wants to look like she did at 295 pounds .
Now comfortable with her weight , which she says fluctuates between 170 and 180 pounds , Wygal works out at least five to six days a week .
She says the key to losing weight and keeping it off is being honest about what you eat , writing it down and staying consistent .
She wants people to know they can do it , but there are no quick fixes or easy outs -- just hard work .
" It wo n't happen overnight , " Wygal advises .
" Know that it will take time but it is worth it in the end . "

CNN Medical News producer Matt Sloane contributed to this report .
When judging risks , we often go wrong by using what ’s called the availability heuristic : we gauge a danger according to how many examples of it are readily available in our minds .
Thus we overestimate the odds of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash because we ’ve seen such dramatic deaths so often on television ; we underestimate the risks of dying from a stroke because we do n’t have so many vivid images readily available .
Slow warming does n’t make for memorable images on television or in people ’s minds , so activists , journalists and scientists have looked to hurricanes , wild fires and starving polar bears instead .
They have used these images to start an “ availability cascade , ” a term coined by Timur Kuran , professor of economics and political science at Duke University , and Cass R. Sunstein , a law professor at the University of Chicago .
The availability cascade is a self - perpetuating process : the more attention a danger gets , the more worried people become , leading to more news coverage and more fear .
Once the images of Sept. 11 made terrorism seem a major threat , the press and the police lavished attention on potential new attacks and supposed plots .
After Three Mile Island and “ The China Syndrome , ” minor malfunctions at nuclear power plants suddenly became newsworthy .
“ Many people concerned about climate change , ” Dr. Sunstein says , “ want to create an availability cascade by fixing an incident in people ’s minds .
Hurricane Katrina is just an early example ; there will be others .
I do n’t doubt that climate change is real and that it presents a serious threat , but there ’s a danger that any ‘ consensus ’ on particular events or specific findings is , in part , a cascade . ”

Once a cascade is under way , it becomes tough to sort out risks because experts become reluctant to dispute the popular wisdom , and are ignored if they do .
Now that the melting Arctic has become the symbol of global warming , there ’s not much interest in hearing other explanations of why the ice is melting  or why the globe ’s other pole is n’t melting , too .
Global warming has an impact on both polar regions , but they ’re also strongly influenced by regional weather patterns and ocean currents .
Two studies by NASA and university scientists last year concluded that much of the recent melting of Arctic sea ice was related to a cyclical change in ocean currents and winds , but those studies got relatively little attention  and were certainly no match for the images of struggling polar bears so popular with availability entrepreneurs .
By Sari Gelzer , TruthOut.org
Daniel Ellsberg , perhaps the country ’s most famous whistleblower , fears that before the Bush administration leaves office they will try to attack Iran .
Indeed , Ellsberg ’s argument gained merit as George W. Bush increased his rhetoric against Iran when he delivered his final State of the Union Address .
Bush accused Iran of training militia extremists in Iraq , and emphasized the US will confront its enemies .
In a wide - ranging interview with Truthout , Ellsberg uses insight from his experience as a Pentagon analyst under the Lyndon B. Johnson , and later , the Nixon administration , to discuss Bush ’s plans to begin a war with Iran , the role of the press to give whistleblowers exposure , and how American democracy can be restored .
Due to Ellsberg ’s experience working within the government , I wanted his insight into how the Bush administration is attempting to begin a war with Iran .
When I highlight his experience working for Secretary of Defense Robert Macnamara in 1965 to draft a speech with the goal of rationalizing and gaining public support for the Vietnam War , Ellsberg gives a very long sigh .
“ That was not my finest hour that I look back on .
That was something that I am ashamed of , ” he tells me , with a heavy heart .
Ellsberg wishes he spoke out against the Vietnam War sooner .
As a civilian working for the government , he says his oath was always to the Constitution and he violated that oath until the day he decided to leak the Pentagon Papers in 1971 , to reveal the war was unlawful .

Hackonomics
>
" The purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready - made answers to economic questions , but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists . "
- Joan Robinson , Cambridge University
>
One of the things that really perturbs me are disingenuous , intellectually indefensible commentary consisting of willfully misleading tripe .
Up until recently , that territory has been owned by the WSJ OPED pages .
This past weekend , the NYT was seen elbowing its way into the same space .
I call this approach to economic analysis Hackonomics .
An OpEd in the Sunday Times is classic Hackonomics .
Unfortunately , it takes little craft to slip junk past the editors at the Times OpEd section .
Impressive - looking academic or government credentials seems to be all that is required .
( Its a shame they do n't have , say , a professor from the Princeton Economics department on staff ) .
Perhaps there is a fear of looking silly or economically ignorant , rather than asking anyone else about any of these " analyses . "
What we get instead are pieces like You Are What You Spend .
The authors are Michael Cox , and Richard Alm , chief economist and senior economics writer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .
As my British colleagues would delightfully articulate , " their work is shite . "
To wit :
These two gentlemen press forward the idea that the proper manner to review economic inequality should involve looking not at income differentials .
Rather , this Fed duo favors a more direct measure of economic status : household consumption .
They claim " the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume , and that the abstract , income - based way in which we measure the so - called poverty rate no longer applies to our society . "
Their analysis is so problematic and their theory so full of holes , that , if time permitted , we could identify errors in nearly every paragraph .
That sort of critique is best reserved for serious intellectual analysis of major importance .
For Hackonomics , we will simply identify 3 major flaws , and then get on to more pressing and important work .
Let 's take a closer look at their arguments :
1. Income Disparity : Abstract ?
There is nothing " abstract " about income - based measures of poverty or wealth inequality .
Merely calling income comparisons " abstract " does not make it so , nor does it make their position any less absurd .
Instead , it reads as a transparent attempt by the authors to avoid any income discussion .
Why not discuss income ?
Perhaps the data is the reason :
The share of national income of the wealthiest 1 % rose from 14.6 % five years ago ( 2003 ) to 17.4 % in 2005 ( Emmanuel Saez , University of California - Berkeley ) .
And since 2005 , the wealth disparity has grown even further .
Indeed , as several commentators have already pointed out , these same authors previously tried to make an income based argument that " the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume " -- and crashed and burned .
Next attempt , please .
2. Median / Average .
The next intellectually corrupt trick is a classic statistical error .
The authors look at average -- rather than median -- spending and income by quintile , and determine there is n't much inequality in the United States .
How did Sunday 's silliness manage such a feat ?
They start with a variation of the median / average trick ( Bill Gates walks into a bar . . . ) .
Only this time , the perps are slightly clever .
Rather than merely play with " average , " they oh so craftily break the spending pools into quintiles .
This creates the appearance ( see chart below ) of relative equality on a per capita basis of spending equality .
Any statistician in the country will tell you this an embarrassing error of the highest magnitude .
The top quintile have an " average " income of ~ $ 150 k and an average spending of ~ $ 70 k .
But " average " broadly misrepresents the top quintile .
This twist ignores the vastly disproportionate income and spending habits of the top 1 % , and the even more disproportionate top 0.1 % .
Wall Street Journal columnist Robert Frank 's book , Richistan looks at the recent unprecedented rise of wealth in the U.S.
The top 2 1/2 % -- over 7 million households -- have a net worth of $ 1 – $ 10 million .
The top 1/2 % -- over 1.4 million households -- have a $ 10 – $ 100 million net worth .
There are now thousands of households -- top 0.1 % -- with a $ 100 million to $ 1 billion in assets .
Oh , and there are now more than 400 billionaires -- the top 0.01 % .
This is not a bad thing per se .
I am all in favor of economic freedom and wealth creation .
But to pretend that there is little wealth disparity is simply nonsense .
~~~
3. Comparing Household Consumption :
Looking at Household consumption can yield some interesting insights -- but it matters at what you look at .
Our intrepid authors have avoided discussing the expenditures on necessities , and instead went a different way :
" To understand why consumption is a better guideline of economic prosperity than income , it helps to consider how our lives have changed .
Nearly all American families now have refrigerators , stoves , color TVs , telephones and radios .
Air - conditioners , cars , VCRs or DVD players , microwave ovens , washing machines , clothes dryers and cellphones have reached more than 80 percent of households .
As the second chart , on the spread of consumption , shows , this was n’t always so .
The conveniences we take for granted today usually began as niche products only a few wealthy families could afford .
In time , ownership spread through the levels of income distribution as rising wages and falling prices made them affordable in the currency that matters most — the amount of time one had to put in at work to gain the necessary purchasing power .
At the average wage , a VCR fell from 365 hours in 1972 to a mere two hours today .
A cellphone dropped from 456 hours in 1984 to four hours .
A personal computer , jazzed up with thousands of times the computing power of the 1984 I.B.M. , declined from 435 hours to 25 hours .
Even cars are taking a smaller toll on our bank accounts : in the past decade , the work - time price of a mid-size Ford sedan declined by 6 percent . "
This is , of course , sanctimoniuos bullshit classic economic misdirection .
What the authors are revealing here are not rising incomes or societal similarities of wealth .
Rather , their data and cost discussion are about Technology adoption lifecycle ( Joe M. Bohlen and George M. Beal , 1957 ) , later refined in Everett M. Rogers ' Diffusion of Innovations .
New technologies and products come down in price over time , regardless of the state of economic equality in the broader society .
This is the oldest dodge in economics .
That two Fed economists either fail to understand technology adoption cycles -- or worse , have chosen to willfully ignore it -- simply boggles the mind .
If this is the best that Federal reserve researchers can produce , it does go a long way in explaining why our financial system is near crisis .
A quick review of this concept is in order , on the ( hopefully ) slim chance the rest of the Fed Reserve research group is as abysmally educated in the ways of technology and economics .
All of the above named products -- Washing machines , phones , autos , TVs , VCRs , Cellphones , PCs -- went through a well established adoption model .
In the classic definition ( see chart below ) , the first group of people to use any new technology are called " innovators , " followed by " early adopters , " then the " early majority " and " late majority , " and lastly , the " laggards . "
>
Technology Adoption Lifecycle
>
The impact of this adoption process and the manufacturing economies of scale are significant determinant of technology product prices .
Here is a grossly over - simplified discussion of how this works :
When the innovators buy a product , they essentially are paying for all of the R&D costs , and other development expenses .
You paid 365 labor units for a VCR in 1972 because they were a limited production , custom product that was practically hand made .
When a PC cost 465 labor units , chip fabs were nowhere near as plentiful as today -- and the biggest cost in early PCs were the exorbitant chipsets contained in them .
The early adopters pay less than the innovators , as factories get built to mass produce chips or tape transport mechanisms or cell phone keypads .
What was a nearly custom made product becomes a merely limited - production , high - end one .
Where the innovators paid for the R&D , the early adopters paid for the fabs and factories to be built .
The early majority does n't get the use of the product for the first few years , but they get a big price benefit of manufacturing economies of scale .
Mass production of components bring prices down ; successful products attract competition to the space , and soon more manufacturers are cranking out more units .
Through competition , prices begin dropping faster and faster .
The late majority gets even cheaper prices .
Consider the laggards and the VCR today -- they cost about $ 29 each .
None of this has any relevancy to problems of wealth distribution and inequality in America .
To understand the serious issue of relative inequality , you would not look at technological toys ( unless you were idiots ) .
Rather , you would consider the consumption of necessities -- Shelter , food , medical care , clothing , education , transportation .
Not only that , but you would not simply review the quantity , but also the quality of the products that get consumed .
Compare the top and bottom quintiles :
Who is consuming fatty , high carb foods , and who is eating lots of protein , fresh fruits and vegetables ?
What about medical care ?
Do they have reliable access to any sort of family physician , regular check ups , doctor visits , ongoing treatments , preventative care -- or is their medical consumption on an emergency room basis ?
What is the quality of their housing like -- safe neighborhoods , with access to good schools ?
Or something less desirable ?
If we are going to use consumption as a measure of economic equality , then look at the quality of essentials ; measuring toys ain't the way to go . . .

4 . How do the Affluent Elite Spend ?
Since the authors want to look at spending , let 's do just that .
Only instead of their intellectual indefensible " average " let 's see how that top 0.5 % spent their cash .
A study by a Prince & Associates last summer ( 2007 ) detailed the spending habits of the upper economic strata .
They found this group spent their money as follows :

Bottom line :
This is one of those absurd situations , where after you look at all the facts , and analyze the deceptive way the authors construct their arguments , you simply have to call Bullshit .

RailsConf2008 で、Jonathern Dahl さんが Rails での非同期処理について話すみたいで す
RailsConf 2008 : Asynchronous Processing with Ruby on Rails http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/1813
適当に訳すと ...
Rails は HTTP リクエストな同期処理はいい感じにこなしてくれるけど、ちょっと複雑な処理や時間のかかる処理をしたいと思うと非同期処理が必要になる。だから非同期処理をはじめてみよう。ちょっと調べてみると、Rails で非同期するにはこんな方法がある。cron , BackgroundDRb , AP4R , daemons , そして AmazonSQS。実際の事例とコードを通じで、それぞれの良いとこ/悪いとこを順にみてみるよ。
ほとんど同じ内容ですが、こっちにもう少し詳しく書かれています。Jonathern
と仲間うちのエンジニアで投稿しているサイトっぽいです。書籍の紹介とほかの非同期ライブラリ、starling , workling , beanstalk , spawn , background_fu あたりへの言及が増えてますね 。
AP4R についてはどんな話をしてくれるんだろ... ( ^^ ;
Rail Spikes : See you at RailsConf '08 http://railspikes.com/2008/2/25/speaking-railsconf-2008
It looks like I will be speaking at RailsConf again .
This time , I ’ll be discussing asynchronous processing .
If you 've worked on a Rails app that strays beyond basic CRUD , you 've probably had to think about running some actions in the background – that is , outside of the HTTP request / response cycle .
I 've had to worry about this on quite a few projects , and contributed a recipe to the forthcoming Advanced Rails Recipes book .
The recipe discussed how to package a Ruby script as a daemon , which is a simple and powerful approach to background processing .
But there are quite a few others , including ( but not limited to ) : AP4R , cron , starling , workling , beanstalk , backgroundrb , spawn , background_fu , and Amazon SQS .
And I 've left out quite a few .
So as I prepare for the conference , I 'd love your feedback .
What options have you tried ?
What has worked well or worked poorly ?
What would you like to see at the conference ?
紹介されている書籍はこちら 。Jonathern は " Asynchronous recipes " として 、" Processing an Asynchronous Workflow " と " Off - Loading Long- Running Tasks to BackgrounDRb " というレシピを書いているみたいです。
もうひとつ、ついでに紹介。こちらは、reliable-msg の作者 、Assaf Arkin さんの書籍となりますが、この中でも AP4R が登場しているそうです。たぶん、 第7章の " Asynchronous messaging " のとこ 。
どちらも発売は初夏なので手にできるのはまだ先ですが、楽しみです。

Back on 2001 , right after Inauguration Day , $ 10,000 of your Social Security funds were placed in a special private personal magic pony account where it would enjoy the explosive benefits of the our surging prosperity , and the Longest Peacetime Terra - fightin ' Expansion in HISTORY ...
History ... history .
All of this made possible by cutting taxes on the productive people at the top of the food chain and removing those regulations that prevented our financial institutions from using all their imagination in creating new ways to loan give ... to give you money !
We at the Treasury know there was some discussion about not going along with the president 's plan , but I think you 'll agree that what we 've learned over the last seven years is that the president can do anything he wants and no one will do more than talk about stopping him .
So we just did it !
Say , why not send us a subpoena ?
That 'd be a hoot !
Now , as we close in on the last year of this glorious wondertime , here 's a quick report on how your outsourced , privately - managed fund has done .
2002 – Okay , your original $ 10,000 is now worth $ 9 , 182 .
But hey , 9/11 , ya know ?
We all have to make some sacrifices .
Besides , inflation was so low that you still have $ 9079 as much buying power as you did the year before .
Hustle on off now and shop .
2003 -- Your balance is now $ 7863 .
See 9/11 .
Add in the absolute need to go after Saddam , who we all know was behind it all and is planning to attack the United States with his perfectly maintained massive military , loads of chemical weapons , and nuclear bombs .
( Oh yeah , that 's $ 7578 in pre-9/11 dollars , and you 're a traitor for even asking . )
2004 -- You 're a winner !
All those gloomy Gusi have been proven wrong .
Your piddly $ 10,000 original is now $ 10,042 .
That 's $ 9,495 in 2001 dollars , but do n't thank us now .
Just you wait till next year !
2005 -- Eh , call it a push .
So you 're down to $ 9,824 .
Look at how much you 've gained since 2003 !
There 's always a silver lining .
After all , $ 9021 original dollars is a lot better than where you were .
2006 – Now you have $ 10,104 , so you 're back on top again .
And besides , this economy is coiled like a spring !
Here it comes ... $ 8922 original dollars after inflation on their way to a million .
2007 – Boom !
$ 11,795 is yours .
Everyone who ever said the market would n't take care of this thing is proven wrong .
Do n't say those fund managers were n't worth the $ 90 million a year we 've been paying them , just because they only match the Dow mix .
Best of all , when you account for inflation , that 's still a $ 201 gain in only six years .
$ 34 a year .
We 're completely sure you do n’t mind us putting $ 10 K at risk for those kinds of gains .
Just be glad you did n't need to retire in 2002 .
Or 2003 .
Or 2004 .
Or 2005 .
Or 2006 .
And be glad you did n't invest at the peak of the market back in the late 90s .
$ 10,000 put in back then would be down by a cool thou when you adjust for inflation .
While you 're at it , give thanks you chose the right fund .
Because if our investors had matched the most widely used index – S&P – rather than the Dow , you would n't have that huge gain .
See , with the Dow stocks get swapped in and out , and it only matches a little part of the market .
The S&P covers a much bigger part of the market , and if you 'd invested there , you 'd have $ 10,554 now .
Or $ 9127 in 2001 dollars .
Thank goodness you did n't invest in real estate funds that went pop , or in banks that invested too much in bad debts , or in one of the 75 % of mutual funds that underperformed the Dow .
Be really grateful that our fund managers charged you absolutely nothing for this service , because if you 'd had to pay the kind of overhead most mutual funds carry , it would have more than carried away your gains , and then some .
Fortunately , we knew that there were hundreds of big Wall Street firms out there , willing to help out the American citizen for free .
Wall Street is known for being generous like that .
Now that we 've made you all this money , how are you going to spend it ?
We suggest a nice vacation to Europe .
You might want to order a few extra traveler 's checks .
If you 're hoping to drop in on Cool Britania , because it'll take about $ 1,378 to exchange for the same number of pounds that $ 1,000 would have bought in 2001 .
The dollar is worth a whole 67 % of what it used to be across the channel in France Freedomland .
We know that you were considering a vacation home up in Nova Scotia , maybe looking for something around the $ 150,000 range .
And really , that was a great idea in 2001 .
But if you want to spend the equivalent up there now , you 'll need to pony up $ 234,000 – and that 's before you start figuring in the rising cost of homes .
So maybe you'd be better off thinking about keeping that money in your own country , right ?
With all that , I 'm sure you agree that we made the right moves economically .
Why , when you consider the explosive rise in home prices , and all the joy our reduced taxes have brought , there are almost half a million new millionaires in this country .
And for that , we only have an increase of about 7 million people living in poverty .
Sure , median family income was down about $ 2,000 from 2001 to 2004 , but that was the bad times .
We do n't have the numbers yet , but we 're sure it 's soared since then , because as we all know , when the people at the top making their money off the stock market are doing well , that rising tinkle - down stream of Reaganomic voodoo raises all the little boats on a warm yellow tide .
Sure , the median family is carrying more of the tax burden than they were back then .
Sure , health care costs have destroyed most of the value of your savings .
Sure , the average family is working more hours , carrying more debt , and seeing less return .
But we think you 'll agree , it was all worth it .
After all ... more millionaires !
Now , about the rest of that Social Security account .
Wait till you hear what we 've done with that !

The number of millionaires in the United States is a surprisingly difficult question to answer .
CNN
Money gives the number as 9.3 million households .
Merrill Lynch gives the number at 1.9 million households .
That 's a huge difference .
The number of people in poverty is also an open question .
The Census Bureau has their numbers , numbers that others think are drastically undercounted . )
We live in the information age .
And boy do we get blasted with information .
It ’s dumped on us by the truckload .
Three pounds of stuff in the mailbox a day .
507 TV channels to flip through to find the weather report .
623 e-mail messages selling male enhancement pills .
And that ’s only a fraction of the information that bombards us .
There are billboards along the highway , news broadcasts on the radio , memos and telephone calls at the office , instruction manuals for office equipment that wo n’t work , family schedules to remember , bills , books , seminars , random conversations at lunch time , business meetings , it never ends .
I even feel it when I walk into the supermarket cereal aisle and have to choose from about 200 boxes screaming with bright colors and promises of low fat and high fiber , when all I want is lots of sugar and a cool little plastic prize wrapped in cellophane .
It makes my head hurt .
There ’s just too much information to process these days .
And when people feel overwhelmed , they react in ways that are n’t good for your blog .
Whatever your blog is about or whatever you ’re selling , your blog boils down to information , usually in the form of words people have to read .
But people will avoid reading when they feel overloaded , or they ’ll filter out difficult information and look for information that is easier to understand , or they ’ll simply misunderstand what you ’re talking about and wont ’ respond in the way you want .
Or , worst of all , they may just ignore you altogether .
You ca n’t alter the flow of information out there , but you can do some simple things in your writing to make the information you present clear , simple , and easy to understand .
Make clarity your # 1 objective .
You ca n’t communicate or persuade someone if that person does n’t understand your point .
Do n’t write to show off or call attention to how smart or clever you are .
Simplify your message .
Make it easy to understand .
Get to the point and say exactly what you mean to say .
Good writing is like a clean pane of glass in a storefront — you do n’t notice the glass , but you can clearly see what you want on the other side .
Take a look at my headline and first paragraph on this article .
No fluff .
I get right to the point and you know what this article is about instantly .
Decide what you want to say before you say it .
Do n’t just hope something sensible will reveal itself as you write your copy .
Plan and outline .
Think about the point you want to make .
Determine the tone or emotional feel .
Know where you ’re headed before you start .
This helps you stay on point and avoid distracting ideas .
It also helps you organize your copy so that it reads in a clear and logical way from beginning to end .
Organize your information visually .
Do n’t be one of those bloggers who thinks subheads , bold face , and bullets are just for search engine optimization .
They ’re really for visual organization .
Take this article , for example .
I ’m using bullets because I have a list of separate tips about my main topic .
If I had three big points to make , I might have used three subheads instead .
Or if I were explaining a process , I would have probably used a numbered list .
You can also use italics , blockquotes , and bold text for emphasis and organization .
Link information with familiar ideas .
If there ’s any chance for misunderstanding , use a simple analogy that relates to something your reader is already familiar and comfortable with .
For example , if you ’re try to explain how anti-virus software works , say it ’s like a doctor that checks your computer for infections , and when it finds one , it quarantines the bug and makes your computer feel better .
That ’s accurate and easy to understand .
Inject emotional content .
Ideas are easier to understand and remember when they are linked with emotional content or intense feelings .
If you ’re a blogger raising awareness to change the American tax system , do n’t just explain economic theory and reel off dry statistics .
Talk about how the IRS takes money from our wallets , how the government makes us work two hours every day to support a bloated government , or how frustrating it is to fill out all those confusing forms every April .
People process emotional ideas more easily than intellectual ones .
Make people feel so they do n’t have to think so hard .
Avoid making counterproductive associations .
Clever analogies , puns , and wordplay might make you look bright , but they will often sabotage clear communication .
This goes for gratuitous graphics , effects , and images that are used because they are trendy or cool looking .
I once saw an item with a photo of a clown handing papers to a guy sitting at a desk .
The headline makes a pun about the boss being a clown .
You have no idea the copy is really about office equipment until you read all the way through .
It makes sense if you spend the time to figure it out , but most people wo n’t .
Be clear , not clever .
Focus on one big idea .
Do n’t dump too many messages on your reader at once .
Start with a simple idea .
Then build and reinforce that one idea , adding information paragraph by paragraph , always linking back to that one big idea .
In this article , my big idea is information overload .
Each point I make refers to that one point .
Even if one point is n’t as clear as I ’d like it to be , the reader will never be lost or feel overwhelmed because I ’m really only talking about one simple idea .
Present your main idea at the beginning and end of your copy .
People tend to remember what comes first and what comes last .
Things in the middle are usually forgotten .
If you have a list of product benefits , for example , put the best up front , but have a few good ones for the end , too .
In a blog post of any length , state your point early in the post and restate it at the end .
Follow the rule for good public speaking :
Tell ‘em what you ’re going to say .
Say it .
Tell ‘em what you just said .
The supermarket ca n’t do much to overcome my feeling of information overload at the supermarket .
And I ’m pretty sure we ’re all on our own with channel surfing and deleting e-mail spam .
But if you apply these ideas to your blog copy , you can reduce the feeling of information overload for your readers .
If your blog becomes an oasis of clarity and simplicity in this sea of confusing information we live in , people will want to spend more time on your site reading and responding to what you have to say or sell .
Higher - Order Perl

Current Status :
The book was published on 8 March 2005 .
Copies are now available in bookstores in the U.S. and Europe , and from online booksellers .
A second printing became available in August 2005 .
A Chinese - language edition of HOP , translated by Mr. Teng Jiahai , was published in June 2013 by China Machine Press and is available from Chinese - language online booksellers .
Idea of the Book
Higher - Order Perl is about functional programming techniques in Perl .
It 's about how to write functions that can modify and manufacture other functions .
Why would you want to do that ?
Because that way your code is more flexible and more reusable .
Instead of writing ten similar functions , you write a general pattern or framework that can generate the functions you want ; then you generate just the functions you need according to the pattern .
The program does n't need to know in advance which functions are necessary ; it can generate them as needed .
Instead of writing the complete program yourself , you get the computer to write it for you .
Table of Contents
HOP is full of useful and interesting examples that Perl programmers will want to see .
Chapter 1 is about writing recursive functions to walk the file system and to process recursively - structured data such as HTML documents .
Chapter 2 discusses dispatch tables in the context of reading configuration files .
Chapter 4 concludes with an improved replacement for the WWW :: SimpleRobot module , with better functionality in one - third the code , and also contains a basic database query system that searches an HTTP log file backwards , delivering the most recent records first .
Chapter 6 discusses the frequently asked question of how to generate a list of all the strings that will match a given regex and provides an astonishingly simple solution .
Later on , in Chapter 8 , I show how to build a parser for regexes and attach it to the string generator .
Chapter 9 presents linogram , a complete constraint - based diagram - drawing system .
It is here .

Charles O’Callaghan , a polygraph examiner and Nebraska State Patrol investigator , has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska by Matthew Livers , from whom investigators coerced a false confession after an allegedly failed polygraph examination conducted by O’Callaghan , who is also a member of the Nebraska Association of Polygraph Examiners .
John Ferak of the Omaha World - Herald reports about Livers ’ lawsuit in an article titled , “ Man Exonerated in Cass County Killings Files Suit . ”
Excerpt :
A former Nebraska man filed suit Tuesday against Cass County and investigators after he spent more than seven months in jail before being exonerated in the April 2006 slayings of his uncle and aunt in their Murdock farmhouse .
Two Chicago lawyers , Steven Drizin and Locke Bowman , filed the civil lawsuit on behalf of Matthew Livers in U.S. District Court in Omaha .
The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and asks for a federal jury trial .
Shortly after Wayne and Sharmon Stock were found slain in the upstairs bedroom of their rural Cass County home , Livers and his cousin Nick Sampson were arrested .
In 11 hours of questioning by the detectives , Livers denied more than 100 times that he had any involvement in the deaths .
Finally , he confessed to the killings and offered that Sampson was with him .
Later , the murder cases against both men collapsed when DNA and physical evidence excluded the cousins and instead linked the deaths to Greg Fester and Jessica Reid , a teenage couple who had been on the run from Wisconsin .
Even after the Wisconsin teenagers were charged , Cass County officials continued to hold Livers and Sampson .
For several more months , investigators tried to build a case that Livers and Sampson had enlisted the Wisconsin couple to carry out the killings .
Cass County Attorney Nathan Cox eventually dropped all charges against Sampson and Livers .
Fester and Reid both entered guilty pleas and received life sentences last March .
After that sentencing hearing , Cox said overwhelming evidence indicated that the slayings occurred during a random , multistate crime spree by Fester and Reid .
Cox also said that no credible evidence linked the Wisconsin killers to the Nebraska cousins .
The 25 - page statement of complaint may be downloaded as a 76 - kb PDF file here .
Regarding the polygraph examination conducted by O’Callaghan and the post - test interrogation that followed the complaint states :
d . After more than five hours of interrogation , the defendants subjected Plaintiff to a polygraph examination .
The defendants did not administer the polygraph in order to ascertain the truthfulness of Plaintiff ’s denials of involvement , but rather as a further means to frighten and intimidate Plaintiff and to overbear his will .
The defendants falsely informed Plaintiff that the polygraph was “ foolproof ” and that the results of the polygraph were definitive and could not be disputed .
Thereafter , the defendants falsely informed Plaintiff that he had conclusively failed the polygraph examination and that he must therefore be guilty of the Stock murders .
During the criminal proceedings against Plaintiff , the defendants never provided Plaintiff or his counsel with a clean , complete copy of the polygraph charts and defendant O’Callaghan ’s report does not explain how those charts were read .
On information and belief , the polygraph charts do not support any inference that Plaintiff was deceptive in denying participation in the Stock murders .
e. Following the polygraph examination , the defendants became highly aggressive and accusatory in their interrogation of Plaintiff .
The defendants repeatedly and hostilely cut off Plaintiff ’s attempts to maintain his denials of involvement in the murders , telling him , for example , “ That is just another line of shit . ”
The defendants employed this tactic deliberately in order to convince Plaintiff that resistance was futile and that he had no choice but to confess to the crime .
f.
The defendants falsely informed Plaintiff that there was physical evidence that connected him to the murders .
g.
The defendants repeatedly threatened Plaintiff that he would receive the death penalty if he did not confess to the Stock murders .
For example , defendant Schenck threatened Plaintiff that Schenck was “ going to do my level best to hang your ass from the highest tree .
You are done .
I will go after the death penalty .
I ’ll push and I ’ll push and I ’ll push and I will do everything I have to , to make sure you go down hard for this . ”
Plaintiff was told , “ Your ass is on the line , ” and “ You are on the line , you are in the frying pan right now . ” h .
The defendants promised Plaintiff leniency if he confessed , telling him , “ You can not hide from this , okay ?
Right now we are waiting on , listen to me and listen well .
This is the chance for you to save yourself .
This is potentially a death sentence .
No lie , okay ?
If you are involved in this then you can save yourself now . ”
Based on the defendants ’ statements , Plaintiff actually came to believe that , because he had confessed , he would be permitted to go home .
The Livers case is yet another in a series of cases nationwide where innocent suspects have failed the polygraph and subsequently been coerced by investigators into providing a false confession .
Other documented examples include Byron Halsey , Jeffrey Deskovic , Abdallah Higazy , and Kevin Fox .
On May 29 , 1919 , two British expeditions , positioned on opposite sides of the planet , aimed telescopes at the sun during a total eclipse .
Their mission : to test a radical theory of gravity dreamed up by a former patent clerk , who predicted that passing starlight should bend toward the sun .
Their results , announced that November , vaulted Albert Einstein into the public consciousness and confirmed one of the most spectacular experimental successes in the history of science .
In recent decades , however , some science historians have argued that astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington , the junior member of the 1919 expedition , believed so strongly in Einstein 's theory of general relativity that he discounted data that clashed with it .
In 1919 general relativity was on the cusp of eclipsing Sir Isaac Newton 's law of universal gravitation , put forth in 1687 .
Newton 's law cast gravity as a type of bond between objects , all floating within the gridlike arena of space and time .
Einstein 's insight was that gravity is the grid , which is warped by massive objects such as the sun .
As a consequence , light passing the sun should literally fall toward it like a moon rover clipping the edge of a giant crater and falling in .
Eddington , then director of the University of Cambridge Observatory , convinced his senior colleague and England 's Astronomer Royal , Sir Frank Dyson , to mount the expedition .
The group split into two teams : Dyson 's crew from what was then the Royal Observatory in Greenwich headed to the town of Sobral , Brazil , as Eddington and cohorts set up on the western African island of Príncipe .
Their task was to independently record the positions of the stars near the moon - blotted sun and compare them with the positions of the same stars at night .
If general relativity was right , the apparent positions of the nearest stars would drift 1.75 arc seconds ( a measure of angularity ) closer to its rim during the eclipse ( a pencil width seen at half a mile ) .
Eddington was hampered by overcast skies on the long - awaited day and photographed only five stars .
It was too few for a solid result , but he gave some weight to his final value of 1.61 arc seconds .
Dyson 's team had mixed results .
One of the group 's two telescopes functioned correctly and gave them a value of 1.98 arc seconds .
The second instrument yielded a value of 0.93 arc second , which was rather close to the Newtonian prediction of 0.87 .
The instrument , however , had lost focus during the eclipse , which cast doubt on the accuracy of the photo comparison , so they excluded the measurement from their final result .
Based on the remaining evidence , they declared general relativity triumphant .
Over time , experts looked askance at the sweeping conclusion , which both ignored the possibility that some other theory of gravity might have better fit the results and also did n't match general relativity very precisely after known sources of error were taken into account .
" No experiment is decisive in the way that Eddington 's experiment was presented as being decisive , " says Harry Collins , a sociologist of science at Cardiff University in Wales .
Indeed , researchers did n't truly nail the light - bending prediction until they used quasar measurements made in the 1960s , says physicist Clifford Will of Washington University in St. Louis , an expert in tests of general relativity .
Science historians John Earman , then at the University of Minnesota , and Clark Glymour of the University of Pittsburgh , revisited the eclipse study in a 1980 paper , concluding that Eddington had erred by suppressing the clashing Sobral result .
But the historical revision never received much scrutiny , physicist–historian Daniel Kennefick of the University of Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences in Fayetteville argues .
" It 's actually like you can see two myths layered on top of each other , " he says .
To disentangle them , he dug into the historical record .
Letters between Eddington and Dyson indicate that the two analyzed their data separately to avoid influencing each other , Kennefick reports in a recent paper .
That means Dyson , who was at first ambivalent about Einstein 's theory , made the initial judgment to exclude the 0.93 –arc second result .
Kennefick documents that Eddington acted properly when Dyson , presumably overeager at the potential discovery , put aside his first instinct and proposed averaging the three measurements to get a value that was closer to Einstein 's prediction .
Eddington squelched the idea , because it would have meant giving added weight to the suspect measurement from Sobral .
Biased or not , Eddington made the right call , says Kennefick , who discovered that Royal Observatory staff in Greenwich had reanalyzed the Sobral data in 1978 using modern computer - based methods .
( The Príncipe data had n't survived . )
Their correction put the 0.93 –arc second shift at 1.55 arc seconds , plus or minus 0.34 — much closer to the 1.75 value .
In other words , the researchers were right to suspect that the measurement was flawed .
" If I was in the same position , I would have done the same thing , " says Washington University 's Will , who adds that he never believed Eddington had cooked the numbers .
" It just did n't seem credible to me that someone of his stature would throw out data because it did n't look right . "
Woman who lied about assault sent to jail REDWOOD CITY
A San Mateo woman who lied about being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by a group of men after her car supposedly broke down in Foster City was sentenced Tuesday to 90 days in jail for filing a false police report .
Karyn Galila , 24 , sobbed in a Redwood City courtroom as Commissioner Kathleen McKenna ordered her taken into custody immediately .
Galila was handcuffed as her husband looked on .
He tried to hug her before she was led away but was ordered by a bailiff not to touch her .
Galila apparently made up the assault story to explain to her husband why she had come home late after rendezvousing at a restaurant with a man she had recently met online , according to her probation report .
" This was such a detailed , fabricated story , " said McKenna , the San Mateo County Superior Court magistrate who handled sentencing .
" This kind of conduct does warrant a jail sentence . "
Galila was arrested after initially telling police she had been sexually assaulted the night of June 12 after her Jeep broke down on Foster City Boulevard .
She admitted she had lied when she said a group of as many as five men had pushed the SUV onto a nearby street , then assaulted her at gunpoint .
A fingerprint from Galila 's SUV led investigators to a 25 - year - old San Mateo man , who was able to produce a receipt from the restaurant and a witness who placed both him and Galila there when the assault was supposedly taking place , authorities said .
Galila pleaded no contest Dec. 31 to one misdemeanor count of filing a false police report .
" She at this point is still struggling to figure out why she conducted herself the way she did , " Galila 's attorney , Earl Jiang , said at sentencing .
" She is genuinely sorry for her conduct . "
Jiang pleaded for leniency , saying Galila has a young child to care for .
But prosecutor Rebecca Baum argued for jail time , saying Galila 's actions could have led to the man being wrongly incarcerated .
Galila , a dental assistant , now faces jail time and a court order to pay police about $ 5,000 to cover the cost of their investigation .
Prosecutions for filing a false police report are relatively rare in San Mateo County and often do n't result in much jail time , Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said .
Defendants often serve their time in the sheriff 's work program , but McKenna ordered Galila jailed immediately .
" I think it was because the conduct was outrageous , " Wagstaffe said .
" We have a criminal justice system that is based from A to Z on being able to rely on the truth of our victims . "
Here is the thing – I do not own a house .
I do not have a mortgage .
Why ?
I cannot afford one here where I live .
My rent is $ 1,949 a month , and a house equivalent in size to my apartment would be about $ 1 million dollars .
This would mean I would have to carry a mortgage of about $ 5,400 a month , give or take a few bucks .
Who in their right mind would give me a loan that big on our salaries ?
The bank , that ’s who .
However , I am not going to blame the banks for this crisis like so many people are doing .
I am going to blame the people who took out the mortgages in the first place that they could not afford .
That ’s not fair , you say ?
I say it is , and here is why – every single person is responsible for their own actions .
If a person decides to use drugs , it ’s their fault if they get hooked .
If a person decides to drag race in their car , it ’s their fault if they get in an accident .
If a person decides to spend themselves into credit card debt , it ’s their fault .
So why should this be any different ?
Buying a home is the single biggest purchase anyone will ever make in life , and it should not be taken lightly .
Did you really think a $ 500,000 mortgage was a good idea on your $ 11 an hour job ?
Just because the friendly banker guy said it was does not make it so …the borrower is solely responsible for signing the paperwork and no one can make them do it .
It is up to the individual to get a second opinion if they think someone is trying to pull something over on them .
Death Pledge .
Did you know the the word Mortgage is actually a combination of two French words : the word Mort which means “ death ” , and the word Gage which means “ pledge ” ?
Me neither , till just the other day .
I know I will probably get a lot of flack for my opinion on this , but that ’s how I see it .
I would not buy a car without doing my homework , I would not invest in a company without doing my homework , and I surely would not buy a house without knowing what I was getting myself into .
And no banker could ever convince me that I could afford a million dollar home , even if he promised to keep the payments at $ 1500 a month for the first 5 years of interest only payments .
I know that come 5 years , I will probably not be making enough to pay the $ 5,400 a month for the mortgage – so I would not take the offer .
Banks can be evil , I understand that …and that is why borrowers need to know what they are doing .
But as evil as they are , they cannot force a mortgage on anyone .
And just to show you that I am not heartless , I feel for people who lose their homes due to unemployment for a long time ( like someone I know who is out of work due to the writer ’s strike here in L.A. ) , or someone who has some kind of medical issue that hampers their ability to pay for their house , or any of the other legitimate reasons why people get foreclosed on .
But losing a house due to taking out too much of a mortgage is a different story .
The American Dream has turned into just that – A Dream .
People think they deserve more than they can afford , and now the government is swooping in to save them from their self - created problem .
I did the responsible thing and did not buy a house – I do n’t think the government is going to give me a cookie .
Sure , the economy might collapse if they do n’t save some of these homes , but maybe that is what we need to make people plan a little bit better the next time around .
But the economic problems this country is facing is not just due to the mortgage crisis – we overspend , we misuse funds , we think we deserve whatever we want at whatever price it may come at .
This goes for the government all the way down to your next door neighbor .
We need some fiscal responsibility here , not more handouts .
Recession here we come , and I do n’t think it is necessarily a bad thing .
Here is the complete list of participants in the series “ Home Finance : Mortgages and the Real Cost of Home Ownership ”  :

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - Voters are not turning their backs on Hillary Clinton because of doubts about a woman in the White House but rather turning on to the optimistic message of her rival Barack Obama , according to some experts on gender and leadership .
The 46 - year - old senator with his wife and two young children makes Clinton , a 60 - year - old political veteran , seem outdated to some voters , they said .
Clinton lost caucuses in Iowa last week to Obama and has seen her poll lead overturned going into Tuesday ’s Democratic primary in New Hampshire , part of a state - by - state process by which parties choose a candidate for president .
Victory in November ’s election to succeed U.S. President George W. Bush would make Clinton the first U.S. female president after 43 male heads of state .
But that possibility could be fading if primary voters opt for the promise of hope and change projected by Obama over Clinton ’s experience and readiness to lead .
Those issues rather than gender will determine whether the U.S. senator from New York and wife of former President Bill Clinton stands or falls , according to Naomi Wolf , author of the 1991 bestseller “ The Beauty Myth ” and other books .
“ None of the polling or the focus groups indicate that people are ... ( snubbing ) her because she is a woman but because of a deficit in how she is projecting leadership , ” Wolf said .
“ If anything , she is too entrenched , too competent a leader .
She ... has been on the world stage and people ( voters ) are sick of people who are ... on the world stage , ” she said .
Obama captured overwhelming support among young voters in Iowa .
Clinton , on the other hand , was flanked by politicians from years past on the night of the Iowa result , including her husband and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .

Clinton , a successful lawyer in Arkansas before Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992 , and Obama play down their symbolism as potential ‘ firsts ’ as presidents .
But one surprise of the 2008 race is that Iowa and New Hampshire voters appear more enthused by the dream of a groundbreaking black president than a first female one .
“ STANDARD BEARER ”
Even if U.S. feminists can chew on many issues such as workplace constraints and lack of widely available cheap child care , few female voters view Clinton as a “ standard bearer ” for their cause because women span the spectrum of opinion and leaders already seek out their votes by responding to some of their concerns , Wolf said .
She cited the focus by politicians including Bush and Bill Clinton on middle - class “ soccer moms ” who care about education , health care and crime .
“ What matters is to be comfortable and run the race that you believe in because you ca n’t please everybody , ” said Victoria Budson , head of the Kennedy School ’s Women and Public Policy Program .
In an ideal world , Clinton would be judged on her merits rather than her gender but this was unlikely to happen , she added .
Clinton faced a struggle her rivals rarely confront to balance the appearance of toughness with a softer quality U.S. voters look for in female politicians , said academic Barbara Kellerman , who published “ Women in Leadership ” in 2007 and has written numerous other books on the subject .
Clinton ’s congressional vote in 2002 to authorize war in Iraq made her appear tougher on national security than some rivals .
But she is also accused by critics of being cold and failing to show emotion , traits that in a male politician might be interpreted differently .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Debate over Clinton ’s style resurfaced at a campaign event on Monday when she became uncharacteristically emotional and teary - eyed as she described why she was running and the obstacles she faced .
Political comment ranged from sympathy to charges she was faking the emotion .
Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin suggested on her political blog “ The Tears of a Clown ” should be Clinton ’s new campaign song .
Kellerman said it would be a mistake to blame Clinton ’s style if she lost the nomination because until recently that same style had won her front - runner status among the Democratic candidates .
“ If her candidacy does not succeed I hope that women will learn the right lessons from her defeat and not make overarching conclusions about how impossible it is ( for women ) to get to the top , ” she said .
A couple of weeks ago , WebSense posted this article with details of a spammer ’s attack on Google ’s CAPTCHA puzzle , using web services running on two centralized servers :
[ …]
It is observed that two separate hosts active on same domain are contacted during the entire process .
These two hosts work collaboratively during the CAPTCHA break process . [ … ]
Why [ use 2 hosts ] ?
Because of variations included in the Google CAPTCHA image , chances are that host 1 may fail breaking the code .
Hence , the spammers have a backup or second CAPTCHA - learning host 2 that tries to learn and break the CAPTCHA code .
However , it is possible that spammers also use these two hosts to check the efficiency and accuracy of both hosts involved in breaking one CAPTCHA code at a time , with the ultimate goal of having a successful CAPTCHA breaking process .
To be specific , host 1 has a similar concept that was used to attack Live mail CAPTCHA .
This involved extracting an image from a victim ’s machine in the form of a bitmap file , bearing BM .. file headers and breaking the code .
Host 2 uses an entirely different concept wherein the CAPTCHA image is broken into segments and then sent as a portable image / graphic file bearing PV .. X file headers as requests . [… ]
While it does n’t say as such , some have read the post to mean that Google ’s CAPTCHA has been solved algorithmically .
I ’m pretty sure this is n’t the case .
Here ’s why .
Firstly , the FAQ text that appears on “ host 1 ” ( thanks Alex for the improved translation ! ) :
FAQ
If you cannot recognize the image or if it does n’t load ( a black or empty image gets displayed ) , just press Enter .
Whatever happens , do not enter random characters !!!
If there is a delay in loading images , exit from your account , refresh the page , and log in again .
The system was tested in the following browsers : Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Before each payment , recognized images are checked by the admin .
We pay only for correctly recognized images !!!
Payment is made once per 24 hours .
The minimum payment amount is $ 3 .
To request payment , send your request to the admin by ICQ .
If the admin is free , your request will be processed within 10 - 15 minutes , and if he is busy , it will be processed as soon as possible .
If you have any problems ( questions ) , ICQ the admin .
That reads to me a lot like instructions to human “ CAPTCHA farmers ” , working as a distributed team via a web interface .
Secondly , take a look at the timestamps in this packet trace :
The interesting point is that there ’s a 40 - second gap between the invocation on “ Captcha breaking host 1 ” and the invocation on “ Captcha breaking host 2 ” .
There is then a short gap of 5 seconds before the invocations occur on the Gmail websites .
Here ’s my theory : “ host 1 ” is a web service gateway , proxying for a farm of human CAPTCHA solvers .
“ host 2 ” , however , is an algorithm - driven server , with no humans involved .
A human may take 40 seconds to solve a CAPTCHA , but pure code should be a lot speedier .
Interesting to note that they ’re running both systems in parallel , on the same data .
By doing this , the attackers can
collect training data for a machine - learning algorithm ( this is implied by the ‘ do not enter random characters ! ’ warning from the FAQ — they do n’t want useless training data ) collect test cases for test - driven development of improvements to the algorithm measure success / failure rates of their algorithms , “ live ” , as the attack progresses
Worth noting this , too :
Observation * :
On average , only 1 in every 5 CAPTCHA breaking requests are successfully including both algorithms used by the bot , approximating a success rate of 20 % .
The second algorithm ( segmentation ) has very poor performance that sometimes totally fails and returns garbage or incorrect answers .
So their algorithm is unreliable , and has n’t yet caught up with the human farmers .
Good news for Google — and for the CAPTCHA farmers of Romania ;)
Update : here ’s the NYTimes ’ take , with broadly agreeing comments from Brad Taylor of Google .
( The Register coverage is off - base , however . )
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton got her campaign back on track with projected wins in the Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island primaries .
Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island .

Delegate - rich Texas and Ohio were considered must - wins for her campaign .
Clinton 's Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama , who claimed victory in Vermont , had won 12 straight contests since Super Tuesday on February 5 .
Texas also held Democratic caucuses Tuesday , but it was too close to declare a winner .
" For everyone here in Ohio and across America who 's been ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out , for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up , and for everyone who works hard and never gives up -- this one is for you , " Clinton said before supporters in Columbus .
" You know what they say , " she said .
" As Ohio goes , so goes the nation .
Well , this nation 's coming back and so is this campaign . "
Obama congratulated Clinton on her victories but downplayed his losses .
CNN 's political team weighs in on the results »
" We know this :
No matter what happens tonight , we have nearly the same delegate lead as we had this morning , and we are on our way to winning this nomination , " Obama told supporters in Texas .
Sen .
John McCain swept all four Republican contests on Tuesday to become his party 's presumptive nominee .
Read about McCain 's victory
McCain won primaries in Texas , Ohio , Vermont and Rhode Island , giving him more than the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination .
" I am very , very grateful and pleased to note that tonight , my friends , we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence , humility and a great sense of responsibility , that I will be the Republican nominee for president of the United States , " McCain told supporters Tuesday night .
Watch McCain claim victory »
Mike Huckabee dropped out of the Republican race after the results came in .
" It 's now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been , but now what must be -- and that is a united party , " Huckabee told a crowd in Dallas .
Watch Huckabee bow out »
McCain is slated to go to the White House on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Bush , according to two Republican sources .
The Arizona senator 's campaign -- his second run for the White House -- was largely written off for dead last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party 's conservative base , a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising .
But McCain said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night .
McCain overwhelmingly won moderates and conservatives in Ohio , but he lost the evangelical vote to Huckabee , according to exit polls .
Obama 's campaign pressed to extend voting by one hour in two Ohio counties .
See county - by - county results in Ohio
" Due to reports of ballot shortages in Cuyahoga and Franklin counties , we requested a voting extension in those counties , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
A judge ruled to keep parts of Cuyahoga county open an extra hour .
In Texas , Clinton held a two - to - one advantage over Obama with Hispanic voters , while Obama had the overwhelming advantage with black voters in the state 's Democratic primary , according to CNN 's exit poll .
See county - by - county results in Texas
Eighty - three percent of blacks voted for Obama , while 16 percent supported Clinton , according to the exit poll .
Meanwhile , 64 percent of Hispanics backed Clinton , while 32 percent went for Obama .
Early exit polls indicate a distinct " age gap " in both states .
Obama appealed most strongly to younger voters while older voters favored Clinton .
Among Ohio Democratic primary voters aged 17 to 29 , 65 percent went for Obama , and 34 percent went for Clinton .
Among those age 60 and older , Clinton led Obama 67 - 31 percent .
The same pattern held true in early exit polling from the Texas Democratic primary .
Among voters aged 18 to 29 , Obama led Clinton 61-39 percent , and among voters 60 and older , Clinton led Obama 63 - 36 percent .
Poll workers in Collin County , near Dallas , estimated that nearly three - quarters of the Democratic voters would participate in the Democratic caucuses to be held after the polls close .
In an unusual system , the 193 delegates that Texas will send to the Democratic National Convention will be split between Obama and Clinton according to the results of both the primary and the caucuses .
State party officials say the dual primary / caucus system promotes participation in the party .
Both Clinton and Obama have encouraged supporters to do the " Texas two - step " and vote in both events .
Obama came into the day with momentum on his side .
He had 1,378 pledged delegates and superdelegates to Clinton 's 1,269 .
Neither candidate is close to the 2,025 needed to win the Democratic nomination .
Former President Bill Clinton said in February that if his wife won Ohio and Texas , she 'd go on to win the nomination .

Far from being a model of social co-operation , the ant world is riddled with cheating and corruption – and it goes all the way to the top , according to scientists from the Universities of Leeds and Copenhagen .
Ants have always been thought to work together for the benefit of the colony rather than for individual gain .
But Dr Bill Hughes from Leeds ’ Faculty of Biological Sciences has found evidence to shatter this illusion .
With Professor Jacobus Boomsma from the University of Copenhagen , he ’s discovered that certain ants are able to cheat the system , ensuring their offspring become reproductive queens rather than sterile workers .
“ The accepted theory was that queens were produced solely by nurture : certain larvae were fed certain foods to prompt their development into queens and all larvae could have that opportunity , ” explains Dr Hughes .
“ But we carried out DNA fingerprinting on five colonies of leaf - cutting ants and discovered that the offspring of some fathers are more likely to become queens than others .
These ants have a ‘ royal ’ gene or genes , giving them an unfair advantage and enabling them to cheat many of their altruistic sisters out of their chance to become a queen themselves . ”
But what intrigued the scientists was that these ‘ royal ’ genetic lines were always rare in each colony .
Says Dr Hughes : “ The most likely explanation has to be that the ants are deliberately taking steps to avoid detection .
If there were too many of one genetic line developing into queens in a single colony , the other ants would notice and might take action against them .
So we think the males with these royal genes have evolved to somehow spread their offspring around more colonies and so escape detection .
The rarity of the royal lines is actually an evolutionary strategy by the cheats to escape suppression by the altruistic masses that they exploit . ”
A few times each year , ant colonies produce males and new queens which fly off from their colonies to meet and mate .
The males die shortly after mating and the females go on to found new colonies .
The researchers are keen to study this process , to determine if their hypothesis is correct and the mating strategy of males with royal genes ensures their rarity , to keep their advantages undetected by their ‘ commoner ’ counterparts .
However , the scientists ’ discovery does prove that , although social insect colonies are often cited as proof that societies can be based on egalitarianism and cooperation , they are not quite as utopian as they appear .
“ When studying social insects like ants and bees , it ’s often the cooperative aspect of their society that first stands out , ” says Dr Hughes .
“ However , when you look more deeply , you can see there is conflict and cheating – and obviously human society is also a prime example of this .
It was thought that ants were an exception , but our genetic analysis has shown that their society is also rife with corruption – and royal corruption at that ! ”

There was pressure on the Senate not to delay the bill
The package includes one - off rebates of up to $ 600 for individuals and $ 1,200 for couples plus $ 300 for each child .
The Senate voted to approve measures after a week of manoeuvring that saw agreements to provide extra money to retired people and the elderly .
The House of Representatives followed suit a few hours later .
Fast action was needed , politicians said , to limit the damaging effect on the economy that the credit crunch and housing market woes were having .
President George W Bush welcomed the passing of the bill and said it would help stimulate consumer spending .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson also welcomed the approval , saying : " This package of payments to individuals and incentives for businesses to invest will support our economy as we weather the housing downturn . "
' Direction change '
As well as the tax rebates , those on low incomes , who do not pay income tax , would receive a $ 300 payout , Congress agreed .
This is not a victory for Republicans or Democrats .
This is a victory for the American people
Senator Mitch McConnell
The new measures were passed in a vote by 81 - 16 in the Senate , but only after Democrats dropped calls for more unemployment benefits , assistance with fuel bills and plans to offer certain industries tax breaks .
The package passed in the House by 380 to 34 .
The approved package would " change the economic direction of this country " , said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat .
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said : " This is not a victory for Republicans or Democrats .
This is a victory for the American people . "
However , some politicians are worried about the damage the plan will do to government finances - potentially doubling last year 's budget deficit .
" We have to remember that every dollar being spent on the stimulus package is being borrowed from our children and our children 's children , " said Republican Senator Judd Gregg , who voted against the bill .
" I was shocked because Apple is bringing the full internet [ to mobiles ] - full web pages with pictures and everything - and it's not 3G and I knew that would be a speed detriment . "
Wozniak , who has moved on to new ventures since Apple but is still an employee and shareholder , said he did not know when a faster 3G iPhone would be released , although it had " sort of been known since day one that it would be here [ eventually ] " .
The current iPhone model supports fast EDGE networks operated by Telstra and regular 2G networks , but both are n't as fast as 3G .
At the UK launch of the iPhone , CEO Steve Jobs said Apple left out 3G support because it would have a detrimental effect on battery life .
" I never heard that it was a battery issue , " said Wozniak .
" I do n't understand why it would be a battery issue - I get as much life on my 3G phones as I get on my non -3G phones . "
He said he still used the iPhone and praised its internet capabilities but he also carried a Motorola Razr for taking calls and browsing the web .
The iPhone is due to launch in Australia this year but thousands have already imported the device from overseas and unlocked it for use on local mobile networks .
When the MacBook Air was launched in January , Apple was criticised by reviewers for trading off too many essential features in favour of a lightweight , streamlined design .
The criticisms centred on the lack of a DVD drive , missing Ethernet networking port , relatively small 80 GB hard drive and the inability to swap the battery .
Wozniak agreed with those criticisms , saying : " I do n't think it 's going to be a hit . "
He said he liked to burn a lot of DVDs for friends and watched movies on planes , and so needed the ability to swap batteries mid-flight .
" I 'm trying to figure out a way to make the Air a part of my life because i'm a one - laptop - only person , " he said .
" I do n't feel it 's a benefit if you have to carry the Air plus a DVD player plus a couple of extra dongles to connect to Ethernet things and also maybe an extra hard disk to carry your music - but still there 's a pureness about it and really I like it . "
Wozniak said he believed Apple TV - with its on - demand access to movies and TV shows without the need for a computer - was " a really good indicator of where the future is " .
But he criticised the 24 - hour time limit given to users who rent shows via the device and said the quality of YouTube videos played on it was poor .
The rental feature is not yet available on the Australian version of Apple TV , as the local iTunes store only offers music .
" My life is way too global and unpredictable for that [ 24 - hour time limit ] - I 'll get interrupted by something and I wo n't finish it ; I do n't want to have to pay again , " Wozniak said .
Wozniak , who is still good friends with Jobs , is known for his frank and honest opinions , even when asked about topics as close to home as Apple .
He said Jobs " very seldom " calls him to complain about something he has said about Apple in public .
The most recent case was when Wozniak criticised Apple for lowering the iPhone 's price by $ US200 within 10 weeks of its introduction , burning early adopters .
" We 're really good friends - never argued over these things - but once in a while he [ Jobs ] will just have a comment , ' thanks a lot ' . "

A revolutionary bodysuit that British swimmers hope will help them power to medals at the Beijing Olympics could be banned .
The skintight Speedo LZR Racer costume , which was developed with help from Nasa scientists , has been worn in 16 world record - breaking swims in just six weeks since its launch , and now swimmers are clamouring to try it .
But the sport 's governing body is worried that , because it apparently helps swimmers go faster , wearing it could constitute cheating .
Scroll down for more ...
Impressed : British hope Caitlin in the suit
Speedo sponsors the British team and our swimmers can test the super - suit at this week 's Olympic trials in Sheffield , where all 700 hopefuls for the team will have the opportunity to wear one .
Caitlin McClatchey , 22 , who won two gold medals at the 2006 Commonwealth Games , is one of Britain 's brightest hopes and has already tried the costume .
She said : " I just dived in and it felt like I was gliding for ever .
It was really effortless through the water . "
The LZR Racer , which Speedo spent £ 2 million developing , works like an old - fashioned corset , squeezing a swimmer 's body into the sleekest shape possible .
It is coated in water - resistant Teflon and welded together ultrasonically , meaning it has no noticeable seams .
Swimming 's governing body Fina are to meet with Speedo executives next month in Manchester to decide whether the £ 320 costume is legal .
They have already given the suit the all - clear once , but the sheer volume of records that have been smashed in recent weeks is making them think again .
Fina executive director Cornel Marculescu said : " There are buoyancy issues .
We have to review this . "
Speedo's suit , however , faces competition .
The company 's biggest rival Arena unveiled its new Powerskin R-Evolution suit a week ago and claims it can knock half a second off a swimmer 's time over just 50 metres .
Giuseppe Musciacchio , global marketing director of Arena , said : " I am very confident ours will prove to be just as effective .
It will be a great race between Speedo and Arena . "
But even some of the swimmers who benefit from the science are worried that their sport is being overwhelmed by technology .
South Africa 's gold medal Olympian Roland Schoeman , who is sponsored by Arena , said : " It is going to be a technological battle come the Olympics .
" It would be great if the final of the Olympics could be just people and their talent and a true testament to an individual 's work ethic and ability , rather than wearing a suit to correct imperfections .
" But it 's not going to happen .
It would be like Tiger Woods saying he wanted to go back to a wooden driver . "
One consolation for British swimmers if the Speedo suit is banned is that their medal rivals will also be unable to wear it .
The world 's top swimmer , Michael Phelps of the US , is hoping to win an unprecedented eight golds in Beijing , and is intending to wear one of the suits .
He said of Speedo 's creation : " When I hit the water , I feel like a rocket . "
And Australian Libby Trickett , who broke the 100 m freestyle world record in the suit on Thursday , said : " It feels like I 'm swimming downhill . "
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures rallied nearly $ 3 to a record closing level of $ 102.59 a barrel Thursday , as investors ' voracious appetite for oil shows no sign of abating .
Oil prices got a boost from the dollar 's tumble to record lows against some of its major counterparts .
Crude oil for April delivery gained $ 2.95 to end at $ 102.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
This is a record closing level for a front - month contract .
In after - hours , electronic trade , the crude contract continued to surge , hitting an all - time high of $ 102.77 a barrel .
" The dollar 's entrenched downtrend [ is ] attracting more speculative buyers to the crude oil market , " said Michael Fitzpatrick , an analyst at MF Global , a futures brokerage , in a research note .
" Aggressive buying behavior by investors into commodity markets , including energies , will probably not be shelved anytime soon , especially since inflation fears have been stirred up again , as investors continue to seek diversification , " Fitzpatrick said .
Oil surged on the back of weakness in the U.S. dollar , which tumbled to fresh record lows against the euro and the Swiss franc after lackluster economic data and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's comments raised fears about the U.S. economy .
See The Fed .
The trade - weighted dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies , fell 1.2 % to 73.68 .
See Currencies .
Thursday 's economic news was downbeat .
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the U.S. economy grew at an unrevised 0.6 % annual rate for the fourth quarter .
See Economic Report .
Also Thursday , the Labor Department reported that first - time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 19,000 last week , reaching the highest level since late January .

A weaker greenback tends to push up prices for dollar - denominated commodities , such as oil , because those commodities become less expensive for buyers holding other currencies .
" There are n't any fundamentals justifying this price , " said James Williams , energy economist at WRTG Economics , who expects oil to retreat eventually .
" We have no examples of a recession in the last 30 years that was not followed by a drop in crude - oil prices . "
" What I see is a market that 's just trading on emotions , and I think it 's about to collapse , " Williams said .
On March 5 , when members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet , " they 're not going to cut production with prices above $ 100 a barrel , " he said .
Earlier Thursday , oil prices were supported by reports of a partial shutdown of production in Nigeria , Africa 's largest oil producer and the U.S. 's fifth - largest crude supplier .
Crude - oil production from Eni SpA's E , - 2.26 % Brass River terminal was cut by around 50,000 barrels a day as a result of an attack by a militia group , Dow Jones Newswires reported on Thursday , citing West African traders .
On Wednesday , crude closed below $ 100 a barrel after surging to a high of $ 102.08 , coming under pressure after data showed the nation 's crude inventories grew by more than expected in the week ended Feb. 22 .
Natural gas surges

Chapter 10
The Wall of Fire
The concept of " OT " ( operating thetan ) is important in Scientology , as it is the promises made for the OT Levels that motivate many Scientologists to remain in the organization and work their way up the Grade Chart , otherwise known as " The Bridge to Total Freedom . "
The concept of " OT " is similar to that of the " Ubermensch " used by Hitler to signify the superior Aryan man , the superman .
In the Scientology cosmology , eons ago , at the beginning of the universe , we existed as thetans , but possessing superior psychic powers .
Over the millenia , as we became involved in the physical universe , called the MEST universe by Hubbard ( the acronym for matter , energy , space and time ) , we gradually lost our superhuman abilities as we became involved with physical bodies , and were subjected to the crippling electronic incidents known as " implants . "
Enter Scientology .
For the first time in recorded history , Hubbard promises his followers , a way has been found to restore human beings to their long forgotten superhuman abilities , known in Scientology as " OT abilities . "
The OT levels , and the " OTs " who are on them , are highly regarded by Scientologists still on the lower grades .
The awe inspired by " OTs " in Scientology is somewhat like the respect given to PhDs in a university setting , but with an added aura of religious reverence .
So , I was about to enter into this hallowed realm of Scientology .
I reported to the Advanced Organization with my briefcase in hand , and picked up the materials for OT1 .
The instructions said to go to a crowded place , so I took a bus to a nearby suburban mall .
I took out my instructions .
There was a single command : " Spot a person , " and I was to do this until I had reached a cognition .
I walked around the mall , spotting people for an hour or so , and soon had some sort of realization , to the effect that I was unique , that I was not like any other person on earth .
I rushed back to the AO ( Advanced Org ) , and went directly to the Examiner to attest , and I turned my paperwork in to the C/S ( Case Supervisor ) .
I waited anxiously in the lobby .
Shortly afterwards , it was announced : I had passed OT1 .
For this I had paid $ 2,750 .
OT2 , which I started the next day , was a bit more complex and also more expensive at $ 5,225 .
On OT2 , one is supposed to gain " the ability to confront the Whole Track . "
OT2 is a preparation for doing the very important and dangerous level of OT3 , on which one will confront the " Wall of Fire , " and learn the great hidden secret of " this sector of the universe . "
On OT2 , I soon discovered by reading the required bulletins , I would be auditing out more implants .
Some of these implants were :
The Electrical GPM
The Tocky GPM
The Big Being GPM
The House GPM
The Psycho GPM
The Banky GPM
The Arrow
The Double Rod
The Woman
The White Black Sphere
The Hot Cold
The Dance Mob
The Basic GPM
The Body GPM , and others .
Each implant was described in detail in the bulletins .
I had to sit down at the E- meter and read each of these items out loud , marking down the " reads " of the needle on the E- meter , until that item no longer read .
It was a long and tedious process .
The descriptions of the incidents did n't make much sense , but I was in no position to question Hubbard 's writings .
After all , he must know .
For example , the " Dance Mob GPM " was described as follows :
" The duration is 7/8 ths of a second .
There is a pole that pulls one in .
One is caught on the pole .
The actual incident is in connecting with this thing and trying to get off it .
The dancing comes after the actual incident , and consists of a mob dancing around one , chanting various things .
In running this , get the phrases that are chanted ... "
Somehow I managed to get through this level .
I was n't allowed to discuss what I was doing with any other person , so there we were , a collection of brainwashed Scientologists , locked in a room , carrying out these absurd instructions , everyone too frightened to question the sanity of what he or she was doing .
Too much was at stake .
I had invested too much to ask any questions at this point .
I was well beyond the point of no return .
Hundreds of hours of mind - numbing TRs had turned me into a " Rondroid , " an unquestioning , unthinking Scientologist .
If Hubbard had told me to kill myself , I probably would have .
It is hard to explain this to someone who has not been in a cult , but you simply get to a point where you no longer question .
You become a psychological hostage to the cult .
The third OT Level , OT3 , known in Scientology as the " Wall of Fire , " is the level to which I looked forward most eagerly , for it is on this level that Hubbard promises one will at last learn the great secret of this sector of the universe .
According to Hubbard , it is this secret that accounts for the current degraded condition of man .
Once you know this secret , you will then understand the world today and why it is the way it is .
At the time I started OT3 , I was living in the suburb of Studio City , where I was having a live - in affair with an architect - Scientologist named Lee Cambigue .
He was already OT3 .
On the big day , the day I was to start the level , he volunteered to come and sit in on the course with me for the first day .
I was grateful , as I was really frightened of what lay ahead .
As we drove into the smoggy city , he asked me if I was scared .
Yes , I nodded .
I was given the secret materials in a brown folder and let into the locked room where OT3 was taught .
I opened the folder and began to read :
The head of the Galactic Confederation ( 76 planets around larger stars visible from here , founded 95,000,000 years ago , very space opera ) solved overpopulation ( 250 billion or so per planet -- 178 billion on average ) by mass implanting .
He caused people to be brought to Teegeeack ( Earth ) and put an H - bomb on the principal volcanos ( incident 2 ) and then the Pacific ones were taken in boxes to Hawaii and the Atlantic ones to Las Palmas and there " packaged . "
His name was Xenu .
He used renegades .
Various misleading data by means of circuits , etc. , was placed in the implants .
When through with his crime , Loyal Officers ( to the people ) captured him after six years of battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is .
" They " are gone .
The place ( Confederacy ) has since been a desert .
The length and brutality of it all was such that this Confederation never recovered .
The implant is calculated to kill ( by pneumonia , etc. ) anyone who attempts to solve it .
This liability has been dispensed with by my tech development .
In December ' 67 I knew somebody had to take the plunge .
I did and emerged very knocked out but alive .
Probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years .
I have all the data but only that given here is needful .
Good luck .
In the subsequent OT3 bulletins , Hubbard explains further .
It was very hard reading .
Other students in the classroom were watching me as I read to see my reaction , to see if I " got it . "
According to Hubbard , millions of years ago , an evil dictator named Xenu decided to solve the overpopulation problem in his galaxy by rounding up people , freezing them , and shipping them to earth on space ships .
They were deposited on two volcanos , one at Las Palmas and one in Hawaii .
Then nuclear explosions were set off , blowing these frozen souls into the stratosphere where they were collected by " electronic ribbons " ( force fields ) and brought back to earth where they were packaged into clusters .
After packaging , they were subjected to implants in which they were shown many different scenes on huge screens .
Then they were released .
And so , according to Hubbard , the great secret of this sector of the universe is that each person on earth is not just a single person , but a collection ( " cluster " ) of hundreds of different entities .
What I was going to learn on OT3 , was how to telepathically locate these other entities of mine and audit them through the nuclear explosion and implanting that occurred 75,000,000 years ago .
Then these entities would be freed , and able to fly off and find a body of their own .
I hardly heard the Supervisor when he announced the lunch break .
My mind was spinning .
I went outside with Lee .
" You mean that 's all there is ? " I asked him .
" The great secret is that I 'm not just one person ? "
" You got it , " he chuckled .
" But wait until you do the auditing .
You 'll feel terrific ! "
As we walked to lunch , I had a peculiar sensation .
I felt like my mind had just locked up , frozen in time .
I could n't believe what I had just read , it was too incredible .
But I was too brainwashed to disbelieve .
So my mind simply froze , unable to process anything at all .
It was at this point that my symptoms , the terrifying anxiety attacks , began to return in full force .
I went to the Examiner and complained .
But I was told just to continue with the level , and the symptoms would take care of themselves .
I was told that this sort of " restimulation " was common while doing the OT levels .
" The way out is the way through , " was a common Scientology adage that was quoted to me that day .
So I dutifully tried to carry out the complex instructions of the OT3 auditing .
I took my E - meter into a small room at the Org and sat down at the table .
My notepaper was placed to my left and I held the Solo can with my right hand while I made my notes with my left .
With my left hand , I also manipulated the dials of the E- meter , keeping the needle on the face of the dial so I could note all the " reads " of the needle .
I closed my eyes as instructed and tried to locate an entity .
I had been instructed that I would begin to feel pressures on various parts of my body , and that these pressures would be the entities I had to audit .
I was amazed when I did , in fact , feel a pressure on the top of my head .
I opened communication ( telepathically ) with the entity .
I tried to find out his name .
I asked him if he had been implanted at the Las Palmas or the Hawaii volcano .
I watched the E- meter for the reads which would give me my answers .
In theory , the entity that I had contacted was the one who was actually registering on the E-meter .
Then I guided the entity through a complicated set of questions , taking him or her slowly through the explosion and the resulting implant .
I did this over and over with the entity until I felt a lessening and then a release of the pressure , and the needle on the E - meter was floating .
I had just released my first entity !
Suddenly , I heard an electrical crackling all over the room .
I was startled , and I did n't know what to do , but I remembered the words of the Examiner , " The way out is the way through , " and I decided to continue .
The crackling sounds continued to bother me for many sessions .
I went on this way for days , auditing the invisible entities .
After each session , I would turn in my folder to the C/S and would be given instructions to continue .
The boundary between reality and unreality was beginning to disappear for me .
Another event at this time also contributed to my sense of unreality .
On one of my lunch breaks from class , I was swimming in a nearby pool with another student from the course .
His name was Al .
He lounged at the shallow end of the pool with his arms resting on the ledge of the pool .
I was in the deep end of the pool , turning somersaults in the water .
Suddenly ,
Al was right there with me under the water .
I surfaced , and he was still lounging against the shallow end of the pool .
He threw back his head and started to laugh .
" How did you do that ? " I sputtered .
He just kept laughing .
" It has something to do with atoms , " he answered .
" Never mind , " I told him .
" I do n't want to know .
Just do n't do it again . "
This event only served to reinforce my beliefs in the power of OT3 .
One night when I was leaving the Advanced Org , I experienced a peculiar sensation .
I looked around me .
As it happened during the experience on the way to Mario 's many years earlier , the colors around me were again unusually bright .
The stars shown clearly as points of light against a velvet sky .
I had a feeling of euphoria .
" This is it , " I thought to myself excitedly .
" I must be finished with OT3 . "
I went to the Examiner .
I was allowed to attest to OT3 .
I had gone through the Wall of Fire and come out unscathed .
I was now free of my other beings .
I was alone , and the world was clear and beautiful .
The next morning I woke up with a splitting headache and an intense panic attack .
What was wrong ?
This was n't supposed to happen .
I went to the Director of Processing and reported my symptoms .
My folders were taken in to the C/S .
I was called in for a " D of P interview . "
" What is happening , " he told me , " is that you are keying in your next level .
The only thing that will handle your symptoms for good is to do your next level . "
" What level is that ? " I asked him .
" Well , normally you would go to OT4 , but Hubbard has just introduced a new level that is to be done after OT3 .
It 's called NED for OTs ( for New Era Dianetics ) .
But right now it 's only being done in Clearwater . "
Clearwater , Florida , was the U.S. headquarters of Scientology , and all experimental levels were done there first .
The cost of the new level : $ 16,000 .
I went back to living with Lee .
My symptoms were just getting worse and worse .
I was desperate .
Fate intervened .
At this time , my grandmother died , leaving me a sum of money .
I called my father and told him I needed the money to do a level to help me with my anxiety attacks .
My mother arrived in L.A. with the check .
As usual , she tried her best to get me out of Scientology , and she was reluctant to give me the check .
But Lee helped me to convince her that this was really what I needed .
Finally , she gave in .
I had the money .
I could now go to Clearwater to do my NED for OTs .
I flew to Clearwater in November of 1979 , just before my birthday , in pursuit of the " Total Freedom " promised by Hubbard .
I had high hopes for this new level .
It would work .
It had to .

ok so here is the latest pic of the d2 project , ive had some fantastic feedback so far so thanks for all the nice comments , but the question remains what the hell am i going to do with it once its finished .
i could stick it up on ebay and sell it to the highest bidder but thats realy not my style .
would rather it go to someone with a genuine love for this sort of thing not someone with deep pockets who would buy it on a whim .
there has been talk of an online raffle over at my regular haunt b3ta.com , i would like to raise enough to cover my time spent making it and my materials and a few quid to fund the next project , once that figure has been reached a percentage of the profit would go to charity .
just an idea at the moment i can see this being a bit of a pain to set up , but we'l see how things go .

John Edwards gave his first public speech today since withdrawing from the Democratic race a couple of months ago .
He had lots of nice things to say about both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , but dropped no hints about when or if his personal endorsement was coming .
“ I have a very high opinion of both of them .
We would be blessed as a nation to have either one of them as president , ” Edwards said .
He continued on the same path of complimenting both the remaining Democratic candidates .
“ We are blessed , first , to have an extraordinarily talented African American who could be the next president of the United States , ” Edwards said .
“ There ’s no way to contest the fact that he ’s inspired this country .
And Senator Clinton , who has served America for so long and so well , and has shown so much strength and leadership , has really forged an extraordinarily historic campaign as a woman for the nomination and for the presidency . ”
When asked by reporters about an endorsement , he said , “ When I have something to say , I ’ll let you know . ”
I think there are a few different possible explanations for why John Edwards has not given his endorsement yet .
First , I think Edwards had a better feel than most about how tight this race could get .
He knows that it is unlikely that neither candidate will win the nomination on their own .
In this situation , he can play kingmaker .
His support thrown in at the right time could tip the balance towards one candidate over the other .
Another possibility is that Edwards is torn between these two candidates , just as the Democratic Party is .
This endorsement could end up being the biggest decision of Edwards ’s political career , and he does n’t want to choose the wrong team .
Advertisements
Finally , there is the possibility that Edwards is waiting for the winner to emerge , because he is looking for a job in the next administration .
Many of his supporters and donors have already drifted towards Obama , so his reason for waiting has to be something more political than personal .
Edwards has millions of supporters , so his endorsement , when it comes , will carry a lot of weight .
It is my guess that Edwards will end up endorsing Obama .
There is an ideological match between the two that is hard to ignore .
Edwards thought he would be a big player in the 2008 race , but I do n’t think that this is the role he had in mind for himself .
The universe is 13.73 billion years old , give or take 120 million years , astronomers said last week .
That age , based on precision measurements of the oldest light in the universe , agrees with results announced in 2006 .
Two additional years of data from a NASA satellite known as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe have narrowed the uncertainty by tens of millions of years .
“ Everything is tightening up and giving us better and better precision all the time , ” said Charles L. Bennett , a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University and the leader of the group analyzing the data .
“ It ’s actually significantly better than previous results .
There is all kinds of richness in the data . ”
About 380,000 years after the Big Bang , the universe cooled enough for protons and electrons to combine into hydrogen atoms .
That released a burst of light , which over the billions of years since has cooled to a bath of microwaves pervading the cosmos .
Under Mr. Romney , Bain took advantage of new financial instruments like junk bonds , borrowing money to make big bets and , when they paid off , big returns .
The firm also inserted itself into a variety of industries .
It helped transform office supplies from a local business into a national one , by financing a business plan that turned into Staples .
“ I do n’t think of Mitt Romney in a C.E.O. context , because that ’s not what he has done , ” said Vin Weber , a former congressman from Minnesota advising Mr. Romney .
“ Mitt Romney has run a company where the sole mission was to look at companies and figure out how to make them more successful . ”
Mr. Romney argues that the analytical skills he honed at Bain would be an enormous asset in the White House .
He would use them , he suggests , to fix the economy ’s problems while leaving alone its many healthy parts .
His economic message is considerably more upbeat than that of the Democrats or of Mike Huckabee , his main rival in Iowa .
“ I think the fundamentals of our economy are sound , ” Mr. Romney said .
“ We are an innovative nation with enviable levels of productivity and high levels of education .
And the combination is such that America has a strong and growing economy . ”
As Mr. Romney argues in a PowerPoint presentation on the campaign trail , the main role of government is to allow the free market to do its work .
One of his advisers , R. Glenn Hubbard , helped devise President Bush ’s tax cuts .
Another , N. Gregory Mankiw , succeeded Mr. Hubbard as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush .
At the same time , Mr. Romney tries to use his business experience to distance himself , gently , from Mr. Bush .
He has lamented the response to Hurricane Katrina and portrays himself as pragmatic and competent .
His time in the business world has made him willing to accept “ three - quarters of a loaf , ” Mr. Hubbard said , when the alternative is standing on principle and accomplishing nothing .
Mr. Romney also says that government has an important role to play  negotiating trade deals that are more favorable to this country , for instance , and setting up a well - functioning market for health insurance .
He has proposed exempting from taxes the earnings on investments that are made by households earning less than $ 200,000 .
The plan would have a “ double impact , ” he says , helping the middle class while creating a bigger pool of capital to finance new businesses .
Nanotechnology — materials , machines and other products fabricated with nanometer - sized components such as single atoms or molecules — is morally unacceptable to most Americans , according to a sampling taken by the University of Winconsin - Madison .
Of 1,015 adult Americans polled , only 29.5 agreed that it was acceptable , compared to more than half in European countries .
Dietram
Scheufele , the university 's proferssor of life sciences communication , claims its due to religious beliefs which inculcate people with a generalized mistrust of science .
In this view , even when scientific endeavor produces results with no clear religious implications ( unlike , say , evolution or human cloning )
it 's simply not on to go around thinking empirically about the natural world .
Scheufele insists that it's not a matter of misunderstanding what nanotechnology is — the respondents knew what they were rejecting .
" They are rejecting it based on religious beliefs .
The issue is n't about informing these people , " he told Science Daily .
" They are informed . "
I think he 's hyping an angle : religious belief merges neatly into irreligious fear of the new and other objections to science .
He specifically chooses to forget about the science - skeptical nature of postmodernists , feminists , environmentalists and countless other non-religious factions .
Only about 60 percent of Brits are happy with nanotech , for example , and they 're about as religious as cement .

Heesters is a controversial figure in the Netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the Nazi occupiers .
Security was tight at the De Flint theater in Heester 's hometown of Amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on Saturday , Feb. 16 .
Protestors equate the singer with fascism
Police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo - Nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
The last time Heesters tried to peform in the Netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave Nazi salutes .
Heesters was born in Amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers ( 35 miles ) east of Amsterdam in 1903 .
Yet he made his fortune in Germany .
The artist is revered by generations of Germans for his operettas and film performances .
One of Hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists
Heesters has been a popular German - language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the Nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
Heesters claims he did not know what was happening to Jews during the war despite visiting the Dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" Honestly , I was too busy working , " Heesters said in an interview after a TV gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" I could n't do anything about politics . "
Heesters is considered a musical legend in Germany
While Germans have taken Heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " Always You " and " Illusion , " many of his Dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the Nazi regime during World War II .
After the Nazi defeat , Heesters continued his career in Germany , settling in Bavaria .
Heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
At the concert Saturday , Heesters performed hits such as " The Merry Widow " and " There by the Windmill " despite breaking several ribs on Jan. 1 during a fall .
At the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports .
Postage rates :
My father — a freelance bookkeeper for many years — kept a list like this , and I made a copy of his list sometime in the 1970's , and then kept updating it myself every time there was a rate increase .
Eventually I converted it into this HTML document .
Links to the US Postal Service web site are constantly changing , so there may be a number of broken links below .
Please bear with me while I weed them out .
Postage Rates and Historical Statistics .
Rates for Domestic Letters , 1863-2011 .
Rates for Domestic Letters , 1792 - 1863 .
Significant Dates in USPS history .
Timeline of Significant Dates in Post Office History .
Information about the most recent ( proposed ) increase came from the Exigent Price Filing FAQ page
Information about " A " through " H " stamps came from the US Postal Rate Commission .
ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan , according to Unicover .
ZIP Code began July 1 , 1963 , according to The Postal Service History Page .
History of post card rates came from the US Postal Rate Commission , which has this to say about post card rates : " The post card rate has remained at 20 cents since 1995 .
On January 10 , 1999 , however , a one cent charge for the card itself was implemented , in addition to the postage .
Putting a 20 cent stamp on a private card avoids the one cent card charge . "
Airmail rates are not shown here ; however , it is worth noting that domestic airmail was eliminated as a separate subclass of mail service , effective May 1 , 1977 .*
ZIP+4 was announced in 1978 and implemented October 1 , 1983 according to Unicover .
The Editor says ...
ZIP+4 was supposed to make mail delivery faster and hold down costs .
Is delivery any faster ?
( It 's called " snail mail " for a reason . )
Since nine - digit ZIP codes were introduced , there have been more than a dozen rate increases .
Domestic Mail Rate History :
This document shows that ZIP+ 4 does hold down the cost of postage ... but only for commercial bulk - rate customers .
In other words , it makes unsolicited junk mail easier to send , but it does n't reduce the cost of a first - class letter at all .
Along the way I also found a complete Glossary of postal terms [ PDF file ] and a Postage Rate Calculator .

New : Inflation - adjusted postage rates , in 2008 dollars .
You could make your own chart by using the On-line Inflation Calculator .
Updated 5/29/2010 : A reader by the name of Rob Haeseler sent in a correction :
The second line of the chart above was in error , and instead of March 3 , 1883 , the effective date for the two - cent rate was October 1 , 1883 .
Hearing no objections , the table has been modified accordingly .
Updated 4/5/2011 : A reader by the name of Steve Elwood noted that I had the wrong postcard rate on the last line of the table .
It should be ( and now it is ) 29 cents , not 30 cents , according to this table .

The price cut , you see , was n't their idea .
The price cut came from the government entity that regulates the postal service , the logically named Postal Regulatory Commission .
The original price hike for letters back in 2014 was actually a surcharge enacted to help the postal service 's cash flow , and the PRC ordered that the postal service roll back that surcharge .
The Postmaster General estimates that the price cuts for domestic and international letters will cost the USPS $ 2 billion per year .

USPS Announces
The " Forever " Stamp : Is It Worth Your $ 0.39 ?
Yesterday [ 2/26/2007 ] , the United States Postal Service announced the introduction of a " forever " postage stamp .
Here 's how it works : whenever you buy a first class postage stamp , it will no longer be marked with a cash denomination on it like current stamps are .
Instead , it will merely say " First Class " on it .
Once you buy it , you can use it at any point in the future .
Think twice before hoarding ' forever ' stamps you might never use .
The stamps are called " forever " because they will be good for any future single - piece first - class envelope weighing an ounce or less , no matter how prices might change in the future .
Additional information —
Some of which is now outdated :
2 - cent increase in stamp prices urged .
A postal regulatory commission recommended a 2 - cent increase in the cost of mailing a letter today and urged the Post Office to introduce a " forever " stamp valid for first - class postage even when rates rise .
The recommendation to increase postage to 41 cents was a penny less than the postal service had requested .
PRC Issues Recommendations on the Postal Rate Case .
On Feb. 26 the Postal Regulatory Commission ( PRC ) issued its recommendations on the rate case filed by the U.S. Postal Service last May .
For the most part , the PRC agreed with the changes proposed in the case , though it did recommend raising the cost of a first - class stamp by two cents , to $ 0.41 , rather than three cents .

According to the access logs here at akdart.com , many people are linking to this page ( that 's good ! ) and some are using it as an educational tool in schools , which is wonderful .
This chart seems to be an easy way to show kids what inflation does to the value of a dollar .
If you would like to dig deeper , compare these postage prices to the US Consumer Price Index from 1913 to today .
Thanks to a reader named Marilyn who sent in this information :
" According to ' The Source -- A Guidebook of American Genealogy ' by Loretto Dennis Szucs and Sandra Hargreaves Luebking , there are postcard postage rates earlier than 1926 .
In their 1997 edition , page 13 : ' Penny postcards were manufactured after 1898 , when postal regulations established the penny postcard rate , while cards requiring two cents of postage date from 1873 to 1898 . '
My postcards have 1¢ stamps on them up through 1928 . "
She also says postcards have 2¢ stamps on them beginning in 1929 .
This seems to contradict the information on the Postal Rate Commission 's web page , so I have included only the 1898 date in the table above .
Thanks also to Jim Cropper , evidently quite a stamp collector , who referred me to the USPS Rate Case filings , which show the Proposed Price Adjustments for Spring 2007 , and the USPS Postal Bulletin , available cover - to - cover in Adobe PDF format bi-weekly .
Updated 2/29/2008 :
Today I received an informative email from Lewis Bussey , president of the United Postal Stationery Society .
Since he is evidently an authority on postal rate history , and since there is plenty of room on this page , I 'll include his comments verbatim :
Dear Mr. Dart ,
The domestic post card was authorized to be mailed at the same rate as government postal cards on July 1 , 1898 .
Post cards were of course available well before 1898 , but previously they were charged the higher letter rate , not a flat 2 ¢ .
This 1898 1¢ card rate continued until November 2 , 1917 ( the " war tax " increase ) when the rate was effectively increased to 2¢ .
On July 1 , 1919 , the rate was reduced back to 1¢ .
However on April 15 , 1925 , the " postal " card rate stayed 1 ¢ and the " post " card rate increased to 2 ¢ .
This condition continued until July 10 , 1928 , when both " postal " and " post " card were again charged 1¢ .
On January 2 , 1952 , the card rate went to 2 ¢ and has been increasing every since ( except as you note from September 14 , 1975 to December 31 , 1975 when the rate actually decreased from 8 ¢ to 7 ¢ ) .
Most of the card rates ( domestic including charges for pre-sorting and automation , and also international rates ) are tabulated in the United Postal Stationery Society 's 2005 United States Postal Card Catalog .
Best Regards -
Lewis Bussey ,
President , UPSS
Thank you , Mr. Bussey !
Updated 9/26/2008 :
Doug Hardt writes ,
The " Each Additional Ounce " column is somewhat misleading in that letters are limited to 3½ ounces or less .
Ounces 2 and 3 each cost 17 cents but anything over 3 up to 3 ½ is another 17 cents .

Coin - operated stamp machines are being eliminated
Thieves Target Postal Stamp Machines .
You may have noticed easy access to stamps missing from your neighborhood postal station .
That 's because crooks have turned their attention to breaking into stamp vending machines for the cash inside .
Post Office to Eliminate Stamp Machines .
Postage stamps can be purchased by mail , at the supermarket , even from many bank cash machines .
But there 's one place you wo n't be able to get them in a few years vending machines at the post office .
The U.S. Postal Service plans to eliminate its 23,000 vending machines by 2010 , the agency said in a recent internal memo .
U.S. Postal Service removing stamp machines .
[ Postmaster Rusty ]
Field said the Carroll Reece station on North State of Franklin Road does have an automated postal center , but it requires the use of a credit or debit card .
U.S. currency wo n't do at the post office automated center .
With plastic a person can also buy stamps online or over the telephone , and those who do n't have anything in their wallet but cash can still wait in line and buy stamps from a postal clerk .
Stamp machines are convenient .
Many of us have had the experience :
We have a piece of mail that needs to go out immediately , so we go to the post office after normal operating hours .
Mail still can be deposited in the outer lobby — and , thank heaven , there 's a machine available to sell us a stamp .
Not anymore .
The U.S. Postal Service is removing all stamp vending machines .
They 're getting old and it is difficult to keep them in operation , say officials .
Stamp machines sent packing .
Postmaster Donald Hopper said the U.S. Postal Service is removing 23,000 machines nationwide by 2010 .
Hopper said the postal service no longer makes new machines and maintenance costs are too high to keep them .
Local postal employee Brian Moore , who 's in charge of maintaining the machines , said they account for approximately 600 transactions per week .
Postal Service removing all stamp machines .
Need stamps for those holiday cards ?
Do n't go to the post office , unless you 're prepared to stand in line or pay with a credit card .
Stamp vending machines , where customers can buy a single 41 - cent stamp or a book of stamps with coins or dollar bills , are on their way out .
The Editor says ...
That will make the long lines at the window just a little longer .

With their dark hair , strong noses and refined chins , it is immediately apparent that women of the Clark family are related .
Each is a feature that has been passed through the generations , and will no doubt appear in their children and children 's children for years to come .
But there is one part of their bodies that does not appear to have been handed down the family line : their breasts .
The matriarch of the family , 69 - year - old Yvonne Clark is a 36B , while her daughter Angela Stanton , 51 , grew into a C - cup .
And the pattern of increasing breast size continues into the next generation : Angela 's daughter Tracey 's breasts are a 32G .
" I got my first bra when I was 11 - I was a 32A and one of the first girls at school to need a bra , " says Tracey , who lives in Buckinghamshire with her mother .
Scroll down for more ...
" After that , I developed at an unbelievable rate .
At 15 , I wore a 32E .
It seemed unusual considering my mother and grandmother had never been that big , and most of my school friends were still wearing B-cups .
I 'm now a 32G and have been this size since I was 20 .
" I love having big breasts .
When I get dressed up to go out in the evenings , I make the most of it .
It makes for a great neckline and my friends associate me with my big chest .
I would n't want to be known any other way . "
Some might call Tracey lucky , but , in fact , she is part of a quantifiable scientific reality : British women 's breasts are getting bigger with each generation .
The average bra size in the UK is now 36C , whereas just a decade ago it was 34B .
This week , it was announced that in response to demand , Marks & Spencer 's is to stock J - cup bras for the first time .
Previously , its lingerie department went up to G , but it will now offer GG , H , HH and J .
Earlier this year , Bravissimo , a bra company that specialises in larger sizes , introduced three different K - cup bras - in response to customer demand .
At this rate , we 'll all reach the next millennium with figures like Jordan's , except our breasts will be natural , not silicone .
" Since the first Bravissimo shop opened in 1999 , we have seen a steady flow of women throughout the UK who need a K - cup bra , " says Jacqui Geraghty , of Bravissimo .
" There is nothing unusual in this bra size any more . "
Looking at her family line , 67 - year - old grandmother Barbara Haywood , a ballroom dancing instructor , is a little taken aback by the increasing size of breasts through each generation .
Her 22 - year - old granddaughter Miranda 's 30G breasts swamp her own 36B bosom .
" In my day it was only old , stout ladies who had big bosoms - the sort who might lean over the garden fence and talk to the neighbours , " says Barbara , who lives in Nottingham .
" But today it 's young women , such as my granddaughter Miranda , who seem to wear the biggest bra sizes .
" My friends and I still had the underdeveloped bodies of children when we were 18 .
I wore ankle socks and plimsolls until I left school at 15 , and wore my first bra some time after that .
" Diet and lifestyle are so different these days .
When I was growing up we ate a basic diet of meat , game and vegetables .
Chocolates , sweets and puddings were a treat and we 'd spend our time riding our bikes and playing outdoor games - not sitting in front of computers .
I 'm not surprised the young generation are bigger all over - I probably would have been if I 'd consumed all that they do . "
Contrast Barbara 's experience with that of her daughter Denise , 42 , who is a 34FF and her granddaughter Miranda , a bra-fitting consultant , who is a 30G and wore her first bra - a B - cup - at the age of 11 .
" I really notice the difference when I look back at old photos of generations of our family , ' says Miranda .
" The women of my gran and great - gran 's generation had very slender figures with small busts and minuscule waists .
That could n't be further removed from the figure I 've landed up with .
Scroll down for more ...
" I love my big breasts now , but I hated them when I was at school .
I dreaded sports lessons because my breasts would bounce around during netball and rounders and all the boys stared at them .
" Now , although my chest is often the first thing men notice about me , they soon realise I have a lot more to offer .
I used to think about having a breast reduction because I felt selfconscious .
Now , having big breasts makes me feel womanly . "
So why do women today have bigger breasts ?
Some experts say the boom in bust size may be explained by the popularity of cosmetic implants : 10,000 breast implants are carried out every year .
Significantly more women have breast enhancements than they do reductions : 2004 figures from a BUPA Hospital in Edinburgh show that of the 21 - 30 age group who had cosmetic surgery , 60 per cent opted for breast augmentation and only seven per cent wanted a breast reduction .
Other experts highlight the effect of hormones - breast tissue is extremely sensitive to these , with some women finding they need a bigger bra in the week leading up to a period .
This is a major reason why the contraceptive pill - which also leads to fluid retention in the breast - has been linked to the increase in breast size .
" There is a tendency for the pill to stimulate breast growth , " says Professor Pierre - Marc Cilles Bouloux , a consultant endocrinologist and physician at The London Clinic .
" However , modern versions of the pill contain far less oestrogen than their older counterparts , so it is not fair to attribute this shift in its entirety to the pill . "
The residual oestrogen that gets into the water supply from people on the pill is also thought by some to be a factor .
Other speculative theories include the suggestion that levels of artificial hormones in the foodchain could be affecting breast sizes , though there is no research to back this up .
Foods from baked beans to almonds have also been touted as factors in increasing breast size , but this is speculative .
In fact , it seems that the most significant and likely explanation for our growing bust size is the simplest - bigger breasts is a result of weight gain all round .
Since the 1950s , the average female waist has risen from 27.5 in to 34in .
So , is it any wonder that breasts are getting bigger too ?
" It 's well known that as a population , we 've all been getting bigger , " says Dr Joanna Scurr , a principal lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Portsmouth .
" The larger we become overall , then the larger women 's breasts will become .
There is not any evolutionary reason breasts are getting bigger : it 's simply a consequence of us all becoming generally bigger .
" Breasts are increasing because women today have a higher proportion of fat in their breasts than they used to .
The structure of the breast is divided into the functional glandular element - comprising the milk ducts and support tissues - and fat .
" The functional part of the breast changes size at certain points during a woman 's life .
It will get bigger when she 's pregnant and breast - feeding - this is why women 's breasts generally get bigger at this time , and smaller when they 're going through the menopause .
This is because the body no longer needs the breast for milk .
" But otherwise this functional part of the breast does n't change .
So the increased breast size is due to the increase in fat that women carry . "
The Mail 's nutritionist Jane Clarke agrees that weight gain in general is a major factor in the increase in women 's bust size .
" We 're eating more - and of the wrong sorts of food such as crisps and chocolate , " says Jane .
" All those calories end up on the hips , and breasts .
Women are also drinking far too much alcohol , which is not only unhealthy but highly calorific . "
Like Miranda , Jane - Louise Atherton , a 22 - year - old fitness instructor , is also significantly better endowed than her mother and grandmother .
" My breasts suddenly appeared out of nowhere as A - cups when I was 13 and did n't stop growing until they hit a FF at 18 , " says Jane - Louise , who lives with her parents in Macclesfield and works as a part - time model .
" I actually used to be called pancake at school before I wore a bra .
I 'm only a size eight , so I can't blame my large breasts on being overweight .
" But big breasts are n't all they are cracked up to be .
It 's true that men zoom in on them , but I can't wear fashionable backless tops or boob tubes because they do n't offer any support .
" When you 've got large breasts it 's incredibly expensive to buy wellfitting bras because they cost at least £ 30 - and that 's without the matching knickers .
I look at the older generations in my family and I 'm envious of their figures .
" My grandmother has an amazing figure for an 80 - year - old .
She 's only a size ten and has tiny feet and slim ankles .
She wears elegant heels and co-ordinates jewellery to wear with her clothes .
Mum looks great , too , and has a very slim waist which accentuates her curves . "
Scroll down for more ...
Certainly , Jane - Louise 's grandmother Betty Cox , 80 , does not feel she has missed out by having a smaller , 34B breast .
" I was a skinny little thing when I was young and did n't need a bra until I was 14 , ' says Betty , a retired tap dancer who lives in Macclesfield .
" I 'm happy with my body and especially my breasts .
They are a good size and in proportion to the rest of me .
I love the fact that dancing has given me a lean figure , even in old age , as well as graceful posture .
" It 's strange how bust sizes are getting bigger , although it 's difficult to tell which breasts are natural and which are false .
Women are taller , curvier and even their feet are bigger .
I only take a size three - and - a - half shoe , whereas my granddaughter Jane - Louise is a five . "
Jane - Louise 's mother Linda , a 34DD , also envies Betty 's silhouette .
" I would love to have a figure like my mum's , " says Linda , a sales assistant , who lives with her husband Keith , 56 , and their other daughter Lauren , 22 .
' I 've always been a C or a D , but being smaller would make it easier to buy more fitted clothes .
" I admit I was a bit surprised when I took my girls to Marks & Spencer 's to have bras fitted and they ended up being more buxom than either my mother or I .
But that is just the way things seem to be going .
" I think it must be down to all this processed food and sugary sweets that young people eat today .
I have lots of friends who look at their daughter 's breasts and wonder where they have come from . "
It is a sentiment with which Yvonne Clark , 69 , agrees .
She admits to being entirely flummoxed as to the
origin of her granddaughter Tracey 's G - cup breasts .
" The funny thing is , I 've been a 36B all my life , " says Yvonne , who lives in Buckingham with her husband , William .
" Young girls wore vests , not bras , when we were growing up and I did n't buy a bra until I was 15 .
" But in my day , we did n't look at every single girl 's weight , or bust size .
Being healthy was the main thing and it still is .
That said , I have definitely noticed that young girls today are lucky enough to have the sort of ample bosom that my generation could only have dreamed of . "

Making your deer butt alien head
All you need to create your own deer art is a styrofoam mannequin head , a fresh deer butt , a sharp knife and some glue and you are ready to get started making your own deer masterpiece .
Deer butts - before and after transformation into fine art Deer butt alien head aficionado's recommend that you start with a fresh deer carcass , and this always makes it more fun and educational for the kids because they can share the joy of disemboweling Bambi , they get a lesson in anatomy and taxidermy , and they have the thrill of creating a one - of - a - kind work of art .
Make sure to tie - off the hiney hole
When preparing a deer butt alien head the old fashioned way ( from scratch ) , it 's important to tie off the anus with a piece of string so that the white tail area does not become soiled with deer doo - doo when you cut - open your treasure .
You need to carefully open - up your deer , starting right above the groin .
Once the incision is made you will need to tie - off the anus again , from the inside , and then sever the large intestine right above the tie .
Next , cut the deer 's throat , severing the deer 's neck all the way back to the spine .
This will disconnect the arteries and throat from the head .
Now , all you need to do is simply cut open the gut upwards to the rib cage and watch junior 's delight when all the innards come - out in one piece !
Amazing !
Redneck Factoid :
When the contents of the body cavity slide free from the carcass , be very careful not to pop the gall bladder .
The bile stinks to high - heaven and it will ruin the meat and your deer butt .
You can also use fine products like " Butt Out " to quickly remove the anus from your deer art :
Once you have skinned the hide , open - up the deer skull and extract the brain so that you can use the deer brains to tan the hide ( see www.braintan.com).
Redneck Factoid :
It 's a curious fact of nature that a deer has just enough brains to tan their own hide , no more , no less .
In fact , every animal has enough brains to tan their own hide , except the Buffalo , of course . . .
Many people say that the real red neck art is the shaping of the deer anus to look like a mouth .
This is the true test of the artists loving hand .
The anus can be made very simple , or you can stretch the anus for realistic effects such as smiles and frowns .
In general , the leading deer butt artists concentrate on the details of the mouth .
Many deer butt snobs will put their art outside , bragging on their good taste .
Here is an example of the popular deer butt doorbells : Alternatives to deer butts
If you do n't have any deer butt 's handy , do n't despair .
Many creative folks will go on a scavenger hunt , searching for fresh road kill to use for their red neck art .
Here is where the creative process is critical and you can let - loose with your artistic freedom to come up with a wealth of affordable fine art for your home .
Even rodents can be sculptured into fine redneck art plaques .

This gentleman is one of my favorite up - and - coming squirrel butt artists , and I 've bid on several of his amazing works of fine squirrel fine art .
I 've noted in previous publications that our farm cats have been eating all of our squirrels and our concerns about mad squirrel disease .
It 's really a waste to have half - eaten squirrel carcasses all over the ranch , and it occurred to me that these corpses could be used as an educational tool for children .
The kiddies can have hours of fun crafting a coffin for the deceased squirrel and you can have great fun doing a full open casket funeral and eulogy .
Oh , and they make a great gift too !

Up , Up and Away What 's Really Driving the Price of Oil ?
The price of crude oil has doubled , from $ 50 to $ 100 , within months .
The increase cannot be attributed to the fundamental data , which have hardly changed .
And the looming recession ought to drive the price down .
So why is oil getting more expensive ?

As the war drums were beating for Iraq I knew something was wrong .
I was paying attention to President Bush as he continually accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction and being linked to terrorist organizations such as Al - Qaeda .
Yet , there was no solid proof that any of Bush ’s accusations had any validity to them .
I guess if you repeat the same lies over and over again they begin to sound true .
How else could Bush have tricked the nation into an unjust and unnecessary war in Iraq ?
At the time I was stationed at Fort Riley , Kansas .
It seemed as if the moment I arrived there in June 2002 the only message being sent from the top down was to be ready for war with Iraq .
We trained vigorously that summer for war .
And in January 2003 my unit deployed to Fort Irwin , California for a month long desert warfare training exercise .
Immediately upon returning from Fort Irwin my unit received orders to deploy to Kuwait for the military buildup to topple Saddam Hussein and his government in Iraq .
We scrambled to get our gear and equipment ready for what would be the inevitable war with Iraq .
It took a couple weeks to prepare , get medically screened , and write out our wills .
Then we were put on standby to deploy at a moments notice .
There was a mixed sentiment among the troops I had served with at the time .
For some troops
Bush ’s word was enough for them to go to Iraq to fight and die for what they believed was necessary for our country .
There were some who did n’t pay attention to the politics .
They felt that they were soldiers who had no other option but to go to war and take their chances .
In a sense , that is what good soldiers do .
I felt alone for the most part because I kept paying attention to what Bush was saying and what the UN weapons inspectors were reporting .
To me it just was n’t adding up .
But before I could blink my eyes I was on the border of Kuwait and Iraq ready to invade on day one .
It was n’t long before we received our attack orders and pushed into Iraq .
It was a rough ride to Baghdad .
Right from the start 150,000 troops were cluttered and stacked upon each other with our vehicles breaking down due to the harsh terrain of the southern Iraqi desert .
We were in the middle of nowhere and out in the open .
If there were ever a time for Saddam to use his weapons of mass destruction it would have been the perfect opportunity for him .
We were in the perfect location for him to attack us — out in the open desert with no other population .
He could have launched the alleged stockpile of WMD directly upon the US military and killed no one but our troops .
If Bush really was convinced that Saddam had such a massive WMD arsenal why would he place us in the most vulnerable position for him to use them on us ?
Probably because Bush knew they did not exist otherwise he never would have allowed such a stupid battle plan to take place .
We pushed into Baghdad facing heavy resistance from the primarily Shiite populated cities in southern Iraq .
It was strange being that the Shiites were Saddam ’s enemies who he had oppressed for decades .
To me it was clear that they hated us more than Saddam because we were invaders from the west .
Saddam might have been a horrible man , but we were worse in their eyes .
It was frightening to realize that the people who Saddam murdered by the thousands actually preferred him to us .
My stay in Baghdad was not much different .
It was very confusing because the enemy was so unidentifiable .
We did n’t know who we were fighting , and that made it extremely difficult to distinguish between the civilian population and the insurgents .
As time goes on you stop distinguishing between the two .
My perception was that we were fighting the Iraqi people who resented our presence in their country — not Al - Qaeda as George Bush kept drilling into the minds of the American people .
We were attacked almost on a daily basis by rocket propelled grenades , AK - 47 assault rifles , improvised explosive devices , and mortars .
This kind of violent activity led to thousands of pre-dawn raids on Iraqi homes .
And when you kick in the door you enter the homes as if you are going after Bin Laden himself .
In a sense we started to treat the Iraqi people as if they are all terrorists causing them to resent us even more .
In the following days of each raid violent activity would double and for some reason no one could understand why .
I participated in the training of the Iraqi Security Forces .
Their training cycle was one week long and it was extremely insufficient .
There was no trust factor between us and them .
During their weapons qualification I can recall being told by my range NCO to stand directly behind the Iraqi soldier just in case he tried to turn the weapon on us .
My instructions were to “ jump him and kill him . ”
When the training cycle was over we incorporated them into our units to accompany us on missions in order to train them .
Prior to the missions we never told them where we were going because we were positive that the insurgency had infiltrated the Iraqi Security Forces .
If they knew where the mission would take place they could tip off the larger insurgency element and set us up for an ambush .
Almost all of them covered their faces out of fear or shame of being seen with American troops in their communities .
As a rifle team leader leading a team of Iraqis wearing hoods and carrying AK - 47 assault rifles down a narrow alley in Baghdad it is needless to say that my anxiety level was through the roof .
Before I left Iraq I made a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to stop this war if I was lucky enough to make it home .
Upon honorable discharge from the US Army in February 2005 I relocated to the Washington , DC area .
I immediately became a vocal critic of the war and traveled the halls of Congress going door to door hoping to share my experiences with those who empowered Bush to send us to war .
For a few months it fell on deaf ears , but after a while some members of Congress began to listen .
From there on I spoke at rallies , demonstrations , town hall meetings , and on behalf of anti Iraq war candidates running for office .
I joined the Democratic leadership in promoting legislation that called for an end to the war .
It ’s been years now and sometimes I feel out of breath and tired from screaming at the top of my lungs for end to this madness in Iraq .
But we are still there and it appears that there is really no end in sight .
Even General Patraeus can’t say that we are safer because of the war in Iraq .
During our troop surge the Iraqi government fell apart .
We have granted amnesty to Sunni militias in Anbar with American blood on their hands , and we are now arming and financing them out of desperation to stop the violence .
We are doing the same for Shiite militias loyal to Al Sadr who is a mass murderer of US troops .
The Iraqi government , police force , and security forces are rampant with corruption .
Is this the Iraq that our troops were sent off to die for ?
If Bush cared the slightest bit I would love to ask him that question .
Now it has been suggested by General Petraeus that the surge has been such a success that we can bring home 30,000 troops by this summer .
Really ?
That would mean that if there were any gains
made by the surge they will evaporate almost immediately into thin air .
We will be right back were we started with fewer troops in an extremely hostile environment —
The Rumsfeld Doctrine .
What then ?
Do we have another surge ?
Is that possible with a broken military ?
OF COURSE NOT .
Bush and his loyalists in Congress wo n’t even allow our troops to rest after mulitple deployments that go above and beyond the call of duty .
During the last Democratic presidential debate the front runners for the nomination could not even guarantee that our troops would be home by the end of their first term in 2013 .
For me that is just tragic to hear .
The American people want an end to this war so badly .
If the politicians will not listen it is our duty as Americans to make them listen .
We owe it to our country and our troops to ensure that our members of Congress no longer allow themselves to be bullied by a coward like George W. Bush .
If Bush vetoes legislation for our troops and an end to the war Congress must shove it right back in his face .
We must act now while there is still a chance to make Congress do their job as a co-equal branch of government and start bringing this war to an end .
They need to be equally as defiant as Bush has been for the last 7 years and fight fire with fire when it comes to this President .
After all , that is what we elected them to do .
I will fight for an end to this war with my last breath .
We all must .

On 28 December 2004 , The Electronic Intifada featured an article , “ Boycott as Resistance : The Moral Dimension , ” by Omar Barghouti .
While Barghouti argues that the situation in Palestine is “ not identical to South Africa ; that it is more complex , more multi-dimensional and even more sinister , in some respect , ” he also acknowledges “ that a sufficient family resemblance between Israel and South Africa exists to grant advocating South Africa style remedies . ”
Barghouti furthermore reflects on the “ insurmountable hurdles ” that South Africans faced throughout the anti-apartheid struggle .
Finally , Barghouti argued that the “ militaristic establishment ” of Israel would eventually weaken , if it were systematically challenged , just as it was in South Africa .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said in 1989 , while the apartheid regime was still choking the South African people , “ I am a black South African , and if I were to change the names , a description of what is happening in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank could describe events in South Africa . ”
Years later South Africans that were involved in the anti-apartheid struggle paid visits to the occupied Palestinian territories .
They have remarked that the situation in Palestine is in many respects far worse than what they faced during the anti-apartheid struggle .
Comparisons between South Africa and Palestine / Israel are made by those who have experienced oppression : the denial of basic human rights , forceful territorial occupation , systematic socio-economic marginalization , planned assassinations , disregard for the rule of law ( including international law ) confrontation with an overwhelming police and military force , and the list of parallels goes on and on .
Apartheid is separation
Apartheid South Africa was politically , legally , economically and socially broken up along racial lines .
The South African citizens were categorized as “ white , ” “ African , ” “ Indian ” and “ colored . ” “ White ” South Africans were the most privileged people and the “ African ” South Africans the least .
The oppressed people of South Africa did not accept this division and instead talked about white and black South Africans , with blackness used to connote the shared suffering of , and a common solidarity amongst , all oppressed people .
The apartheid government ’s policies had many dimensions , oriented around the literal meaning of the word “ apartheid ” — separation .
This translated into separate living areas reserved for whites , Indians , coloreds and Africans .
Well - funded social projects and newly arrived immigrant programs were established for white South Africans , while a virtual vacuum in social services and a ban on immigration existed for black South Africans .
World - class hospitals were open to white South Africans , including one in Cape Town that performed the world ’s first heart replacement ; at the same time , a scarce number of filthy hospitals were the only ones available to black South Africans .
Larger prison cells were set aside for whites who generally received lower prison sentences , while more crowded prison cells were left for black South Africans who received higher prison sentences for the most petty of crimes .
At one stage even separate parliaments for the Indian and colored communities were created in response to pressure to give all South Africans a right to vote however , the “ African ” community was denied even this .
Separate “ countries ” were established for Africans but were only recognized by South Africa ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
These were known as “ Bantustans , ” or the absurdly euphemistic term “ homeland ” which were constituted by the so - called “ independent homelands ” ( e.g. Transkei and Venda ) and “ self=governing territories ” ( Kwa - Zulu ) .
At the height of apartheid , black South Africans occupied 13 percent of the land , with the rest occupied by white South Africans .
Influx control and “ pass books ”
Black South Africans were forced to carry so - called “ pass books ” ( identity documents ) that were used to control their movement within the so - called “ white South Africa , ” that is , areas outside the homelands .
This was a policy known as “ influx control . ”
Pass books were used to distinguish people on the basis of race , and therefore , ensure inequitable access to social services such as health care , education and more .
Failure to produce this document led to rampant harassment , including imprisonment and deportation of black South Africans .
Few black South Africans were permitted to hold a South African passport .
Sexual relations across the racial barrier meant criminal prosecution and even imprisonment for those concerned under the so - called Immorality Act .
These are only a few of many barbaric examples of racist apartheid policies , providing more than enough reason for protest and armed struggle , which after several decades of resistance , eventually formed into a broad - based , international anti-apartheid movement .
A rallying cry within the movement was “ Amandla Ngawethu ! ” ( Power to the People ! ) .
Difference in treatment
Where comparisons may be legitimately made with respect to the situation in Palestine are , for example , where people were treated differently , on the basis of arbitrary distinctions , with white South Africans granted privileges that were not extended to black South Africans .
At the same time , special sanctions were placed on the movement and activities of black South Africans , while white South Africans were virtually free from such restrictions ( unless they became politically involved ) .
While white South Africa under apartheid is comparable with what Israel is today , black South Africa and black South Africans under apartheid resembles the situation that most Palestinians in Israel , occupied Palestine and in refugee camps in the region are forced to live under today .
It is the massive land dispossession and disproportionate situation that has existed both for black South Africans and for Palestinians , reinforced by policies and actions designed to destroy their dignity , which have formed the primary motivators in both liberation struggles .
Drawing on experiences
Of course , this is not to say that there are not significant distinctions to be made .
The key to drawing relevantly on the experiences of previous liberation movements is choosing the proper perspective .
The perspective of most Israelis is fundamentally different from that of most Palestinians , as the perspective of most white South Africans was fundamentally different from that of black South Africans under apartheid .
The key to finding a successful political settlement may involve understanding the true nature of the divide and to use understanding that find bases for compromise on both sides .
As Dennis Brutus , former anti-apartheid campaigner and now professor in the USA , declared at the European Social Forum in London in 2004 :
“ Various campaigns against the apartheid regime had contributed to creating a climate of international awareness of the nature of the racist and oppressive system of apartheid and had led to general outrage and a demand for its international isolations .
Something similar should happen in the case of the Palestinian struggle . ”
Ultimately , it can be very useful to draw on the expertise of seasoned activists who worked to mobilize and influence popular sentiment towards the liberation of peoples in Southern Africa , and many other countries .
Much of this expertise / experience is still around and may be tapped into .
Indeed , some of those working today for Palestine were formerly involved in other solidarity movements .
Adri Nieuwhof and Jeff Handmaker are human rights advocates based in the Netherlands .
Bangani Ngeleza is a consultant based in South Africa .

So , the U.S. forces in the country have a wolf by the ear .
We can keep the level of violence reasonably contained as long as we stay there , but neither the armed forces nor the U.S. budget can afford to stay there indefinitely .
And to leave , we have to let go of the wolf .

You will remember that homeopaths and various other quacks are philosophically opposed to this process .
The results were spectacular : in three months , the incidence of blood infections from these IV lines fell by two - thirds , and over 18 months , the programme saved 1,500 lives and an estimated $ 200 m ( £ 102 m ) .
Then someone complained to the OHRP , because this was a research study , and they did not have ethics committee clearance .
The project was shut down .
This week , the OHRP grandly lifted its ban , explaining that now - since it turns out the research bit is over , and the hospitals are just putting the tick list into practice - they may tick away unhindered .
This is what we might call the " ethical paradox " .
You can do something as part of a treatment programme , entirely on a whim , and nobody will interfere , as long as it's not potty ( and even then you 'll probably be all right ) .
But the moment you do the exact same thing as part of a research programme , trying to see if it actually works or not , adding to the sum total of human knowledge , and helping to save the lives of people you 'll never meet , suddenly a whole bunch of people want to stick their beaks in .
Hilary Hearnshaw , a researcher at Warwick medical school , did an elegant study where she pretended to apply to do a medical research project in Israel , the UK , and 11 other countries in Europe .
She said she wanted to do a trial on a leaflet which was designed to help older patients get more engaged with their GP .
Only three countries required the project to go through a process of ethical approval , and in the UK this was more arduous than in any other country .
Getting ethical clearance took 10 weeks , required two submissions ( because they demanded changes ) , and five full days of administration , during which the proposal had to be reviewed by full committees , some of which required multiple copies of the application paperwork .
This is just the tip of the iceberg ( and I would always welcome more examples by email ) .
For one multicentre clinical trial , each of 125 local research ethics committees required between one and 21 copies of a protocol .
Ethics approval for another trial , involving 51 centres , required more than 25,000 pieces of paper , 62 hours of photocopying , and an average of 3.3 hours of investigator time for each centre .
You feel like you 're dying when administrators drag their heels .
In the case of medical research , when you delay research findings , and deter researchers from even bothering , people really are dying .
This wider harm seems to be a blindspot for the ethics committees , captivated by their own mission creep .
But it 's not the only ethical blindspot .
These regulations have their roots in the Nuremburg Code .
But while the world of clinicians and academics splits ethical hairs , with our eye off the ball , an elephant has walked into the room .
February has seen another string of prominent psychologists resigning from their membership of the American Psychological Association in disgust at its failure to take a stand on " abusive interrogation techniques " , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , and other activities which you might consider to be torture .
Psychologists are key to these interrogations and other activities , both in designing and enacting what I would rather not call " protocols " , out of compassion for the people on whom they are grimly enacted , in places cameras do not go .
APA members , trained , clinical professionals on its register , who have signed up to its codes of practice , now participate in these activities .
The APA 's response has been to specifically bend the codes of conduct to permit their actions , and to obfuscate .
Where 's your ethics committee now , science boy ?

ISLAMABAD , March 7 : Hund-reds of activists of Jamaat - i- Islami and Imamia Students Organisation on Friday held protest demonstrations against the re-production of sacrilegious caricatures in a Danish newspaper and release of an ‘ anti - Islam ’ film in Holland .
The protesters demanded Muslim countries in general and Pakistan in particular to sever diplomatic ties with both the countries and boycott all their products to force them to tender an official apology .
About three hundreds activists of ISO walked from Jamia Masjid Sector G - 6/2 and reached the Rawalpindi - Islamabad Press Club camp office chanting slogans against what they called Europe ’s anti- Islam policies .
The protesters were holding banners and waving placards against the two countries .
They were also chanting slogans like “ Down with Danish and Dutch governments ” and “ Down with USA and Israel ” .
The protesters also torched the flags of Denmark and Israel .
Addressing the demonstrators , Alama Akhtar Abbas , Khateeb Markazi Jamia Masjid ; Alama Amin Shahidi , Ali Komail Haider and others condemned the blasphemous acts by the Danish newspaper and release of the sacrilegious film in Holland .
They also termed the blasphemous acts a conspiracy against Islam .
The protesters called upon all political and religious parties and scholars to chalk out a policy to stop the Western propaganda against Islam .
They urged the government to send back the Danish ambassador in protest against the publication of the blasphemous caricatures .
Meanwhile , addressing protesters at Faisal Masjid , JI chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed condemned what he said the anti-Islam policies of the West .
However , he also spoke elaborately on domestic politics .
He said the people of Pakistan would reject the new political government if it failed to restore the pre-November judiciary and 1973 Constitution and bring a no-confidence move against President Musharraf .
He asked leaders of the political parties which won majority in the general elections to stop holding meetings with US officials .
He said the Pakistani people had given their verdict against the policies of the United States by electing anti-Musharraf people .
The real test of the political parties , he added , would begin when they would start reversing the unconstitutional steps of the previous government .
He also condemned the recent Israeli aggression against the Palestinians .
Yaqoob Malik from Attock adds : Hundreds of religious leaders and activists staged a protest demonstration against the publication of the blasphemous caricatures in the Danish newspaper .
The protest rally led by Maulana Mohammad Saddiq was taken out from Masjid Loharan after Friday prayers .
Later , the protesters gathered at Fowara Chowk where they burnt an effigy of US President George Bush .
The speakers asked the West to initiate action against such newspapers beside tendering unequivocal apology , so that no one can take liberty to print blasphemous material under the guise of press freedom .
Dodd Endorses Obama , Rules Out Veepstakes Dodd tells ABC
News he has no interest in the second slot on the ticket .
Feb. 26 , 2008  --
It 's looking more and more likely that Sen. Barack Obama , should he win the Democratic presidential nomination , will be searching for a running mate who can help him overcome any doubts about " the experience issue " — but Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , says that he is not up for the job .
Today in Cleveland , Dodd became the first of the original 2008 presidential contenders to endorse Obama .
Dodd told ABC
News he has no interest in the second slot on the Democratic ticket .
" Who would want to be vice president ? "
Dodd chuckled .
" I 'd rather be chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
" It 's now the hour to come together , " Dodd said , in an appearance with Obama at a news conference in Cleveland .
" This is the moment for Democrats and independents and others to come together , to get behind this candidacy . "
Dodd said he called Clinton last night to inform her of his decision to endorse Obama ahead of Tuesday night 's debate .
Dodd described it as an awkward phone call to make .
" She was as gracious as she could be , " he said , noting she was " obviously disappointed , maybe even something beyond disappointment , " but that she appreciated the call .
" I said I did n't want you to hear it from the media , I want you to hear it from me .
She said , ' I really appreciate that ' . "
Dodd said he would never presume to pressure Clinton to step aside , should she lose next Tuesday 's primaries in Ohio and Texas , but he expressed his hope that the party will soon rally around Obama as its standard bearer .
As for tonight 's debate , the 20th — and final — scheduled debate in the nominating process , Obama told reporters that he 's ready for it .
But he acknowledged the debate format has not always suited him best .
" My staff used to kid me that it took me 60 seconds to clear my throat , " he said .
" Brevity and succinctness is something I 've tried to work on in this debate process , and I think I 've gotten better at it . "
Obama said he has also come to realize that the debates are as much a conversation with the voters as they are a sparring match between two candidates .
" You do n't want to go too much into the weeds , " he said .
The wave of baby boomers hitting retirement age threatens to create such a void in the workforce that states are crafting policies and programs to keep older Americans working and volunteering .
Five states have launched initiatives aimed at getting the most out of the experience and skills of older Americans .
Another eight are working with the National Governors Association to study ways to keep boomers in the labor market as volunteers or part - time workers .
TURNING 62 : Boomers ' eagerness to retire could cost them It 's a major shift in public policy in a nation that has treated the aging of 79 million boomers as a likely drain on social and entitlement programs .
The oldest turn 62 this year .
" People are now saying that they want to and need to continue to work , " says John Gomperts , president of Civic Ventures , a non-profit think tank that just wrote a report on states leading the call to engage boomers .
" The aging of America might turn out to be something good for individuals and communities across the country . "
What some are doing : • Arizona , where more than a quarter of the population in several counties is older than 60 , launched the Mature Workforce Initiative .
This spring , azmatureworkers.com will provide online listings of paid and volunteer work .
The program also will highlight businesses deemed " mature - worker friendly " and change state government retirement policies to allow greater flexibility .
• California , where the 60 - plus population will almost double to 8.7 million by 2020 , faces labor shortages in the public sector .
During the next 10 years , the state will need 33,000 new math and science teachers .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sherry Lansing , former CEO of Paramount Pictures , launched the EnCorps Teachers Program .
The corporate - sponsored effort is designed to entice boomers into teaching .
" There are plenty of crack math and science potential teachers retiring from corporations , " says former senator Harris Wofford , D - Pa. , who is working with states on boomer initiatives for Experience Wave .
• Maryland passed the Baby Boomer Initiative Act , New York the Mature Worker Task Force and Massachusetts the Coalition on Vital Aging .
• The National Governors Association is working with Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Maine , New Mexico , Ohio and Wyoming in a year - long program to find ways to tap skills of older workers .
" Not everybody has three pensions and an IRA plan , " says Melanie Starns , the Arizona governor 's policy adviser on aging .
" A lot of people actually need the work to survive , and others who have more time do n't want to just stuff envelopes and answer phones . "
Adds Wofford : " We 're retiring the concept of retirement . "

Pteropod mollusc , Limacina helicina .
As oceans warm and become more acidic , ocean creatures are undergoing severe stress and entire food webs are at risk .
The information was presented by scientists at a press briefing on February 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston .
Gretchen Hofmann , associate professor of biology at the University of California , Santa Barbara , has just returned from a research mission to Antarctica where she collected pteropods , tiny marine snails the size of a lentil , that she refers to as the " potato chip " of the oceans because they are eaten widely by so many species .
The National Science Foundation 's Office of Polar Programs funded the expedition .
Pteropods are eaten by fish that are in turn consumed by other animals , such as penguins .
As these small creatures are stressed by an increasingly acidic ocean , due to the build - up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , they are less able to cope with a warmer ocean .
" These animals are not charismatic but they are talking to us just as much as penguins or polar bears , " said Hofmann .
" They are harbingers of change .
It 's possible by 2050 they may not be able to make a shell anymore .
If we lose these organisms , the impact on the food chain will be catastrophic . "
Hofmann is a molecular ecologist who studies how genes go off and on as certain marine animals work to make their calcium carbonate shells from the seawater they live in .
She characterized her recent trip to Antarctica as an urgent research mission .
She has performed extensive studies of the sea urchin that lives in the kelp forests of California .
Sea urchins are a vital part of the food web and play a major economic role in California fisheries , since the roe of the sea urchin is a valuable sushi called " uni . "
Hofmann explained that as marine invertebrates deal with increasing acidity , the larvae have to " re-tune " their metabolism in order to still make a shell .
But this is done at a cost .
The physiological changes that are a response to the acidity make the animals less able to withstand warmer waters , and they are smaller .
" These observations suggest that the ‘ double jeopardy ' situation –– warming and acidifying seas –– will be a complex environment for future marine organisms , " she said .
Hofmann is studying levels of carbon dioxide that would result from what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicts would occur if humanity continues on a " business as usual " scenario projected out to the year 2100 .

The Woman Never Lies Myth Frank S. Zepezauer * ABSTRACT : Empirical evidence does not support the widespread belief that women are extremely unlikely to make false accusations of male sexual misconduct .
Rather the research on accusations of rape , sexual harassment , incest , and child sexual abuse indicates that false accusations have become a serious problem .
The motivations involved in making a false report are widely varied and include confusion , outside influence from therapists and others , habitual lying , advantages in custody disputes , financial gain , and the political ideology of radical feminism .
Male sexual misconduct  rape , incest , stalking , sexual harassment , child molestation , pornography trafficking  has , according to some observers , become a problem so big that it demands a big solution , not only the reform of our legal system but of our entire society .
Yet the increasingly heated debate over this crisis has focused primarily on how these misbehaviors are defined and how often they occur .
The estimated numbers keep mounting .
We hear that perhaps 31 million women are suffering from some form of rape , 41 million from harassment , 58 million from child sexual abuse , and all 125 million of them  from toddlers to grandmothers  from a toxic " rape culture " that suffocates the feminine spirit .
Much less discussed is how often an allegation of male sexual misconduct is false .
The question seldom enters the debate because , presumably , it had long ago been settled .
Pennsylvania State Law Professor Philip Jenkins ( 1993 ) , in a review of the " feminist jurisprudence " which leads the sex crisis counterattack , reports that in response to the question its proponents have established an " unchallengeable orthodoxy . "
It is that " women did not lie about such victimization , never lied , not out of personal malice , not from mental instability or derangement " ( p.19 ) .
Jenkins is not the first to cite this will to believe .
Wendy Kaminer ( 1993 ) reported that " it is a primary article of faith among many feminists that women do n't lie about rape , ever ; they lack the dishonesty gene " ( p.67 ) .
Eight years earlier , in 1985 , John O'Sullivan discovered a widespread defense of the belief that " no woman would fabricate a rape charge " ( p.22 ) .
Feminists themselves admit as much .
Law Professor Susan Estrich stated that " the whole effort at reforming rape laws has been an attack on the premise that women who bring complaints are suspect " ( Newsweek , 1985 , p.61 ) .
Some feminists believe that even defending that premise is a sex crime .
Alan Dershowitz ( 1993 ) reports that he was accused of sexual harassment for discussing in class the possibility of false rape allegations .
Believing the self - proclaimed victim of sexual misconduct has thus evolved from ideological conviction to legal doctrine and , in some jurisdictions , into law .
California now requires that jurors be explicitly told that a rape conviction can be based on the accuser 's testimony alone , without corroboration ( Associated Press , 1992 ; Farrell , 1993 ) .
Canada is proposing that a man accused of rape must demonstrate that he received the willing consent of a sexual partner .
These new rules rest on the assumption that women do not lie because they have no motive to lie .
Consequently , as Jenkins ( 1993 ) states , the question of the " victim 's credibility " has now become " crucial . "
Is that credibility warranted , particularly as feminist jurisprudence would want it established , as nearly automatic ?
Not if we consult recent history .
And if we do , we will find that we do indeed face a sexual misconduct crisis , but not the one radical feminists now insist is ubiquitous in our society .
False Accusations of Rape Begin with evidence of false accusation of rape , the crime which has become not only the metaphor for all cases of sexual misconduct but for male sexuality itself .
Alan Dershowitz ( 1991 ) , for example , has further harassed his students by telling them that an annual F.B.I. survey of 1600 law enforcement agencies discovered that 8 % of rape charges are completely unfounded .
That figure , which has held steadily over the past decade , is moreover at least twice as high as for any other felony .
Unfounded charges of assault , which like rape is often productive of conflicting testimony , comprise only 1.6 % of the total compared to the 8.4 % recorded for rape .
Consult also a recent development , DNA testing , which is now becoming routine in rape investigations ( Krajik , 1993 ) .
Also routine is the discovery that a third of the DNA scans produce non-matches .
Consequently , a growing number of men are not only gaining acquittals but are also being released from prison .
As with all rape statistics , these figures need careful scrutiny .
Police investigators warn , for example , that a mismatch proves innocence only when the DNA could have come from no one but the assailant and its profile or makeup does n't match the suspect's .
Even so , the DNA tests , primarily a prosecutorial weapon , have now been added to the arsenal of defense attorneys , and more evidence of false allegation is appearing .
Although useful , the F.B.I. and DNA data on sex crimes result from unstructured number gathering .
More informative , therefore , are the results of a focused study of the false allegation question undertaken by a team headed by Charles P McDowell ( McDowell & Hibler , 1985 ) of the U.S. Air Force Special Studies Division .
Its significance derives not only from its scholarly credentials but also its time of origin , 1984 / 85 , a period during which rape had emerged as a major issue , but before its definition included almost any form of non-consensual sex .
The McDowell team studied 556 rape allegations .
Of that total , 256 could not be conclusively verified as rape .
That left 300 authenticated cases of which 220 were judged to be truthful and 80 , or 27 % , were judged as false .
In his report Charles McDowell stated that extra rigor was applied to the investigation of potentially false allegations .
To be considered false one or more of the following criteria had to be met : the victim unequivocally admitted to false allegation , indicated deception in a polygraph test , and provided a plausible recantation .
Even by these strict standards , slightly more than one out of four rape charges were judged to be false .
The McDowell report has itself generated controversy even though , when rape is a frequent media topic , it is not widely known .
Its calculations are no doubt problematic enough to raise serious questions .
If , out of 556 rape allegations , 256 could not be conclusively verified as rape , then a large number , 46 % , entered a gray area within which more than a few , if not all , of the accusations could have been authentic .
If so , the 27 % false allegation figure obtained from the remaining 300 cases could be badly skewed .
Moreover , the study itself focused on a possibly non-representative population of military personnel .
The McDowell team did in fact address these questions in follow - up studies .
They recruited independent reviewers who were given 25 criteria derived from the profiles of the women who openly admitted making a false allegation .
If all three reviewers agreed that the rape allegation was false , it was then listed by that description .
The result : 60 % of the accusations were identified as false .
McDowell also took his study outside the military by examining police files from a major midwestern and a southwestern city .
He found that the finding of 60 % held ( Farrell , 1993 , pp. 321-329 ) .
McDowell 's data have received qualified confirmation from other investigators .
A survey of seven Washington , D.C. area jurisdictions in the 1991 / 2 period , for example , revealed that an average of 24 % of rape charges were unfounded ( Buckley , 1992 ) .
A recently completed study of a small midwestern city was reported by Eugene J. Kanin ( 1994 ) of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Purdue University .
Kanin concluded that " false rape allegations constitute 41 % of the total forcible rape cases reported during this period " ( p.81 ) .
Kanin provides significant confirmation of McDowell 's findings in several ways .
Kanin 's subject , for example , covered a nine - year period  1978 - 87  during which rape had become a highly - politicized issue .
Members of the police department from which the data was taken were therefore sensitive to the kinds of misperceptions about which parties to the dispute had complained .
The city offered a relatively useful model : free of the unrepresentative populations found in resort areas , remote from the extreme crime conditions plaguing large communities , small enough to allow careful investigation of suspicious allegations , but large enough to produce a useful sample of 109 cases .
The investigators also separated " unfounded " from " false " rape allegations , a distinction sometimes blurred in other reports .
Moreover , among the strict guidelines used to determine an allegation 's unreliability was McDowell 's requirement that only unambiguous recantations be used .
Equally revealing were addenda following Kanin 's basic report .
They reported studies in two large Midwestern state universities which covered a three - year period ending in 1988 .
The finding of the combined studies was that among a total of 64 reported rapes exactly 50 % were false .
Kanin found these results significant because the women in the main report tended to gather in the lower socioeconomic levels , thus raising questions about correlations of false allegation with income and educational status .
After checking figures gathered from university police departments , he therefore reported that " quite unexpectedly then , we find that these university women , when filing a rape complaint , were as likely to file a false as a valid charge . "
In addition , Kanin cited still another source ( Jay , 1991 ) which supported findings of high frequency false allegations in the universities .
On the basis of these studies , Kanin felt it reasonable to conclude that " false rape accusations are not uncommon " ( p.90 ) .
Sexual Harassment Alan Dershowitz 's experience with an esoteric definition of sexual harassment also raises questions about false allegations in this newly - defined but widely publicized crime .
Skeptical checking has revealed that , as with rape , the percentage of unfounded accusations of sexual harassment may reach astonishingly high levels .
That was the claim of Randy Daniels , whose confirmation for New York City 's Deputy Mayor was almost derailed by a sexual harassment charge he was able to refute .
To see whether his experience was relatively rare , Daniels checked with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
He found that in 1991 , the EEOC investigated or mediated 2119 cases of sexual harassment and found that 59 % were determined to have no cause ( Daniels , 1993 , p. 1 ) .
Since the Hill / Thomas affair they have gone up sharply  up 64 % in one year  but so have false allegations , remaining steadily in the plus 50 % range .
Child Sexual Abuse
This rape and sexual harassment pattern  expanding definitions , rapidly increasing accusations , intensely politicized publicity campaigns , and significantly high percentages of false allegations  has also appeared in still another arena , the agencies which deal with the sexual molestation of children .
With this kind of sexual misconduct the credibility of a third party , the child , becomes a factor , and we hear , in addition to appeals to " believe the woman " an appeal to " believe the child . "
We are now learning that children can be manipulated into supplying dramatic testimony of sexual abuse and that in most cases the accusation originates not with the child but with the mother .
Thus the question of credibility once again focuses on women .
As one lawyer put it , " For a lot of these people ' believe the child ' is just code .
What they really mean is , ' believe the woman , no questions asked " ' ( Stein , 1992 , p. 160 ) .
To keep this issue in perspective , note three significant facts .
The first is that of the 2,700,000 cases of child abuse reported every year less than 10 % involve serious physical abuse and only 8 % involve alleged sexual abuse ( Schultz , 1989 ) .
The second is that , contrary to the male victimizer / female victim paradigm of feminist ideology , at least as many boys as girls are victimized by child abuse , if not more .
The third is that the majority of child abusers are women , that the most dangerous environment for a child is a home formed by a single mother and her boyfriend , and the safest is formed by a married mother and a husband who is the child 's biological father .
1
In many cases allegations of child sexual abuse occur in a nasty divorce made nastier by a custody fight .
It is now so common that it has received scholarly attention and its own acronym , S.A.I.D. ( Sexual Allegations in Divorce ) .
The consensus is that in " S.A.I.D. syndrome " cases the number of such allegations increased so rapidly  up from 7 to 30 % in the eighties  that one scholarly team called it an " explosion . "
Others , noting how often the guilt of the accused was assumed , used the word " hysteria " and searched for analogies in the Salem and the McCarthy witch hunts ( Stein , 1992 ) .
Another consensus is being reached : that the majority of these allegations are false .
Melvin Guyer , Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan , reports that " in highly contested custody cases where the allegation is made , a number of researchers have found the allegations to be false or unsubstantiated in anywhere from 60 to 80 % of those cases " ( Felten , 1991 ) .
Another investigative team stated that of 200 cases they studied " about three - fourths have ultimately been adjudicated as no abuse " ( Felten , 1991 ) .
Some studies have come in with a lower but still significant estimate .
For example , a 1988 study by the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts said that sexual molestation charges in divorces are probably false one - third of the time ( Dvorchak , 1992 ) .
Allegations of child abuse , both divorce related and in general , are flying out so frequently that those who believe themselves victimized by false charges have organized a nationwide support group , VOCAL ( Victims Of Child Abuse Laws ) , which now includes 80 local chapters .
This group refers its members to both informal and professional counsel , sends out a newsletter , and offers access to a rapidly expanding data base .
In 1989 , its summary of relevant statistics cited 23 studies which reported findings on both sexual and non-sexual child abuse .
Among these , the lowest assessment of false allegation was 35 % , the highest 82 % , averaging at 66 % .
Recovered Memories
Those joining VOCAL are finding that an even more dramatic form of child abuse allegation is now sweeping the country .
It originates with a " recovered memory " of sexual atrocity , often involving incest or satanic ritual abuse , usually made by an adult daughter against her father , and almost always discovered in therapy .
This form of allegation made the headlines when celebrities such as Roseanne Arnold , La Toya Jackson , and Suzanne Sommers declared they had suddenly remembered a long repressed victimization .
It is also claiming celebrities among the accused , most notably Cardinal Bernardin of the Roman Catholic Church , which was however later recanted .
In such cases the question of credibility applies not only to the accuser or accused but also to the therapist as well as the therapeutic technique and its supporting theory .
Because cases of recovered memory of abuse have surfaced relatively recently , skeptical criticism is just now beginning to appear in the media although the underlying issues have been under debate for decades .
One result has been the formation of an organization whose title already makes an assertion , the False Memory Syndrome Foundation .
Thus to VOCAL we can add FMSF among the acronyms coined in response to the false allegation problem .
It appears to be widespread .
The FMSF reported that within two years of its founding in 1991 , it had built a file of 12,000 families who believed themselves victimized by accusations prompted by false memories .
Eleanor Goldstein ( Goldstein & Farmer , 1992 ) estimates that the actual number of involved families reaches into the tens of thousands .
She also cites data from the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse on the highly inflated estimates of victimization .
Contrary to statements that one in four women have been abused prior to the age of 18 , retrospective surveys reveal great variations , from 6 to 62 % , which means , Goldstein says , " that we do n't have any valid statistics at all " ( p.2 ) .
How many of those reports of remembered child abuse , whether in the high or low range , were false ?
Several sources suggest that they may match figures on false allegations in reports of rape and sexual harassment .
The National Center for Child Abuse reported that false allegations , which were 35 % of all claims in 1975 , had by 1993 reached 60 % ( FMSF Newsletter , 1993 ) .
Other sources suggest that the kind of child abuse caused by satanic ritual cults is almost totally a myth .
There may be a satan and he may have followers but , contrary to widely held belief in the mid-eighties , they did not surface all over middle America .
Where accusations actually led to trials , as in Jordan , Minnesota and in Los Angeles in the McMartin Preschool Case , prosecutors suffered embarrassing defeats .
An extensive New Yorker report of a Washington State case reveals that at least one conviction was indeed achieved .
However , after a careful analysis of the facts , the writer concludes that it was a grievous miscarriage of justice , one more ghastly example of the recovered memory theory gone amok ( Wright , 1993 ) .
With regard to recovered memory cases which do not involve satanism , other indications point to a high number of false allegations .
A strong phalanx of professional opinion has raised significant doubts about the veracity of long repressed memories even within a carefully disciplined therapeutic context .
For that reason emphatic warnings are now being issued against their being used in a courtroom  not to mention a press conference  without persuasive corroboration , which , it appears , is often missing .
Some mental health experts make the point more pungently .
Dr. Paul Fink , head of Psychiatry at Albert Einstein Medical Center said , " If a therapist says 70 to 80 % of patients remember abuse , I say the therapist ought to be a shoemaker " ( Sifford , 1992 ) .
Dr. Richard Ofshe , a member of the FMSF professional advisory board who exposed the proliferating fallacies in the Washington State case , stated that " the incidence of cases in which repressed memories correspond with facts about abuse is as common as Siamese twins joined at the head " ( Brzustowicz & Csicsery , 1993 , p.8 ) .
Motivations of Accusers Even so , reasonable doubts about a woman 's veracity in all these often sensationalized sexual misconduct cases do not necessarily mean that she has deliberately lied .
She may , for example , have suffered from confusion , a problem now proliferating as the definition for sex crimes becomes increasingly complicated and inclusive , leaving all parties struggling with questions about definition and propriety .
Or she may have been affected by emotional instability or mental illness , which one study reported was a factor in 75 % of false allegation in divorce cases ( Wakefield & Underwager , 1990 ) .
In some cases a woman or her defenders might exaggerate a misdemeanor into a felony or , as happened in Washington state , translate bad parenting into sexual misconduct .
In addition , there has been a tendency to emphasize what a victim felt rather than what happened .
Thus , a woman can truthfully say she felt raped , abused or harassed by behavior which is actually non-criminal .
Moreover , the woman 's feelings are often influenced by outside parties with whom she has confided  friends , family members , social workers , therapists , clergymen , rape counselors , lawyers , political activists  any of whom can interpret her emotion as a sign of felonious abuse .
With regard to recovered memory , evidence published by the FMS Foundation suggests that the woman may be as much victimized by therapy or by recovery movement " enthusiasm as by a perpetrator hidden in her subconscious .
Ericka Ingram , the primary accuser in the Washington State case , had come under the influence of both secular and religious counselors .
Their intrusive encouragement helped to loosen a flood of wild charges she leveled against her father and mother as well as two of her father 's colleagues .
These realizations have led to an increasing number of lawsuits now being filed by former patients against incompetent or overzealous therapists .
By the same token , among the divorcing wives who file sexual molestation charges against their husbands are some who have been coached by self - serving lawyers .
Columnist Barbara Amiel ( 1989 ) stated that " a lawyer is coming close to negligence if he does not advise a client that in child custody cases and property disputes , the mere mention of a child abuse allegation is a significant asset " ( p.25 ) .
In The Morning After , Katie Roiphe ( 1993 ) reported still another cause of false allegations : political passions generated by activities such as the " Take Back the Night " marches .
She tells about " Mindy " who so wanted to be a " part of this blanket warmth , this woman - centered nonhierarchical empowered notion " that she was " willing to lie " ( pp. 40 - 41 ) .
A similar story was told by a Stanford University professor whose daughter was , he claimed , behind a conspiracy to murder him .
He testified that he had had a good relationship with her until she attended an anti-rape rally .
" She appeared to have gotten swept up ... and was experiencing great emotional distress " ( Wykes , 1993 ) .
These mitigating circumstances have often softened the judgment of authorities who confront women guilty of misrepresentation .
In the Washington D.C. area , for example , police send women who lied about rape not to the court room but to a counseling center .
The Princeton woman who accused a fellow student suffered no more than an obligation to write a public apology .
Because of these sometimes compelling reasons for a departure from the truth , many officials hesitate to call a woman a liar .
But it appears , some women with little or no evidence do not hesitate to call a man a rapist .
It also appears that more than a few of them have in fact knowingly and willfully lied .
Regardless of the influences working on Ericka Ingram , for example , there came a point when the evidence openly confounded her story , leaving her with the choice either to persist or recant .
Because she not only persisted but further embellished her story , Richard Ofshe called her an " habitual liar " ( Wright , 1993 , p.69 ) .
Whether Anita Hill lied about Clarence Thomas still cannot be determined , but David Brock demonstrated that in several other matters she had indeed lied .
And as Charles P. McDowell and other rape allegation researchers have discovered , at least one out of four women in their study population have openly admitted to having lied .
Such disclosures should encourage skepticism toward the now widely held belief that , in accusations of sexual misconduct , women never lie .
The same skepticism should be activated when we hear its supporting explanation : that filing such a charge is so painful that only a truthful woman would proceed .
That belief , although equally strong , is equally suspect .
The research that revealed how many sexual misconduct allegations are false has also revealed how often these unfounded accusations are strongly motivated .
The clearest example of compelling motive can be found in the Sexual Allegation in Divorce ( S.A.I.D. ) syndrome .
In such cases questionable allegations multiply because the accuser has far more to gain than to lose .
Simply charging a divorcing spouse with child molestation  or wife battering or spousal rape  can turn a hot but evenly balanced custody battle into a rout .
In many cases , the accused husband must vacate what had been the " family " home and submit to prolonged alienation from his children .
He also finds himself ensnared by both the criminal justice and the social service bureaucracies whose conflicting rules of evidence can deny him the presumption of innocence .
In a process that only a Kafka can describe , he must then devote his resources to defending himself rather than pursuing the original divorce litigation .
Even then he may find himself in jail or in court ordered therapy while his accuser has won de facto custody not only of the children but of the house .
Should he eventually win vindication , a process which can literally take years , he may enjoy at best a hollow victory which leaves him financially and emotionally drained , nursing a permanently injured reputation and functioning as an " absent " father with a sparse schedule of controlled visits .
It is no wonder , then , that to express the reality commentators have sometimes used dramatic language , such as " the ultimate weapon " or the " atom bomb . "
The impressive results that are so often easily achieved with false allegations in custody disputes suggest the kind of temptations women may feel in other situations .
Among those found to have lied about rape or sexual harassment , for example , a number of motivations have been identified .
The McDowell report listed those they uncovered in declining order of appearance .
" Spite or revenge " and " to compensate for feelings of guilt or shame " accounted for 40 % of such allegations ( Farrell , 1993 , p. 325 ) .
A small percentage were attributed to " mental / emotional disorder or attempted extortion . "
In all cases , then , the falsely alleging woman had any of several strong motives to lie .
But , as with the S.A.I.D. syndrome , the most common motive was anger , an emotion which prompts more than a few embattled women to reach for " the ultimate weapon .
Although money gained through extortion ranked low among the motives for false rape allegations , it appears to rank higher when sexual harassment claims prove to be unfounded .
A casual survey of some of the suits that have been filed suggests why .
In the eighties , successful claims often brought damages in the $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 range .
After the explosion ignited by the Hill / Thomas case , not only the number of claims but damage awards have skyrocketed .
A clothing store cashier successfully sued her employer for $ 500,000 .
Employees of Stroh 's Brewery claimed that the company 's commercials , which showed the " Swedish Bikini Team , " constituted harassment and sued for damages ranging between $ 350,000 and $ 550,000 .
In the famous locker room harassment case , Lisa Olson was reported to have received a settlement ranging between $ 250,00 and $ 700,000 .
Damage claims  and awards  in the millions are becoming more common .
In some cases which were later proved to be false , the financial stakes were particularly high .
One lawyer was charged with coaching six of his clients to " embellish or lie " about some of the incidents on which they based a sexual harassment case .
They had asked for $ 487,000 ( Gonzales , 1993 ) .
Eleven women from the Miss Black America Pageant , after claiming that Mike Tyson had touched them on their rears , filed a $ 607 million lawsuit against him .
Several of the contestants later admitted they had lied in the hope of getting publicity and cashing in on the award money which would have given them around $ 20 million each ( Farrell , 1993 , p.328 ) .
But where extortion does appear , the motivation may be political as well as monetary not only in particular cases but in the growth of the entire sexual misconduct crisis .
Whether it is rape or sexual harassment or divorce - related child molestation or recovered incest memory , many of the investigators eventually mention the influence of ideological feminism .
Katie Roiphe , for example , found feminist politics at work in the phony rape story invented by Mindy , the imaginative Princeton co-ed .
Norman Podhoretz , who wrote about " Rape in Feminist Eyes , " attributes the current over - publicized obsession with rape to " the influence of man-hating elements within the ( women's ) movement ( which ) has grown so powerful as to have swept all before it " ( 1992 , p.29 ) .
As far back as 1985 John Sullivan attributed the overheated denial of false accusation to attempts to defend the " feminist theory of rape . "
And Philip Jenkins ( 1993 ) , who reported the trend toward automatically - assumed female credibility , stated that it was part of a larger campaign to establish " feminist jurisprudence . "
Whatever their motivations in particular cases , there is little doubt that ideological feminists have achieved significant political gains from publicizing the sexual misconduct crisis .
Lisa Olson 's feelings of harassment may for example have been genuine , but as the focus for a prolonged media event that established for female reporters an access to locker rooms it was as unpopular with the general public as it was with male athletes .
The real Anita Hill may or may not have been lying , but the Hill / Thomas affair propelled sexual harassment into a hot issue that rapidly generated a subindustry of scholars , consultants , and bureaucrats , prompted a " Year of the Woman " campaign that helped several women into congress , and revived a flagging women 's movement .
The same spectacular results may follow from the Tailhook Scandal , which , like Hill / Thomas , is raising serious questions about motive and credibility .
Whether Paula Coughlin 's testimony will become as clouded as Anita Hill 's , her whistle - blowing has already scuttled the careers of a still growing number of naval officers , not to mention the Secretary of the Navy himself , intensified in - service anti-sexual harassment campaigns , reinforced an already strong feminist presence in the armed forces , and helped soften the military 's granitic opposition to women in combat .
These incidents also helped to power a " Violence Against Women " bill through congress which will channel still more millions of government money into women 's programs , not to mention winning congressional validation of feminist jurisprudence .
That 's a lot of political gain achieved by the words of a few women who suffered little more than an affront to their sensibilities .
Conclusions
This growing gap  between the anguish suffered by the victims of traditionally - defined sex crimes and what is suffered by victims of ideologically - defined crimes  suggests that the crisis we face is not the result of a sexual misconduct epidemic but of the crisis mentality itself , an ever more hysterical vision of a " rape culture . "
It has a foundation in reality .
In what has become a ritual disclaimer , those who have exposed the surprising number of false allegations of sexual misconduct have also admitted the appalling number of genuine accusations .
And those who have attacked the incompetence , self - interest , and zealotry that has denied the extent of false allegation have also recognized the courage and energy that has exposed the problem of honest allegation begging vainly for belief .
They have therefore applauded the effort to seek for this long ignored injustice both social and legal remediation .
But that effort , carried too far and exploited too often , has generated another gap : between our awareness of the now highly visible victims of sexual misconduct and the almost invisible victims of false allegation .
The lesser known victims have their own stories to tell , enough to reveal another long ignored injustice that demands remediation .
False allegations of sexual misconduct have deprived a rapidly growing number of men and women of their reputations , their fortunes , their children , their livelihood , and their freedom ; have wasted the time and money of countless tax - supported agencies ; have destroyed not only individuals but entire families and communities ; and have left some so desperate that they have taken their lives .
For that reason , in the current revision of our sexual misconduct code , we must retain as a guiding premise the realization that women can lie because we know that , for several reasons , more than a few women have lied , more often than researchers into false allegation had expected , far more often than " rape culture " ideologues have admitted ... too often , in any event , to be ignored by our jurisprudence , feminist or otherwise .
Endnote 1 .
These assertions are themselves widely disputed .
However , one of the most extensive studies on the subject , by Strauss and Gelles ( 1990 ) reports that for physical abuse , the rate is higher for mothers than for fathers : 17.7 % for mothers vs. 10.1 % for fathers .
They found that preteen boys are slightly more likely to be abused than their sisters but that the pattern changes alter puberty .
Strauss and Gelles , however , also refer to some contravening studies that show higher rates for fathers .
Susan Steinmetz ( 1977/78 ) who has collaborated with Strauss and Gelles , reported independently that " mothers abused children 62 % more often than fathers , and that male children were more than twice as likely to suffer physical injury " ( p.499 ) .
David C. Morrow ( 1993 ) reports : " Drawing upon reports of the American Humane Association , the Association of Juvenile Courts , the National Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse , and the FBI 's 1978 crime report , John Rossler of Equal Rights for Fathers of New York State estimated that mothers commit over two - thirds of all child abuse , 80 % of it in sole custody and none in joint custody situations , while boyfriends and new husbands perpetrate most of the rest .
A similar study conducted a few years earlier in Utah by Ken Pangborn showed abuse 37 % higher among single mothers than the general population and 67 % of all abuse in the doing of women of whom 80 % are single mothers . "
Diane Russell ( 1986 ) reports that of adult women in San Francisco who reported one or more experiences of incestuous abuse , overall 4.5 % were abused by a father ( biological , step , foster or adoptive ) .
But the abuse was much more likely to occur with a stepfather .
Russell reports that 17 % of the women who were raised by a stepfather were abused by him compared to 2 % of the women who were raised by a biological father .
This indicates the greater risk to a girl of growing up in a household without her biological father .
Thomas Fleming ( 1986 ) cites a Canadian study that concluded that preschoolers were 40 times as likely to be abused in broken and illegitimate families as compared to those in intact two - parent families .
The consensus thus appears to support the assertion that child abuse is much more common in single parent families or families missing the biological father , that women are more often the abusers , and that male children are more often the victims .

Bush :
What we asked telecoms to do was legal David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday February 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This President Bush continued Monday to press for Congress to retroactively excuse alleged lawbreaking by the nation 's telecommunications companies , and he repeated questionable allegations that Democrats ' refusal to pass a surveillance law has endangered the country .
Although he previously admitted that America 's telcos helped the government eavesdrop on its citizens , Bush returned to referencing companies " believed to have assisted " his warrantless wiretapping program when he spoke from the White House Monday .
He did insist , though , that whatever the government required the companies to do was within the law .
" Our government told them that their participation was necessary , and it was and still is , " Bush said .
" What we asked them to do was legal , and now they 're getting sued for billions of dollars . "
Telephone and Internet providers like AT&T , Verizon and SBC are facing about 40 lawsuits from customers who say their privacy was violated as part of Bush 's " Terrorist Surveillance Program " he says began after 9/11 .
Only if they are found to have violated privacy laws would these companies face the " billions of dollars " in penalties Bush warned against .
The House allowed a temporary expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act expire earlier this month because of an immunity provision included in a permanent measure they were asked to approve .
Bush has claimed the expiration of that bill , the Protect America Act , has weakened the country 's intelligence infrastructure , although he promised to veto any measure without telecom immunity .
" To put it bluntly , if the enemy is calling into America , we really need to know what they 're saying , and we need to know what they 're thinking , and we need to know who they 're talking to , " Bush said before a meeting with governors from across the US Monday .
Democratic leaders hit back at what they said were Bush 's " scare tactics and political games , " in a Washington Post op - ed Monday .
" First , our country did not " go dark " on Feb. 16 when the Protect America Act ( PAA ) expired .
Despite President Bush 's overheated rhetoric on this issue , the government 's orders under that act will last until at least August .
These orders could cover every known terrorist group and foreign target .
No surveillance stopped .
If a new member of a known group , a new phone number or a new e-mail address is identified , U.S. intelligence can add it to the existing orders , and surveillance can begin immediately , " wrote Sens.
Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Reps. Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) and John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
The four lawmakers , who chair the judiciary and intelligence committees in the House and Senate , said FISA is plenty powerful enough to keep the country safe .
The accused Bush of employing " ' sky is falling ' rhetoric " to distract voters .
" But if our nation were to suddenly become vulnerable , it would not be because we do n't have sufficient domestic surveillance powers , " they wrote .
" It would be because the Bush administration has done too little to defeat al - Qaeda , which has reconstituted itself in Pakistan and gained strength throughout the world .
Many of our intelligence assets are being used to fight in Iraq instead of taking on Osama bin Laden and the al - Qaeda organization that attacked us on Sept. 11 and that wants to attack us again . "

My recent post on how not to manage geeks has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of great comments .
Right now there ’s a very interesting debate going on in the comments about the need for structure in small or large organizations .
This debate is great because it goes right to the core of the central dilemma of new leadership and employee empowerment .
Here are some of the key arguments that have come up :
Elling writes : I think you re attacking structures which you can do without in a small company …
In a large company theres a NEED for the structures …
Jeremy writes : I can anticipate some of this need – the need to account for diverse costs accurately and thoroughly , the need to maintain a standard of output for workers in an organized , fair fashion , etc. – but these play to the weaknesses of large organizations .
In other words , large organizations SHOULD be at a disadvantage , and the structures were proposing tearing out actually add value only in the sense that MegaCorp is inherently inefficient and out of scale with the market .
Numeeja writes : … there is NEVER a  NEED  for self - serving , personal progression over departmental improvement  style work places and managers .
Thad writes :
The place where I work is managed by good people who dont want to be bureaucratic jerks , but they cant grasp one simple concept : they are giving me money in exchange for doing something I love they dont have to shackle me with schedules and policies to get me to produce !
I will be here working my little heart out because * I want to be * .
I try to block out the memos and TPS reports and remind myself that those things arent really changing what I get to do here , but damn , every time the red tape is thrust in my face it just deflates me and I dont even feel like trying to design or build something .
Elling writes :
If you have 20 people which you want to pull in the same direction , you NEED to have a manager whos job it will be to try and ensure that the people in the group DO pull in the same direction …
On the other hand , I do realize that there ARE idiot - bastard - managers out there .
And I m not defending them .
Cityzenjane writes : … small tech teams in my experience – when left to their own devices do a GREAT job of pulling in the same direction , getting behind technical strategic priorities that they have been part of developing .
First let me say thanks to all who ’ve commented .
THIS is what blogging is all about – one post sparking many great contributions .
I feel lucky to be hosting this dialogue .
But which is it ?
Do companies need structure or do n’t they ?
Is less management better than more management ?
Is management a necessary evil or simply evil ? :o )
Niels Bohr , the Nobel Prize - winning physicist once said :
The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement .
But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
and that ’s exactly what I think we ’re dealing with here .
Whenever I ’m faced with one of these either - or questions , I try to loook beyond the immediate choice , to see if there might exist an answer that transcends the dilemma and includes both .
Can we have both personal freedom and structure at work ?
The answer is not only that it can be done , but that many highly succesful companies are actively doing it .
The truth is that there needs to be structure for personal freedom to even be possible .
But we are talking a different kind of structure .
Where the “ old ” structures are often opaque , rigid and top - down we can instead create new structures that are the exact opposite but perform the same function of coordinating and streamlining people ’s efforts .
These new structures are transparent , dynamic and participatory .
Companies that have done this include business school case classics like Semco , Oticon , Southwest Airlines and GE Aviation .
None of them are doing too shabby ( understatement alert ) , and people are really happy at work there .
Herb Kelleher , ex-CEO of Southwest , was once asked how he could maintain control when his employees had so much freedom .
His answer is classic :
Control ?
Never had it .
Do n’t want it .
I think we can move forward most efficiently if we shift away from choosing between freedom and structure , and work from the assimption that it ’s about choosing both and thus creating a new kind of structure .
Let me hit you with one last Niels Bohr quote ( Yes I ’m a fan , dammit ) :
How wonderful that we have met with a paradox .
Now we have some hope of making progress .
