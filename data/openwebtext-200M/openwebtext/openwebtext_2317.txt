The US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is making quick progress on its Future Attribute Screening Technology ( FAST ) or Project Hostile Intent as it was called originally , which is designed to detect hostile thoughts , or thought crime as it ’s known in Orwellian - speak .
The technology uses high - tech sensors that can measure breathing and pulse rate , as well as facial expressions and skin temperature in an attempt to identify people acting suspiciously .
The system aims to make it easier for border control staff to choose who to single out for a probing interview .
FAST has only been tested so far on paid volunteers , of which , some were instructed to “ act ” shifty .
I would imagine the physiological symptoms that result from real world intent would be quite different to anything that could be simulated by actors .
These symptoms could also easily be altered with drugs , both legal or illicit .
I can’t imagine this system ever achieving a low level of false positives .
People will naturally show signs of stress and irritability from very common everyday conditions such as sleep deprivation , nicotine withdrawal or simply from having too much coffee .
That is all before factoring in medical conditions or any emotional aspects that may cause our bodies to act in a manner that may seem suspicious .
Impressive technology , but it is unlikely to ever be more helpful than the notoriously unreliable polygraph test .

Wondering whom the New York Times intends to endorse for president ?
A string of editorials published since the conventions ended may have tipped its hand :
John McCain has " pandered shamelessly by urging a gas tax holiday , " says the Times .
His " kindergarten ad . . . is shamefully more of the same . "
When he addressed the economy , " McCain lavished praise on workers , but ignored their problems .
That is the real insult . "
As for McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , her record contains " gaping blanks . "
Her views are " alarmingly out of touch with reality .
No less alarming was Mr. McCain 's decision to welcome them into the campaign . "
After her interview with ABC's Charles Gibson , the Times said that " as we watched . . . we kept wondering what on earth John McCain was thinking . "
His choice of Palin " raises profound questions about his judgment .
If the choice was , as we suspect , a tactical move , then it was shockingly irresponsible . "
So the suspense has n't exactly been mounting .
Last Sunday the Times editorial page remembered that there 's also a Democrat in the race .
" The Candidates and the Court " predicted that Barack Obama would nominate " moderate justices " to the Supreme Court , while McCain would favor " archconservatives [ who ] could be expected to lead the charge to eliminate the right to abortion . . . to undermine the right of habeas corpus . . . to strike down , or sharply limit , federal power to protect clean air and water ; ensure food and drug safety ; safeguard workers . . . prohibit discrimination against women and minorities , [ and ] further erode the separation between church and state . "
As the Times did n't spell out its own position on undermining habeas corpus , eroding the church - state divide , and what not , the editorial must be considered , by the Times 's standards , even - handed .
The Chicago Tribune is a different story .
Against the Times 's seven editorials since the convention commenting on any of the candidates , I 've spotted just two in the Tribune , both about Palin .
They were as two - fisted as the Venus de Milo .
On September 9 the Tribune ventured that " Palin owes the nation answers about her record , qualifications and policy beliefs . "
Lest that sound harsh , the editorial made it clear that the paper feels her pain : " We 're not here to shill for ' those reporters and commentators ' Palin mocked in her speech to the Republican National Convention .
On a personal level , sure , she has a right to be miffed .
The disdain of PBS's Gwen Ifill and some other TV journalists after Palin 's speech was visible to millions . "
Five days later the Tribune weighed in on the Gibson interview .
" If you had a high opinion of Sarah Palin before . . . you probably still do .
If you had thought she is not qualified to be president , the sit - down probably confirmed that judgment .
And if you were withholding judgment , you most likely will want to see more before making up your mind . "
But what did the Tribune think ?
Would any actual conviction ever surface in the editorial ?
" The more urgent question , " the Tribune went on , " is whether she is prepared to be president in the near future .
She is not .
The odds are good that she does n't have to be . "
And in conclusion , " There are plenty more questions that deserve answers .
And if Palin can handle them with confidence and skill , she can do herself a world of good among voters who need proof that she can grow quickly into the responsibilities she seeks .
It 's a challenging assignment for someone suddenly thrown on to the national political scene .
" But given the office she seeks , it 's the least the electorate can ask . "
This is the voice the Tribune speaks in every four years , when in the name of dishing it out fearlessly to both sides it tickles the Republicans once or twice with a peacock feather before endorsing them .
The Tribune has never in its history supported a Democrat for president .
If , one Sunday in mid-October , the Tribune endorses the McCain - Palin ticket , there will be nothing in its mid-September Palin editorials to explain away .
But the thing is , I 'm not at all sure the Tribune will endorse the Republican ticket .
There are good reasons why it might not — but also reasons anyone who wants to respect the Tribune should worry about .
Let 's start with the good reasons .
As the Tribune 's changed and the Republican Party 's changed over time , the paper 's absolute fidelity to the GOP in national elections has become increasingly absurd .
If ever there were a time for the Tribune to take the leap , it would be now , when the newspaper of Lincoln would be embracing the symbolism of a Barack Obama presidency .
And symbolism aside , it could easily find Obama the more conservative of the two candidates , as measured by fiscal judgment , fidelity to the constitution , and regard for appointment by merit .
Furthermore , Obama 's a hometown guy the Tribune knows well and , if past editorials are any indication , greatly admires .
In January , endorsing Obama for the Democratic nomination , the Trib editorial page called him " the rare individual who can sit in the U.S. Senate yet have his career potential unfulfilled .
. . .
The professional judgment and personal decency with which he has managed himself and his ambition distinguish Barack Obama .
We endorse him convinced that he could lead America in directions that the other Democrats could not . "
Sadly , that distinction does n't necessarily make Obama , in the Tribune 's eyes , the equal of the worst Republican .
Every four years I seem to find myself writing one of two columns — the one that mocks the Tribune for inanely sticking to form , or the one that grudgingly admires the Tribune for honoring its roots and traditions by making the best case for the Republican presidential nominee there is to make — often a better case than the nominee made for himself .
When I write that second column , I give the Tribune credit for its strong institutional sense of itself .
Plenty of papers have none .
Presidential endorsements are rarely reached by a process with any transparency , and the public 's right to be cynical about them .
The Tribune 's endorsement of George W. Bush four years ago was met with so much hooting and thumb - nosing that Don Wycliff , then the public editor , addressed the subject in a column .
" The Tribune is not blindly or uncritically partisan .
No political party should take its support for granted , " he wrote .
Sensitive to the fact the record made this assertion sound ridiculous , Wycliff ingeniously proposed that when the Tribune did oppose a Republican ( which the paper resumed doing with Bush once he was safely back in office ) , " the Tribune 's reputation as a ' Republican newspaper ' gave extra potency to its counterintuitive action . "
Wycliff explained the endorsement process .
The editorial board — which includes the publisher , the editor , and the public editor — met and sought a " consensus . "
If he'd wished to , the publisher could 've imposed a consensus of one ; but in the case of the Bush - over - Kerry endorsement , " there was no need . "
But whatever " consensus " existed for Bush four years ago was unenthusiastic , I heard then , and I doubt there 's any at all for McCain in 2008 .
Bruce Dold still leads the editorial board , but today a new publisher , a new editor , and new owners are reckoning the Tribune 's best interests .
( There 's also no longer a public editor . )
And , of course , we have two new candidates .
It may be that Sam Zell and company view the Trib 's political heritage as its seed corn .
But as this is a brash , arrogant , desperate bunch with no background in the newspaper business and hundreds of millions of dollars of debt to dig out from under , it probably does not .
" Is our POV blurred or dated ? " asked innovations chief Lee Abrams in a staff memo in April .
He suggested the company was operating on cruise control , " accepting that the look and POV are fine , when historically they might be , but the history may hold us back from competing and winning in today 's vastly changed and intense new environment . "
On September 29 the Tower will unveil a leaner , cleaner Tribune transformed for one big reason — the old one cost too much to produce .
If Zell and Abrams and their buddies think endorsing Obama will give the retooled Tribune a leg up in this hazardous environment , they wo n't let history stop them .
Then it 'll be up to Dold to persuade us that it 's still the newspaper of Lincoln talking , not the paper of — to quote the back of a T - shirt a Zell - hating Cubs fan was sporting a couple rows ahead of me at Wrigley Field last Sunday — a " money - grubbing old man . "
Dold 's in a tough position .
Either the Tribune endorses the Republicans , as usual , and it becomes his job to produce an endorsement we can read without more snickering than usual , or the Tribune endorses Obama and he must sell this seismic shift in Tribune history as something other than an expedient recalculation of where the paper 's interests lie .
Not since Colonel McCormick has the Tribune been so closely identified with its owner , and the colonel was called many things but never a grave dancer .
If Zell wants to do Dold a favor he should boast publicly that he makes money no matter who 's president so his papers can endorse anyone they like .

ORLANDO , Fla .  Senator John McCain was not in a “ cone of silence ” on Saturday night while his rival , Senator Barack Obama , was being interviewed at the Saddleback Church in California .
Members of the McCain campaign staff , who flew here Sunday from California , said Mr. McCain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as Mr. Obama was being interviewed by the Rev. Rick Warren , the author of the best - selling book “ The Purpose Driven Life . ”
The matter is of interest because Mr. McCain , who followed Mr. Obama ’s hourlong appearance in the forum , was asked virtually the same questions as Mr. Obama .
Mr. McCain ’s performance was well received , raising speculation among some viewers , especially supporters of Mr. Obama , that he was not as isolated during the Obama interview as Mr. Warren implied .
The Internet in China may soon run out .
According to the China Internet Network Information Center , under the current allocation speed , China 's IP v4 address resources can only meet the demand of 830 more days and if no proper measures are taken by then , new Chinese netizens will not be able to gain normal access to the Internet .
Li Kai , director in charge of the IP business for CNNIC 's international department , says that if a netizen wants to get access to the Internet , an IP address will be necessary to analyze the domain name and view the pages .
At present , most of the networks in China use IP v4 addresses .
As a basic resource for the Internet , the IPv4 addresses are limited and 80 % of the final allocation IP addresses have been used .
By the current allocation speed , China 's IP v4 address resource can only meet the demand of 830 more days .
If there is no available new resource by then , new netizens will not be able to gain normal access to the Internet and the business expansion of network operators will be impossible .
Li says that a new IP v6 network address , which is a basic network resource without these limitations , has been developed in America , but this kind of IP address is only used among educational websites in China .
To use the IPv6 network address , network operators need to spend a lot of time and money on equipment updating .
CNNIC now has started hosting seminars to remind the operators to apply for the remaining IP addresses as soon as possible for a storage in addition to call for a preparation for the providing of IP v6 addresses to netizens .
Mr Chavez is beefing up his armed forces with Russian help
He will visit Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - on Tuesday , and later the Urals town of Izhevsk , where Kalashnikov assault rifles are made .
The US has tried to persuade Russia not to supply weapons to Venezuela .
Mr Chavez is visiting several countries , lobbying for a Venezuelan seat on the UN Security Council .
On Monday he signed a series of co-operation agreements with President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus , covering topics such as technology , energy and agriculture .
Both Mr Lukashenko and Mr Chavez are fierce critics of US policy .
In Belarus they exchanged compliments about each other 's strong leadership styles .
" I 'm impressed by your knowledge of military affairs , " Mr Lukashenko told Mr Chavez as they toured an army museum .
Strategic alliance
The US has labelled Mr Lukashenko " Europe 's last dictator " .
Mr Chavez said the agreements were just the start of a Belarus - Venezuela strategic alliance .
He will later visit Qatar , Iran , Vietnam and Mali .
The planned arms deal with Russia is worth around $ 1bn ( £ 542 m ) , correspondents say .
The US has voiced concerns about it , having banned such deals with Caracas for US manufacturers .
Russia plans to deliver 30 Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets and 30 helicopters to Venezuela .
Venezuela also plans to buy 100,000 Russian - made AK - 103 assault rifles and wants to set up factories on its soil to produce Kalashnikovs under licence .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bulky and obtrusive rack - mounted solar panels may be a thing of the past .
Tim McGinnis ( R ) , president of Woodside Homes , and Troy DeGraff , director of purchasing , hold up a solar wafer made by SunPower Corp as they stand next to one of their new homes in Temecula , California , July 19 , 2008 . .

Spurred by recent advances in technology , solar panel makers are scrambling to come up with neater and cleaner products that will overcome the aesthetic objections of home owners to traditional solar panels .
They are building their technology directly into different kinds of roof tiles , hiding them in walls and lining the tops of patio awnings with them .
“ Bottom line , people do n’t want goofy looking roofs , ” said Julie Blunden of solar panel manufacturer SunPower Corp .
SunPower is making solar panels designed to work seamlessly with both flat roof tiles and the curved , Spanish - style clay tiles popular in parts of California and other sunny places .
SunPower , controlled by Cypress Semiconductor , is the leading U.S. manufacturer , but has half its sales in Europe .
Lumeta , a division of DRI Energy , has similar integrated panels in the final stages of industry certification , manufactured by China ’s Suntech Power Holdings Corp .
Both SunPower ’s and Lumeta ’s panels are made using silicon , the same raw material used in solar panels since the 1950s .
Advances in technology using a new semiconductor called copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) promises much thinner panels that are easier to hide .
For now though , thin - film panels are less efficient than silicon and manufacturers such as DayStar Technologies Inc are focusing on the commercial market because of economies of scale .
“ Because it ’s capital - intensive , the way to get cost down is to get volume up , so the thin - film manufacturers are looking for more high volume production applications -- that ’s how you can get the cost parity to silicon , ” said Bret Adams , a spokesperson for DayStar .

Although thin film is a relatively new technology , John Langdon of thin - film start - up HelioVolt said he expects it to dominate residential use as it becomes part of the building process .
“ Solar power today is where air conditioning was in 1950 -- everything is a window unit designed for retrofit on existing construction -- its more expensive , its not as good , its not as a cost effective , ” Langdon said .
“ But by 1960 no one built a building without saying ‘ Should I put a central air system in ? ’ - and the same thing is going to happen with solar . ”
Until recently , solar panels were about six inches thick and mounted with brackets on top of existing roofs or custom designed racks .
But with energy prices climbing , and authorities offering subsidies for solar power , the solar industry is beginning to recognize aesthetics as one of the last barriers to solar power in the residential market , despite a housing slump in the United States .
“ At first you do n’t even notice they ’re solar , ” said Tony Fortenberry , who bought a home in Rockland , California , in September with solar panels manufactured by SunPower on its roof .
“ The tiles are completely integrated into the roof , ” Fortenberry said .
“ It has a more elegant appearance and it does n’t look like an add - on . ”
The number of solar installations in the United States rose 45 percent to 150 megawatts in 2007 , according to the Solar Energy Industry Association , or the equivalent of the total energy use of about 37,500 homes .
Total solar capacity of 3,400 MW , not including pool or lighting systems , was less than 1 percent of U.S. annual use last year , leaving plenty of room for growth .
Although such aesthtic designs are more expensive than the rack - mounted systems , they appear to make sense in new developments , where reduced installation costs and less - invasive designs can help convince builders and prospective buyers of the merits of solar power .
According to SunPower ’s Blunden , the solar business is dependent on builders , who must be convinced that it is cost - efficient and that buyers will like the way they look .
In the United States , a typical market price for retro - fit add - on systems is about $ 8 per watt , split roughly equally between hardware and installation .
This translates into about $ 40,000 for a 5 kilowatt system , before government subsidies and reimbursements .
Another product , Lumeta ’s PowerPly , which has adhesive backing , eliminates the need for a rack - mounted systems and can reduce installation costs by about 70 percent .
For homeowner Fortenberry , the integrated roof was so successful that he questions why the developer did n’t go a step further .
“ Why do I have a solar panel integrated into my roof ?
Why is n’t my entire roof a solar panel ? ”
The MESA + Research Institute for Nanotechnology is an organization dedicating to providing the supporting infrastructure for a diverse range of research topics .
Member groups have interests that encompass everything from laser wakefield acceleration through to the development of novel piezoelectric nanostructures .
With such a diverse range of researchers , it can be difficult to keep track of what everyone is up to .
To overcome this problem , and to open up more possibilities for collaborative research projects , the MESA + institute organizes a one - day meeting that provides a snapshot of the institute 's research activities , giving us a chance to listen to some of the latest research performed by the invited speakers .
A more extensive article devoted to the work of one of them will appear later — in the mean time , you can get your science fix with this new development in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR ) .
NMR is , without doubt , the gold standard in spectroscopy .
To put it in perspective , the discovery and subsequent technical developments in ( NMR ) spectroscopy — including the magnetic resonance imaging used in hospitals — have garnered four Nobel prizes , the last being in 2002 .
Every hospital , chemistry , and biochemistry lab worthy of the name has at least one of these things .
NMR uses the interaction of the nuclear spin with its environment to determine the properties of that environment .
The idea works like this : a hydrogen atom 's nucleus , when placed in a magnetic field , will begin to precess — the way a top behaves as it spins — with a certain frequency .
However , if the atom it is sitting next to it is a carbon atom , then that will alter the frequency slightly .
Likewise , if the next carbon down the chain is bonded differently , then a hydrogen atom attached to it will have a different resonant frequency .
In the case of long molecules that folds back on itself , the atoms that end up close to each other will mutually change each other 's resonant frequency , even though they are not bonded directly .
All of these frequency shifts will appear in the spectrum in direct proportion to how many atoms are in that particular configuration .
By careful calculation , one can do things like figure out the folded structure of a protein complex , which is an absolutely incredible achievement .
However , doing NMR on very small samples is difficult .
Jacob Bart and co-workers from the MESA +
Institute recently demonstrated NMR on samples as small as 100nl .
The problem is two - fold .
First , the signal from the atomic nucleus is very small , so a large sample volume gives you lots of nuclear material to get a signal from .
They can't do anything about this — 100nl is 100nl , and you can't have small samples and large signals .
The second problem is the magnetic field .
The frequency of the signal depends on the strength of the magnetic field , and that strength has to be evenly distributed across the sample .
Remember , we interpret NMR data by looking at how the resonance frequency changes , so you had better be damn sure that you know what the magnetic field strength is .
This is generally done by using big coils that have a very homogenous field near their center , where the spectroscopy is performed .
Once you move to small sample volumes , this becomes a problem because the coil needs to be smaller , making it harder to obtain a homogenous field .
Their solution was to use what is called a strip - line .
This is a strip of metal on a printed circuit board with a metallic ground plane underneath .
The length of the strip - line was chosen such that it generated electrical standing waves , like the oscillations on a guitar string .
The geometry of the strip - line and ground plane produce a nicely confined and homogenous magnetic field .
There is a problem here , in that the field is too weak .
In a rush of inspiration , the researchers realized that the field strength is proportional to current density , so they made a center portion of the strip line very narrow .
This had the effect of vastly increasing the current density and , consequently , the magnetic field strength .
This intense magnetic field is located very close to the wire , but is still quite homogenous .
As a result , a tiny sample volume is actually a requirement for doing NMR with this setup .
Bart and coworkers demonstrated this by hooking it up to a microfluidic reactor , where two chemicals were pumped into a chamber to react and form a single product .
The flow then continued to the NMR chip , where spectroscopy was performed .
They found , as expected , that if the flow rate was low enough , the reaction would go to completion and they would only detect the final product .
As the speed was increased , however , they began detecting the two chemicals originally put into the reaction chamber .
Furthermore , they could also detect an intermediate product that is formed as the reaction proceeds .
The resolution of the NMR spectrum was also sufficient to perform more complicated forms of molecular identification .
( For the chemists among you , the spectrometer could resolve the hydrogen triplets . )
This little development has untold possibilities .
It will now be possible to perform generalized " I have n't a clue what this sample is , but I need to find out " spectroscopy on a chip .
This is important because microfluidic systems make general spectroscopic methods difficult , leading researchers to resort to specialized devices where you limit the use of the device to situations where you basically know what needs to be detected .

It 's not over until Bush and Cheney leave town Wednesday , September 24 , 2008 by Dave Winer .
There are four distinct possibilities .
1 . The need for a bailout is a bluff , so nothing happens and Bush finally looks wholly like the idiot asshole that he is .
McCain suspended his campaign for nothing .
The Republican Party loses in a landslide in November .
2 . McCain votes for the bailout , providing cover for other Republicans to follow him , and enough Democrats will sign on so the bailout passes .
The Republicans who vote for it blame McCain for the mess , and he loses to Obama , in a landslide , and the Republicans lose more seats , but most of them get re-elected anyway .
( Democratic voters think the bailout sucks but it's not a matter of religion for them as it is with the Republicans . )
3 . McCain convinces Bush & Cheney to resign , Pelosi becomes President until January 20 , and a Democratic Congress and Executive passes the bailout , all Republicans who have conservative constituencies vote against it and win re-election in November .
A few Democratic incumbents get thrown out because the public will hate the bailout , even if it works .
Pretty good chance the next Senate has a Republican majority , maybe the House too .
4 . The need for a bailout is not a bluff , Bush refuses to leave , McCain refuses to sacrifice his candidacy , the Republicans in Congress wo n't vote for the bailout so neither will the Democrats , and the world economy melts down .
Okay it 's your choice .
Which of the four scenarios do you think will prevail ?
I think the hot potato lands in Bush 's lap .
His father comes down and tells him playtime is over , he has to leave to save the world economy , and what little remains of the Bush name , and we limp along until Obama takes office on Jan 20 .

Space Force satellite ready to launch aboard Falcon 9
SpaceX is set to launch the 4th GPS III satellite from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station but according to the 45th Space Wing weather is only 40 % " go . "
Speaking to Massively , Multiverse 's Corey Bridges has shed a little extra light on the company 's just - announced Buffy the Vampire Slayer MMO .
Bridges noted that the game would be released in a 2D , Flash - based version first , with a full 3D version to follow .
" What we 're doing with the Buffy game then is releasing it in stages , " he said .
" It will start as a 2D Flash - based MMO where you can go on missions and interact with other players .
This will extend once we have the 3D client working . "
Bridges also confirmed that the two versions of the game would connect : " We 're going to have these shared spaces where 2D and 3D people can interact , " he said .
But they would also diverge : " We 're planning to have content that can only be done by 2D players , and content that can only be done by 3D players . "
" The easy thing is to say that it will be more casual in the 2D version of the game , and more deep ... in the 3D version . "
Multiverse is " planning for " avatars being able to switch between both versions of the game .
The 2D version will go into public beta " really soon " , according to Bridges : " I 'd love to get that out to players by the end of the year , " he said .
Bridges also took the opportunity to apologise for the non-appearance of the company 's planned Firefly MMO , although he was " contractually bound " not to say anything about it .
He said that Multiverse was already in development with Buffy , whereas it had only done pre-production work on Firefly .
It was looking for another company to develop the Firefly game .
" I can say that it 's not an issue of someone being at fault .
Neither Multiverse or Fox , or anyone in specific made an error in this .
There are just some issues that need to be worked through .
Hopefully things will get back on track before too long , " Bridges said .
" Believe me , nobody could beat us up [ more than ] we beat ourselves up about this .
We 're not at fault , but there are a lot of dashed hopes here . "
A reader writes :
Hi John ,
Long time reader , but this is the first time I ’ve been compelled to write directly .
I ’ve just read the Obama statement on the economy and I just wanted to start beating my head into the nearest drywall .
The tag line the Obama camp seems to be going with is ‘ Failed Philosophy ’ .
How does this come close to communicating what happened this morning ?
We ’re not in this mess because of a high - level theoretical argument of regulation vs. deregulation .
We ’re here because the people in charge of overseeing and guiding the economy are grossly incompetent at their jobs .
I ’m sorry , but ‘ Failed Philosophy ’ strikes me as the weakest , most watered down angle on which to attack this .

All of this would seem to suggest that Warner Bros.
either massively screwed up or is pretty darn certain that Fox is grossly mistaken .
In a statement issued to the press on Tuesday , a Warner Bros. spokesman said : “ We respectfully disagree with Fox 's position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project . "
But the studio also made the claim that the judge in the case , Judge Gary Allen Fees , " did not opine at all on the merits , other than to conclude that Fox satisfied the pleading requirements . ”
This is technically true .
But the tenor of Fees ’ edict does sound rather leading .
For example : " It is particularly noteworthy that nothing on the face of the complaint or the documents supplied to the Court establishes that [ Watchmen producer Larry ] Gordon , the claimed source of Warner Brothers ' interest in Watchmen , ever acquired any rights in Watchmen . "
At the very least , the judge ’s order seems to put Warner Bros . and Gordon in the position of producing proof that clearly shows that Fox is wrong , or confuses the situation so much that the judge will have no choice but to throw them into a slime pit and let them slug this thing out .
( If you want to examine the legalese yourself , check it out here . )
Regardless , the two most likely outcomes are : 1 . Warner Bros. wins .
2 . Warner Bros. offers
Fox a big fat settlement and Fox takes it .
They could certainly use the bump after a weak summer season in which none of its films crossed the $ 100 million threshold .

I do n't know that the revelations from Ron Suskind 's new book The Way of The World are truly bombshells , so much as confirmation of what we in the liberal blogosphere have always said : the Bush administration wanted to go to war in Iraq and were willing to do whatever they had to to sell it to the American people .
But what is key to me is that there is very little left to which people like Nancy Pelosi can hold on to claim that there is no proof of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the White House .
John Dean -- no stranger to impeachment proceedings -- has been saying that this administration is worse than watergate for years .
On Tuesday 's Countdown , he confirms that Suskind 's findings absolutely signal impeachable offenses on the part of the administration and why it is critical that Congress find their spines and pursue it :
OLBERMANN : The big picture question .
As I ‘ve been saying , you saw enough in Bush in malfeasance by the end of 2003 to have titled that book " Worse than Watergate . "
Suskind says in his that just the Iraq part is worse than Watergate .
Do you concur with his assessment ?
DEAN : Well , I do and I base mine largely on the excessive secrecy which he has only added more detail and information about and the consequences of that secrecy .
And , of course , in Watergate , nobody died as a result of Nixon ‘s so - called abuses of power nor was anybody tortured .
So , we ‘re playing in a whole different field and on a different level .
So , I think he is right , it is worse .
OLBERMANN : The devil ‘s advocate question in this one , John , is - the Bush administration ends in six months , presumably - why is simply , you know , getting the shovel , the historical shovel out and covering this up with as much clean and sanctified dirt as we can not enough ?
Why is forgetting this man and his presidency not enough ?
DEAN : Keith , I think it ‘s more than a devil ‘s advocate question .
It really is the central question in the 2008 campaign .
If we have another Republican administration , we ‘re going to see more of the same that this sort of material that ‘s revealed by Suskind .
Full transcripts below the fold , including Olbermann 's exclusive interview with author Suskind
In our fourth story on the COUNTDOWN :
The book ‘s assertions would obviously destroy deniability for the president and would constitute criminal wrongdoing worse than Watergate .
As noted by Mr. Suskind in his book , " Under a 1991 amendment to statutes that created CIA and that govern its actions .
There is a passage that reads no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies , or media . "
Suskind adding , " The operation created by the White House and passed to the CIA pertains to the White House ‘s knowingly misusing an arm of the government , the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings . "
Let ‘s turn now to Nixon White House counsel John Dean , author , of course , of " Worse than Watergate : The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush " and a columnist for FindLaw.com .
John , always a pleasure .
Thanks for your time tonight .
JOHN W. DEAN , FMR .
NIXON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL : Thank you , Keith .
OLBERMANN : Before we broaden out , that CIA statute that he cited , is Suskind right , is the violation of that , ( A ) , did it happen ; ( B ) , is that by itself an impeachable offense ?
DEAN : Well , I think , if indeed it did happen , there are some real problems .
I do n‘t think people are looking at it too narrowly or Suskind is when I read his book .
What happens when you tie that with a criminal conspiracy statute , 18 USC 371 , which nailed countless people in Watergate for misusing the agencies and departments of government - that ‘s where they ‘ve got a problem .
That ‘s where Nixon had a problem for telling the CIA to block the FBI for part of the Watergate investigation .
Yes , it was obstruction but it was also defrauding the government .
This is their real problem with that statute .
This may be why some of these people are having second thoughts about being on the record with Ron .
OLBERMANN : Well , once again , as we know , history repeats itself .
Suskind has tapes .
And the tie between Watergate and this is - is deniability , plausible deniability or the lack thereof .
In your opinion , if this book is accurate , if the allegations are correct here , are the links clear enough about the president on the specific issue of knowing criminality ?
DEAN : Well , what I ‘ve read so far , no .
It looks like Cheney has been very effective in setting up his deniability and always being the failsafe for Bush .
And as they start waterboarding the vice president , which is n‘t too likely , he is the man that the trail ends right there , as it did with Scooter Libby , for example .
OLBERMANN : The big picture question .
As I ‘ve been saying , you saw enough in Bush in malfeasance by the end of 2003 to have titled that book " Worse than Watergate . "
Suskind says in his that just the Iraq part is worse than Watergate .
Do you concur with his assessment ?
DEAN : Well , I do and I base mine largely on the excessive secrecy which he has only added more detail and information about and the consequences of that secrecy .
And , of course , in Watergate , nobody died as a result of Nixon ‘s so - called abuses of power nor was anybody tortured .
So , we ‘re playing in a whole different field and on a different level .
So , I think he is right , it is worse .
OLBERMANN :
The devil ‘s advocate question in this one , John , is - the Bush administration ends in six months , presumably - why is simply , you know , getting the shovel , the historical shovel out and covering this up with as much clean and sanctified dirt as we can not enough ?
Why is forgetting this man and his presidency not enough ?
DEAN : Keith , I think it ‘s more than a devil ‘s advocate question .
It really is the central question in the 2008 campaign .
If we have another Republican administration , we ‘re going to see more of the same that this sort of material that ‘s revealed by Suskind .
Those people have been well - implanted - as we learned from the testimony on the record and the inspector general ‘s report of what ‘s happening in the Department of Justice - this is really true throughout the government .
These people are there , that mentality is there .
And if there is n‘t a serious change of parties controlling the top of the government , we ‘re going to see much more of this .
OLBERMANN : John Dean , the author of " Worse than Watergate " and " Broken Government , " giving his assessment of Ron Suskind ‘s reporting tonight , an extraordinary thing as it is .
Great thanks , as always , John .
DEAN : Thank you , Keith .
We 've already shown you that San Francisco has been overrun by Imperial Forces , but Google 's Street View has revealed the shocking truth that it's not the only Californian city ripe for conquest by the Emperor - as anyone traveling down the virtual version of Hollywood Boulevard can see for themselves .
We 'll show the full shocking image that will have you realizing that LA is next ... and that Darth Vader is a little short for a Sith Lord .

Anyone who Googles for 6860 Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles , clicks on the " Street View " and then rotates the camera 180° will see the chilling picture above of popular Sith Lord Darth Vader directing his faithful Stormtrooper guard to shoot the Google camera van so as to not reveal their contemptuous hidden plans ( and Darth 's real height ; apparently , he wore platforms for the movies ) .
Obviously , the Stormtrooper was too late , but who knows how far the Imperial takeover of California has gotten since the picture was taken ?
There 's no way of being sure , so all we can safely say is this : Nevada , Oregon and Arizona ...
Be warned .
Be careful .

( Thanks , Patrick ! )
Being true to yourself is not easy .
In magazines , we ’re shown images of flawless airbrushed bodies .
Luxury and celebrity lifestyles are worshipped .
In our culture we ’re judged for what we own and what we do .
Not who we are .
It ’s hard to remain true to yourself when our culture encourages competition .
I do n’t think competition is a bad thing necessarily .
Our economy ’s livelihood depends on it .
The problem is we define everyone as winners or losers .
He ’s a janitor , he must be a loser .
She ’s a fortune 500 executive , she must be a winner .
We judge people based on their outward appearances , the cars they drive and the restaurants they frequent .
Have you ever been nervous to approach a person because they have a more important title than you ?
Have you ever avoided someone because they looked homeless ?
Judging others based on their appearances and job titles is kind of inevitable though , as backwards as it may be .
After all , it ’s the first thing we see , and the first thing we hear .
But I think we abuse this system .
In a perfect world , we would judge people based on the contents of their character ( or not judging at all , for that matter ) .
I think the more we practice doing this , the more comfortable we become with ourselves .
The more we accept ourselves , the more we accept others as well .
Because the truth is , the level of your happiness is exactly proportional to the amount you ’ve sold yourself out .
The amount of contentment you experience is directly related to how authentically you ’re living .
The main source of this problem is :
The Domestication of Humans
When we are born , we ’re completely authentic .
We ’re wild .
We think , but not in symbols ( words ) .
We know what ’s right and wrong , but it ’s not based on knowledge .
It ’s based on our integrity .
As we grow up , we ’re taught ( through language ) what ’s right and what ’s wrong .
What ’s acceptable and what is n’t .
We start to think of the world in symbols .
Instead of experiencing life directly , we have series of thoughts and judgments about it .
Thinking is essential to our success as humans and much of our lives depend on it .
It ’s allowed us to build cities , create technology and all sorts of conveniences .
The problem with thinking in symbols , is we judge everything .
We judge ourselves .
We judge the things we do right and the things we do wrong .
We start to want everything we do to be right , so we create an image of perfection .
We ’ve Sold Ourselves Out to Knowledge
I ’ve talked here before about the importance of not taking things personally .
That ’s because what other people do is n’t about you , it ’s about them .
Well , in the same way , if you want to regain your authenticity , you have to not take your thoughts personally .
You have to stop identifying with your thoughts .
Because your thoughts are not you .
Your spirit is not an idea or a concept .
Sometimes to stay true to yourself you have to :
Stop caring about being defined by erroneous status symbols .
Such as : job titles , credentials , college degrees , and the contents of your resume .
Not care about how much money you have , how productive you are , or how popular you are .
Instead you care about how much you control your time and how much you own your own mind .
No longer live your life based on a template .
Spend your time in unconventional ways ( like long - term world travel ) that cause other people to disapprove .
The reason they do n’t approve is probably because you ’re forcing them to question their own values .
Stop caring about what other people think .
I admit that it ’s not always easy for me to stay true to myself .
I often find myself editing what I say because I ’m afraid of what other people will think .
I find myself trying to make a certain impression , because I want people to view me a certain way .
I want to be seen as someone “ who matters ” or something who is “ interesting ” or “ important . ”
Every time I do this , I feel like I give up a little part of my soul .
Every time I act a certain way for the sake of popularity , I sell myself out a little more .
It ’s not easy being authentic .
You have to be able to take some harsh criticism sometimes .
That ’s because authenticity is n’t popular ; “ fitting in ” is .
But have you ever noticed the most successful , admired people are the ones who have vehemently gone against the grain ?
Those that have blazed their own trail and followed their own path ?
I ’ve noticed this .
That ’s why I live every day consciously following my heart as much as possible .
To help you live more based on the way you want to live and stop sacrificing your integrity , here ’s what I ’ve learned .
I hope this will help you in some way .
Reject the idea that you ca n’t be consistently happy .
Yes , it ’s actually possible to be consistently happy .
If you do n’t take other people ’s actions personally or your own thoughts personally , you can be consistently happy .
The easiest way to do this is to stop caring .
Live based on your own values and not for the approval of others .
We all do things to please others , that ’s natural .
It ’s part of the give and take of life .
What is n’t natural is living your life based on the expectations of others and society as a whole .
If you can stop caring about what other people think , your happiness will increase instantly .
This means having the courage to be corky , embracing your inner geek and be brave enough to just be weird .
What one person thinks is weird is completely normal to someone else .
It ’s all about perspective .
Work toward your own goals and not to further someone else ’s agenda .
This one of the hardest ones to follow because many of us have no other choice but to work for someone else .
You can start building a business now though , one day at a time .
Within a year or two you can quit your day job .
This is something that ’s very important to me that I struggle with daily .
I hate going to work having someone pay for my time .
But ultimately it ’s a temporary sacrifice I have to make right now ( if I do n’t want to be homeless ) .
I work daily to try to build this blog so I can fund the ownership of my time .
What can you do to afford the ownership of your time ?
Can you find a place where what you love to do , what you ’re good at , and a viable source of income intersect ?
Reject popularity as a primary source of happiness .
It ’s true that everyone wants to be liked .
It ’s a basic instinct of life .
But if you ca n’t be happy without dressing a in the latest fashion , driving a mercedes or owning a louis voughton purse , that ’s a problem .
Who owns your happiness , your or some brand ?
Living based on a certain lifestyle is fine , as long as that ’s what resonates with you .
If you ’re following a path , it ’s not your path .
( Although sometimes a dot is better than a path . )
Make freedom and authenticity your highest ideal .
It ’s difficult staying authentic .
Illusory fears have an uncanny way of getting in the way of us .
That ’s why it ’s important to make being authentic you ’re highest aim .
If you can make considering this value an auto - response it will be easier for you when it comes time to make a decision .
When I think about the value of being authentic vs. conforming / popularity it helps me to realize what matters most me .
It gives me the extra push to choose what will make me sleep easier at night .
Follow your integrity .
Integrity , conscience , intuition , whatever you want to call it , listen to it .
Whenever you make a decision , follow your integrity .
This seems like such common sense , that it ’s not even worth stating .
But the truth is , we have a tendency to value logic more than how we feel .
Stop trying .
Probably the most important part to being authentic is that you do n’t try to be authentic .
If you ’re constantly thinking about being true to yourself , you ’re trying too hard .
Real authenticity is about being natural .
You ’re not trying , you ’re just being .
This is just a starting point of things that have helped me live more authentically .
Everyone ’s path to staying real ( or unreal ) will be different .
Have you ever sold yourself out to try be more popular ?
To try to fit in ?
What do you do to stay authentic ?
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments .

Russia exports a lot of armaments and military equipments to other countries .
Some more countries would like to buy it too but their budgets can’t afford them to do this , so Russian engineers have created a full set of fake weaponry for some countries .

It would be just like a real thing for the foreign satellites or spy-planes , just bring it to the place , inflate and you are done .

Computing Thoughts
Self in the Argument List : Redundant is not Explicit
by Bruce Eckel
September 23 , 2008
Summary
The response to arguments about self in Python is " explicit is better than implicit . "
In a discussion at Pycon Brazil , I realized that we do need self in the body of a method , but being forced to place it in the argument list is redundant .
I 'm not actually expecting it to change , but I want to try to establish that this is n't a dumb argument .
Advertisement
self is necessary to distinguish between global variables / functions and those of the object , for example .
It provides a scoping mechanism , and I personally find it clearer than Ruby 's @ and @@ , but I 'm sure that 's just because I 'm used to it , probably because it 's similar to this in C++ and Java .
Something has always bugged me about self , however , and I 've blogged about it before -- I had hoped that it would have been rectified in Python 3 and this caused the usual furor which ends up by people saying " explicit is better than implicit . "
In a conversation with Luciano Ramalho ( president of the Brazilian Python group ) while I was in Brazil , he made me realize that it was n't self everywhere that has been bugging me , it 's self in the argument list which I think could actually be called un -pythonic .
How it Works Now Here 's some simple Python code showing the use of classes : def f( ) : pass a = 1 class C1 ( object ) : a = 2 def m 1 ( self ) : print a # Prints ' 1 ' print self . a # Prints ' 2 ' f() #
The global version self .
m2 ( ) #
Must scope other members def m 2 ( self ) : pass obj = C1 ( ) obj.m1 ( )
First , you see f( ) and the global a , so we have something to call at the global scope .
The class C1 is defined by inheriting from object , which is the standard procedure for defining a new class ( I think this might become implicit in Python 3 ) .
Note that both m 1 ( ) and m 2 ( ) have a first argument of self .
In Python , self is not a keyword , but the name " self " is conventionally used to represent the address of the current object .
The address of the object is always the first argument .
The a that is defined at class scope represents one way to create object fields , but you can also just assign to self .
a within a method , and the first time this happens the storage will be created for that field .
However , the two versions of a must now be differentiated .
If you just say a within a method , you 'll get the global version , but self .
a produces the object field ( you can also assign to global variables from within classes , but I 'll skip that for the current discussion ) .
Similarly , an unqualified call to f( ) produces the global function , and self .
m2 ( ) calls the member function by qualifying it ( and simultaneously passing the address of the current object to be used as the self argument for m 2 ( ) ) .
Now let 's look at a class with a method that has arguments : class C2 ( object ) : def m2 ( self , a , b ) : pass
To call the method , we create an instance of the object and use the dot notation to call m 2 ( ) on the object obj : obj = C2 ( ) obj.m2( 1,2 )
In the call , the address of obj is implicitly passed as self for the call to m 2 ( ) , and here we see a big inconsistency : why is implicit better than explicit when you define the method , but it 's OK to be implicit when you call the method ?
I certainly think that the method call syntax is desireable , but it means that you define a method differently than you call it , which I do n't see as either " explicit " or pythonic .
This is seen when you call the method with the wrong number of arguments : obj .m2(1 )
Here 's the resulting error : Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " classes.py " , line 9 , in < module > obj.m2(1 ) TypeError : m 2 ( ) takes exactly 3 arguments ( 2 given )
Because of the implicit argument pass of self during a method call , the above error message is actually saying that it wants you to call the method this way : C2.m2 ( obj , 1,2 )
Even though the above line does run , this of course is n't the way you actually do it ; you use the normal method calling syntax and give it two arguments : obj.m2( 1,2 ) The message m 2 ( ) takes exactly 3 arguments ( 2 given ) is not only confusing for beginners , but it confuses me every time I see it , which I think suggests non-Pythonicness and points out the inconsistency between method definition and method invocation .
The Hopeless Suggestion
So what am I suggesting , despite the long history of hopelessness for this idea ?
Make self a keyword in Python 3.1 ( what 's a bit more backwards incompatibility , as long as we 're at it ? )
( Or even use this to make it easier for C++ and Java programmers to transition ) .
All the existing rules for self remain the same .
The only difference : you do n't have to put self in a method argument list .
That 's the only place it becomes implicit ; everywhere else it 's explicit -- except , just as it is now , the method call .
This produces consistency between the method definition and the method call , so you define a method with the same number of arguments that you call it with .
When you call a method with the wrong number of arguments , the error message tells you the actual number of arguments the method is expecting , instead of one more .
Explicit vs. Redundant Before I hear " explicit is better than implicit " one more time , there 's a difference between making something clear and making it redundant .
We already have a language that forces you to jump through lots of hoops for reasons that must have seemed good at the time but have since worn thin : it 's called Java .
If we just want to be explicit about absolutely everything , we can use C or assembler or some language that spells out exactly what 's happening inside the machine all the time and does n't abstract away from those details .
Forcing programmers to put self in the method argument list does n't honor explicitness ; it 's just redundant forced behavior .
It does n't add to the expression of programming ( we already know it 's a method ; we do n't need self in the argument list to remind us ) , it 's just mechanical , and thus , I argue , non-pythonic .

" I plan on going so deep into the desert , that any failure of my equipment , could cost me my life . "
-- Evan Tanner , August 18 , 2008
It appears that former UFC middleweight champion Evan Tanner predicted his own death less than one month ago .
The Imperial County Sheriff 's Department today discovered the dead body of a man in the Palo Verde , Calif. , mountain area .
And it is indeed Tanner .
MMAmania.com has placed several calls to the Imperial County Sheriff 's Department and we have been unable to confirm or deny the report .
However , it has been confirmed by several people close to Tanner .
Here 's a snip from IVPressOnline.com :
" Authorities have not confirmed if the body is that of missing mixed martial arts fighter , Evan Tanner , who had fought in the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) .
Tanner , 37 , has been missing since last weekend .
Tanner 's friends from Oceanside , where Tanner resides , had been texting him without reply since Wednesday before they reported him missing on Friday .
On Sunday , a campsite was discovered in the Clapp Springs area of the Palo Verde mountains .
Tanner 's motorcycle was found at the campsite .
A body was found today when a sheriffs deputy was flying around the general location of the campsite .
The Imperial County deputy coroner is being flown in to retrieve and identify body . "
This is truly a a huge loss .
He was a pioneer of the sport who had his own unique approach to fighting and to life .
He was an adventure seeker , documenting his travels in great detail on his personal blog and on Spike.com .
Tanner recently overcame a dark period in his life and a battle with alcohol .
His life was an open book , which either turned fans in his favor or against him .
Tanner did n't really care one way or the other how people felt -- he did things his way .
He recently returned to the Octagon to recapture some of the glory from earlier in his fighting career ; however , he lost his first two comeback bouts .
Tanner mentioned that he was going to take some time off and address some injuries that had been hampering him for the past several years .
In the meantime , he continued his nomadic ways .
While terribly tragic and entirely premature , it 's perhaps a poetic end for one of the most eccentric fighters the sport has ever known .
Rest in peace , Evan .
In March or April 2007 , three noncommissioned United States Army officers , including a first sergeant , a platoon sergeant and a senior medic , killed four Iraqi prisoners with pistol shots to the head as the men stood handcuffed and blindfolded beside a Baghdad canal , two of the soldiers said in sworn statements .
After the killings , the first sergeant  the senior noncommissioned officer of his Army company  told the other two to remove the men ’s bloody blindfolds and plastic handcuffs , according to the statements made to Army investigators , which were obtained by The New York Times .
The statements and other court documents were provided by a person close to one of the soldiers in the unit who insisted on anonymity and who has an interest in the outcome of the legal proceedings .
After removing the blindfolds and handcuffs , the three soldiers shoved the four bodies into the canal , rejoined other members of their unit waiting in nearby vehicles and drove back to their combat outpost in southwest Baghdad , the statements said .
Politico :
According to one GOP lawmaker , some House Republicans are saying privately that they ’d rather “ let the markets crash ” than sign on to a massive bailout .
“ For the sake of the altar of the free market system , do you accept a Great Depression ? ” the member asked .
Putting that little bit of horror aside , here ’s a quote guaranteed to make you chuckle :
President Bush ’s lame duck status , and his heavy hand in dealing with lawmakers in his own party for the last seven - plus years , is also coming back to haunt the White House , as House Republicans grumble that Bush is “ trying to tear up the Constitution ” by committing the federal government to such a massive intervention in the U.S. financial markets .
Yeah , Republicans caring about the Constitution .
Seven years too late , you jerks .
They only care about the Constitution when money is involved – their money .
Ok , this is interesting too :
[ Michael Steel , spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) ] reiterated that Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) — who , as ranking member of the House Financial Service Committee participated in talks on the compromise — “ was n’t empowered to negotiate ” any agreement on behalf of other House Republican .
So the top House Republican on finance issues is n’t empowered to negotiate for House Republicans on finance issues .
Now tell me who is in disarray and mucking up the entire process .
It sounds like there ’s a bit of chaos in Republican - land .

If Ludwig von Mises were to peruse today 's newspapers , he would recognize the symptoms of a worldwide central - bank - generated credit bubble and its oncoming collapse .
What increasingly characterizes the global financial order , Mises would say , is an arrangement where regulators encourage a " heads I win , tails everyone else loses " mentality , backstopped by the willingness of quasi - governmental entities to print and borrow money without bound .
A gentle man by all accounts , Mises would resist the temptation to say , " I told you so , " and focus on how to avoid a full - blown global economic and political catastrophe .
The announcement by the FDIC that it might have to " temporarily " borrow money from the Treasury , i.e. , the taxpayers , is the latest squawking canary that the dollar - centric global - fiat - money and regulatory era in place since WWII is approaching a final ugly dénouement .
The FDIC now fails to meet its required statutory minimum of 1.15 % of capital per insured dollar in deposits due to the ongoing mortgage and credit market carnage ; hence the hint for the life preserver thrown out by the FDIC to the Treasury Department the last week of August 2008 .
The FDIC , like Fannie and Freddie , says , " Of course we will pay this loan back when everything returns to normal . "
The accounting " profession " and " civil servants " at the CBO et al .
are likely to give their seal of approval to an FDIC bailout with the assurance that " all is well " in the short run .
In fact , the bailouts of Fannie , Freddie , and the FDIC in the long run by themselves are likely to be as effective as the Niedermeyer character from the movie Animal House was in attempting to stop the John Belushi–triggered stampeding crowd at the end , pitifully screaming , " Remain calm , all is well . "
As in the case of Fannie and Freddie , the FDIC promise to repay the taxpayers when things return to normal is worthless , because there was nothing normal about the real estate and associated credit bubble in the first place .
The FDIC , Fannie and Freddie will assure everyone that " the public will receive its money back when the assets of failed banks , etc. … are sold . "
That is unhelpful nonsense .
By definition , a bubble is an economic disequilibrium caused by the excessive creation of money in relation to the intrinsic value of the asset class to which the money is drawn .
In long - run equilibrium , therefore , the money stock ( and therefore asset prices ) must return to their productively useful value in relation to the size of economic output , or the general price level must rise to restore the fundamental relationships between the marginal utilities of goods and their prices : Mises 101 .
In other words , in the case of the fallout from the real - estate and associated credit bubbles , either housing and bond prices must fall dramatically , or there must be a dramatic increase in inflation , or a ( convex if you will ) combination of the two .
This is not rocket science , whatever the sophists of the political class would have us believe .
Without wishing to cause a panic , the situation is actually significantly worse than the mere bailout of Fannie , Freddie , and the FDIC would suggest , once one places the bailouts in their proper historical and political contexts .
For the last sixty years , the United States has provided military protection for the European and Asian capitalist powers , all possessing economies governed by regulatory apparatuses analogous in character to the apparatuses of the American postwar New Deal .
These apparatuses , especially when coupled to fiat money , have in common the fundamental flaw that they create economic instability via moral hazard .
This provision of American military protection has been supported by the imperial tribute of the acceptance of paper dollars — dollars at first theoretically backed by gold .
Of course , this charade , described by Robert Triffin in 1960 , ended in 1971 with the collapse of the Breton Woods system , exposing holders of dollars to massive losses and causing the Great Inflation of the 1970s .
Through the 1970s and 1980s , the United States did not abandon the course of empire , or statist regulation , but instead expanded , especially the imperial side of the interventionist mentality and especially in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Whatever the deregulation of other sectors of the economy , the financial sector — due to its role in imperial finance — retained its peculiar regulatory privilege through its ability to generate unlimited losses at taxpayer or dollar - holder expense .
This expanded American empire was , for a time , bizarrely aided by the People 's Republic of China as part of an industrialization policy in which the Chinese sterilized the purchase of dollars by massive domestic security sales to soak up excess liquidity .
This is a strategy that is rapidly running out of steam and has created a dangerous inflation in Chinese real - estate and stock prices that is unlikely to end well .
Japan , capitalist - oriented East Asian and to a lesser degree Western central banks , the oil states , and Russia ( yes , Russia ) also purchased huge quantities of dollar - denominated assets from the 1990s onwards , with the effect of subsidizing the Pax Americana — probably because alternative security arrangements seemed more expensive .
Alas , that willingness to subsidize the United States would seem to be rapidly waning .
Russia 's recent assertiveness is a hint of things to come , as more and more foreigners are taking a hard look at their subsidization of an America living beyond its means .
The stocktaking economic signal globally is the increasingly punishing foreign - credit - related losses caused by the Fed 's last imperial bubble , a credit bubble that has infected the entire planet .
It was fun for the United States in the short and medium run , since , at least in the 1980s , the United States got to have its imperial cake and shopping - mart icing too .
The United States thereby avoided having to deal with the fundamental disequilibrium between both the federal government 's promised expenses versus expected revenues , as well as the associated disequilibrium between American living standards and economic productivity .
That era is coming to a close , with the increasing amplitude in the financial oscillations of the world economy at lower frequencies , demonstrating systemic instability dating , at the latest , to the Asian financial crisis of 1998 .
In response to that crisis and to concerns over Y2 K , and with especially intense initiation at the time of the LTCM fiasco ( an event itself of course made possible by the intrinsic moral hazard of Greenspan and the postwar regulatory mentality ) , the Fed lowered rates , thereby pushing the tech - stock bubble into a final frenzy .
Raising rates in 1999 to combat Fed - fiat - money generated inflation , the creature from Jekyll Island succeeded in crushing the NASDAQ et al. , and , in the process , generating a global economic downturn .
In 2002 , now concerned about deflation , the Fed took rates to absurdly low levels , thereby generating the housing bubble .
Worried about inflation in 2006 , in which the housing bubble was the inevitable consequence of trying to maintain American asset prices and output valuation at nonequilibrium levels , Greenspan 's fall guy Bernanke took rates up , killing the housing bubble , and then took rates down while revving up the printing presses to stave off a credit - market collapse .
This leads us to the current juncture with Fannie , Freddie , and the FDIC , and what Mises would clearly identify as the " policy " trap .
Viewed in isolation , the Fed can take rates neither substantially up nor down .
If it fights its own inflation by taking rates up , it sends the economy into a depression .
If it fights a credit - contraction - generated recession with lower rates , it risks a hyperinflation and a run on the dollar .
If the federal government were to try to use any more fiscal stimulus on the tax or spending side , the Ricardian equivalence theorem would apply to an entity with a present discounted budget deficit / solvency problem of $ 30 trillion dollars .
That is , there will be minimal effect .
A bump in second - quarter GDP changes nothing about the long - run picture , and in equilibrium actually means merely a shift of output from the future to the present ; it is , however , popular with politicians under the electoral gun and Wall Street types looking for suckers .
In other words , Mises would point to the bailouts of Fannie , Freddie , and the FDIC as the hint that a general system event had arrived , in which we need a new policy mentality .
Mises would clearly see the solution to the fiat - money - generated world disequilibrium as a global return to a commodity - money standard with 100 % reserve banking as the only monetary policy rule and a banking order that avoids the disequilibria generated by the politically motivated manipulation of the money supply .
Although the author was trained in a very different mentality , he now sees an irreducible truth in the argument that , under the current discretionary monetary policy arrangements , we keep observing the same cycles in under and overextension of credit , because the political temptation to do so is overwhelming .
In the long run , when monetary authorities around the globe play the same game — and especially when the use of that credit is so often indirectly used to finance war — the results of central - bank activities are likely to be so poor in terms of system risk that the seemingly radical step of a return to commodity - based money and a new reserve order for the banking system might well be the most responsible step to take , provided that the move is done in an orderly fashion .
Given the need to avoid an implosion of the world political order , such a transition would probably have be created in conjunction with negotiations with our foreign creditors for a new gold - based monetary order to avoid a panicked run on the dollar , amid attempts to attack a grossly overextended American imperial position .
In the regulatory field , what is needed at a minimum is the effective creation of an adults - only area where losses are credibly understood as not subject to a Greenspan - like put in order to permanently rid ourselves of the " heads I win tails you lose " financial - system externality that is getting increasingly expensive and disruptive .
Although this analysis of the meaning of the FDIC bailout in its broader consequences cannot be regarded as cheery — and , to some , may seem radical — human beings do poorly when imitating ostriches , and any of the alternatives available to policy makers are likely to be gratuitously destructive in character .
The two Spice Girls live just a few miles apart , but they are " very different , " says Scary
Friendship never ends ?
That ’s not exactly true , admits Melanie Brown , who says she does n’t speak regularly to her fellow Spice Girls .
“ We ’re not in touch much , ” she tells the new issue of British magazine Closer .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
And that includes Victoria Beckham – even though the two former bandmates live just a few miles apart in Los Angeles .
“ Victoria and I are very different , ” Brown explains .
“ People bracket us together because we live in the same city and we ’re both interested in fashion .
Victoria ’s fashion line has been very successful and hopefully mine will be too .
But that ’s where the similarities begin and end . ”
The performer – who has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and is working on her own fashion line , Catty Couture – says her children are her main focus .
( She is mom to daughters Phoenix Chi , 9 , and Angel Iris , 1 – who was famously fathered by Eddie Murphy . )
The " Gamer 's Bill of Rights " and the Future of DRM
I wrote this in August of last year : I should receive notification when a copy protection program installs itself .
I should be told its name .
I should also receive notification every time it connects to the Internet , and if it sends data , I should be told what it 's sending .
If I uninstall the game , and I have no other game using this method of copy protection , then the copy protection program should be fully and completely removed from my system .
Completely ....
The biggest problem , of course , is that we have no rights as consumers .
Nothing 's spelled out on the box in regards to this kind of bullshit , and we can't return the game .
Last Thursday , Brad Wardell of Stardock released this :
We the Gamers of the world , in order to ensure a more enjoyable experience , establish equality between players and publishers , and promote the general welfare of our industry hereby call for the following : 1. Gamers shall have the right to return games that do n't work with their computers for a full refund .
2 . Gamers shall have the right to demand that games be released in a finished state .
3 .
Gamers shall have the right to expect meaningful updates after a game 's release .
4 .
Gamers shall have the right to demand that download managers and updaters not force themselves to run or be forced to load in order to play a game .
5 .
Gamers shall have the right to expect that the minimum requirements for a game will mean that the game will adequately play on that computer .
6 .
Gamers shall have the right to expect that games wo n't install hidden drivers or other potentially harmful software without their express consent .
7 .
Gamers shall have the right to re-download the latest versions of the games they own at any time .
8 . Gamers shall have the right to not be treated as potential criminals by developers or publishers .
9 .
Gamers shall have the right to demand that a single - player game not force them to be connected to the Internet every time they wish to play .
10 .
Gamers shall have the right that games which are installed to the hard drive shall not require a CD / DVD to remain in the drive to play .
Is this self - serving and a thinly - diguised marketing effort to promote Stardock ?
Yes .
Is it also dead - on in almost every case ?
Yes .
In other words , it 's both self - serving and correct .
What I think is most interesting about this is that someone from inside the gaming industry who 's published this list .
Yes , you can say that Stardock is on the periphery of the gaming industry , but they 're making award - winning , complex games for the PC , and those games are selling very well .
Because of that , this is awkward for the gaming industry .
It 's not some food - encrusted blogger with no life ranting about the gaming industry ( hey , I resent my own characterization of myself ) -- it 's someonesaying what everyonehas been saying for years .
Really , the only thing the gaming industry can do is ignore this , because trying to argue that any of this is unreasonable is almost impossible .
Well , except the point about meaningful updates , because I do n't expect any meaningful updates for a game that 's been released in a finished state .
In a marketing sense , this is a brilliant move .
It 's the " little man " developer standing up to the " big man . "
It crystallizes the " we 're on your side " position that Stardock has been promoting to the consumer for years .
I'm very curious to see if anyone in the gaming industry responds in any substantive way .
I doubt it very much , but if they do , it should be very interesting .
That 's the short view .
The long view , though , is potentially much more interesting .
I read an article yesterday titled The On-line Music Ripoff ( thanks for the link , Sirius ) , and in the article DRM was described as a " disaster . "
I think that 's fair , but what 's particularly important to note is that it 's been a disaster for both consumersthe music industry .
Would anyone have predicted three years ago that Amazon would be offering DRM - free music on their website ?
I doubt it , because the music industry slogan seemed to be " to the death with DRM .
" It 's a funny thing about death , though -- the closer it gets , the better compromise looks , and the music industry found itself faced with a strange paradox : while DRM undoubtedly reduced the number of people whomusic , it also reduced the number of people whomusic .
Industry growth was anemic , and the only real driver remaining was digital music .
Here 's the takeaway : crisis drives change .
In the gaming industry , PC gaming DRM is in much the same cluster - * uck situation that the music industry 's been in for years .
There are so many different standards for copy protection that it 's impossible to even catalogue them all , seemingly .
DRM on the consoles works because its turnkey to the consumer , but on the PC , it 's anything but that .
We never know what the hell is getting installed on our systems or what it 's doing , and that pisses most of us off .
It 's so bad , in fact , that what we desperately need as consumers is a game database that lists the form of copy protection used for every existing and upcoming release .
It would spell out exactly what gets installed by each copy protection scheme , and it would tell us under what situations a program gets activated or tries to pass information back to the publisher .
It 's very difficult , on the surface , to believe that PC game publishers would ever abandon the present system .
And for now , that 's true , because the gaming industry is still growing every year .
When the lean times come , though , and they will , the gaming industry will go through the same kind of painful self - examination that the music industry 's gone through .
Look , the goal of gaming publishers is to make money .
It 's business .
No matter what they say about philosophies and fairness , none of that matters a bit .
What matters is the long green .
Gaming publishers actually have more possibilities for post - purchase revenue , by far , than music companies , and at some point , I think they 're going to start focusing on the size of the pie instead of protecting individual slices .
If somehow DRM does survive for the next five years , I think it survives because a universal standard is adopted by the industry .
In other words , one application that gets installed on the PC , not half a dozen from different companies .
Anything else , in the long run , is going to fail .
US drone ' kills six ' in Pakistan
Pakistani troops are deployed against militants in tribal areas A suspected pilotless American drone has fired missiles in a border area of Pakistan , killing at least six people , Pakistani intelligence officials say .
Officials said a house was hit near the town of Mir Ali in North Waziristan and nine people were also injured .
Some reports say the missiles were fired after the drone was shot at .
A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan told the BBC News website that he " was not aware " of a drone attack taking place .
The Pakistani army has not commented on the incident .
Haven Tension between the US and Pakistan has increased over cross - border incursions against militants by American forces based in Afghanistan .
North Waziristan is known as a haven for Taleban and al - Qaeda fighters who enter Afghanistan .
Foreign fighters from Uzbekistan , Afghanistan and the Middle East are all thought to be based there .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says that , according to some reports , the house of a local Taleban leader was struck near Mir Ali , but the reports are not confirmed .
She says there is no clear indication as to who was killed in the missile strike .
The United States has stepped up missile attacks from drones in the region in recent weeks .
It says that they are used against militant targets , but our correspondent says that sometimes intelligence failures have led to civilian casualties .
Shot down
Such attacks seem likely to continue as long as US and Nato forces in Afghanistan believe that Taleban and al - Qaeda forces are taking refuge in Pakistan 's tribal areas , our correspondent says .
BORDER TENSIONS 3 Sept : First reported ground assault by US troops in Pakistan - Islamabad responds furiously 15 Sept : Pakistani troops reportedly fire in air to stop US troops crossing in S Waziristan 17 Sept : Top US military chief Adm Mike Mullen visits Pakistan to calm tensions 16 Sept : Pakistan says it was not told of fresh US missile strike 22 Sept : Pakistani troops in fresh firing to deter US incursion into N Waziristan , officials say 25 Sept : Pakistani troops fire warning shots at Nato helicopters on border with Khost
The Afghan - Pakistan militant nexus US attacks raise stakes in Pakistan Last week , the Pakistani army said it was investigating the wreckage of a suspected US spy plane found in South Waziristan , although it dismissed suggestions the aircraft had been shot down .
Pakistan has protested to Washington about US strikes into its territory , including a raid by commandos on 3 September in which several Pakistanis were killed .
Pakistani and US troops are also reported to have exchanged fire across the border last week .
President Asif Ali Zardari has said he will not tolerate violations of his country 's territory .
But in a statement released on Monday , the US State Department affirmed " its support for Pakistan 's sovereignty , independence , unity , and territorial integrity " .
The statement was released after a meeting in Washington between the US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi .

What are these ?
Last night my wife and I were sitting in the den and I said to her , ‘ I
never want to live in a vegetative state , dependent on some machine and fluids
from a bottle to keep me alive .
That would be no quality of life at all , If
that ever happens , just pull the plug . ’
So she got up , unplugged the computer , and threw out my wine .
She ’s such a poophead sometimes .
Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild , a top fundraiser for Hillary Clinton and a member of the Democratic Party ’s Platform Committee , announced today that she was throwing her support behind Republican John McCain .
Lady de Rothschild has been a long time and devoted supporter of Clinton ( saying about Hillary ’s run for the presidency “ I ’ve been waiting for this since Bill Clinton left office , frankly ” ) , so it is not too surprising that she is a bit disappointed in Clinton ’s loss in the Democratic primary to Obama .
Even so , some of her reasons for supporting McCain are incredibly ironic :
Talking about Obama in July , Rothschild told CNN “ frankly I do n’t like him .
I feel like he is an elitist ” .
I am amazed at the chutzpah of any Rothschild , and especially Lady de Rothschild , calling someone else “ elitist ” .
Lady de Rothschild has been described by the Wall Street Journal as a “ New York Socialite ” and the Washington Post as an “ aristocrat ” , and met her future husband Sir Evelyn de Rothschild at the secretive and elite Bilderberg conference , where the matchmaker was none other than Henry Kissinger .
Lady de Rothschild also claimed that Obama was “ too far to the left ” , even though in a ranking of all Senators by seven major liberal groups , Clinton was rated more liberal than Obama .
And in a similar ranking of all Senators by eight major conservative groups , Obama was rated more conservative than Clinton .
Rothschild also said that she was excited about the prospect of a woman being in the White House , even though they disagree on most issues .
Rothschild is pro-choice and Palin is decidedly pro-life .
最近『初めてのRuby』を読んでいる。Pythonのメソッドの第一引数にselfを書かなくてはいけないが、Rubyと対比して理由がなんとなく分かったので検討してみる。
まずPythonで はRubyと同様、インスタンスメソッドとトップレベル関数の区別がない。Pythonではメソッドと関数という呼び方をする。関数およびメソッドは単なるオブジェクトの属性である。つまりメソッドはクラスオブジェクトのcallableな属性、関数はモジュールオブジェクトのcallableな属性である。Pythonでも全てがオブジェクトなので、この区別をしないということが重要となる。
ここで、以下のクラス定義を考えてみる。
>>> class Foo : ... a = 1 ... def foo ( self ) : ... a ... Foo .a ... self .a ...
クラス内に関数を定義した場合、ローカル変数(グローバル変数)、クラス変数、インスタンス変数の区別を考えなくてはならない。Rubyでは変数の頭に「何も付けない」、「@を付ける」、「@@を付ける」で構文上区別している。Pythonでは以下のようになる。
1. クラス内で関数を定義すると属性になるので、クラス内で変数を定義しても属性とする
属性なので 、Foo. a のような構文で参照させる
2. 次にローカル変数( グローバル変数)とそれ以外のクラス変数、インスタンス変数を区別するため以下のようにする
3. self をどうにかしないといけない
しかし 、Pythonではメソッドと関数の区別がない。メソッド「定義」だけ特殊にしたくない
そこで、メソッド( となるべき関数 ) では「 第一引数に自分自身のオブジェクトを表すselfという引数を付ける」という決まりを作る ( selfという名前でなくても良い ) すると、定義するときにメソッドと関数の区別をする必要がない
しかし、メソッド呼び出しの度に第一引数にインスタンスを渡すのは面倒なので、インスタンスからクラス内の関数を参照した場合、第一引数に自動的にインスタンスオブジェクトが渡されてカリー化されたメソッドに自動的に置き換わるという仕組みになっている
ここで、ポイントとしてはRubyのようにselfは省略可とした場合、インスタンス変数に特殊な構文を用意しない限り、ローカル変数とインスタンス変数の区別がつかなくなってしまう。構文上区別しなくても良いが、lookupの規則が複雑になり遅くなる。また同じ変数名が使用できないという制限も付いてしまう。なので通常は違うものであるとして区別したいので、selfを導入するしかない。
4. Rubyのような暗黙のselfはどうだったのか？

Author ’s note :
It is beyond the scope and space available in this blog to fully explain how important solar energy has always been .
For this reason , much of the information here is meant to be a LINK to other information , and is connected to it through hyperlinks to other web pages .
To better understand how important solar energy is , it is strongly advised that you click on some or all of these links .
Each one will open a new window , so you will be able to return easily to this article , and continue along the train of thought it offers .
— Roger
Solar energy is the most abundant form of power in the universe .
By definition , every solar system contains at least one colossal generator of raw energy .
Galaxies are composed of millions or even billions of solar power plants , and there is no known form of life that does not depend on it , either directly or indirectly .
The very air we breathe is a byproduct of solar energy acting upon the planet .
Even nocturnal plants and animals , which ca n’t bear to be exposed to direct sunlight , could n’t exist without solar energy .
Even most things which are poisoned by direct solar energy depend on it to fuel their growth , or provide their food .
For humanity , solar energy is not just a viable choice , it has been the only option all along .
Primitive man discovered this truth .
He learned that crops had to have enough sunlight to grow tall and strong , and produce the largest crops .
He discovered that plants demanded sunlight , and converted it into grains and grasses , fruit and foliage , vegetables and vineyards , and from these things came everything else he needed to live and prosper .
Longer days had warm sun rays , and the shortest one was found in the dead of winter .
In many ways , primitive man knew more than most of us alive today , even though he lacked the wisdom to tie the links together , or the ability to record his findings for posterity .
But this is nothing new .
We all learned the basic truth of all existence in grade school , and most of us promptly left that knowledge in the same crowded classrooms .
We graduated from our educations , and moved into our 5 day work weeks with 9 - 5 jobs , and never again questioned why the modern world , with its abundant electricity , is still tied to a pattern of activity in the light , and dormancy in the dark of night .
For most of us , the sun is little more than a consequence of existence , and very few acknowledge why it is the gods of the light that rank highest among the dieties of myth and legend .
As a child in the 1970 ’s , I heard the first rumors of global warming , and learned such novel terms as ecosystem and food chain .
And I wondered , even then , how something as huge as a burning star could be overlooked as the most feasible way to live in harmony .
I ca n’t recall the times I ’ve tried to patiently exlain the chain of events the sun makes possible for us , and it is difficult to relate the blank , bored stare of those I tried to convince .
Thirty - odd years later , and global warming has turned our only recourse into a demon , and those who think of the sun do so with a bottle of sunscreen in hand , and either excitement or a faint inflection of resentment in their tone .
And no one seems to be able to comprehend that the sun , instead of being our enemy , is the only real source of power we have ever had .
Without the sun , there could be no fossil fuels .
Our seasons would have long since blended into a frozen , lifeless period of perpetual darkness , and the complex chemical reactions that form natrual gases would have stalled , frozen on a wasteland of ice colder than dry ice , and just as inhospitable .
Today , I hear again and again how solar energy is not an affordable solution to the world ’s problems .
And I bear the uncomprehending glare of those who are simply unable to see that we ca n’t afford not to use the sun .
No matter how basic the connection is , humanity seems unwilling to recognize that there is n’t another way , that there has never been another way , and that no matter how far through the cosmos we will ever go , everything we will encounter is either a product or source of solar energy , whether it be hydrogen fuel , biofuels , or the fuels which form nuclear reactions .
Not even the wind that blows through the trees would exist without the power of sunlight .
Take a cue from the totem poles and mythological dieties of ancient times , and recognize the sun for what it truly is – the only true source of energy mankind will ever know .
I was water - skiing with my children in a light drizzle off Hyannis , Mass . , last month when a sudden , fierce storm plunged us into a melee of towering waves , raking rain , painful hail and midday darkness broken by blinding flashes of lightning .
As I hurried to get my children out of the water and back to the dock , I shouted over the roaring wind , “ This is some kind of tornado . ”
The fog consolidated and a waterspout hundreds of feet high rose from the white ocean and darted across its surface , landing for a moment on a moored outboard to spin it like a top , moving toward a distant shore where it briefly became a sand funnel , and then diffusing into the atmosphere as it rained down bits of beach on the harbor .
For 24 hours , a light show of violent storms illuminated the coastline , accompanied by booming thunder .
My dog was so undone by the display that she kept us all awake with her terrified whining .
That same day , two waterspouts appeared on Long Island Sound .
Those odd climatological phenomena led me to reflect on the rapidly changing weather patterns that are altering the way we live .
Lightning storms and strikes have tripled just since the beginning of the decade on Cape Cod .
In the 1960s , we rarely saw lightning or heard thunder on the Massachusetts coast .
I associate electrical storms with McLean , Va. , where I spent the school year when I was growing up .
In Virginia , the weather also has changed dramatically .
Recently arrived residents in the northern suburbs , accustomed to today ’s anemic winters , might find it astonishing to learn that there were once ski runs on Ballantrae Hill in McLean , with a rope tow and local ski club .
Snow is so scarce today that most Virginia children probably do n’t own a sled .
But neighbors came to our home at Hickory Hill nearly every winter weekend to ride saucers and Flexible Flyers .
In those days , I recall my uncle , President Kennedy , standing erect as he rode a toboggan in his top coat , never faltering until he slid into the boxwood at the bottom of the hill .
Once , my father , Atty .
Gen. Robert Kennedy , brought a delegation of visiting Eskimos home from the Justice Department for lunch at our house .
They spent the afternoon building a great igloo in the deep snow in our backyard .
My brothers and sisters played in the structure for several weeks before it began to melt .
On weekend afternoons , we commonly joined hundreds of Georgetown residents for ice skating on Washington ’s C&O Canal , which these days rarely freezes enough to safely skate .
Meanwhile , Exxon Mobil and its carbon cronies continue to pour money into think tanks whose purpose is to deceive the American public into believing that global warming is a fantasy .
In 1998 , these companies plotted to deceive American citizens about climate science .
Their goal , according to a meeting memo , was to orchestrate information so that “ recognition of uncertainties become part of the conventional wisdom ” and that “ those promoting the Kyoto treaty ... appear to be out of touch with reality . ”
Since that meeting , Exxon has funneled $ 23 million into the climate - denial industry , according to Greenpeace , which combs the company ’s annual report each year .
Since 2006 , Exxon has cut off some of the worst offenders , but 28 climate - denial groups will still get funding this year .
Corporate America ’s media toadies continue to amplify Exxon ’s deceptive message .
The company can count on its hand puppets -- Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , John Stossel and Glenn Beck -- to shamelessly mouth skepticism about man-made climate change and give political cover to the oil industry ’s indentured servants on Capitol Hill .
Oklahoma ’s Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe calls global warming “ the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American public . ”
Now John McCain has chosen as his running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a diligent student of Big Oil ’s crib sheets .
She ’s something of a flat - earther who shares the current administration ’s contempt for science .
Palin has expressed skepticism about evolution ( which is like not believing in gravity ) , putting it on par with “ creationism , ” which posits that the Earth was created 6,000 years ago .
She used to insist that human activities have nothing to do with climate change .
“ I ’m not one ... who would attribute it to being man-made , ” she said in August .
After she joined the GOP ticket , she magically reversed herself , to a point .
“ Man ’s activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming , ” she told Charles Gibson two weeks ago .
Meanwhile , Alaska is melting before our eyes ; entire villages erode as sea ice vanishes , glaciers are disappearing at a frightening clip , and “ dancing forests ” caused by disappearing permafrost astonish residents and tourists .
Palin had to keep her head buried particularly deep in an oil well to ever have denied that humans are causing climate change .
But , as Upton Sinclair pointed out , “ It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it . ”
Palin ’s enthusiastic embrace of Big Oil ’s agenda ( if not always Big Oil itself ) has been the platform of her hasty rise in Alaskan politics .
In that sense she is as much a product of the oil industry as the current president and his vice president .
Palin , whose husband is a production operator for BP on Alaska ’s North Slope , has sued the federal government over its listing of the polar bear as an endangered species threatened by global warming , and she has fought to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Alaska ’s coast to oil drilling .
When oil profits are at stake , her fantasy world appears to have no boundaries .
About American ’s deadly oil dependence , she mused recently , “ I beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we ca n’t drill our way out of our problem . ”
I guess the only difference between Sarah Palin and Dick Cheney is ... lipstick .

As a formerly dumbed down Democrat , I start this blog to counter the division created by the left / right paradigm .
There are the the Elite and then there are the rest of us .
This left / right paradigm is used to divide and conquer .
This technique is as old as time .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and current chief McCain economic advisor tells Fortune columnist Matt Miller in a forthcoming book , The Tyranny of Dead Ideas , that the next President is simply going to have to raise taxes .
Joe Klein has an advance copy of the book and the details :
" If you do nothing on the spending side , you 're going to have to raise taxes whether you 're a Republican , a Democrat or a Martian , " he tells Miller ... and then he immediately makes it clear that the " spending side " part of the argument is nothing more than a political fig - leaf .
" It 's arithmetic . "
Federal revenue today is 18.8 percent of GDP and federal spending is 20 percent .
Holtz - Eakin observes that " the pressure are there " to lift spending [ on entitlement programs , mostly ] and taxes to 23 or 24 percent of GDP by around 2020 , and to as much as 27 percent if health costs remain out of control .
Miller does the arithmetic : that 's an annual tax hike of $ 550 to $ 700 billion , well beyond the range of any spending cuts that McCain has or might propose .
( Those vaunted earmarks cost about $ 20 billion per year . )
So how come , with this guy on board , the McCain campaign is still pushing tax cuts and more tax cuts even if they are fiscal suicide ?
" It 's the brand , " he said , " and you do n't dilute the brand . "
How 's that for cynical ?
Of course , the book is n't out until after the elections .
Klein may well think Holz - Eakin is ' an honest man " , but to me he looks like just another Republican hack willing to deceive about McCain 's economic policies and their impact .
He has been doing the rounds of the likes of Forbes magazine pushing McCain 's tax - cut budget and while admitting that it's " not exactly revenue - neutral , " saying that it 's a pro-business plan .
However , he also told the wonks at the Center for American Progress that McCain 's plan would " make deficits expand up front , no question " .
Expert economists at the the Center for American Progress Action Fund seriously questioned McCain 's deficit - funded corporate - welfare budget because in the short - run such tax cuts are the least cost - effective stimulus among 13 options , andin the medium or longer - run , the effect on growth of deficit - financed tax cuts “ tends to be small ” .
Obama , of course , says that his greater tax breaks for the less well off would be paid for by tax increases on those in upper tax brackets , especially those earning over $ 600,000 a year .
Anderson Cooper recently explained the differences in tax proposals very simply on CNN :
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update finds John McCain maintaining his five - point lead versus Barack Obama among registered voters , 49 % to 44 % .
McCain led Obama by five percentage points in Monday 's report on the strength of a six - point increase in the percentage of voters choosing him on the presidential trial heat following the Republican National Convention .
McCain's 49 % support in today 's three - day rolling average , based on Sept. 6 - 8 interviewing , is unchanged from Monday 's report and matches McCain 's high mark in Gallup tracking to date .
Gallup polling in recent days has been quite stable , showing McCain ahead of Obama by similar margins in each of the last four individual days of nightly tracking .
McCain also had a 4 - point lead over Obama among registered voters in the separate USA Today / Gallup Poll conducted this past weekend .
The GOP convention has clearly altered the structure of the race for now , which had shown Obama consistently ahead in the Gallup Poll Daily tracking updates for all but a few days from the time he clinched the nomination in early June until the end of last week .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
While the increased vote share a candidate receives following his convention usually diminishes , candidates who lead after the second convention usually remain the leader a month after the convention .
This is based on a review of historical Gallup data since 1964 -- the first year for which Gallup could reliably measure convention bounces .
The only possible exception to this general pattern occurred in 1980 , when Jimmy Carter had a slim one - point advantage after the Democratic National Convention but he and Ronald Reagan were exactly tied one month after Carter was nominated for a second term .
Thus , if Obama regains the lead over the next month , he will be bucking the historical trend .
Admittedly , most of the elections since 1964 were not as competitive as this year 's election has been , but even in closely contested election years of 1988 ( George H.W. Bush led by just four points after the GOP convention that year ) , 2000 , and 2004 the post - conventions leader usually held that position one month later .
However , for the most part past conventions were completed much earlier than this year 's late August and early September conventions , and this year the first debate between the presidential candidates will take place just three weeks after the last convention .
That could give Obama an opportunity to change the race in his favor if he has n't done so before then .

LONDON ( AP ) 
The Church of England owes Charles Darwin an apology for its hostile 19th - century reaction to the naturalist 's theory of evolution , a cleric wrote on an Anglican website launched Monday .
The Rev. Malcolm Brown , who heads the church 's public affairs department , issued the statement to mark Darwin 's bicentenary and the 150th anniversary of the seminal work On the Origin of Species , both of which fall next year .
Brown said the Church of England should say it is sorry for misunderstanding him at the time he released his findings and , " by getting our first reaction wrong , encouraging others to misunderstand ( Darwin ) still . "
The Church of England said Brown 's statement reflected its position on Darwin but did not constitute an official apology .
The church 's stance sets it apart from fundamentalist Christians , who believe evolutionary theory is incompatible with the biblical story of the Earth 's creation .
Darwin was born into the Church of England , educated at a church boarding school and trained to become an Anglican priest .
However , his theory that species evolve over generations through a process of natural selection brought him into conflict with the church .
The Church of England did not take an official stance against Darwin 's theories , but many senior Anglicans reacted with hostility to his ideas , arguing against them at public debates .
At an Oxford University debate in 1860 , the bishop of Oxford , Samuel Wilberforce , famously asked scientist Thomas Huxley whether it was through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed to be descended from a monkey .
Critics included the Rev. John Stevens Henslow and Adam Sedgwick , both scientists who had taught Darwin at Cambridge .
Sedgwick wrote that he found some of Darwin 's ideas " utterly false and grievously mischievous . "
Brown said that from a modern perspective , it was hard to avoid the thought that the reaction against Darwin was based on what would now be called the " yuck factor ... when he proposed a lineage from apes to humans . "
Brown called for a " rapprochement " between Christianity and Darwinism .
The bishop of Swindon , Lee Rayfield , who also is an immunologist , said religion and science were not mutually exclusive .
He said he opposed Christians for whom " evolution is equated with atheism " as well as Darwinists who felt ideas about evolution " completely undermine any kind of credibility for God . "
" That 's completely wrong , " he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio .
" It 's a false polarization . "
This is not the first time a cleric or a church has been pressed to apologize for past actions .
In 1992 , Pope John Paul II said the Roman Catholic Church was wrong to condemn astronomer Galileo Galilei for maintaining that the Earth is not the center of the universe .
The Church of England said sorry two years ago for its role in the trans -Atlantic slave trade .
Still , a descendant of Darwin's said the Anglicans ' latest bout of soul - searching served little purpose .
" Why bother ? " the scientist 's great - great - grandson Andrew Darwin was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail newspaper .
" When an apology is made after 200 years , it 's not so much to right a wrong , but to make the person or organization making the apology feel better . "

OTTAWA – The latest polling results suggest Stephane Dion 's Liberals continued to lose ground during the opening week of the federal election campaign .
According to The Canadian Press Harris - Decima survey , Liberal support slipped to 24 per cent , a full 17 - points behind Stephen Harper 's Conservatives at 41 per cent .
The NDP and Green party made modest gains at the Liberals ' expense , ending the week at 16 per cent and 10 per cent respectively .
The Liberals were ahead of the pack only in Atlantic Canada , with an eight - point lead over the Conservatives .
In Quebec , the Bloc Quebecois led with 36 per cent , followed closely by the Conservatives at 30 per cent , the Liberals at 16 per cent and the NDP at 10 per cent .
The telephone poll of 1,200 Canadians was conducted Sept. 9 through Sept. 12 and is considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.9 percentage points , 19 times in 20 .
More information on the poll is available from www.harrisdecima.ca.
Respondents to the poll were asked : " If a federal election were held tomorrow , who do you think you would be voting for in your area ? "
Last night ’s POWERBALL draw produced no jackpot winners , which means the big prize hits the $ 200 million mark , easily the biggest jackpot being offered in the world .
There were nine players who matched the first five white ball numbers for a $ 200,000 prize : 1 from Indiana , 1 from Kentucky , 1 from Missouri , 1 from Montana , 1 from North Carolina , 1 from New Hampshire , 1 from Pennsylvania , 1 from Tennessee and 1 from Wisconsin .
Saturday night ’s lump sum take home will be whopping $ 101.1 million , minus taxes .
Friday ’s Mega Millions jackpot is $ 24 million .
Talking about Mega Millions , two weeks ago , the winner of the Aug. 29 , 2008 $ 133 million draw came forward , after consulting with business experts .
In fact , they came forward as a corporation , and that ’s a pretty smart thing to do .
The name of the corporation is Carrollton SHM LLC .
The name makes sense , since the winner , Frank Mack Skinner ’s family , hails from a little Georgia town named Carrollton .
Carrollton is about 60 minutes west of Atlanta towards the Alabama line .
West Georgia College is located in Carrollton .
Frank Skinner said he buys tickets , as a general rule , to help kids go to school .
In Georgia , lottery profits contribute to HOPE scholarships .
Now , the family will be able to put their kids ( and future grandkids ) through school using their own money … and then some .
The Carrollton resident , who will split the more - than $ 82 million lump sum cash payout with his wife and their three children , plans to more than just that , he want to help other kids go to school .
Kids who might not be able to afford it .
Skinner , waited about three weeks before telling lottery officials they had the winning ticket .
Phyllis Skinner bought the family ’s Quick Pick ticket at Mableton Chevron , in Mableton , Georgia .
“ The ticket was bought by my wife Phyllis , which is rare but she did buy them that evening , ” Skinner explained .
“ I guess it was lucky .
Over the years individual members of the family have all bought tickets representing the family , and it evolved into a tradition . ”
Winning numbers were : 21-25-26-50-51 and the Mega Ball was 22 .
The family partnership , he said , was a result of the poultry processing plant his father formed in the 1940s .
That plant is now part of the Pilgrim ’s Pride chicken company .
Skinner said the money wo n’t change his family .
“ We wo n’t be buying any Porsches , ” he said .
“ And my wife wants to keep her $ 28,000 a year job at [ Carrollton ] High School . ”
Enlarge By Bart Nagel , Nanosolar CEO Martin Roscheisen 's company , Nanosolar , says it can turn out rolls of thin , relatively inexpensive solar panels at a rate of 100 feet a minute .
The nation is turning to alternative energy as never before amid concerns about global warming and runaway fossil - fuel prices .
Wind and solar power , for example , each grew 45 % last year , while the U.S. consumed 633,000 barrels of ethanol a day in June , up 43 % from a year earlier .
But alternative energy has not broken into the mainstream because of myriad roadblocks .
Solar energy , for example , is expensive .
Wind power is available only when the wind blows .
But hundreds of companies are working to overcome the obstacles .
Through June , venture capital investments in alternative energy companies this year totaled $ 980 million , up 92 % from a year earlier , says Dow Jones VentureSource .
Here are four technologies that show promise :
Thin - film solar panels : Printing process cuts down on the cost of silicon , a key material Here 's one way to bring down the price of solar energy : make churning out solar panels as easy as printing a newspaper .
That 's precisely what start - up Nanosolar has done .
The company says it 's poised to be the first among dozens of manufacturers to make solar competitive in price with conventional electricity .
While solar - system costs have fallen , they 're still about 20 cents to 30 cents per kilowatt hour , or more than twice the price of electricity from your local utility .
That 's largely because traditional solar - system makers use expensive silicon as a semiconductor to generate electricity from sunlight .
Thin - filmmakers have pushed down costs by using a tiny fraction of the semiconductor .
But most still employ a slow and expensive condensation method to attach the semiconductor onto a base .
Yet with production volumes rising , solar energy generally is expected to be competitive with grid electricity in 2010 or after .
Nanosolar , a Northern California company , says it can achieve that next year because of its printing process .
It embeds tiny semiconductor particles in ink , then coats a layer of it onto mile - long rolls of aluminum foil , which is later cut into solar panels .
The company says it can turn out panels at a rate of 100 feet a minute , 20 times faster than typical thin - filmmakers at a tenth of the cost .
" It 's all about higher throughput , " to more cost - efficiently leverage fixed labor and equipment costs , Nanosolar CEO Martin Roscheisen says .
In December , Nanosolar opened a factory in San Jose that 's capable of pumping out 430 megawatts of solar capacity a year , nearly the size of an average coal - fired power plant .
It plans to produce huge solar panels for cities and other utility - scale users this year and target businesses and homes next year .
Consultant Paul Maycock of Photovoltaic Energy Systems says Nanosolar 's systems " could be one of the more exciting products " in solar energy 's history .
But he says the company has not delivered the production volumes it promised a few years ago .
Roscheisen would not discuss its output , noting Nanosolar is private .
E - Coal :
No greenhouse gas in coal substitute Imagine an electricity source that kind of looks like coal and packs all of coal 's energy punch but is cheaper and produces no greenhouse gas emissions .
That 's what Seattle - based NewEarth Renewable Energy says it developed with E - Coal .
It 's biomass made from plants or other organic waste and heated to boost its energy content .
" We can produce ( clean ) fuels that are pound - for - pound replacements for coal , " NewEarth CEO Ahava Amen says .
In 2004 , after making a small fortune in cosmetics , Amen and some former associates reunited to tackle global warming .
They hunted for a substitute for coal , the biggest greenhouse gas producer .
Biomass emits carbon dioxide when burned but absorbs the same amount in its lifetime .
Yet it yields a third to half of coal 's energy , raising fuel costs and limiting the size of current biomass power plants .
NewEarth boosts its energy content by placing the biomass in an oxygen - deprived chamber and heating it to 250 degrees .
The resulting solid is condensed , and unwanted gases and moisture are removed .
The heating process was invented decades ago , but Amen says NewEarth has made it cost - efficient .
It 's using as its feedstock a fast - growing plant , Nile reed .
Because the energy value equals coal 's , he says , there 's no need to spend millions to upgrade plant boilers .
Plus , he says , E - Coal costs 5 % to 40 % less than regular coal .
Initially , a utility likely would blend a small amount of E - Coal with its coal .
But Amen says a plant 's entire fuel stock can be replaced .
He says he 's negotiating with dozens of utilities .
Larry Joseph , former U.S. Energy Department official and investor in the company , says utilities are very cautious and want clear evidence they 're not going to harm their equipment .
Algenol : Company uses algae to make ethanol more eco-friendly Corn - based ethanol is getting slammed for straining the world 's food supply and contributing to global warming by encouraging the plowing of grasslands .
Cellulosic ethanol , a more eco-friendly version derived from switch grass or wood chips , is several years away .
Maryland - based Algenol says it can solve the problems by making ethanol from algae , starting next year .
The start - up recently agreed to license its technology to BioFields , which plans to build an $ 850 million saltwater algae farm in Mexico 's Sonoran Desert and churn out 100 million gallons of ethanol the first year .
It will sell the gasoline substitute to Mexico 's state - run oil monopoly .
A handful of companies are working on turning the abundant marine organism into biodiesel .
That requires growing algae and killing them to extract their oil , a time - consuming and expensive process .
Algenol adds enzymes to the organisms to enhance their normally limited ability to convert sugar into ethanol , a waste product .
To maximize ethanol production , the algae are placed in regions with abundant sunlight and grown in 50 - foot long tubes filled with seawater .
Ethanol is captured as a gas in the bottle and condensed to a liquid .
Since algae are n't destroyed , the same ones keep yielding ethanol , holding down costs .
Algenol CEO Paul
Woods says production costs are half those of corn - based ethanol , and the fuel will wholesale for $ 1 less than gasoline .
His goal : Woods wants to build 20 plants in sunny areas such as Texas and Florida to generate 20 billion gallons of ethanol by 2020 .
" We do n't have any limitations , because we 're not competing with the food supply , " Woods says .
Philip Pienkos , of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , says Algenol 's goal is " definitely doable . "
But he says there will still be a need for fuels with higher energy content than ethanol .
Compressed air : Facilities put stored air to work when wind dies
Wind farms are sprouting across the country as wind energy costs become competitive with those of coal - fired power plants .
But there 's a rub : no wind , no electricity .
Batteries can store electricity generated by wind for use on a day when the wind does n't blow .
But they 're expensive .
PSEG Global , a sister company of a New Jersey utility , says it has the answer .
It recently teamed with energy storage pioneer Michael Nakhamkin to market compressed - air technology .
Here 's how it works :
During off - peak hours , wind turbines compress air that 's stored in underground caverns or in more expensive above - ground tanks .
The air is released at peak periods to run turbines and generate power when gusts flag .
The nation 's only compressed - air generator was built in Alabama in 1991 .
PSEG says it has improved on the technology and hopes to deploy it with power providers .
PSEG says its advanced system can transform the industry .
It 's about half the price of batteries , partly because it uses off - the - shelf power - industry parts rather than customized compressed - air gear .
The technology is more than 25 % cheaper than current systems , says Stephen Byrd , president of PSEG Energy Holdings .
Also , it can generate electricity in five minutes , vs. current systems that take 20 minutes .
That 's vital if the wind suddenly stops blowing .
" It really is likely to further enable the growth of renewable " energy , Byrd says .
While the system is largely designed to supplement intermittent wind or solar power , it can be used to stockpile cheap electricity at night and use it midday when the grid is strained .
Energy consultant Stow Walker says it sounds promising , but finding suitable underground storage can be challenging .

From the 'we like Linux kinda / sorta files :
Adobe is joining the Linux Foundation as part of an effort to show its commitment to Linux .
Adobe is also now making its AIR platform available for Linux -- as an Alpha .
Finally there is also an update to the alpha version of Adobe Flex Builder 3 for Linux .
It sure sounds all fine and nice , but there is still is a major problem in my view .
Adobe does not lead with Linux , it barely stays even with Linux .
Adobe 's product releases for Linux ( proof of which are the AIR and Flex alphas ) typically follow those for other platforms .
In a quote on a press release issued by the Linux Foundation about Adobe 's decision to join the group , Jim Zemlin , executive director at
The Linux Foundation praises Adobe 's move .
" Adobe 's decision to join the LF is a natural extension of its commitment
to open standards and open source , which demonstrates its leadership and
foresight in the software industry , " said Jim Zemlin , executive director at
The Linux Foundation .
" Adobe 's membership will contribute to our goal of
increasing even more application development on Linux with a specific
emphasis on Web 2.0 applications . "
I would hope that Zemlin will encourage Adobe to now treat Linux as a first class citizen as opposed to an afterthought for release after Windows .
I hope Zemlin will pressure Adobe to finally actually make Flash -- not just the player -- but Flash CS3 Professional , ( the core Flash development tool ) available for Linux as a fully commercially available and supported product .
It is somewhat ironic in my opinion that Adobe can join the Linux Foundation , claim to support Linux and yet not offer its flagship Flash development tool on Linux .
Having the Flash Player , Flex and AIR are great steps , but what about those that want to develop Flash design using Linux -- as opposed to just deploying on Linux ?

Cafferty : Do n't cancel the debate Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday September 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Now is precisely the time for Senators McCain and Obama to have a debate , charged CNN 's Jack Cafferty this afternoon .
Furthermore , he said , if the ongoing wars are any indication , President Bush is not the salesman to pitch the proposed Wall Street bailout .
Cafferty asked : " Is he going to warn us about all the dire consequences if they do n't do this the way he warned us about all the dire consequences if we did n't invade Iraq ?
" With all due respect to the President , he could n't sell snow in South Africa in the middle of July , I do n't think .
If this is another , you know , ' give us $ 700 billion to do with what we want because you should be very afraid that if you do n't do it your world will come to an end , ' I do n't know how well that 's going to play .
He 's done this before -- he 's done it for eight years .
They 've used fear to pressure and leverage the Congress and the public into getting whatever they wanted on a whole raft of issues . "
While Senator McCain is suspending campaign ads and fundraising to " focus " on proposed legislation to bail out failing Wall Street banks to the tune of $ 700 billion , Cafferty said that the American people ought to hear the presidential candidates ' plans and be able to gauge their capabilities to run the country .
Part of this perspective can be provided by keeping the Friday engagement and discussing the issues .
" What I do n't understand is this , " Cafferty said : " Why does John McCain want to cancel the debate ?
The two men who want to be President of the United States , I would be interested in hearing them have a discussion about what their ideas are for leading this country through what is arguably the biggest financial crisis we 've encountered maybe since the Great Depression .
Why does n't he want to talk about it ? "
" [ McCain ] has n't cast a vote in Congress since April , " Cafferty balked .
" He 's not going to be working on the legislation .
The debate is scheduled between the two men who want the job of running the country .
I do n't understand the logic of saying ' let 's cancel the debate . '
I want to hear what these guys have to say about what they 're going to do about the problem that the country has . "
" The public wants to know which one of these men is capable of leading the country , " he added .
" They 'll learn more about that by listening to them have a debate about the issues . "

NREL ( TGW ) – Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) have set a world record in solar efficiency , creating a solar cell that is 40.8 % efficient at converting light , compared to the previous record of 40.7 % .
The scientists used a variety of methods to improve efficiency : “ The cell uses compositions of gallium indium phosphide and gallium indium arsenide to split the solar spectrum into three equal parts that are absorbed by each of the cell 's three junctions for higher potential efficiencies , ” the lab said in a press release .
This lets the cell be efficient at different spectrums .
The cell hit the efficiency under the amount of light concentrated on was equal to 326 suns – the amount of sunlight that hits the earth in 326 days .

If the programs are removed , the software makers gain no value out of the $ 2 to $ 10 they typically pay HP and others to install them on each PC — and PC makers miss out on their cut from revenue - sharing deals .
But Best Buy , the nation ’s largest electronics retailer , tells computer buyers that the preinstalled software , also known as bloatware , can clutter their machines and slow them down .
“ You ’d be surprised how often consumers tell us to get rid of it , ” said Robert Stephens , the head of Geek Squad , the technical support division of Best Buy that removes the software .
He declined to say how many people were paying for the service , but said that “ it ’s going to increase in popularity . ”
The demand for the service , along with similar offers from Circuit City and other chains , reflects an outpouring of consumer frustration with the way that a brand - new computer can feel as if it is full of digital infomercials — even if those come - ons knock a few dollars off the PC ’s price tag .
The Web has dozens of do - it - yourself guides to removing such software , which , as one tutorial puts it , “ turns your computer into a messy battleground . ”
Mr. Stephens said the personal computer makers should be worried about the demand for less cluttered computers .
“ No matter what manufacturers want , we ’ll give consumers what they want , ” he said .
But he added that he believed computer makers would find different ways to profit :
“ While they may be scared by these trends , they ’ll be O.K . ”
As it turns out , HP , the world ’s largest technology company , is already working on a fundamental change in the way it packages software on its new computers , and thus how its business model works .
Stephen DeWitt , who oversees HP 's personal computer business in the Americas , said that starting next year the company ’s new computers would point users to a Web site where they can buy and download games , productivity software and other programs .
Revenue from the site will be split in some fashion among HP , a retailer like Best Buy and the makers of the software .
Mr. DeWitt said the change would cut how much software comes preloaded .
Mr. DeWitt said this was happening because consumers were demanding something different , but also because the technology was now in place to allow downloading of software on demand .
For now , he said , the benefits to consumers of the free software far outweigh whatever small slowdown it might cause .
And he said Best Buy ’s cleanup service was not pressuring HP to move to a new model .
“ There ’s no tension coming from Best Buy on this — none , ” he said .
But in Best Buy stores in Northern California , there is clear evidence of the different agendas of Best Buy and the computer makers .
The stores display two HP computers , identical except that one desktop is cluttered with software icons from eBay , Quicken , AOL , Yahoo and others , while the other is entirely cleaned up .
Best Buy workers use the display to promote the company ’s $ 30 “ optimization ” service .
Industry analysts said that the planned change in HP ’s approach could well reflect Best Buy ’s growing influence — and its ability to exact new concessions from computer makers .
They said Best Buy has benefited from two key changes : the declining fortunes of competing retailers like CompUSA and some large regional chains , and the addition to its shelves in the last year of computers made by Dell and Apple .
Bob Kaufman , a spokesman for Dell , said , “ This is an evolving story and Dell is evaluating how it can best deliver software to its customers . ”
Best Buy ’s offer to remove software began in 2006 .
But recently the toll its policies are taking has heightened considerably , analysts and industry executives say .
“ Best Buy ’s sway is definitely growing , ” said Matt Fassler , an industry analyst who covers Best Buy for Goldman Sachs .
He said the company had good relationships with computer makers , and , while it would n’t seek to harm those relationships , “ if they have a strong competitive position , it is incumbent on them to use it . ”
Mr. Fassler estimates Best Buy will have sales of $ 44 billion this year .
Of that , $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion will be from the sale of HP computers , analysts estimated .
One important question is whether the new model being developed by HP will be as profitable as the current one .
Mr. DeWitt said he expected it to be more profitable .
But A. M. Sacconaghi Jr. , an industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company , said the change could imperil HP ’s profitability , in part because there is no guarantee that consumers will buy software offered through HP instead of another site .
As software buying moves online , Mr. Sacconaghi asked , “ what makes a consumer go to HP.com over Google ? ”
He also says the challenge for personal computer makers is that they are losing control of what shows up on PC screens — a form of real estate that they have used to sell billboard advertising for software .
“ They no longer have that real estate advantage , ” he said .
“ There ’s a substantial profit pool at risk . ”
And there can be little profit to begin with , analysts said .
The profit margin on many personal computers can be 5 percent or lower , depending on the model .
The margins are slim in part because of intense competition that has driven down prices .
In some cases , the computers are profitable only because their makers earn $ 30 or more for each computer for preinstalling the software , according to Shaw Wu , an industry analyst with American Technology Research .
And J.P. Gownder , an analyst at Forrester Research , said , “ For the average PC , that could be the entire margin . ”
Without the preloaded software , Mr. Gownder said , “ it could put them in the red .
That ’s why they ’ve become so addicted to it . ”
Mr. Stephens of Geek Squad says he agrees with HP that the future is in allowing computer buyers to choose and download what they want .
But he said he believed Best Buy , not H. P. , was in the best position to help people choose what works for them because , he argued , the in - store technicians are in closest contact with them .
“ Geek Squad agents have one thing over Apple and Microsoft engineers .
We spend most of the day talking to people , ” he said .

Sorry , vegetarian and vegan Eat Drink Better readers .
This tip is for the omnis !
We recently made the move from a vegetarian kitchen to a sometimes - omnivorous kitchen .
Without getting into the nuances of both my husband and my ’s food preferences , we ’re more likely to eat at home if I cook meat sometimes , and I ’d rather save the money and eat at home where I can control ingredients .
One thing I recently tried as part of this new arrangement was cooking a whole chicken .
Why deal with a whole chicken when you can buy the convenient prepackaged boneless skinless breasts ?
Because you can save a ton of money by buying a whole bird .
Find out how , after the jump …
A whole bird costs a fraction per pound that chicken parts .
I either buy a local bird ( still cheaper than store - bought breasts ) at the farmers ’ market , or I wait until organic chickens go on sale at the supermarket .
Either way , wait until you can get a deal , then buy a few to freeze .
You can get at least three meals from one chicken , four depending on the size of the bird .
Here ’s how :
When we ’re ready for chicken , I ’ll roast a whole bird ( it ’s much easier than you would think ! ) and we ’ll eat that for one meal with roasted veggies .
We save enough pieces for one leftover meal of chicken pieces .
Then , I shred any other leftovers , plus any meat picked from the bones / carcass , and freeze for either tacos , salad , or pasta .
The carcass also gets frozen and then made into stock , which can be used to make soups or risotto .
Boom , four meals .

The country is understandably focused on the financial crisis .
But there is another serious issue in front of us that is not getting nearly enough attention , and that ’s whether Sarah Palin is qualified to be vice president  or , if the situation were to arise , president of the United States .
History has shown again and again that a vice president must be ready to assume command of the ship of state on a moment ’s notice .
But Ms. Palin has given no indication yet that she is capable of handling the monumental responsibilities of the presidency if she were called upon to do so .
In fact , the opposite is the case .
We know that there are some parts of Alaska from which , if the day is clear and your eyesight is good , you can actually see Russia .
But the infantile repetition of this bit of trivia as some kind of foreign policy bona fide for a vice presidential candidate should give us pause .
The McCain campaign has done its bizarre best to shield Ms. Palin from any sustained media examination of her readiness for the highest offices in the land , and no wonder .
She has been an embarrassment in interviews .
It ’s a theater of status .
Professional wrestling is n’t about wrestling , of course .
It ’s about who ’s up and who ’s down .
The stated rules are there to be broken by some of the participants , and it ’s not professional in any useful sense related to the sport of wrestling .
And the metaphor is powerful in many areas of life .
But we ca n’t understand the metaphor without understanding the forms of status that are on offer .
There is the status of affiliation .
This is about belonging , about knowing and living with the rules .
It ’s about weaving together the culture and this affiliation leads to a form of popularity .
And then there is the status of dominance .
This is about winning at any cost , cheating and subjugating .
It ’s about unraveling the culture in service of just one aim–victory over the others .
Professional wrestling creates tension between the two forms of status .
We know that we all benefit from affiliation , but often are swayed by the avenging dominator if we see ourselves in them .
The theater of status happens in our daily lives .
It ’s who sits where at the meeting , or who gets to announce that the Zoom session is over .
It ’s the insurgent and the status quo .
It ’s the dramatic back and forth between someone who seeks power and someone who is tired of being told what to do .
The successful affiliator does n’t seek to out - dominate the dominator .
Instead , affiliators weave together enough persistent community pressure to get things back on track .
And sooner or later , people realize that the triumph of the dominator , while it can be painful , is short - lived .
Hey !
I have a great idea .
Why not start a holiday tradition of delivering these delicious cinnamon rolls to your friends and cohorts ?
This ingredient shopping module is created and maintained by a third party , and imported onto this page .
You may be able to find more information about this and similar content on their web site .
Growing up , my mom always made these for her good friends at Christmastime , and you could literally hear the primal groans of pure joy rising from the rooftops of our town .
I ’ve carried on the tradition through the years and have won friends and influenced people just by delivering these rolls .
They really are that good .
*** This is the original Cinnamon Roll recipe !
All other sweet roll recipe variations that I do come from this .
Let ’s start by making the dough .
Mix 1 quart of whole milk , 1 cup of vegetable oil , and 1 cup of sugar in a pan .
" Scald " the mixture ( heat until just before the boiling point . )
Turn off heat and leave to cool 45 minutes to 1 hour .
Go fold laundry or sculpt or play Twister with your mailman or something .
When the mixture is lukewarm to warm , but NOT hot , sprinkle in 2 packages Active Dry Yeast .
Let this sit for a minute so the yeast gets all warm and moist and happy .
Then add 8 cups of all - purpose flour .
Stir mixture together .
Cover and let sit for at least an hour .
Go throw away the rest of your wrapping paper or build a Lego Rottweiler or do Yoga or watch Home Shopping Network and order a frozen pizza oven for your countertop or some cellulite cream .
After an hour , the dough will look like this .
Now add 1 more cup of flour …
1 heaping teaspoon baking powder …
And 1 " scant " ( less than a full ) teaspoon baking soda and 1 heaping tablespoon of salt .
Stir mixture together .
At this point , you could cover the dough and put it in the fridge until you need it — overnight or even a day or two , if necessary .
Just keep your eye on it and if it starts to splurge out of the pan , just punch it down .
Or , of course , you can just go ahead and make the rolls .
Let ’s do that , shall we ?
Sprinkle surface generously with flour .
Take half the dough and form a rough rectangle .
Then roll the dough thin , maintaining a general rectangular shape .
Rectangle should increase in both width and length as you roll it out .
Here ’s my beautiful , weird , lovely , delightful friend , Hyacinth .
She came over to make cinnamon rolls with me .
Ain’t she purty ?
Now drizzle 3 / 4 to 1 cup melted butter over the dough .
Do n’t be shy ; lay it on thick , baby .
You know you want it .
Oh , by the way ?
This is not non-caloric .
In case anyone asks .
Now sprinkle 1 cup of sugar over the butter …
… followed by a generous sprinkling of cinnamon .
Now , starting at the opposite end , begin rolling the dough in a neat line toward you .
Keep the roll relatively tight as you go .
Some of the butter / sugar / cinnamon mixture may ooze out toward the end , but that ’s no big deal .
Next , pinch the seam to the roll to seal it .
Does n’t Hyacinth have lovely hands ?
Spread 1 tablespoon of melted butter in seven round , foil cake or pie pans .
Then begin cutting rolls approximately 3 / 4 to 1 inch thick and laying them in the buttered pans .
Repeat this process with the other half of the dough .
This recipe makes approximately seven pans of rolls .
Let the rolls sit for 20 to 30 minutes to rise , then bake at 375 degrees until light golden brown , about 15 to 18 minutes .
While the rolls are in the oven , make the deliciously sinful maple frosting .
To a mixing bowl , add 1 bag of powdered sugar .
To this , add about 2 teaspoons maple flavoring …
1/2 cup milk ...
1/4 cup melted butter …
… and 1/4 cup of brewed coffee .
Also add 1/8 teaspoon ( a generous pinch ) salt .
Then have a big , strong , virile man stir it up for you .
I chose Marlboro Man .
The mixture should be thick but pourable .
Taste and adjust as needed .
Generously drizzle frosting over warm rolls after you pull them out of the oven .
And take a walk on the wild side .
Do n’t be afraid to drown them puppies .
Be sure to get frosting around the perimeter of the pan , too , so the icing will coat the outside of the rolls .
These are not non-caloric .
Did I mention that ?
The frosting will settle in and become one with the cinnamon rolls .
And you ’ll be another step closer to being the most popular person in town …or the jiggliest , depending on whether you choose to deliver the rolls to friends or lock yourself in your pantry and eat them all by yourself .
Not that I ’ve ever done that , mind you .
I do n’t ever do things like that .
I ’m a model of self - discipline .
And I do n’t have time to do such things —
I ’m too busy doing the Stairmaster .
Yeah , that ’s me —
Miss Will Power .
I do n’t ever consume wasted calories .
And if I do , I ’m always vigilant about compensating with a higher activity level and weeks of fasting .
And all .
Go forth and conquer !
Yes you can .
And report back to me .
You want a scary thought ?
Imagine a fanatic in the mold of Dick Cheney but without the vice president ’s sense of humor .
In her important new book , “ The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , ” Jane Mayer of The New Yorker devotes a great deal of space to David Addington , Dick Cheney ’s main man and the lead architect of the Bush administration ’s legal strategy for the so - called war on terror .
She quotes a colleague as saying of Mr. Addington : “ No one stood to his right . ” Colin Powell , a veteran of many bruising battles with Mr. Cheney , was reported to have summed up Mr. Addington as follows : “ He does n’t believe in the Constitution . ”
Very few voters are aware of Mr. Addington ’s existence , much less what he stands for .
But he was the legal linchpin of the administration ’s Marquis de Sade approach to battling terrorism .
In the view of Mr. Addington and his acolytes , anything and everything that the president authorized in the fight against terror  regardless of what the Constitution or Congress or the Geneva Conventions might say  was all right .
That included torture , rendition , warrantless wiretapping , the suspension of habeas corpus , you name it .
In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low - income consumers , the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders .
The action , which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets -- including the New York metropolitan region -- will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans .
Fannie
Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring .
Fannie Mae , the nation 's biggest underwriter of home mortgages , has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits .
In addition , banks , thrift institutions and mortgage companies have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to so - called subprime borrowers .
These borrowers whose incomes , credit ratings and savings are not good enough to qualify for conventional loans , can only get loans from finance companies that charge much higher interest rates -- anywhere from three to four percentage points higher than conventional loans .
' Grim ' Afghanistan Report To Be Kept Secret by US White House has " no plans to declassify " new national intelligence estimate .
September 23 , 2008  -- US intelligence analysts are putting the final touches on a secret National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Afghanistan that reportedly describes the situation as " grim " , but there are " no plans to declassify " any of it before the election , according to one US official familiar with the process .
Officials say a draft of the classified NIE , representing the key judgments of the US intelligence community 's 17 agencies and departments , is being circulated in Washington and a final " coordination meeting " of the agencies involved , under the direction of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , is scheduled in the next few weeks .
A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , Vanee Vines , said " it is not the ODNI 's policy to publicly comment on national intelligence products that may or may not be in production . "
The finished secret NIE would be sent to the White House and other policy makers .
Mike McConnell , the director of National Intelligence , has made it his policy that such key judgments " should not be declassified " , although several have recently , including a report on Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
" That does not portend that this is going to become a standard practice , " McConnell said it a guidance memo last year .
Seth Jones , an expert on Afghanistan at the Rand Corporation think tank , called the situation in Afghanistan " dire . "
" We are now at a tipping point , with about half of the country now penetrated by a range of Sunni militant groups including the Taliban and al Queida , " Jones said .
Jones said there is growing concern that Dutch and Canadian forces in Afghanistan would " call it quits . "
" The US military would then need six , eight , maybe ten brigades but we just do n't have that many , " Jones said .
Last week , Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told Congress " we 're running out of time " in Afghanistan .
" I 'm not convinced we 're winning it in Afghanistan , " Adm .
Mullen testified .
Perhaps foreshadowing the NIE assessment on Afghanistan , Adm . Mullen told Congress , " absent a broader international and interagency approach to the problems there , it is my professional opinion that no amount of troops in no amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek in Afghanistan . "
The limited number of US and NATO troop in Afghanistan has been a recurring theme during the 2008 Presidential election and a dire assessment in a new NIE could make the Bush administration 's handling of the situation there a campaign issue in the final month of the campaign .

The Rocket Man , Yves Rossy , known by those in the know as Fusionman , took flight today in a successful voyage across the English Channel .
He was the first man to ever do this with a self - contained , homemade jet pack .
That 's right , we said jet pack , people .
A former Air Force pilot , Yves Rossy has spent much of his career flying thousands of people around the planet as a captain for SWISS .
But when Rossy is not flying planes , he is jumping out of them .
Freestyle , skysurf , freely – you name it , he has done it .
But no matter how daring , these adventure sports never fulfilled his childhood dream : to soar like a bird .
Not with a glider , but with a propelled fixed wing .
Appearing live on National Geographic Channel in Jet Man Live , Rossy will attempt to become the first person to cross the English Channel using a single , jet - propelled wing .
But hey , that 's not very " green " there Captain Turbine , now is it ?
Maybe not but the Fusionman 's " Wicked Pissa " coefficient pegs the Cool - o - Meter and you can bet he gets all the chicks .
So who cares ?

Serving Your Home Network on a Silver Platter with Ubuntu
By Shane Lazar
Linux has always been a good choice for a server OS .
In practical terms , however , this functionality has been out of reach for the everyday computer user , mainly due to the technical know - how required to manage a dedicated server OS .
On the other hand , our homes today are more filled with computers than ever before - and , in a multi - node network , a server can provide many benefits .
In this article , I am going to try to guide you in setting up a useful server for your home network , one that is headless ( i.e. , without monitor , keyboard , or mouse ) and can be stowed away neatly out of view .
This setup will be ideal for :
securely sharing a single Internet connection to multiple computers ,
streamlining of Internet traffic ,
providing a central file server in the home network ,
preventing bandwidth - hogging by P2P software ,
allowing easy remote administration of the server .
Hardware required :
Any old computer with commonly available components ( thus ensuring driver availability for it ) .
My own server is a Pentium III 800MHz with 256MB RAM , Intel chipset , an on - board graphic card , 2 Ethernet cards , 40 GB hard drive ( the larger the better , obviously ) , and a CD - ROM .
This is really overkill - you can use a Pentium I with 64MB RAM ( otherwise landfill material ) , and it would run moderately well .
The two network cards are required .
You can use a wireless card for your Local Area Network ( LAN ) , but make sure it has Linux drivers available .
An Ethernet hub with at least as many ports as there are computers you wish to connect ( including your server ) .
If you use a wireless LAN , you will not need this .
As much " straight through " Ethernet cable as you will need ( not required in a wireless setup ) .
The basic setup :
Internet <--> Ubuntu Server <--> Ethernet Hub <--> LAN Machines
Services we are going to be running on our system :
Let us dive right in !
1. Getting Ubuntu
Download the Ubuntu ( currently at version 7.04 , " Feisty Fawn " ) Server CD image from Ubuntu 's download page .
2. Making the installation CD
Burn the ubuntu-7.04 - server-i386.iso image to a CD using your favorite image - burning program .
Remember , burn the image ; do not extract the files from the image file .
If you are going to be using an old CD - ROM , burn the CD at the slowest possible speed , for reliability .
3. Installing Ubuntu on Your Server
Ubuntu is well known for having an easy installation process .
For now , plug in a monitor , keyboard , and the network cables ( Internet and LAN , both ) , put in the Ubuntu server CD , and boot up !
You may need to change your BIOS settings to allow booting from CD .
Select the hard disk installation , choose your desired language , then pick your country and keyboard .
Configure the network interface connected to the Internet , using one of 3 options : autoconfiguration , autoconfiguration with DHCP ( automatically assigned IP addresses ) , or manual .
Which one you choose really depends on your Internet connection ; ask your ISP , if in doubt .
If you have to configure manually , configure your Internet connection on the eth0 network card , for simplicity 's sake .
For partitioning , I recommend " Guided - use entire disk " , as it is a no- brainer , and accept the settings , thereby writing changes to disk .
Allow the system clock to be set to UTC .
Create the system administrator 's user account ; enter the full user name , account name , and administrator 's password ( which has to be verified ) .
Ubuntu will continue to install the base system .
Enter your ISP 's proxy server settings , if required .
When you are asked to choose the software to install , select both DNS and LAMP server .
You do this using the spacebar to check the boxes , cursor keys , and TAB , to navigate through the menu .
Complete the installation , reboot , and you will be presented with a command - line interface ( CLI ) prompting you to log in .
Use the administrator account name and password to do so .
Before we continue , I did mention that I would try to make this as simple as possible , and now you are probably wondering what you are doing in a CLI .
This is necessary , as we want our server to run as lean as possible .
After all , it is going to be stowed away in a closet , so who needs a fancy GUI ?
I promise we wo n't be spending much longer on the CLI .
A couple of tips for new users :
the cursor keys let you scroll through previous commands you entered ,
the TAB key is a God - send for its auto - complete function .
Type a couple of keys , hit the TAB key , and it will auto - complete or show you the valid commands or paths !
4. Checking Internet connectivity
First thing we will do on our new system is to check if we are connected to the Internet .
Do this simply by pinging Google .
ping www.google.com
Stop the pinging with Ctrl+C .
If all went well , you should be getting responses to your pings .
If not , try switching the LAN and Internet cables around .
Most probably , you will get a ping response by now .
Keep in mind which card your Internet is configured on , eth0 or eth1 , and modify the instructions accordingly .
In this guide , the Internet is on eth0 and the LAN is on eth1 .
5. LAN network configuration
Now , we will configure our LAN network card .
We will do this using vim , a CLI text editor .
Four simple commands you will use in vim are :
the I key , which will put you in Insert mode so you can edit the text file as in any other text editor ,
key , which will put you in Insert mode so you can edit the text file as in any other text editor , the Esc key , which exits you out of the Insert mode ,
key , which exits you out of the Insert mode , :w! , which saves / writes the file to disk ,
, which saves / writes the file to disk , :x , which exits the vim text editor .
Let us open our network configuration file with administrative privileges :
sudo vim /etc/ network / interfaces
You will be asked to enter the administrator 's password .
Navigate with the cursor key and add the following at the end of this file :
auto eth1 iface eth1 inet static address 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
If you need to change the configuration of your Internet connection , you should do this now in the eth0 section .
Restart your network interfaces using :
sudo /etc/ init.d/ networking restart
6. Update Ubuntu
Install any available updates by :
sudo apt - get update
and then
sudo apt - get upgrade
7. Installing Webmin
Now we will install the packages required for Webmin , the Web - based administration tool :
sudo apt - get install libnet - ssleay - perl openssl libauthen - pam - perl libio - pty - perl libmd5 - perl
Download Webmin :
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.350_all.deb
If this does not work , there is probably a newer version of Webmin .
Get the link to the latest *. deb file from the Webmin site .
Install it :
sudo dpkg - i webmin_1.350_all.deb
You will get the following output :
Webmin install complete .
You can now login to https://your-server-name:10000/
as root with your root password , or as any user who can use sudo to run commands as root .
And that 's it !
We are done with the CLI .
Log out :
exit
Now , you can disconnect the monitor and keyboard , stow your server away , and continue from your desktop machine on a beautiful Web - GUI !
8. Configure your LAN machines
However , before you do that , you will have to configure your desktop machine 's network card .
Set it up as follows :
IP address : 192.168.0.2 Subnet mask : 255.255.255.0 Gateway : 192.168.0.1 DNS server : 192.168.0.1
Your other machines would have incrementing IP addresses , e.g. , 192.168.0.3 , 192.169.0.4 , ...
9. Upgrade Webmin
Open your favorite Web browser and navigate to https://192.168.0.1:10000 .
Enter the administrator 's user name and password .
Welcome to the powerful Webmin !
On the tree menu on the left , go to Webmin > Webmin Configuration .
Click Upgrade Webmin , and , with " Latest version from www.webmin.com " selected , click the Upgrade button .
If there is an upgrade available , it will be installed for you .
10 . Shorewall Firewall
To install the Shorewall firewall , go to System > Software Packages and in the " Install a New Package " section , select " Package from APT " , enter shorewall , and click Install .
This may take some time , depending on your Internet connection , but Shorewall will be installed .
Now , go to Networking > Shorewall Firewall , and we 'll begin setting up your firewall .
Do not start the firewall yet , or you might lock yourself out of the server .
We will configure Shorewall section by section .
Network Zones :
This section defines zones to which we will assign " levels of trust " .
We will create three zones : the firewall , Internet , and local zones .
Click
Add a new network zone .
You will be provided with a number of options .
We are interested in the Zone ID field and the Zone type list .
For each zone , enter the options as follows , and click Create before returning to the page to create the next .
Zone ID = fwall ; Zone type = Firewall system
; Zone type = Zone ID = net ; Zone type = IPv4
; Zone type = Zone ID = loc ;
Zone type = IPv4
Network Interfaces :
This section tells the firewall which Ethernet card is connected to the Internet , and which one to the LAN .
In our case , we have only two interfaces .
Click
Add a new network interface , and again you will be presented with a vast array of options .
We will define only Interface , Zone name , and Broadcast address .
Here , also , you will have to setup one interface at a time , clicking Create before returning to configure the next .
Configure as follows :
Interface = eth0 ; Zone name = net ; Broadcast address = Automatic
; Zone name = ; Broadcast address = Interface = eth1 ; Zone name = loc ; Broadcast address = Automatic
Default Policies :
The default policies tell the firewall what to do with packets coming from various sources .
We will set it to drop all requests from the Internet , and accept all from the LAN and the firewall itself .
Click
Add a new default policy .
As before , we will define one policy at a time , clicking Create before proceeding .
Configure the policies as follows :
Source zone = net ; Destination zone = Any ; Policy = DROP
; Destination zone = ; Policy = Source zone = fwall ; Destination zone = Any ; Policy = ACCEPT
; Destination zone = ; Policy = Source zone = loc ;
Destination zone = Any ; Policy = ACCEPT
Firewall Rules :
This section defines specific rules for specific services .
We will enable them as the need arises , later .
TOS : This section optimizes Web browsing as much as you can on your end .
Click
Add a new type of service , and we will proceed to configure the services one by one .
Source zone =
Any ; Destination zone = Any ; Protocol = TCP , Source ports =
Any ; Destination ports = with the Ports or ranges radio button selected enter www ; Type of service = Maximize - Throughput
; Destination zone = ; Protocol = , Source ports = ; Destination ports = with the Ports or ranges radio button selected enter ; Type of service = Source zone =

This tells the server to forward requests from the LAN to the Internet , which is required for Internet connection - sharing .
Click
Add a new masquerading rule , and enter the following rule .
Outgoing interface = eth0 ; Network to masquerade = with Subnet on interface selected , choose eth1 ; leave the rest unchanged
When Stopped :
This allows machines whose IP addresses are specified to access the server even when the firewall is not running .
No other IP addresses will have access .
Add as many as you want , but there should be at least one , just in case .
In the example below , I have allowed access from two IP addresses on the LAN .
Click
Add a new stopped address , and configure as follows :
Interface = eth1 ; select Listed addresses and networks , and enter 192.168.0.2,192.168.0.3 and / or any other addresses you wish .
We do n't need to add any other settings .
Back on the Shorewall main page , click " Check Firewall " .
You should get the thumbs up .
Note that an " OK " result here does not guarantee the firewall will work properly , or will work at all .
It simply checks the rules syntax .
There is a security feature that prevents an unconfigured Shorewall from being started up , when booting .
This has to be changed manually .
For this , you will need a Java - enabled Web browser to do it using Webmin , or you could resort to using vim from the CLI .
What you have to do is change the line
startup=0
in the file / etc / default / shorewall to
startup=1
In Webmin , go to Others > File Manager .
This will give you a nice Java - based file manager .
Navigate to the above mentioned file , and click the " Edit " button at the top .
A text editor window will pop up .
( Disable pop - up blocker . )
Make the change , and then save and close .
Again , using this browser , browse to the file /etc/ shorewall/shorewall.conf , click " Edit " , and find the line IP_FORWARDING =Keep .
Change the value from Keep to On .
Save and close .
Now , let us make sure that Shorewall is set to start at bootup .
Go to System > Bootup and Shutdown , look for shorewall in the list .
Tick the checkbox , and click " Start Now and On Boot " at the bottom .
Go back to the Networking > Shorewall Firewall page , and you should see six buttons where there were previously only two .
Click " Show Status " , to verify that all is running well .
Your Internet connection sharing should be set up , now .
Try it out !
11 . BIND DNS Server
Ubuntu server pretty much does all the configurations necessary for a working BIND DNS server .
There is , however , one thing we can do to make the lookups faster .
We can tell our server to forward unknown requests to your ISP 's DNS server . [ 1 ]
Go to Servers > BIND DNS Server , click on " Forwarding and Transfers " , and , in the fields marked " Server to forward queries to " , enter the IP addresses of your ISP 's DNS servers .
Save , and click " Apply Changes " in the main BIND DNS server page .
12 . Squid Proxy Server
Now , we will move on to installing and setting up Squid as your caching proxy server .
Go to Servers > Squid Proxy Server .
Webmin will inform you that Squid is not installed on your system , and provide you with an option to install it using APT .
Click on the link ( labelled " Click here " ) provided , to install Squid .
Webmin will keep you informed of the progress and , once completed , will give you some information on the installed packages .
Go back to the main page for Squid , and now you should have a host of configuration tools available .
I will not explain all the options available , but , if you require more clarification , help is available at the top left of the tool 's page .
( You will have to disable your browser 's popup blocker . )
Ports and Networking :
Here we will tell Squid which port it will be listening on .
The default is port 3128 .
We will stick to this , but you can change it .
In the " Options for port " field , enter transparent .
This will make Squid a transparent proxy server , which eliminates the need to configure machines on your LAN .
Save the changes .
Memory Usage :
Here , you can define memory usage limits for Squid , or choose to go with the default settings .
I would draw attention to the " Maximum cached object size " option .
Here , you can define the maximum size of cached files .
Cache Options :
The option I would recommend you changing here is the " Cache Directories " one .
Squid defaults to a 100 MB cache , which is pretty minuscule for our caching proxy objective .
Decide how much of your hard disk you wish to use for the cache ; I use 5 GB out of my 40 GB hard disk .
In the " Directory " field , enter / var / spool / squid , " Type " as UFS , in " Size ( MB ) " , enter however much you decided on in megabytes , for the 1st - and 2nd - level directories , enter one of the following numbers ; 16,32,64,128 or 256 ( defaults being 16 and 256 , respectively ) .
These numbers basically define the file structure of your cache .
Read the help documentation , for more information on this and other options .
Save your changes .
Helper Programs :
In the " DNS server addresses " field , enter 192.168.0.1 , select the radio button , and save .
This tells Squid to send DNS requests to the BIND DNS server running on your server .
Access Control :
Here , we will define which LAN machines will be able to use Squid , by their IP addresses .
At the bottom of the " Access Control Lists " section , select Client Address from the drop down list , and click " Create new ACL " .
In the page that appears , enter a name of your choice in the " ACL Name " field ( e.g. , Local_Network ) , define the range of IP addresses you wish to grant access to , and the Netmask , e.g. , From = 192.168.0.2 , To = 192.168.0.7 , Netmask = 255.255.255.0 .
If you would like to grant access to all machines on your LAN , enter as follows ; From = 192.168.0.0 , To = * leave blank* , Netmask = 255.255.255.0 .
Save your changes .
Having defined the machines on our LAN , we will now tell Squid what to do with requests from these machines .
Click " Add proxy restriction " in the " Proxy Restrictions " section .
Select the " Allow " action , and the ACL you just created ( Local_Network ) from the " Match ACLs " list .
Save your changes .
Your new restriction will be at the bottom of the restrictions list , and , since they are effectuated in order , you will have to move your new rule up the list to third place .
Do this using the " Move " arrows , to the right of the defined restrictions .
For security reasons , we will create a new user named squid who will run squid .
Go to System > Users and Groups .
Click " Create a new user " , and enter the following ;
Username = squid ,
, Real name = squid ,
, Password =
No login allowed ,
, Primary group =
New group with same name as user ,
, Create home directory =
No ,
, Copy files to home directory =
No ,
, Create user in other modules =
Yes ,
Leave the rest unchanged .
Click " Create " .
Now , we will grant permissions to the user squid to write to our cache .
Go to Others > Command Shell , and execute the following command :
chown - R squid : squid / var / spool / squid /
Return to the Squid Proxy Server page .
Administrative Options :
In the " Run as Unix user " field , click the browse button , and select squid from the list of users .
In the " Visible hostname " field , enter the name of your server .
This you can find out from the " System Information " page in Webmin , as " System hostname " .
Save the changes .
Click " Initialize Cache " .
Once this terminates successfully , return to the Squid main page and click " Start Squid " .
Since we are making a transparent proxy server , we need to add some rules in the firewall , to redirect requests to pass through Squid .
Go to Networking > Shorewall Firewall >
Firewall Rules > Manually Edit File , and paste the following rule :
#squid transparent proxy redirect REDIRECT loc 3128 tcp www
If you changed the port Squid listens to , earlier on , use that port in this rule , instead of 3128 .
Save the changes , and Apply Configuration .
Test if your desktop machines have access to the Internet .
The difference between a simple Internet connection sharing and using a caching proxy is that frequently visited Web sites will load faster , as some content is stored on your server .
13 . Samba file sharing
Now , we 'll move on to installing and setting up Samba for file sharing to both Linux and Windows machines .
Go to Servers > Samba Windows File Sharing .
As was the case with Squid , Webmin detects that Samba is not installed , and provides an easy link to install it using APT .
Go ahead and click the link , to download and install Samba .
Once this is done , we will now configure file sharing .
Since we are sharing on a trusted network , we will setup our file server with read and write permissions for everybody .
Return to Servers > Samba Windows File Sharing , and , in the first section , click " Create a new file share " , then complete as follows :
Share name = enter whatever you would like to identify the share as ( I am using public ) ,
) , Directory to share = / home / public ,
, Automatically create directory =
Yes ,
, Create with owner = root ,
, Available = Yes ,
, Browseable = Yes ,
, Share Comment can be whatever you wish .
This will create the share public , with Read - only permissions for all .
Using Others >
File Manager , navigate to / home , select the folder public , and click Info .
In the info window that opens , in the Permissions section , select all the checkboxes for User , Group , and Other , thereby giving permission to everybody to read and write to this folder .
Now , navigate to /etc / samba , select smb.conf , and click Edit .
Look for the line
; security = user
and change it to
; security = share
Scroll down to the end of the file , to find the section which describes the share we just created , and edit it to it look like this :
[ public ] comment = public path = / home / public public = yes writable = yes create mask = 0777 directory mask = 0777 force user = nobody force group = nogroup
Save and close .
If you need to change your Workgroup , do that from the Windows Networking tool in the Global Configuration section on the Samba Windows File Sharing page .
Samba 's default workgroup is , ironically , MSHOME .
Click Restart Samba Server , and verify that you have access to the shared folder with read and write permission from your desktop machine , by creating and deleting a file in the share .
The only settings you will have to enter on your LAN machine to gain access are :
the correct workgroup ( Samba defaults to MSHOME ) ,
the server 's address which is 192.168.0.1 in our setup ,
in our setup , the name of the share which is public in our setup ,
in our setup , no username or password is required .
14 . TorrentFlux
For those of us who use Bittorrent for peer - to - peer file sharing , we will install TorrentFlux , which is a Web - based Bittorrent client .
Some of the advantages of using TorrentFlux include ;
running all Torrents on a single machine , so your workstations do not bear that load ,
other machines need not be left running solely for the Torrent connections ,
automatically sharing the downloaded files across the LAN ,
limiting of bandwidth usage of Torrent downloads ,
queueing of Torrent connections .
In your Web browser , go to the TorrentFlux Web site , and download the latest version of TorrentFlux .
In Webmin , go to Others > Upload and Download .
In the " Upload files to server " section , browse to the torrentflux _2.x.tar.gz file you just downloaded in the " Files to upload " field .
In the field " File or directory to upload to " , enter / var / www .
Select in the Extract ZIP or TAR files options the Yes , then delete radio button .
Click " Upload " to upload , and unpack TorrentFlux .
Using Other > File Manager , browse to the /var/www/torrentflux_2.x directory , and double - click the INSTALL file , to open it in your browser .
Read the instructions carefully .
First , and very important , we will set the root password for our MySQL database .
Note that this root user is different from the system root user .
The same applies to all MySQL users .
Go to Servers > MySQL Database Server , and click User Permissions from the Global Options section .
From the list of users , click on any of the instances of root .
In the password field , select Set to .. , and enter a password for the MySQL root user .
You may be asked to log in , after setting the password .
Repeat for all the other instances , with the same password .
TorrentFlux uses MySQL for its database features .
So , let us go ahead and create a database for TorrentFlux .
On the main MySQL page , click Create a new database .
In the " Database name " field , enter torrentflux and do n't make any other changes .
Click Create .
To create the required tables , click on the torrentflux database we just created , then click the " Execute SQL " button .
In the second section , which says " Select an SQL commands file to execute on database " , select " From local file " , and browse to the file / var/www/ torrentflux_2.x/sql/mysql_torrentflux.sql , click Ok , and then Execute .
Now , if you return to the table list , you will see that some tables have been created .
For security reasons , we will create a MySQL user specifically for TorrentFlux .
On the MySQL main page , click " User Permissions " , and then " Create new user " .
Enter the following , and make sure to select the appropriate radio buttons :
Username = torrentflux ,
, Password = * enter a password which you will add to the config .
php file later * ,
Hosts = localhost ,
Do n't select any of the permissions , and Save .
Now , we will allow this new user to modify the torrentflux database , only .
Back on the MySQL main page , click on " Database Permissions " , and then on " Create new database permissions " .
Remembering to select the appropriate radio buttons , select the following ;
Databases = torrentflux ( from the drop - down menu ) ,
( from the drop - down menu ) , Username = torrentflux ,
, Hosts = localhost .
For the permissions , hold the Ctrl key , and select the following ;
Select table data ,
Insert table data ,
Update table data ,
Delete table data ,
Create tables ,
Drop tables ,
Alter tables .
That 's it ; we 're done with MySQL !
Now , we will tell TorrentFlux about the database settings we have just implemented .
Using the Java browser , navigate to /var/www/torrentflux_2.x/html , select the config .
php file , and click " Edit " .
Modify the " Your database connection information " section , entering the correct settings .
Hints are provided .
It should look something like this :
$ cfg [ " db_type " ] = " mysql " ; // mysql , postgres7 view adodb / drivers /
$ cfg [ " db_host " ] = " localhost " ; // DB host computer name or IP
$ cfg [ " db_name " ] = " torrentflux " ; // Name of the Database
$ cfg [ " db_user " ] = " torrentflux " ; // username for your MySQL database
$ cfg [ " db_pass " ] = " * password for MySQL user torrentflux * " ; // password for database
Save and close .
Now , we will tell the Web server , Apache httpd , to serve TorrentFlux on port 80 .
Go to Servers > Apache Web server .
You should have a Default Server and a Virtual Server , set up for you already .
Click on the Virtual Server , and , at the bottom , in the " Virtual Server Details " section , make the following changes ;
Address = Any ,
, Port = 80 ( do n't forget to select the radio button ) ,
( do n't forget to select the radio button ) , Document Root = /var/www/torrentflux_2.x/html ( replace the " x " with your version number ) ,
and Save .
Then , on the Apache server page , click " Apply Changes " at the top right .
Now , in your browser , navigate to http://192.168.0.1 , and you should get the TorrentFlux login page .
Note that the username and password you enter here will create the administrator 's account settings .
Do n't forget these .
Choose wisely , and proceed to login .
You will be taken to the settings page , where we will change a few things .
Path = /home / public
Max Upload and Download rates : set these to your liking .
If you have broadband , I would suggest setting the max upload rate to 5 % of your total Internet bandwidth , and your max download rate to 40 % .
This should allow modest bandwidth for Web browsing , even with two Torrent downloads running .
Ultimately , the choice is yours .
Port Range = 40000 - 40010
Have a look at the other settings , and change them as you wish .
You can change them later , as well .
Click " Update Settings " .
There are " lights " that indicate problems in your settings .
All should be green .
Notice that TorrentFlux will download directly to our shared folder , giving instant access over the LAN .
A nice feature of TorrentFlux is queueing .
Click on " queue " at the top , and choose if you want to enable it , and define how many torrent connections you want to allow to run in total ( server threads ) and per user ( user threads ) .
Click " Update Settings " .
Going with the 40 % max download bandwidth per Torrent and allowing two connections total to run at a time still leaves 20 % of the bandwidth for Web browsing .
Use the " new user " page to create normal or admin users for any one you want to grant access to .
Other settings include search engine options and filters , external links , rss feeds , and database backups .
Adding torrents is done either by uploading from your desktop machine , pasting the URL of the torrent file , or searching using the available search engines .
Files will be saved in folders according to TorrentFlux usernames in the shared folder .
Now , we will open ports 40000 - 40010 in Shorewall for the Torrent software to work properly .
Go to Networking > Shorewall Firewall >: Firewall Rules >
Manually Edit File , and paste this rule at the end :
#torrentflux ACCEPT net $ FW tcp 40000:40010
If you wish to access your TorrentFlux from the Internet , e.g. , while at work , and have a static external IP address , simply open port 80 on the external firewall , by adding this rule :
# Apache Web server ACCEPT net $ FW tcp 80
Click Save , and then Apply Configuration in the Shorewall main page .
You can then access TorrentFlux from anywhere , by browsing to http://*your external IP address *
If you have a dynamic IP address , then you will also have to use a service such as that provided by Dynamic DNS , which is free .
Instructions for this are available on ubuntuguide.org .
Although they are meant to be done at the actual machine , you can do them through Webmin , running the sudo commands in Others > Command Shell and editing the dyndns_update file in the Java file manager tool .
One thing to be wary of is completely filling up your hard disk .
This will inevitably cause problems .
So , just make sure you have enough space , before you decide to run your Torrent session .
15 . System logs
Speaking of space , although system log files are useful in diagnosing problems , they sometimes occupy a whole lot of space .
We will now limit the size of the log files .
Go to System > Log File Rotation > Edit Global Options and set the " Maximum size before rotating " to 50 M ( for 50 MB ) and the " Number of old logs to keep " to 4 .
This should allow you to have decent system logs , without eating up all your disk space .
For a few days under normal use , keep an eye on the size of log files in / var / log using the Java file manager .
See which logs are huge , fiddle with their settings in System > Log File Rotation and System > System Logs .
Bear in mind that all that logging might be due to a real problem in your system .
In general , though , the debug logs are pretty massive , and not very important for our purpose , especially the ones that debug network traffic .
16 . Backing up Webmin configurations
Once you have set everything up , and all is working fine , it would be wise to backup your settings , in case you get too adventurous trying to fiddle around and break something , or even if you decide to change your server machine .
This will enable you to restore all your settings .
Shift
/home/*admin username*/backup-*date*.tar
Go to Webmin > Backup Configuration Files .
In the " Modules to backup " list , select all of them ( using thekey ) ; for the Backup destination choose Local file , and enter a path , e.g. , ; in the " Include in backup " section , check " Webmin module configuration files " and " Server configuration files " , and click " Backup Now " .
I recommend naming your backup files including the date , as choosing which one to restore from becomes easier .
If you wish , you can set up Webmin to periodically backup your configurations automatically , in the " Scheduled backups " section .
I set mine to backup up daily and weekly .
Previous scheduled backups are replaced , and only the latest one is kept .
Restoring is simply a matter of choosing which modules to restore , from which backup file , and whether the configurations should be applied .
17 . Updating your server
Once in a while , it would be wise to update your server to get the latest fixes and patches .
Do this by going to System > Software Packages , and in the " Upgrade all Packages " section , select :
Resynchronize package list =
Yes ,
, Upgrade mode = Normal upgrade ,
, Only show which packages would be upgraded =
No .
Click " Upgrade Now " , and it will all be done automagically , giving all the information about the upgrade .
Also periodic upgrades to Webmin , as we did at the beginning of this guide , are advisable .
Other tools
Some examples of other functionality you may be interested in including :
SSH will allow you log in to your server in CLI over any network , while keeping everything encrypted and secure .
I would recommend this , as everything else pales in comparison to the CLI , when it comes to control over your system .
using Apache HTTPd , to host your own Web sites in tandem with services like Dynamic DNS ,
Coppermine Gallery or Image Gallery Server , for sharing your photos online while keeping them off public services ,
hosting an FTP server , to share files over the Internet
using hotway and freepops , to get your Hotmail and Yahoo mail right in your e-mail client ,
The list is endless , really , from disk quotas to clusters , and to think we have only used a fraction of the features in Webmin !
Poke around !
It only gets more interesting , and besides ... what are backups for , anyway ?
As you may have gathered by now , administering a Linux server is not a brain - twisting business , as some may have you think .
Once you have everything set up to meet your needs , your LAN server / gateway should run like clockwork , requiring only occasional upgrades and maybe a pat on the back .
Moreover , Webmin makes it a pleasant point - and - click affair , although , like everything else , you have to know what it is you want to do .
This is where the vast documentation and help from the Linux community is priceless and indispensable .
With luck , everything has worked as expected , so far , and you now benefit from a free ( as in free speech ) , powerful , flexible , easy - to - manage , easy - to - use , and cheap solution to your home networking needs .
This , dear friends , is the brilliance of free and open source software !
[ 1 ] Rick Moen comments :
On balance , I 'd recommend against forwarding queries to one 's ISP 's nameservers .
At minimum , users should understand the tradeoff .
Declaring forwarders in BIND declares a list of nameserver IPs to consult on all lookups BIND cannot answer from its local cache , in preference to the various nameservers that are authoritative for those domains , that would have been otherwise consulted .
In the very short term , this gives you faster responses on early queries ( i.e. , for a short while after your local BIND instance fires up ) .
After a while , most likely queries will be hits on the local cache , making your relatively high speed of access to the ISP 's nameservers mostly irrelevant .
What you lose , through such forwarding , constitutes in my view a very serious drawback : you are making your DNS rely on the performance , reliability , and security of your ISP 's nameservers .
Most ISP nameservers turn out to have poor performance , are seriously lacking in performance and reasonableness of configuration , and have alarming security problems .
To be specific about some of those things :
Many ISPs appear to have deliberately overridden the Time to Live ( TTL ) values that would normally be shared with cached DNS records , to artificially prolong the life of that cached information even though it may have been sent with low TTL values to keep cached copies from being used after becoming obsolete .
The ISPs presumably do this , subverting the intended DNS - updating mechanisms , to reduce ( needed ) network traffic .
The worst problem is the security one : Studies such as Dan Kaminsky 's have shown that a large number of ISP nameservers are vulnerable to cache poisoning , a form of attack in which they are induced to cache fraudulent data .
This is especially true when those nameservers are used by forwarding nameservers in the fashion that this article describes .
The alternative , of course , is to just simply run your own recursive - resolver nameserver without forwarders , which by default will then get its data from the root zone and the immense tree of authoritative servers it defines .
Fortunately , this works just perfectly without touching anything at all , out of the box , and imposes no performance deficiencies once you 've started loading the cache .
I guess , overall , there 's an instinctive tendency in people to think " Let 's rely on the ISP 's services , because they 're the pros , and we should get better performance and reliability , that way . "
However , it turns out that , most often , none of those things is actually the case , and you can do much better on your own , with surprising ease .
One last suggestion : BIND9 is certainly a respected do - it - all nameserver , but is vastly overfeatured when all you need is a simple recursive resolver ( and , in particular , are n't serving up locally defined domains of your own , which is called authoritative service ) .
Also , BIND9 is infamously bloated and slow .
For all of those reasons , I long ago started keeping a catalogue of alternatives to BIND9 , and in all honesty cannot say which of them I 'd recommend , since I 've stayed with BIND9 despite reservations , but you might browse the alternatives .

Shane is a Medical Resident in Romania .
He has been a ardent user of FOSS and Linux since 2004 .
He spends a sizeable amount of time on Linux forums learning about it and helping others where he can .
Currently his favorite distro is Ubuntu , while he has used Mandrake / Mandriva in the past on his desktop and still does for his home network server .
With a grant from the World Anti-Doping Agency , University of Vermont anthropology professor Brian Gilley has spent the last year studying attitudes among under - 23 - year - old cyclists towards use of performance enhancing drugs .
Since the Tour de France ousted its third cyclist from the race , even after multiple doping scandals the last few years , his findings are interesting .
Using American amateur collegiate cyclists as his control , Gilley interviewed elite junior and young adult Italian , Belgian , and American riders and found a surprising mix of responses about willingness to dope .
The majority , he says , believe intense pressure from team managers and sponsors forces them to cheat in order to be competitive .
Some of Gilley 's findings delve into conspiratorial opinion , like that doping is part of a secretive , intentional long - term training regimen encouraged by European trainers for even very young cyclists and that pressure to dope is entrenched both in their national culture and within cycling culture .
He is willing to believe rider claims that sponsors are responsible for doping because they can get monetary benefits whether riders get caught or not : if they perform well sponsors gain through publicity and related product sales ; if a rider gets caught , the sponsor gains by taking the moral high ground and withdrawing support .
In order words , cycling is exactly the same scenario as every sport , every university and every business in the entire world .
He says it must be sponsorships causing the problem because collegiate riders view doping as a moral failure but approximately 20 % of American college cyclists say that they would dope if the stakes were high enough .
Not exactly a consensus .
What is his solution ?
An interesting one .
Basically he believes there should be two tiers in sports ; a higher level of professional competition in which doping is accepted as a given and then authentic amateur athletic competition across all sports .
If you can't change the cheating , change the rules ?
Google has recently launched Google Health , a place where you can organize health information , keep it up to date and stay current with the latest health issues .
We 're happy to say that Google Health was built with the Google Web Toolkit , and pleased to have Samantha Lemonnier from the Health team share her experience using GWT .
Google Health started to pick up speed around the time I first joined Google .
A few of us had whipped up a prototype in our 20 % time .
GWT naturally came into the picture as we tried to decide what we would use to build our client infrastructure : hand - written JavaScript with other internal JS libraries , or GWT .
We did n't jump right to GWT until we did our homework .
We loved the concept , but GWT was fairly new back then .
We were cautious about whether it was mature enough for a production - planned project like Google Health .
Since many of you are faced with these same decisions , I thought it might be useful to share a synopsis of that first email thread I wrote to the GWT team titled " GWT , to use or not to use " .
In it I included a link to our mock as well as 4 key questions :
Can we use GWT to accomplish all that was in the mock ?
How many browsers does GWT reliably support ?
Is i18n supported ?
How big is the GWT library that needs to be downloaded and how will it perform in the browser client ?
Scott Blum from the GWT team responded that " in general anything you can do in HTML , you can do with GWT " .
Joel Webber , one of the founders of GWT , added " Looking at the your mocks ... it appears as though you would want to fetch lots of information from the server during the course of interaction with the user , and to update both the form on the left and the results on the right interactively .
I think GWT would be an excellent way to do this " .
To get a better feel for what GWT development meant , I created a sample project to test the waters .
After exploring the widget library , I was able to build a functional prototype quickly .
I tried a bunch of different widgets and found that they are easy to use and extend .
The RPC calls were straightforward as well , and tied into the Servlet framework nicely .
I was very pleased with the result of the prototyping .
Scott also confirmed browser support for " Recent versions of Opera , Safari , and Mozilla / Firefox ; IE6 + " , which was satisfactory for us .
At the time , the i18n support was still in the works , but we were assured that it would arrive very soon .
We were a little bit worried about how hard it would be but we were pleasantly surprised to learn that the implementation was really simple .
All we had to do is to inherit the i18n package , create the constant and message classes along with their associated property files for all the strings , messages that need to be externalized .
The initial answer I got regarding our fourth question was " your entire application is monolithically compiled into aggressively optimized and obfuscated JavaScript .
It 's a " pay - as - you - go " model , code you do n't call gets pruned " , and " GWT uses a trick to allow its script to be reliably compressed , resulting in a 3 - 5 fold decrease in size " .
I had vivid memory of working on scripts to prune and obfuscate handwritten JavaScript code in my previous job , and how it required constant tweaks and tune - ups .
As painful as it may be , performance tuning is a very important step for any large - scale JavaScript application .
The initial download time and execution speed are crucial and greatly affect the user 's perception of an application .
As a skeptical engineer , I performed my own tests to validate these claims and test performance , initially and prior to launch , to make sure that the code was pruned , optimized and obfuscated .
The results of this testing proved to me that GWT could live up to our expectations .
Finally , after receiving convincing arguments and techniques for creating a custom - cut Google Data library , the choice for which technology to use to bring Google Health to production was obvious , and the rest is history .
My sample GWT project became the launch pad for the Google Health client infrastructure .
Of course we did n't develop the whole application without running into technical challenges .
We grew our application as GWT itself was still growing up .
There were times when we realized that some of the little details in JavaScript were not exposed through GWT .
In most of these cases , we used JSNI to access lower level JavaScript functionality .
At one point , we also noticed that as we continued to build the application the initial download time started growing as well .
We analyzed all the requests and realized that there was cumulative latency introduced by each little icon , logo and other images that needed to be requested and loaded during the application loading .
We used GWT image bundle to handle all the images and it considerably improved performance .
Finally , in cases where we thought a certain widget should be further extended , we took one of a few approaches : first we checked for such a widget in the GWT pipeline ; second we checked the developer forum to see if someone has already constructed what we need and contributed it back the open source community ; third , we developed our own and contribute it back to GWT for potential inclusion in a future release .
Looking back today at a successful Google Health pilot and public launch after 2 major UI redesigns , numerous UI experiments including proof of concepts and user studies , it 's hard for me to imagine accomplishing so much in last two years without GWT .
We were able to do all the fancy JavaScript stuff in half of the effort it would have taken with handwritten JavaScript .
We were able to write truly object - oriented UI code , refactoring and reuse were much easier , and leveraging IDEs like IntelliJ or Eclipse made UI redesigns much easier to absorb .
GWT 's compile - time elimination of dead code also meant we did n't have to worry about unused code that was still hanging around the codebase ( of course it 's best to do code cleanups every now and then ) , and we were also able to easily create unit tests for our UI code with GWT 's integration with JUnit , which saved us lots of debugging time as our engineering team grew .
It 's been an amazing experience .
Our lonely and half - hearted defense notwithstanding , the commentariat is unanimous : SanDisk 's " SlotMusic " -- preloaded music on flash memory cards -- is a terrible idea and the music labels are staffed with craven idiots .
So we 're going to stop fighting the wisdom of crowds here , back away from the fray and save our energies for winnable battles .
In just a minute .
First , we want to tell you how truly terrible " SlotMusic " could have been .
What if :
Instead of loading the cards the pre-loaded music in MP3 format , so you could move it wherever you wanted , the tunes were locked up with DRM ?
Instead of featuring music from popular artists who sell music , like Usher , the memory cards were preloaded with new music from people who have n't had hits for decades , like the Rolling Stones ?
Instead of being priced somewhere between $ 7 and $ 15 , the memory cards were sold for more than $ 30 -- that is , at least 2 x more than a conventional CD ?
Unbelievable , right ?
That 's what we said , too -- the first time we saw SanDisk 's attempt to launch this product , way back in 2005 .
Some press release excerpts :
SAN FRANCISCO , CA , SEPTEMBER 27 , 2005 – SanDisk ® Corporation ( NASDAQ : SNDK ) today made entertainment history by launching gruvi™ , the first removable flash memory card of its type to be sold with premium music content .
And SanDisk ’s debut release in this new medium is none other than A Bigger Bang from EMI Music ’s Virgin Records , the bestselling album from the legendary Rolling Stones ..
The Rolling Stones ’ A Bigger Bang , the band ’s first studio album in eight years , has been unanimously hailed by critics and fans .
The Rolling Stones ’ A Bigger Bang tour launched in the U.S. in August .
The gruvi music card includes the album along with bonus content that is offered exclusively in this unique format .
A Bigger Bang is the first music release to use SanDisk ’s new Trusted Flash ™ technology , which also was announced today at the CTIA show .
Trusted Flash enables content providers to lock content to the card -- using a rights management protocol that is on the card itself – but gives consumers the freedom to play the card , and thus the content they own , in a variety of supported devices .
This is in contrast to closed , proprietary systems that restrict content to a single device .
Apart from getting all of the tracks on the new Rolling Stones album , consumers also will be able to preview and purchase – directly from the card -- other Rolling Stones music from the band ’s back catalog , through either a PC or a supported mobile phone .
A Bigger Bang on the gruvi music card will have a suggested retail price of $ 39.95 at select retailers , where it is scheduled for release in early November .
This was so awful that we promptly forgot about it , and apparently so did everyone else ( Has anyone ever actually seen one ?
This ebay auction is the only evidence we have it actually made it to market ) .
But the good / stubborn people at SanDisk would n't let it go .
Alas , our fellow pundits have declared the new version DOA , too .
We look forward to seeing what SanDisk rolls out a couple years from now .
In the meantime , we 've spent the morning thinking about Martin Landau in " Entourage " , for some reason .

Chrysler , all but left for dead by most industry watchers , surprised just about everyone in Detroit this morning by announcing it has not one but three electric vehicles in the pipeline and we 'll see the first of them in showrooms by 2010 .
The stunning announcement instantly propelled the smallest of the Big Three automakers to the front of the pack in the race to bring an EV to market and places it in direct competition with the Chevrolet Volt that General Motors unveiled last week .
Chrysler 's joining GM in betting that electric cars are the future , and it's gone all - in with a make - or - break lineup that includes range - extended versions of the Chrysler Town & Country minivan and Jeep Wrangler SUV and an all - electric Dodge sports car .
" We have a social responsibility to our consumers to deliver environmentally friendly , fuel - efficient , advanced electric vehicles , and our intention is to meet that responsibility quickly and more broadly than any other automobile manufacturer , " says Bob Nardelli , chairman and CEO of the struggling automaker .
" The introduction of the
Chrysler , Jeep and Dodge electric vehicles provides a glimpse of the very near future and demonstrates that we are serious and well along in the development of bringing electric vehicles to market . "
These cars are n't mock - ups .
Chrysler says we 'll see 100 of them in test fleets next year .
One model – the company is n't saying which , but some analysts say it 's probably the yellow two - seater pictured above – will be ready for sale by the end of 2010 , the same deadline GM has set for the Volt .
" We are well ahead of where people think we are , " company co-president Jim Press said at the unveiling before taking a shot at cross - town rivals GM : " Perhaps that 's because we have n't tooted our horn up to now . "
Chrysler is n't tooting its horn with this announcement .
It 's playing a Sousa march .
Although Chrysler 's recently introduced two hybrids , no one saw this coming from a company where sales are down 24 percent – about twice the declines seen by the industry as a whole .
But Chrysler 's been working nonstop on these cars since launching the ENVI electric vehicle team about a year ago .
It rolled out a few concepts at the Detroit auto show in January , but no one took them seriously and even Chrysler 's own dealers grumbled it is n't moving fast enough to develop EVs .
" This was the best - kept secret in the auto industry , " Aaron Bragman , an industry analyst with Global Insight , told us .
" Basically what they 've done is lock the ENVI people in a room and throw a lot of money at them . "
Unlike the gas-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius and the forthcoming Honda Insight , the wheels of the three Chryslers will be driven only by electricity .
The minivan and Wrangler will have electric motors ( 255 horsepower in the minivan , 268 in the Jeep ) that will go 40 miles on a charge .
The small gasoline engine acts only as a generator to keep the battery charged as it approaches depletion , keeping the vehicle going at about 50 mpg .
It 's similar to what GM is putting in the Volt .
The as - yet - unnamed sports car will be a full - electric vehicle like the Tesla Roadster with performance to match .
The Dodge EV , based on the Lotus Europa , has a 268 - horsepower electric motor that will propel the car from 0 to 60 in less than five seconds .
Chrysler says its lithium - ion battery – which could come from A123 Systems , one of two companies working with GM on the Volt – will provide a range of 150 to 200 miles and charge in six to eight hours .
" It 's a great tribute to our engineers , " Tom LaSorda , company vice president , told the Detroit Free Press .
It 's a safe bet the electric two - seater is the car we 're most likely to see in showrooms first .
The company reportedly will work with Lotus under an arrangement similar to those that led to the Tesla Roadster and Vauxhall VX220 ( and could bring a return of the Fiat Dino ) .
Cribbing from Lotus saves Chrysler the time and trouble of designing a car , and going with a full electric prevents the headaches of integrating an engine into an already complex vehicle .
" I 'd say there 's a 75 percent chance they 'll hit that deadline , " Mike Omotoso of J.D. Power & Associates tells us .
" They 've got the Europa and they can learn from the mistakes Tesla 's made .
It 's an aggressive timeline , but I think they can hit it . "
That leaves the minivan and the Jeep ; the analysts we talked to said we 'll probably see them in 2011 .
While some people are clamoring for a small city car , a minivan and a Jeep make sense for Chrysler because they are " signature " vehicles that have long been the company 's bread and butter .
Basing them on existing models also allows the automaker to bring them to market faster because it does n't have to engineer new platforms or engines .

Muslima Lewis , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida , said : “ Really , you ’re not having a full participatory democracy if you disenfranchise so many people .
It weakens the whole system and , in particular , communities of color . ”
All of Us or None , a prisoner - advocacy organization in San Francisco , held a rally last month about restoration of voting rights in California .
Also last month , the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition successfully lobbied the Denver County jail system to begin registering felons upon their release .
The A.C.L.U. is also advising lawyers ’ groups planning to deploy to polling places in November to enforce the rights of former convicts who have restored their voting privileges .
According to the A.C.L.U. only two states , Maine and Vermont , allow prisoners , parolees and probationers to vote .
Thirteen states allow parolees and probationers to vote , eight states reinstate probationer voting rights , and 20 states restore voting rights to people who have completed their sentences , although each state has different processes , exceptions and limits on eligibility requirements .
Kentucky and Virginia permanently disenfranchise nearly all felons .
Florida ’s felony voter registration law divides applicants into three categories based on the seriousness of their crimes : nonviolent criminals , the biggest group , need not apply for restoration of voting rights and just need to re-register .
Violent criminals , but not murderers or rapists , must apply to the clemency board .
The board either grants those rights immediately or investigates on a case - by - case basis .
The most violent criminals are subjected to a more rigorous investigation and must attend a hearing of the clemency board , which meets only four times a year , before their rights can be reinstated .
Despite the state ’s liberalization of felony voter procedures , only 9,000 out of a potential 112,000 former convicts in Florida registered to vote in the last year , according to a report last month in The Orlando Sentinel .
Part of the reason is that thousands of notifications sent by the state went to the wrong addresses because of poor data and former prisoners ’ high mobility .
Fred Schuknecht , the director of administration for the Florida Clemency Board , acknowledged in an interview that there was a backlog of 60,000 former felons who could potentially have their rights restored , but must first be reviewed by the agency .
Despite the fact that 3,500 newly released prisoners are added to the caseload every month , the Legislature cut 20 percent of the staff devoted to felony voter restoration cases , Mr. Schuknecht said .
Congress and the Bush administration headed for a preelection showdown Wednesday over the issue of executive privilege , with House Democrats scheduling a hearing that would put a key former administration figure under oath and the Justice Department mapping a last - ditch court appeal .
Justice lawyers said they would go to court as soon as today to block a ruling by U.S. District Judge John D. Bates that forces the White House to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the politically charged firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 .
The move came as Democrats pushed ahead with that investigation .
Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , announced that he was calling former White House counsel Harriet E. Miers to appear before the committee on Sept. 11 to answer questions about her role in the firings .
Conyers also set a Sept. 4 deadline for the administration to turn over White House documents concerning the firings as well as a log detailing what documents it was withholding because of security concerns and why .

Legal experts said they doubted that the Justice Department would succeed in persuading the federal appeals court in Washington to intervene in the matter at this point .
But it was also unclear what questions
Miers would choose to answer if she took the witness chair next month , and that raised the possibility of further legal wrangling .
Experts said the tug - of - war also seemed unlikely to be resolved before January , when the subpoenas legally expire .
That would confront the new Congress with the decision whether to renew the battle .
“ It is an unpredictable game at this point , ” said Charles Tiefer , a former House counsel who is a professor at the University of Baltimore law school .
“ The Congress could win or the White House could drag it out . ”
The rapid - fire series of events was triggered by an order by Bates on Tuesday in which he declined to put on hold a July 31 ruling in which he held that the refusal of the administration to cooperate in the U.S. attorney investigation was legally untenable .
Advertisement
Bates had ruled that the administration ’s position that it had “ absolute immunity ” from being forced to honor subpoenas issued by Congress was unprecedented .
He said Miers was obliged to at least show up -- but did not rule on which questions she would be required to answer .
Justice Department lawyers told Bates at a hearing Wednesday that they intended to ask the appeals court to overrule the judge .
Justice Department lawyer Carl Nichols indicated the government would file court papers to that effect no later than today .
Investigators are trying to determine whether Miers and Karl Rove , Bush ’s former chief political advisor , were involved in the 2006 firings .
Democrats have alleged that the prosecutors were singled out for failing to bring corruption and other cases that benefited Republicans and that the idea was hatched at the White House .
Rove has also refused to appear before the House and Senate Judiciary committees and has been held in contempt by both panels .
The Justice Department has argued that the former Bush aides are immune from having to testify because of the doctrine of executive privilege , which is grounded in the principle of separation of powers and is intended to insulate presidential policymaking decisions .
Advertisement
Officials have also argued that , because U.S. attorneys are presidential appointees , Congress has no authority to question executive - branch advisors about decisions to fire them .
The Justice Department effort to block the lower - court ruling would be considered by a three - judge panel that is randomly assigned to hear emergency appeals .
The federal appeals court here , whose alumni include Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia , has a generally conservative reputation .
If the appeals court blocks Miers ’ testimony , even temporarily , it could allow the Bush administration to drag out the proceedings until after the election .
But several legal scholars said they doubted that even a conservative panel would intervene .
Bates himself was appointed by Bush to the federal bench in 2001 , they noted , and he was likely to be shown deference .
Advertisement
They also said his central ruling appeared to be indisputable .
“ The Supreme Court has never given any indication that the White House counsel or people who work for the president can just ignore a subpoena , ” said Cass R. Sunstein , a professor at the University of Chicago law school .
“ It would be very surprising to think that the White House official does not even have to appear to assert the privilege . ”

At 49 % , support for Obama is near his record high for the year
Gallup Daily : Obama Now Leads McCain by 5 Points
At 49 % , support for Obama is near his record high for the year
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Tuesday through Thursday finds Barack Obama with a five percentage point lead over John McCain in the presidential preferences of registered voters , 49 % to 44 % .
This is the fourth consecutive day that Obama has inched forward in voter preferences since the start of the Wall Street financial meltdown beginning with the announcement on Sunday , Sept. 14 , that Lehman Brothers was headed for bankruptcy .
The overall effect has been to shift the lead back to Obama after McCain had moved ahead following the Republican National Convention .
Obama 's current 49 % rating is close to his 50 % record high reached just after the Democratic National Convention .
( That came in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Aug. 30 - Sept. 1 . ) However , his current five - point advantage is still lower than his 9 - point lead in late July ( following his trip to Europe and the Middle East ) and his 8 - point leads right after the Democratic National Convention in late August .
McCain's 44 % is about midway between his record high 49 % reached right after the Republican National Convention in early September , and his all - time low for the year of 40 % recorded in late July .
Obama enjoyed one of his widest advantages over McCain of recent weeks in Thursday night 's interviewing .
It will be important to see whether the stock market 's reaction today to aggressive government intervention in the crisis has an impact on the direction of the presidential race over the next few days .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general election results are based on combined data from Sept. 16 - 18 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,796 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

There is a continuing battle surrounding Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) .
While most rights holders see it as a way of maximizing their profits , users see it as a way to reduce their ability to actually use the products they bought , the way they want to .
Ironically , one of the books that spells out what is wrong with DRM , is now available with DRM .
DRM has managed to become widespread without the knowledge of many .
DVDs , MP3s , books , software , games and even audio CDs ( although such DRM ’d CDs are not allowed to use the CD logo ) , they can all come with DRM nowadays .
DRM issues occasionally hit the headlines , with instances like the Sony Rootkit lawsuits and HD - DVD fiasco , with TorrentFreak even running a competition to design an anti- DRM T - shirt last year ( results are here ) .
The problem with DRM is that it does n’t do what it ’s supposed to do .
The only people who are negatively affected are honest customers , since pirates will get their DRM - free version off BitTorrent anyway .
In fact , DRM seems to produce an increase in downloads over legitimate sales , with the ‘ Spore ’ fiasco as a recent example .
Public reaction to DRM is not favorable , and has been growing worse ( such as when a DRM - based service closes ) .
Even though some retailers have started to sell their goods without DRM , others have not , or have released products selling stuff ONLY in DRM encumbered formats .
A prime example of without DRM is Amazon , with its music , and an example of with DRM is Amazon and their Kindle ebook reader .
Kindle ebooks are sold complete with DRM , locking the books to a single system .
This applies to all Kindle ebooks sold via Amazon .
One of the Kindle e-books looks a little out of place with DRM though .
A member of the US - based Students for Free Culture organization informed TorrentFreak that the book Free Culture , by Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig , is available through the service .
The book deals with the rise of the copyright situation in the US , and how laws in other areas were changed to keep pace with advances in technology , sometimes making obsolete decades , or centuries of precedent .
The fact that this book is available in a DRM format might not seem all that important , except that the book itself spells out what is wrong with DRM .
The book is available as a 100 % free download on the book ’s official site .
However , short of violating the DMCA by circumventing the DRM , it is hard to put the pdf version of the book on the Kindle , exemplifying the problem .
Most ironically , though , is that the subtitle of the book is “ How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity ” , so the book has become its own example .
Prof .
Lessig will be giving a keynote speech at SFC’s “ Free Culture 08 ” on October 11th .

Rails ’ ActiveSupport package includes an inflector class .
This lets you do things like singularize and pluralize strings , viagra camel case text , etc .
I ’m building a framework that lets Rails developers use erlang + mnesia to replace their ruby models and traditional relational DBs ( using Hyperactive Resource + Mochiweb ) .
But a key part of interoperating with rails is being able to infer that “ Person ” is the singular for “ People ” .
Inflector.erl brings this magic to erlang !
Witness the awesome power :
1 > inflector : singularize ( ” mice “ ) . “ mouse “ 2 > inflector : titleize ( ” i_love_erlang “ ) . “ I Love Erlang “ 3 > inflector : ordinalize ( 142 ) . “ 142nd “ 5 > inflector : pluralize ( ” quiz “ ) . “ quizzes “ 7 > inflector : tableize ( ” MyModelModule “ ) . “ my_model_modules “
Inflector.erl includes functions for pluralizing , singularizing , camelizing , titleizing ,
capitalizing , humanizing , underscoring , dasherizing , tableizing , moduleizing ,
foreign_key..isizing ?
and ordinalizing !
I found it very difficult to implement some functions without regular expressions , so it does require R12B4 of erlang due to the vastly improved regular expression support B4 offers .
The majority of the inflections are just standard pattern matching and list manipulation , though .
It also has an eunit test suite embedded , so it requires eunit to compile ..
But everyone has eunit , right ?
Also , in order to minimize the impact of compiling the regular expressions , Inflector.erl caches all compiled regular expressions .. so I expect performance wo n’t be a problem but be aware that it does register a process named “ re_cache ” .
Download and enjoy !!

Marines ordered to stay longer in Afghanistan Associated Press
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON - The Pentagon has ordered roughly 1,250 Marines serving as trainers for the Afghan security forces to stay on the warfront almost a month longer to continue a mission that military leaders say is a top priority , according to a senior military official .
In addition , Defense Secretary Robert Gates has authorized the deployment of up to 200 other troops to Afghanistan to support the Marines .
That includes eight helicopter crews that could be shifted from Iraq if commanders decide .
The senior military official spoke to The Associated Press on Monday on condition of anonymity because the formal announcement has not yet been made .
The decision to extend the tour of the 2nd Battalion , 7th Marine Regiment in Afghanistan comes just a month after defense officials told the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit that it would stay an extra month in Afghanistan .
According to the official , the decision to hold the battalion there longer is part of an effort to capitalize on the gains the Marines have made in the training mission .
The extension means that the battalion would return home in late November .
Asked about Gates ' decision , Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said the secretary was responding to a request from the commanders .
Gates " is always pained to have to extend tours .
He understands the effect that has on the families of our forces , but he also appreciates our commanders ' need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in Afghanistan , " Morrell said .
Gates ' decision to send the other support forces comes after weeks of discussions by top military leaders who scrambled to find needed troops .
He authorized Army Lt. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , who is temporarily in charge of U.S. Central Command , to shift up to eight helicopter units from Iraq to Afghanistan  four Cobra attack aircraft and four MH - 53 heavy lift helicopters .
The remainder of the support forces being deployed are smaller units , including engineers , route clearance troops and explosive ordnance disposal teams .
It was not clear Monday whether those support forces also would return home in late November , or if they would stay longer in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon announced in January that the Marine Expeditionary Unit , which is based at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , was being ordered to Afghanistan , largely because efforts to press other NATO nations to increase their troop levels at the time had failed .
The MEU has been fighting Taliban militants in the volatile south .
At the same time , the 2nd Battalion , 7th Marine Regiment , which is based at Twentynine Palms , Calif. , was ordered to deploy also .
Gates has said he would not replace the Marines with other U.S. troops when they left later this year .
But commanders have said they need three more combat brigades  or as many as 10,000 troops  to bolster the fight in Afghanistan .
And U.S. officials have indicated they would like to send extra brigades there next year .
Military leaders , however , have made it clear they need to free units from Iraq deployments in order to send more troops to Afghanistan .
As security in Iraq continues to improve , officials have suggested that units initially headed for Iraq late this year or early next year could be sent to Afghanistan instead .

July 31 , 2008
Five years of bloody US occupation have seen numerous crimes against humanity unfold in Iraq .
Millions of Iraqi civilians have been killed and wounded , with millions more made into refugees .
Ancient , once - vibrant cities have been destroyed by air raids and chemical weapons .
Thousands of Iraqis have imprisoned by the US military in barbaric conditions , and in many cases tortured .
In carrying out the occupation , more than 4,400 military personnel �most of them American �have died and tens of thousands have been wounded .
Little reflection of these realities is to be found , however , in the US media , particularly in visual form .
Censorship by the military �and self - censorship by media outlets �is part of an effort by the ruling elite to sanitize the war and keep the American public in the dark about its real nature .
As highlighted in a July 26 piece in the New York Times , titled " 4,000 U.S. Deaths , and a Handful of Images , " very few photographs of the occupation have trickled out from the military - embedded journalists and been released by the American media .
The military and Bush administration have imposed rules barring photos of flag - draped caskets , as well as documentation of battlefield casualties in which faces , ranks , or other identifiers are visible .
The Times notes , " Even memorial services for killed soldiers , once routinely open , are increasingly off limits .
Detainees were widely photographed in the early years of the war , but the Department of Defense , citing prisoners � rights , has recently stopped that practice as well . "
Journalists have also been forbidden from releasing images showing what the military deems to be sensitive information �anything from an image of American weaponry to the aftermath of an insurgent strike .
Journalists interviewed by the Times said that even tighter rules imposed last year , requiring written permission from wounded soldiers before their images could be used , were nearly impossible to satisfy in the case of seriously wounded and dying soldiers .
" While embed restrictions do permit photographs of dead soldiers to be published once family members have been notified , " the Times commented , " in practice , the military has exacted retribution on the rare occasions that such images have appeared . "
Clearly , none of these restrictions have anything to do with " prisoners � rights " or respect for the families of fallen soldiers .
To the contrary , the military�s intent is to obscure from the American people the hellish reality in which prisoners and US soldiers alike have found themselves .
Indeed , while employing typical military jargon and doublespeak , Defense Department officials make no secret of the subject : free and easy access to photographs , print journalism , and first - hand accounts of the war are a " vulnerability " for US imperialism because it fuels antiwar sentiment in the population and within the military .
The Times article invites a comparison of Vietnam war - era photojournalism and coverage of the present occupation in Iraq : " If the conflict in Vietnam was notable for open access given to journalists �too much , many critics said , as the war played out nightly in bloody newscasts �the Iraq war may mark an opposite extreme : after five years and more than 4,000 American combat deaths , searches and interviews turned up fewer than a half - dozen graphic photographs of dead American soldiers . "
Significantly , the Times was able to document only five published images of war dead that had been released by embedded journalists .
In four of those cases , the paper notes , " the photographer was immediately kicked out of his or her embed following publication of such photos . "
The number of embedded journalists has been cut drastically in the last five years .
At the time of the invasion in 2003 , 770 journalists accompanied US forces .
Currently , according to the newspaper industry journal Editor & Publisher , only a dozen embedded journalists remain , about half of whom are photographers .
Even if they were granted complete liberty to witness and document the occupation , the idea that 12 journalists could adequately cover the operations of 150,000 troops around the country is absurd .
The first " disembedded " photojournalist documented by the Times was Stefan Zaklin , then of the European Pressphoto Agency , who was barred from working with the US Army after publishing a photo of a dead US officer in Fallujah in 2004 .
In 2005 , Chris Hondros of Getty Images was " kicked out of his embed " with an Army unit after photographing a young girl , screaming and covered in blood , after US soldiers killed her parents .
Two Times journalists were barred in January 2007 after the paper printed a photo of a fatally wounded soldier .
The soldier died within hours of being wounded , but the military insisted that the Times reporters violated rules by not getting his written permission to use his image .
The most recent barring of a photojournalist followed a devastating suicide bombing June 26 in Anbar province .
The bombing killed 20 people , including three Marines .
The photographer , Zoriah Miller , who goes by his first name , was among the first on the scene after the blast .
He documented scattered body parts , pools of blood and debris , and wounded and shocked survivors .
According to a July 17 piece in Photo District News , a photography industry magazine , Zoriah was told to " stop photographing , delete his memory cards , [ and ] surrender his cameras " .
Three days after family members had been notified of the Marine deaths , Zoriah published the images on his independent website .
The next morning , the Times reported , " high - ranking Marine public affairs officers demanded that Mr. Miller remove the photos .
When he refused , his embed was terminated . "
Zoriah wrote on his blog that officers claimed the military " would not allow even the pants or shoes of an injured or killed Marine to be depicted in images . "
On July 3 , the photographer was handed a letter claiming he had violated embed rules by publishing photos that revealed " tactics , techniques and procedures witnessed during operations , " and provided " information on the effectiveness of enemy techniques . "
" Specifically , Mr. Miller provided our enemy with an after - action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of U.S. and Iraqi forces , " Marine spokesman Lt. Col.
Chris Hughes told the Times .
Another Marine officer , Captain Esteban Vickers , waxed indignant to the paper : " Mr. Miller�s complete lack of respect to these marines , their friends , and families is shameful ...
How do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened ? "
Zoriah countered : " The fact that the images I took of the suicide bombing �which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country �the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people , says that whatever they are doing to limit this type of photo getting out , it is working . "
" It is absolutely censorship , " the photographer told the Times .
" I took pictures of something they didn�t like , and they removed me .
Deciding what I can and cannot document , I don�t see a clearer definition of censorship . "
In an earlier interview with PDN magazine , Zoriah commented : " They embedded a war photographer , and when I took a photo of war , they disembedded me .
It �s as if it�s okay to take pictures of them handing lollipops to kids on the street and providing medical care , but photographing the actual war is unacceptable . "
Indeed , the claim that documenting casualties aids the enemy is crafted to stifle information about almost any situation .
It has also been used to justify the military targeting of independent journalists and media outlets that document American atrocities .
The US bombings of independent Arab media Al - Jazeera offices in Kabul , Afghanistan , and in Baghdad served to quash critical coverage of the wars .
Photographers have been increasingly held back from combat zones .
James Lee , a photojournalist embedded with a Marine unit , told the Times that he was thwarted by commanders from entering Basra during the massive air assault and raid offensive in April .
He was told the military brass " did not want any Western eyes down there . "
As with Fallujah in 2004 , the sieges on Basra and Sadr City constituted major war crimes .
Over the course of a few days , hundreds of civilians and militiamen were slaughtered .
During the siege in Basra , hospital and health officials were prohibited from speaking to independent journalists .
American media dutifully reported Pentagon talking points , referring to killed civilians �even when children were counted among the dead�as " terrorists , " or at best " collateral damage . "
Such suppression of the truth is an expression of the larger crime of the war .
More fundamentally , however , military censorship and the self - censoring of the media reflect the immense and growing militarization of American political life .
Oceans cover well over two - thirds of the planet 's surface and are home to a world where at least a million known species of plants and animals depend on each other for survival .
Small marine organisms are food for larval and juvenile fish that in turn are consumed by larger fish that eventually fall victim to top predators .
Humans have relied on this entire food chain for sustenance for a long time .
But now more than 85 percent of the world 's fisheries have been pushed to or beyond their biological limits .
Pollution , poorly planned development , and the effects of climate change have also contributed to the degradation of the underwater environment .
WWF believes that conserving marine habitats and promoting sustainable fishing methods are as important to people as they are to wildlife .
We support marine conservation in places such as the Coral Triangle , the Arctic , and Coastal East Africa and also on the high seas .
We help to protect a long list of species that are of crucial importance to the entire marine ecosystem and those communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and food security .
Preserving healthy fish populations and securing sustainable fisheries is only possible by working collaboratively with the private sector .
WWF works with the companies along the entire value chain , from the world ’s oceans to your plate , to protect our seafood supply and to make sure that the interconnected network of underwater species will thrive into the future .
Atlanta 's Crissy Thompson is the queen of coupon - clipping — she 's so skilled at it that she 's cut her weekly grocery bill to $ 10 for a family of five :
She buys two copies of the AJC 's daily double Sunday paper , getting four papers , four sets of coupons , for $ 5 .
She also goes to her favorite coupon websites ( see links ) .
On the day we 're with Crissy , we tell her we just want a sampling of what she does .
She tells us we 're going to CVS and Publix , two of her favorite stores .
I do coupons every week myself so I was very curious to see how she did it .
At the Publix , Crissy got her best deals with the buy 1 , get 1 free items .
Most local grocery stores will let you buy only one item and get it 50 % off .
If you pair a coupon with that ( most grocery stores double coupons up to 50 cents ) you can sometimes get the item for free or next to nothing .
What I learned from Crissy is that you can use one coupon per item .
All this time I had misunderstood what it says on each coupon , only one coupon per purchase .
I took " purchase " to mean " transaction . "
It 's not .
For example , Crissy grabbed two boxes of cereal that were buy 1 , get 1 free .
The cereal was $ 3.79 a box .
Crissy had a three dollar coupon for each box of cereal .
She made over $ 2.00 when she pulled those boxes off the shelves .
I thought I could only use one coupon , no matter how many boxes or cans or whatever I 'd bought .
So that 's good for me to know .
She did n't buy any produce or meat when we were with her .
The best deals that week were elsewhere and she told us she often gets her produce from local farmers at a nearby market where prices are very inexpensive .
When we got to checkout her bill was $ 15.38 and she saved $ 36.22 .
Basically she saved two thirds of the bill .

CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - Auto salesman Ryan Thomas is watching the credit crisis hit Main Street America .
On Monday , as Congress rejected a bailout plan and stock markets plummeted , Thomas had to turn away a customer with $ 3,000 in his hand who wanted to buy a new vehicle .
Customers drink coffee at Versailles restaurant in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami , Florida February 23 , 2008 .

“ He wanted to get into a bigger truck for his job , he was a union worker , ” Thomas said .
But the man still owed money on the vehicle he was trading in , so his loan request was denied .
“ He did n’t have enough money down .
He would have needed about $ 5,500 down and he had $ 3,000 .
A year ago that was a piece of cake , ” Thomas said .
The customer left without his American - made vehicle , Thomas lost another sale -- and somewhere an autoworker made one less truck , a tiny ripple in the growing U.S. financial crisis .
As Wall Street collapses and politicians in Washington struggle to agree on a rescue package , credit markets across America are grinding to a halt , leaving many business owners and would - be borrowers alike without money to get by .
Anger and blame are everywhere .
While outraged voters besieged members of Congress with calls and e-mails demanding lawmakers reject a White House plan to bail out a sinking Wall Street , some experts believe the resulting stock crash and credit panic may spur a new rescue campaign .
The House of Representatives voted the plan down on Monday , but top lawmakers said they hoped a revised bailout bill could clear in the near future .
“ Some of the folks in Congress ... will start to hear it from the other side now , ” said Al Kugel , chief investment strategist at Atlantic Trust in Chicago .
Without a new plan , Kugel worries the credit shortage will get worse : “ It will be like a boa constrictor has got the economy and just keeps squeezing . ”
Dallas - area roofing contractor Bill Good has already felt the squeeze .
Before times were tough , his bank offered him a $ 100,000 credit line that he did n’t need .
Now , with high oil prices doubling the cost of roofing material , he ’s strapped .
“ Now I ca n’t access this kind of money to facilitate my cash flow .
The lines of credit ... have dried up , ” said Good .

Kansas City cabinet maker Anthony Gallo is in a similar bind .
Eighteen months ago Gallo had no debt .
Now he ’s being forced to borrow just to make payroll -- just as his chief lender has cut his credit line from $ 400,000 to $ 175,000 .
“ My line of credit has been cut to nothing , ” said Gallo .
“ We ’re all hurting ... and wondering what is going to happen . ”
‘ NOTHING AVAILABLE ’
Retailers are also braced for a slowdown as consumers feel the pinch of reluctant lenders .
Jon Levin , owner of Orchard Street Associates , a retail sales group based in Burns Harbor , Indiana , said many independent retailers , including among his 4,000 customers , have postponed orders for the holiday season and are waiting to gauge customer demand because financing is just not like it used to be .
“ It ’s not a question of the high cost of credit , there ’s nothing available out there , ” said Levin , noting that he hears of sales agencies going out of business almost every week .
“ The party ’s over and people do n’t want to admit it ... I do n’t want to admit it , but you had to see it coming . ”
David Zugheri , co-founder of Envoy Mortgage Ltd , which has 475 employees in 20 states , has also seen a big slowdown .
He said 30 percent to 40 percent of prospective buyers who could have qualified for mortgages two or three years ago are being shut out .
“ There has been a mad rush back to the basics and if you do n’t have the necessary documentation you cannot get a loan , ” Zugheri said .
But he noted that not all credit is dead .
“ If you have decent credit , a verifiable income and want a loan for under $ 400,000 it ’s business as usual . ”
Ohio businessman Duane Hickerson , a partner at Columbus - based Relay Gear , which makes promotional products , said he has not yet had to struggle to get credit from his regular lender .
But he said standards have definitely changed .
“ The bank has gotten more stringent over the last 3 , 4 , 5 months , ” said Hickerson .
“ They ’ve forced us to make some changes in what we do as a business and what kind of debt load we ’re carrying .
They ’ve changed our covenants in terms of what kind of pace we have to pay down loans . ”
Hickerson said the company laid off four people two months ago to try to tighten up its bottom line to please the bank .
But even as Main Street feels the pain of the credit crisis , business owners are divided over the proposed Wall Street bailout .
Some oppose it , some feel it is necessary -- illustrating the difficulty facing members of Congress , most of whom are trying to win re-election in November .
Thomas may be losing car sales , but he ’s glad the bailout failed : “ They do n’t need to bail out CEOs of these high - powered banks .
Why should they ?
They ’re already millionaires . ”
Cabinet - maker Gallo said he was angry taxpayers would end up footing the bill to bail out troubled Wall Street banks -- but he also thought it was necessary .
“ They ’ve got to do something to save the banks , ” Gallo said .
“ They ca n’t kill our economy . ”
It was as if the party had been thrown to mark the end of an era .
It was last weekend , on Park Avenue , and the sort of bash middle aged adults like to throw to show they are still on top of their game , still capable of getting up on the dance floor and gyrating to recapture their lost youth .

My fellow guests were mostly money people , hedge fund managers , bankers of one sort or another , investors in commercial real estate , people who until the last couple of weeks thought nothing of shelling out on a faster boat or renting a large house in the Hamptons for the summer and hang the expense .
As they bopped up and down to the band , it was as if they were enjoying one last summer .
The men were mostly putting a brave face on it .
Whatever their personal circumstances , and no one was letting on how badly they were affected , the bad debts and junk paper that had clogged the economy like a bad program frozen on a computer screen became an excuse for gallows humor .
But for the first time I noticed a restrained hysteria in the air .
Some of the wives , used to spending a whopping annual bonus one Christmas after the next , could barely hide their nascent anxiety .
It was as if they felt the wolf prowling outside the door .
For once they knew people  not just friends of friends , but friends  who had been turned out of a job , or who had put their homes on the market , or were wondering where the school fees were coming from .
The meltdown in the financial markets spells the end of an epoch , and not just for Wall Street .
The age of Reagan is winding up .
The 30 - year period born of the hyper inflation and national malaise of the unlamented Carter years has come to an abrupt end .
The age of unfettered markets , cheap money , low inflation , low public expenditure , low taxation , and low unemployment has hit the buffers .
There are few defenders of the old system .
President Bush has abandoned economic policy to the Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , and the Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , and whatever they say goes .
When the pair took the president their $ 700 billion plan to buy the banks ' bad debt with taxpayers ' money , Mr. Bush made no attempt to push back .
As one official recorded , " The president said , ' Let 's do it . '
There was no hesitation . "
Both presidential candidates are taking it in turns to blame the " greed " and " excess " of the financiers who caused the markets to gum up .
Both insist what is needed is tighter regulation .
Never mind that the last panic driven regulations , the Sarbanes Oxley rules , rushed into law in the wake of the Enron scandal , have burdened small businesses into bankruptcy and frightened public offerings across the Atlantic to London .
John McCain even thinks a Democrat , Andrew Cuomo , son of the Democratic grandee Mario Cuomo , would be the best person to police the market .
Barack Obama offers more than regulation .
He has lined up a team to spend vast amounts of taxpayers ' money to stimulate the economy .
Nothing has been suggested on this profligate scale since Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society hosed dollars at the nation 's problems , to little avail .
The days of Ludwig von Mises , Friedrich von Hayek , and Milton Friedman have been put on hold ; the advocates of unabashed , big spending Keynesianism are waiting in the wings .
Take this wish list , from the former Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to Charlie Rose : " Getting out of this recession , reforming the health care system , achieving a better set of outcomes on energy efficiency and reduced vulnerability from abroad , responding to inequality . "
The projects may sound like good ideas  rebuilding our out - dated infrastructure , switching to solar energy , " investing " in public education  but they all are to be paid for out of funds borrowed on the international bourse .
The inevitable result will be inflation , an even weaker dollar , and the nation digging itself deeper in debt to the Chinese and the Middle Eastern " sovereign wealth funds . "
There is a second , important element of the age of Reagan that has also been lost .
After the collapse in national will that followed our defeat in Vietnam , Reagan discovered a renewed sense of American purpose that was soon evident both at home and abroad .
When he increased defense spending and put the missile defense shield on the fast track , the Soviet leadership rushed to the conference table laden with concessions .
Now Russia is back .
The Soviet empire may be gone , but Vladimir Putin's Russia is on the march , spurred by hurt pride and soaring oil revenues .
Despite Nicolas Sarkozy 's blustering attempt to invoke the Franco - Russian special relationship , Russian troops remain permanently stationed in Georgia .
The government of Ukraine is in turmoil in the wake of Russian threats .
Moldova endures Russian occupation .
The Baltic states , who have suffered Russian assaults on their communications , live in fear of being integrated back into Russia .
Yet America has little appetite for another war on another front .
When Senator McCain says he is prepared to defend Georgia , just as soon as it joins NATO , his opponents point at Iraq and Afghanistan .
This is the perception of Mr. Bush 's legacy , as he prepares to retire to Austin , Texas .
Two unpopular wars and a mismanaged economy have undone Reagan 's good work and left us inhibited from doing what may be necessary and right .

American plans to erect a chain of all - seeing eyes atop tall towers to guard the Mexican border have been put on hold in favour of a more conventional fence or wall , according to reports .
" The highest priority is to put out a system of physical fences and barriers that will keep people and vehicles from illegally crossing the U.S. - Mexico border , " said US Customs & Border Protection honcho Jayson Ahern , quoted in the Wall Street Journal .
The paper 's ubiquitous " persons familiar " added that the push to sidetrack the " virtual fence " of networked man-tracking scan towers was the result of budget overruns in physical - walls projects .
The so - called Secure Borders Initiative tower network from Boeing , aka SBInet - we would be willing to accept any reasonable fee for our suggested alternate brand - name , Eye - o - Sauron™ - was supposed to work by constantly scanning large areas of borderland using the moving - target - indicator radars which are now all the rage for military recce aircraft .
Any moving human - sized object would cause long - ranging thermal nightsight camera eyes to swivel round for a good stare , hopefully distinguishing huddled masses , troublemaking hobbits etc from among the trundling tumbleweeds , mustangs , loose cattle , bona - fide Americans out for a stroll and so forth .
Those radar blips confirmed as intruders would then appear as such on networked maps viewable by command posts and border patrols in their vehicles , allowing them to bracelet the miscreants and send them homeward to think again .
However , the Eye - o - Sauron kit was dogged by delays and tech snags , and reportedly was still riddled with bugs when the initial nine - tower pilot sector was accepted by Homeland Security overlord Michael Chertoff .
Its final demise has been rumoured for some time .
If the WSJ report is correct , that time is now imminent and the US will concentrate instead on more basic walls .

MP calls for new Kelly death probe after MoS revelations cast doubt on whether he was able to kill himself
Was it murder ?
The Hutton Inquiry found David Kelly had committed suicide but doubt has been cast on his ability to kill himself
David Kelly ’s mysterious death should be investigated by a coroner to establish whether the weapons inspector was murdered , the Government has been told .
The demand was made in a letter to Attorney General Baroness Scotland following revelations in The Mail on Sunday that question the Hutton Inquiry ’s finding of suicide .
After 59 - year - old Dr Kelly ’s body was discovered in woods near his Oxfordshire home in July 2003 , a coroner ’s inquiry into his death was controversially halted by the Government .
Lord Hutton took over the investigation and concluded the scientist slashed his left wrist and took an overdose of painkillers after being named as the source of a BBC report on the Iraq war .
But after the weapons inspector ’s close friend Mai Pederson cast doubt in this newspaper last week on his ability to kill himself – she says his right hand was so weak following an accident that he would have been unable to cut himself fatally – Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker has written to the Attorney General demanding a coroner ’s inquest .
Mr Baker , who has written a book on Mr Kelly , believes he was murdered by supporters of the war , with exiled Iraqi dissidents heading his list of suspects .
In his letter to Baroness Scotland , Mr Baker argues that Lord Hutton ’s finding of suicide would not have been endorsed by a coroner ’s court because it could not be proved ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’ .
Since the Hutton report was published it has also been revealed that there were no fingerprints on the knife Dr Kelly is supposed to have used .
Also , he suffered from a disorder that made it hard for him to swallow pills – and when a heat - seeking search aircraft flew over the spot where his corpse was found shortly after his supposed time of death it did not pick up any sign of a body .
Inquest demand : Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker
Some experts suggest he was killed elsewhere .
Ms Pederson , an American military linguist , has also revealed that Dr Kelly told her that he was on an Iraqi hit list and if Britain invaded the country ‘ he would be found dead in the woods ’ .
Mr Baker writes : ‘ Lord Hutton appeared to have decided that Dr Kelly had committed suicide before his inquiry had even begun , and limited the evidence given accordingly .
‘ I argue , therefore , that it is clear beyond doubt that there was an insufficiency of inquiry , as a result of both the nature of the inquiry itself , but more particularly by the way Lord Hutton interpreted his role .
‘ There is much more that has been uncovered , which taken together suggests very strongly that Lord Hutton ’s conclusions are unsafe , and that justice demands that there be a proper inquest . ’
Setting the stage for a collision of religion and politics , Christian ministers from California and 21 other states will use their pulpits Sunday to deliver political sermons or endorse presidential candidates -- defying a federal ban on campaigning by nonprofit groups .
The pastors ’ advocacy could violate the Internal Revenue Service ’s rules against political speech with the purpose of triggering IRS investigations .
That would allow their patron , the conservative legal group Alliance Defense Fund , to challenge the IRS ’ rules , a risky strategy that one defense fund attorney acknowledges could cost the churches their tax - exempt status .
Congress made it illegal in 1954 for tax - exempt groups to publicly support or oppose political candidates .
“ I ’m going to talk about the un-biblical stands that Barack Obama takes .
Nobody who follows the Bible can vote for him , ” said the Rev. Wiley S. Drake of First Southern Baptist Church of Buena Park .
“ We may not be politically correct , but we are going to be biblically correct .
We are going to vote for those who follow the Bible . ”

Drake was the target of a recent IRS investigation into his endorsement last year of former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee .
In the end , Drake was cleared .
Drake and 32 other pastors who have signed on to the “ pulpit initiative ” have sparked loud condemnations by fellow clergy and advocates of the separation of church and state .
These critics , such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State , argue that Sunday ’s sermons at churches in Oregon , Texas , New Mexico , Pennsylvania and other states will violate federal tax law by politicizing the pulpit .
That , they believe , will undercut the independence churches have long enjoyed to speak out about moral and ethical issues in American life , including women ’s suffrage , child labor and civil rights .
“ The integrity of the religious community is at stake when religion and politics become entangled , ” said the Rev. Eric Williams of the North Congregational United Church of Christ in Columbus , Ohio .

Williams was recruited for the defense fund but instead joined with 54 other Christian and Jewish clergy members to file a complaint against the initiative with the IRS .
The religious leaders asked the agency to stop the Arizona - based defense fund from recruiting churches and to investigate whether its efforts may jeopardize its own tax - exempt status .
Representing the religious leaders are three Washington attorneys , all former IRS officials , who also filed a complaint accusing defense fund attorneys of violating IRS rules by helping the churches break federal law .
Meanwhile , a separate group of 180 ministers , rabbis and imams also has sought to counter the “ pulpit initiative . ”

Members of the Interfaith Alliance -- which includes the nation ’s top Episcopal bishop -- have signed a pledge to refrain from electioneering in their houses of worship .
“ Political activity and political expressions are very important , but partisan politics are . . . . a death knell to the prophetic freedom that any religious organization must protect , ” said the Rev. Ed Bacon , rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , who signed the pledge .
All Saints survived a nearly two - year IRS investigation after former Rector George Regas spoke out against the Iraq war on the eve of the 2004 presidential election .
Bacon repeatedly said the church did not engage in campaigning .
The IRS dropped the case last year even though agency officials indicated that they still considered the sermon to be illegal .
All Saints leaders voiced frustration Wednesday at pulpit initiative backers for using the Pasadena church ’s fight with the IRS as fodder for their cause .

“ These people are wanting to promote one candidate over another and that ’s a huge difference , ” Bacon said .
At the heart of the controversy is the Johnson amendment , named after former President Lyndon Johnson , a senator from Texas when it was enacted in 1954 .
The measure stated that nonprofit , tax - exempt organizations cannot participate in political campaigns for or against candidates for public office .
Many churches have appeared to step over the line , but legal scholars could recall only one church that lost its tax - exempt status -- a congregation in New York that urged voters not to vote for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential race .
The defense fund said churches targeted by the IRS would serve as clients for lawsuits against the agency in federal court .

The defense fund issued seemingly contradictory statements about the initiative .
On one hand , it insists pastors will not endorse candidates and will simply exercise their constitutional rights by addressing “ the differing positions of the presidential candidates in light of Scripture . ”
On the other hand , the defense fund describes its efforts as a “ strategic litigation plan ” that seeks to “ restore the right of each pastor to speak scriptural truth from the pulpit ” without losing a church ’s tax - exempt status .
“ The bottom line is that churches and pastors have a right to speak freely from the pulpit , ” said Dale Schowengerdt , a defense fund attorney working on the project .
“ They should not be intimidated into silence by unconstitutional IRS regulations or rules . ”
Still , recognizing the confrontational nature of their strategy and wary of protests , the defense fund released the name of only one pastor ahead of Sunday -- the Rev. Gus Booth of the Warroad Community Church in rural Minnesota , who already is the subject of a complaint filed with the IRS over a May sermon in which he urged congregants to oppose Obama and Democratic New York Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton because of their positions on abortion .

“ There is nobody who will ever tell me what I can and cannot say from behind my pulpit , ” Booth said , “ except the spirit of God or the word of God . ”

At least 18 people have died and 135 have been hurt in a head - on collision between a passenger train and a freight train near Los Angeles .
The crash derailed both trains and forced the engine of the passenger train back into one of its coaches .
Fire - fighters put out a blaze under one of the carriages and have been cutting through metal to rescue trapped people .
The exact cause of the crash - the worst in the US for 15 years - is not yet known .
The crash happened at 1632 local time ( 2332 GMT ) on Friday , at a time when the passenger train was carrying 222 people , most of them commuters .
The Metrolink passenger train was travelling from Los Angeles to Moorpark , north - west of the city , a spokeswoman said .
It collided with a Union Pacific freight train on a curving stretch of track in Chatsworth , in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles county .
' Total destruction ' " That 's probably the most serious trainwreck to occur here in a very long time , " Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said , according to the AFP news agency .
I heard a loud crash and I saw black smoke ... some people were mangled pretty bad
Phil Thiele , Metrolink passenger
The front coach of the Metrolink passenger train derailed and was crushed by the engine after the collision .
Two other coaches of the train remained upright .
Aerial images of the crash scene showed teams of rescuers using ladders to reach injured people inside the mangled front coach .
A number of casualties were treated near the scene , while some were airlifted to hospital .
There are fears that the death toll will rise further .
Los Angeles City Fire Captain John Virant described the scene as " total destruction " .
" It was chaos .
The injuries are crushing , " he was quoted as saying by the Los Angeles Times newspaper .
Capt Virant said firefighters were trying to cut through train carriages to rescue the injured .
" They are in there removing dead bodies that are lying on top of survivors , " he said .
The Union Pacific freight train was badly damaged in the accident .
Officials say two people - the engineer and the conductor - were on board the train .
" I heard a loud crash and I saw black smoke ... some people were mangled pretty bad , " Phil Thiele , one of the passengers in the front coach , told the Los Angeles Times .
He said he tried to help one man who was pinned between seats : " I tried my damnedest to get him out but I just could n't . "
Mr
Thiele also said one woman appeared to have a serious head injury .

John McCain was supposed to deliver 100 House Republican votes .
He only delivered 65 .
Democrats were supposed to deliver 120 House Democratic votes , they delivered 140 .
“ We ’re optimistic that Senator McCain will bring House Republicans on board without driving other parties away , resulting in a successful deal for the American taxpayer , ” said McCain spokeswoman Kimmie Lipscomb .

“ What Senator McCain was able to do was to help bring all of the parties to the table , including the House Republicans , whose votes were needed to pass this ” – McCain campaign top aide Steve Schmidt , Meet the Press , September 28 , 2009
Obama has obviously studied this debate , and early on during the flight to Chicago , he told me a story about Reich and Rubin .
The previous week , Obama convened a discussion with a high - powered group of economists and chief executives .
He was sitting at a conference table , with Rubin two seats to his left and Reich across from him .
“ One of the points I raised , ” Obama told me , “ is if you just use you , Bob , and you , Bob , as caricatures , the truth is , both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated . ”
By this , Obama did n’t simply mean that their views were more nuanced than many outsiders understood .
He meant that both have come to acknowledge that the other man is , in part , correct .
The two now occupy more similar ideological places than they did in 1993 .
The battle of the Bobs may not be completely over , but it has certainly been suspended .
Among the policy experts and economists who make up the Democratic government - in - waiting , there is now something of a consensus .
They agree that deficit reduction did an enormous amount of good .
It helped usher in the 1990s boom and the only period of strong , broad - based income growth in a generation .
But that boom also depended on a technology bubble and historically low oil prices .
In the current decade , the economy has continued to grow at a decent pace , yet most families have seen little benefit .
Instead , the benefits have flowed mostly to a small slice of workers at the very top of the income distribution .
As Rubin told me , comparing the current moment with 1993 , “ The distributional issues are obviously more serious now . ”
From today ’s vantage point , inequality looks likes a bigger problem than economic growth ; fiscal discipline seems necessary but not sufficient .
In practical terms , the new consensus means that the policies of an Obama administration would differ from those of the Clinton administration , but not primarily because of differences between the two men .
“ The economy has changed in the last 15 years , and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well , ” Furman says .
“ And that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate . ”
Obama ’s agenda starts not with raising taxes to reduce the deficit , as Clinton ’s ended up doing , but with changing the tax code so that families making more than $ 250,000 a year pay more taxes and nearly everyone else pays less .
That would begin to address inequality .
Then there would be Reich - like investments in alternative energy , physical infrastructure and such , meant both to create middle - class jobs and to address long - term problems like global warming .
All of this raises the question of what will happen to the deficit .
Obama ’s aides optimistically insist he will reduce it , thanks to his tax increases on the affluent and his plan to wind down the Iraq war .
Relative to McCain , whose promised spending cuts are extremely vague , Obama does indeed look like a fiscal conservative .
But the larger point is that the immediate deficit is n’t as big as it was in 1992 .
Then , it was equal to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product .
Right now it ’s about 2.5 percent .
During our conversation , Obama made it clear that he considered the deficit to be only one of the long - term problems requiring immediate attention , and he sounded more worried about the others , like global warming , health care and the economic hangover that could follow the housing bust .
Tellingly , he said that while he admired what Clinton did , he might have been more open to Reich ’s argument  even in 1993 .
“ I still would have probably made a slightly different choice than Clinton did , ” Obama said .
“ I probably would n’t have been as obsessed with deficit reduction . ”
The new Democratic consensus is n’t complete , obviously .
Labor unions , in particular , would prefer more trade barriers than many other Democrats .
During the primaries Obama nodded , and at times pandered , in this direction .
Since then , he has disavowed that rhetoric , to almost no one ’s surprise .
Yet his zig - zagging on the issue did highlight the biggest weak spot in his , and his party ’s , economic agenda .
He still has n’t quite figured out how to sell it .
For all his skills as a storyteller and a speaker , he has not settled on a compelling message about how to put the economy on the right path .
Image Credit ... Tim Davis for The New York Times
The lack of such a message has contributed to several of his worst moments over the last year .
Most recently , the campaign has come out with a series of small - bore , populist energy plans  a windfall - profits tax on oil companies , a crackdown on speculators , a partial opening of the strategic oil reserve  that seem more political than economic .
The most glaring misstep on this score was his comment this spring about bitter rural voters clinging to guns and religion .
It was , in effect , an admission that his own message about the economy had n’t yet broken through .
The Biggest Mo-Fo Of A Printer I ’ve Ever Seen
Sure , it ’s not really new , and it ’s almost certainly not the biggest printer in the world , but the HP DesignJet Z6100 ps is still one of the largest and meanest looking printers I ’ve ever seen – for some reason it reminds me of a Decepticon hungry for some human suffering .
The 120kg monster measures in at 197 x 96 x 135 cm and is compliant with HP ’s DreamColor technology , which allows it to recreate one billion colours and if you own a HP DreamColor monitor , what you see on screen is exactly what you ’ll get printed out , colour - wise .
As you can see the print outs are huge , and the quality is pretty sweet .
And if you want to own one for yourself ( perhaps for some form of world - domination plot ) , they cost about $ US12,495 .

What a week was the week of September 14 .
Bankruptcy and bailout were the words of the week .
Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and American International Group ( AIG ) was bailed out by the Federal Reserve ( by the holders of American dollars and dollar denominated savings and investments ) while earlier in the month Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were bailed out by the US Treasury ( by the American taxpayer ) and earlier in the year Bear Stearns was bailed out by the Federal Reserve .
Then the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve put together the mother of all bailout programs proposing another Resolution Trust Corporation , similar to the one used during the administration of the senior Mr. Bush to bail out the savings and loan industry .
This Resolution Trust II will take over all the " toxic " mortgages and other bad deals made by some of the financial buccaneers on Wall Street and some other international financiers .
These debts will ultimately have to be liquidated at cents on the dollar .
The US taxpayer will be responsible for the almost $ 1 trillion cost of this bailout program .
This is in addition to the cost of the bailout of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Bear Stearns .
Does anyone truly believe that there will be only a $ 1 trillion cost for this when your objective is to bail out the malinvestments made by some of the world 's financiers ?
How long will be the line for a bailout ?
Will the line end with the financiers or will it include other industries as well ( the automotive industry has been actively seeking its own bailout by Congress ) ?
As the Austrian economists know , the root cause of this financial crisis is the spendthrift US government and the resulting inflation by the Federal Reserve which created this bubble .
Ron Paul has spoken at length about this .
A lot of money was made available by the Federal Reserve so the wizards on Wall Street invested in high - risk investments and the investments ultimately went terribly wrong .
To compound the problem some investment firms such as Bear Stearns and AIG insured the bad investments against defaults .
They were the insurers of last resort if you will that is until Hank and Ben arrived on the scene to help Wall Street clean up its mess .
Ben and Hank should abandon their bailout plan and let Wall Street experience the consequences of their actions .
We should feel no sorrow for the Wall Street financiers and swap traders .
They were playing in the risk market and ultimately lost when the market turned against them .
Since the companies such as Bear Stearns and AIG made the profit from insuring against the risk why should the American taxpayer now be asked to foot the bill for the defaults ?
These were experienced financial risk ( hedging ) managers and valuers of risk supported by teams of bright lawyers , accountants and other professionals .
They wrongly assumed that the inflation would continue forever and that consequently homeowners would forever be prosperous and continue to pay their mortgages .
They learned nothing from the dot com bubble nor did they understand the long history of financial bubbles .
Rather than taking their profits ( they made a lot of money on the way up ) minimizing their exposure and exiting from this risky business they continued and got caught as they tried to wring the last bit of profit from their business ( they lost a lot of money on the way down ) .
There is a saying in the futures business that " bulls make money , bears make money , pigs get slaughtered " and so it happened to these financiers and traders .
They should all attend a course in Austrian economics at the Mises Institute so they understand the business cycle .
Ironically the firm least affected by the crisis , J P Morgan Chase , was the one that created the derivative called Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) in the early 1990s as a means to hedge their loan risks .
Having created this derivative perhaps J P Morgan Chase understood the inherent long - term risks .
The derivatives market is a private contractual market functioning in what is referred to as the Over the Counter market ( OTC ) .
The sole purpose of the derivatives market is the allocation , hedging , valuation and pricing of risk pure and simple .
It has no other function .
A CDS is an insurance policy ( called protection in the swaps market ) against default on a debt such as a bond or loan .
An initial premium and thereafter annual premiums are paid for 5 years by a protection buyer to a protection seller to cover any loss on the face amount of the bond or loan for which the insurance is written .
If ultimately the seller of the CDS is not financially capable of paying the protection buyer in the event of a default then the buyer of the CDS insurance is out the premiums paid and has no coverage for the default .
The protection buyer is no longer hedged against the default and must so indicate such in its financial statements .
It is estimated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) that there is currently $ 62 trillion worth of CDS in the market .
If an investor wants to acquire the bonds of company X but is concerned about company X's default on the bonds the investor can hedge the investment by purchasing from a protection seller ( such as Bear Stearns or AIG ) CDS insuring the investor against the default of the bonds of company X .
The investment house makes its money in valuing and pricing the risk of default by company X .
This is a market populated by highly experienced and sophisticated risk valuers who know how to value and price risk .
Ultimately the value of CDS on referenced bonds impact on the ability of the company to raise capital .
For example if traders bid up the price for CDS on the bonds of company X the CDS market is indicating that company X is likely to default on its bonds .
This makes borrowing by company X more difficult and more expensive or impossible .
This is what ultimately happened in the case of AIG which explains why initially AIG was seeking $ 20 billion , then $ 40 billion and by the time that Ben took over AIG the company required $ 85 billion .
Now imagine what happens when AIG and other investment firms issue CDS to cover asset - backed security pools consisting of collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , pools of subprime mortgages , pools of Alt - A mortgages ( Alternative A mortgages , which are more risky than prime mortgages and less risky than subprime mortgages ) , prime mortgage pools and collateralized loan obligations .
You can begin to see where this story is heading .
As the housing market collapsed , foreclosures ( mortgage defaults ) began to rise .
As the mortgage defaults increased , the value of the pools of mortgages insured by companies such as AIG and Bear Stearns began to fall .
As the credit crisis spread to other pools of loans a company insuring against such defaults experienced more claims .
As the claims began to mount the losses began to increase .
The company had to meet margin calls on the CDS by putting up more collateral .
As the downward spiral continued the company had to meet more margin calls and put up more collateral against its CDS exposure .
In the business world this is often called " the death spiral . "
What happens to all the financial institutions with bonds or loans protected against default by the CDS they purchased if the protection seller ( provider of the insurance ) is unable to pay the protection buyer ( the insured ) for any default claims ?
Soon all these financial institutions and their balance sheets are exposed to defaults without any protection against default .
There is no longer any hedge of the risk .
The financial institutions are now forced to revalue and write down the value of the assets on their balance sheet .
This in a nutshell is what has happened .
Should the American taxpayer bail out these financial institutions ?
No .
These institutions are staffed by experienced and sophisticated financial managers and risk takers who entered into these transactions on behalf of their company .
The nature of the business in which they engage is RISK .
The fact that they purchased CDS to provide insurance protection or a hedge in the event of default is evidence of their knowledge of the risky nature of the debt in which they were investing .
If there were no great risk then there would be no need to purchase a hedge against the risk .
The sellers of protection against default valued and priced the insurance being provided in line with their assessment of the risk of default .
It is unfortunate for the holders of such mortgage pools and providers of CDS insurance that the market took the turn it did but that is the nature of the high - stakes business in which they were engaged and the nature of rising markets which ultimately come to an end .
Oil and gas producers take the risk of dry holes ( not being able to produce commercial quantities of oil or gas ) every time they drill for oil or gas but they do not run to the government for bailouts when they experience dry holes .
They understand and accept the risk associated with the exploration and production business .
Every business has risk associated with it .
Retailers attempt to judge next year 's fashions when they commit to production or purchases of those fashions this year .
As the Kenny Rogers song goes you have to " know when to hold them , know when to fold them , know when to walk away . "
The American taxpayers must walk away from the bailouts proposed by Messrs Paulson and Bernanke and the Bush administration and the US government and Federal Reserve should cease their intervention in financial markets .

But , some economists say that the slowdown in August could be a temporary blip , and may not be indicative of a long - term trend .
China ’s industrial output grew at its weakest pace in more than six year last month , partly due to the industrial shutdowns ordered by the government ahead of Olympics , the government ’s statistics agency said on Friday .
The sharp decline continued to be affected by the global economic downturn .
Industrial production in China expanded by 12.8 % in August from a year earlier , the National Statistics Bureau said after a gain of 14.7 % in July .
The August reading was less than the 14.5 % median estimate of economists .
This was slowest rate since August 2002 and well below the 17.5 % recorded in August 2007 .
But , some economists said that the slowdown in August could be a temporary blip , and may not be indicative of a long - term trend .
China ’s industrial activity will pick up with the re opening of factories in Beijing and surrounding areas , JP Morgan ’s local securities unit wrote in a note .
Read
Today ’s weak data also increases the chance that Beijing will soon announce measures to stimulate economic activity .
The figure adds to the week ’s weaker inflation and trade reports in signaling that the expansion of the world ’s fourth - biggest economy may keep slowing as growth falters in the US , Europe and Japan .
China ’s policy makers may cut the proportion of deposits that banks are required to set aside as reserves and maintain a slower pace of gains in the yuan to protect jobs , according to some economists .
The reserve ratio is expected to fall 50 basis points from a record 17.5 % by year ’s end , dropping to 15 % in 2009 .
The yuan fell to 6.8452 against the dollar as of 12:51 p.m. in Shanghai from 6.8449 immediately before the data was released .
During the July to August period , China ’s industrial output expanded by 15.7 % from the year - earlier period .
Apart from a seasonal slowdown during the Lunar New Year celebrations that fall in the January to February period , the figures represent the weakest rate of industrial output growth since August 2002 .
Separately , China ’s retail sales grew at nearly the fastest pace in at least nine years , as rising incomes encouraged consumer spending .
Retail sales rose 23.2 % in August from a year earlier to 876.8 bn yuan ( US $ 128bn ) , the National Bureau of Statistics said today , after gaining 23.3 % in July .
That was more than the 23 % median estimate of economists .
Peak Debt - US Debt & GDP Growth
I am no expert on Peak Oil , but Peak Oil is not the urgent problem that the world faces , economically , or politically .
The problems of the supply - demand of oil will play out over a longer period and its effects would be spread over a longer period of time than that of the Peak Debt , which are lot more immediate .
As a matter of fact , it has been the rapidly rising debt ( racing towards the peak ) , which in turn has " fueled " a worldwide construction boom , that has resulted in the high prices for oil over the past 4 years and not the realization of the problem of Peak Oil .
During the coming global depression , within this decade , the price of crude oil should fall below $ 25 a barrel and there will be glut due to sharply falling demand .
I realize that these are not the concerns that people have today as long as the American consumer keeps borrowing .
But , for how long ?
What Is Peak Debt ?
I will limit the discussion to the US .
If one looks at the long - term graph of Total Debt as a percent of the GDP ( see graph in the above reference ) one sees a Longwave Cycle type of behavior whereby the debt grows for a long period , decades , reaches a crescendo and then seems to fall down rapidly , in a crash - like fashion , and remains low for a long period .
Since the process is cyclical in nature , it repeats .
Thus , Peak Debt , unlike Peak Oil , is not a theory but an observed reality of our economic system .
What happens at the Peak Debt is that the Total Debt of the economy , as a percent of the GDP , or nominal debt in current dollars , or both , stop going up and start to go down .
The last time that the Peak Debt occurred in the US was in early 1930s and I can confidently predict that the next Peak Debt will occur within this decade , because the forces pushing debt higher and higher are reaching a point of exhaustion .
The rising Consumption Debt exerts a depressionary effect on future consumption and at some point the debt service reaches a high enough portion of the income that the current consumption must be cut down .
Debt plays an extremely important role in our economic system , especially , if one recognizes that stock market is a substitute debt market .
In particular , Consumption Debt , taken on by the households for the express purposes of consumption expenditures ( including mortgage debt ) , plays direct role in income and wealth inequality ; high corporate profits , hence stock market booms ; inflation rate ; etc .
All these - inequality , historically high corporate profits , and inflation - peak before the Peak Debt .
Peak Debt occurs during the early part of the Deflationary Depression phase of the Longwave Cycle .
What follows Peak Debt is a long period of depression , as the material and psychological effects of the prior consumption boom linger .
All the above are based on cause and effect and not some theory and fully supported by history of earlier episodes .
Since these cycles are rooted in human behavior , in this case the predictable behavior of various participants , especially , bankers and consumers , the cycle unfolds in a " clock - work " fashion .
The modern history of Consumption Debt , on a broad scale , especially , on non-essential purchases , is only a century old .
Its messiah was none other than Henry Ford .
Ford realized that it is not enough to offer great products at a reasonable price but the consumers must be induced to purchase in order for the producers to be able to sell more and more product and make more profits .
This led to financing of the consumer goods that ultimately resulted in the 1920s boom in the US ( very very similar to what has been going on in India over the past ten years ) .
What is new in 2000s , compared with the 1920s , is not just pushing the consumer products , for which financing became a vehicle , but pushing of the debt itself , which now results in later afterthought purchases of big - ticket consumer items .
I hope that you discern the difference between the two .
PUSHING DEBT HAS BECOME THE EASIEST AND THE MOST PROFITABLE BUSINESS IN THE US OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS .
Who wants to take the risks of a producer when financing has become so lucrative ?
Look at the largest " industrial " corporations in the US over the past decade , or two , and what you see is that they are lot more into financing business than in production business .
BTW , the boom - bust nature of the Longwave Cycle has most to do with debt , hence the " banker 's mischief " in creating them .
Let me quote my favorite economist , Joseph Schumpeter , " One of the results of our historical sketch will , in fact , be that the failure of the banking community to function in the way required by the structure of the capitalistic machine account for most of the events which the majority of the observers would call " catastrophe . " "
I am amazed by the fact that blind faithful of the American System do n't see the current " reckless mortgage lending " as an indictment of the whole econo - political system as being corrupt .
These blind faithful will pay the price in not too distant a future .
That is what happens with any blind faith .
No system , or human institution , is immune from the control by the Crooks .
We can proudly claim to be # 1 when it comes to takeover of the econo - political system by Corporate Crooks , or as " the Money Bags " had done in England a hundred years ago .
The two largest bubbles of their kind in the US history - the Stock Market Bubble of late 1990s and the Housing Bubble of 2002 - 06 - over the past ten years are a result of the largest Debt Bubble ( or Credit Bubble ) in US history .
Economic Central Planning , the American Style
We all know that the Central Planning , the Soviet Style , consisted of planning of the production .
In America , Federal Reserve , particularly in the recent years , has been attempting to plan the level of consumption ( we all know that the consumption is some 70 % of the GDP and to keep the GDP growing consumption must not be allowed to fall below a certain level ) .
The control mechanism is Consumption Debt , because at the margin all the growth in recent years is a result of debt - driven consumption .
Thus , by the control of interest rates and lending policies the Federal Reserve affects the growth in Consumption Debt , the most visible examples of this have been the lending on homes and automobiles .
Of course , Federal Reserve does n't tell you that it is trying to control Consumption Debt , or control the economy via Consumption Debt , but its policies do exactly that .
This is because there are other variables that come into play when Consumption Debt is being affected .
The most important of these variables being the inflation rate - all other things being equal , the increase in Consumption Debt leads to increase in inflation rate ( simple demand driven inflation ) and vice versa .
Now , that is in Fed 's domain .
Let us see , in 2003 , Bernanke wanted to artificially boost the economy in preparation for the Bush re-election in late 2004 and his own future appointment .
He had read articles by some self - serving economists in 2002 , if it had n't occurred to him , that low interest rates could boost housing and that may lead the economy out of the recession ( it was already out of the recession , but did n't feel like a recovery with the employment falling ) .
So , during the first half of 2003 , Bernanke , as a Fed Governor , started to publicly talk about the deflation threat and how the Fed can always stop that by " printing money . "
Thus , the Fed , under Greenspan chairmanship back then , lowered the rates to " emergency " levels when the only real emergency was the Bush re-election .
Greenspan was very happy to play along because his own reappointment in 2004 was contingent upon the economy visibly recovering .
The artificially low rates gave rise to artificial boost to the economy in the form of the predictable housing boom , but no one could have predicted the Housing Bubble and the overbuilding that ensued .
As mentioned earlier , the global building boom , as well as the general rise in consumption due to the boom , also gave rise to the steep increases in the price of oil , which has led to the current problem of inflation .
So , now the Fed has the excuse to force consumption down by altering the availability of Consumption Debt in the form of mortgage refinancing .
Therefore , the Fed is actively engaged in leading to the Peak Debt that I am predicting .
This is because curbing consumption is necessary to control inflation , especially , inflationary psychology , and it is not an accident that " inflation peaks during the first year of a recession , " as announced by Ron Insana on CNBC .
One way or another ( by raising the rates further , if necessary , or holding rates high enough for long enough )
Bernanke will have to bring the consumption down by indirectly affecting Consumption Debt .
As in the past , at some point Consumption Debt in the US will peak ( the debt service to income ratio having reached historical highs ) , most likely during the next recession , leading to the general condition of the Peak Debt for the current Longwave Cycle .
With great forethought , in 1999 , Bernanke , an academic getting attention as the future Fed Governor , pre-empted any talk of Fed having to take any actions to nip in the bud any asset bubble by his public declaration that Fed should keep its hands off any asset bubbles , i.e. , let the asset bubbles build as far as they go .
Bernanke was just the man that Bush needed on the Fed for his re-election bid and was thus appointed just in time .
( On a historical note , one of the three conditions that Grant had to agree to get the command of the Union Army was that Lincoln be re-elected ; this was confirmed by another general who was offered the command on the same conditions , before Grant was offered , and who declined due to the conditions ) .
Consequences of Peak Debt
The most immediate impact of the falling debt would be a collapse in corporate profits , hence , a sharp fall in the stock market , either crash - like , or over a period of 1 - 2 years .
The second would be fall in inflation rate to level significantly below the level preceding the Peak Debt .
Demand Destruction is what is going to kill inflation in the US , as has been the case in the past time after time , and when inflation starts to fall it does n't stop readily and keeps falling all the way into the next economic recovery .
You can count on the inflation rate going down below zero because the rate would n't be very high to begin with when it starts to fall .
Trying to control inflation rate within a very narrow band , e.g. , 1 - 2 % core CPI , is idiotic and tells you more about the mindset of the economic central planers of the US of A than about anything else .
Trying to control the economy too finely , requiring too much meddling into the economy , is not a sign of a country committed to free markets .
Higher degree of uncertainty is one price of freedom .
Control freaks are never lovers of freedom and the Federal Reserve System is a dark mark against the free market principles .
In case you have n't noticed , Federal Reserve interferes is the markets , incessantly .
These meddlers do n't even know the meaning of hands off policy most of the time ( to a blind faithful whatever the Fed does must be right and for the good ) .
In attempting to control inflation within a very tight range have n't these geniuses looked at the historical data on inflation ?
Oh , they are smarter than all the rest in the past ?
One consequence of the rise in Consumption Debt over an extended period , mostly pushed on the middle class , is rising ineqaility .
This is one consequence that takes a very long time to correct .
If you listen to people like Greenspan and Bernanke , who act as if they are " very concerned " about the problem of rising inequality , which they have contributed the most to ! , you will hear lame excuses like education gap .
What a crock .
Is the education gap in the US much higher today than in 1973 ?
Most importantly , the rich are NOT the most educated ; it so happens that the most educated serve the richest , who happen to be lot less educated then them !
BTW , Bush administration 's solution to narrowing the inequality is , you guessed it , " No Child Should be Left Behind " program !
I heard an administration official claim that , just a few days ago .
You will find direct correlation between the increase in debt on the middle class , as percent of income , and the rise in inequality .
And this correlation is a result of causation .
This time , the banking Crooks have taken the problem to such a scale that the middle class in America will be decimated .
America will become a nation full of bankrupt households most of whom were formerly middle class .
It does not bode well for the stability of the whole political system .
The current Peak Debt may well foreshadow the collapse of the American political system , as the world has known it since 1776 .
And that would be a long life for a political system .
Circa 2020s :
It was a good system for most of the time it lived .
May it rest in peace .

Peak
Oil is not a theory any more either .
The US reached peak oil in 1970 .
Planet earth reach peak oil in 2005 .
These are symptoms of a core problem .
The core problem is not peak oil or peak debt .
The core problem is the flawed economic policy we embrace in this country known as exponential growth .
The other problems , although serious , are only symptoms of this core problem .

Where to then ?
So if this is to be our future , what is the best way to financially prepare ourselves for it ?
What postion can a savy investor take to best weather this storm ?

That 's one of the best pieces of analysis I 've seen .
The end result looks like this :
http://djomama.blogspot.com/2006/12/first-world-government-junk-bonds-on.html
Security managers often have a difficult time getting budget money for security controls during times of economic health , but in a downturn that puts financial pressure in some industry sectors , security budgets can literally dry up .
This may be especially true in organizations that were releasing funds for spending on security controls based upon qualitative justification .
If you ’re in this situation , maybe it ’s time to switch to a risk - based model for making decisions on where to best spend money on security .
This approach requires that an organization adopt a risk management and risk analysis methodology that is used to perform a detailed risk analysis for any given situation .
A risk analysis methodology will enable a security manager to precisely identify threats , vulnerabilities , and risks in specific situations or settings , which can lead to a clearer understanding of specific risks and what can be done to reduce those risks .
In the end , it ’s middle or senior management ’s job to make spending decisions .
As risk managers , we can help decision - makes to make more informed decisions based upon identified risks and potential remedies to those risks .
If a decision - maker still says “ no ” , do not consider this a failure .
It is a risk manager ’s job to help management make informed decisions .
As long as the risk manager provides the facts , including the alternatives in a risk situation , then the risk manager has done his or her job .
It is the decision maker ’s job to make risk decisions .
Whether we agree with those decisions may be the basis for much professional discussion – if it ’s not our decision , it ’s not our decision .
The consolation for the risk manager is that risk - based spending at least puts money where it ’s needed the most .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
It was easy to scoff two years ago when word leaked out that Amazon was launching its own digital music service .
The Seattle - based online retailer was n't just mulling an iTunes - like download store - it was supposedly drawing up plans for a branded iPod - like device .
But Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had a much better plan for a digital music offering than his naysayers realized .
Ten months after its debut , Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) has overtaken competitors like Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) and RealNetworks ' ( RNWK ) Rhapsody to become the second biggest online store after iTunes , according to market research firm NPD .
Now two music industry sources tell Fortune that Amazon is talking to MySpace ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) about becoming the social networking giant 's download store partner when it rolls out its highly anticipated joint venture with Universal , Warner Music and SonyBMG in September .
MySpace and Amazon declined to comment on any pending deal .
Amazon still trails
Apple by a huge margin .
NPD does n't release detailed market - share data , but Russ Crupnick , the firm 's senior entertainment industry analyst , says iTunes still controls more then three - quarters of the Internet music store market .
By contrast , Amazon 's market share is in the single digits .
" There is a tremendous gap between number one and number two , " he says .
Even so , Amazon may have a better chance of chipping away Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) dominance than any of its other rivals .
MySpace plans to let its 120 million users stream entire songs before downloading them for a yet - to - be - specified price .
That could be a powerful sales tool for Amazon .
Why go to iTunes to purchase the Justin Timberlake song you just heard on MySpace when you can buy it instantly with one click , courtesy of Amazon ?
How did Amazon wind up in such a promising position after less than a year in the digital music business ?
Well , for one thing , it scrapped whatever plans it may have had for a branded - MP3 player .
How many people do you know who would have ditched their beloved iPod for what industry wags referred to as the aPod .
Sure , we all shop at Amazon .
But it does n't have Apple 's cool factor .
( Amazon , it should be noted , did go ahead with the Kindle , its oddly named wireless book reading gadget . )
Instead , the web retailer rolled out a download store that became the first to sell songs from four major music companies without digital rights management software , referred to in the music industry by its forbidding acronym : DRM .
Until recently , record companies insisted that digital music stories use DRM .
Why ?
Because the software limits the number of times you can copy a song .
But consumers hate it because it 's such a pain in the neck .
If you were one of the few people who owned a Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) Zune , you could n't play songs purchased on iTunes .
That 's because Zunes were stuffed with Microsoft software , and it would n't play songs wrapped in Apple 's DRM .
iPod owners could n't play tracks purchased from Yahoo because the portal 's music store used , you guessed it , Microsoft DRM .
By the time Amazon launched its download service , it had dawned on the major labels that DRM was n't protecting the legitimate online music business - it was stifling its growth .
The retailer persuaded them to license it songs with no copy protection so they could be played on any device .
" It had an enormous impact , " say Sam Heyworth , group product manager for Amazon 's MP3 store .
" Going DRM - free really helped . "
Here 's another thing that helped .
Amazon would n't have attracted many customers if it sold songs for 99 cents just like iTunes .
So it cut its prices .
Today , Amazon offers one - sixth of the 5.9 million tunes in its library - including the 100 most popular tracks - for 89 cents each .
It sells some classic albums - like Miles Davis ' " Kind of Blue " - for as little as $ 1.98 .
It 's tough for a pure - play digital music company like Napster to slash prices like that .
But Amazon is betting that some of the people who buy a cheap jazz album will stick around and also purchase a $ 149 digital camera .
" Amazon 's game here is like Target or Best Buy , " says Ted Cohen , managing partner of TAG Strategic , a digital entertainment consulting firm .
Sounds familiar , does n't it ?
Amazon uses music to sell cameras .
Apple uses it to sell iPods .
Maybe the folks in Cupertino , Calif. , should be a little scared .
Okay , maybe not scared .
Amazon still has a long way to go .
But perhaps Apple should be concerned .
It 's finally dealing with a competitor that looks at digital music the same way it does .

A great suit will feel like a suit of armor – it gives you a whole different level of swagger .
Nothing makes me feel more like a confident man than when I ’m in a killer suit .
If I could , I ’d wear a suit all day , everyday , whatever the occasion .
I ’ll be sharing my passion for suits through a series of article on suits .
This particular article is going to take you through the basics of purchasing a suit .
In the next few articles I ’ll talk about how to find a suit that fits your body type , talk about how to look for quality , and lots more .
So read on to make sure you know exactly what to look for to ensure that your next suit is one of the best of your life .
Step 1 : Know Why You ’re Buying A Suit
A suit is kind of a big purchase for a man , so this means you need to know as much as you can about choosing the right one before shopping .
Otherwise , you may end up with a suit that wo n’t look or feel right , and end up in your closet rack for decades without use .
The first and foremost question you should ask before a purchase is :
What will be the main purpose of the suit ?
If you ’re looking for something that you ’ll wear to the office often , then keep it dark and classic .
If you ’re looking for a suit to wear to key special occasions , then black or navy is a safe bet .
If you ’re looking for an interview suit , you want to be well dressed but not better dressed than the guy interviewing you , so do n’t break the bank on it .
Step 2 : Deciding What You Want
Do you know if you want one button , two buttons , or three buttons ?
Do you want a peak lapel ?
Do you want side vents ?
What kind of fabric and color do you want ?
Overwhelmed or confused ?
Do n’t worry , I ’ll guide you through the options .
a. Choose Your Fabric
If this is your first suit , then stick with a wool suit because it can be worn year - round .
Cotton suits should only be worn in the spring , summer , and fall .
There are even more choices out there like linen suits which are best for summer days or flannel to keep you warm during harsh winter chills .
A wool suit will give you the most for your money , so start there .
As a rule , it ’s far better to have two great suits than five mediocre ones .
Start with a rich midnight blue , a few shades darker than the average navy .
This suit will transition beautifully from day to night , and can be worn with both black and dark - brown shoes .
If you have already own a navy suit , you can go for the next most versatile suit color – charcoal .
Then move on to your light colors like light brown or khaki .
But sometimes these colors wo n’t compliment your skin tone , and so in that case go for light gray .
This is what you can wear in the summertime to dress down a formal look .
A black suit seems like the logical first choice for a young man but it ’s actually the least versatile color .
But there are times when only black will do , so you should have one nonetheless .
b. Choose The Number of Buttons
Three - button suits
The three - button suit was very popular in the 90’s because the two - button used to be the conservative main stay , but the tables are turning again .
If you ’re going to get a three button suit , instead of opting for one of those high - cut versions , look for one with a roll - over lapel — one in which you button the middle button , encouraging the soft lapel to roll over the top button .
Taller men may prefer the three - button jacket , which will reach higher on the chest and could be more comfortable or flattering .
( more tips like this in the next article )
Two - button suits
The two - button suit is what most guys should wear .
Every fashion label imaginable is designing two - button suits , except they ’re making them more streamlined and modern , so you ’ll see a lot of these around .
A man with a shorter torso will appreciate wearing a two - button jacket style .
It lengthens your frame , and it has an undeniably classic appeal .
One - button suit
The one - button suit exists , but it ’s not for everyone .
It ’s something you should buy only if you ’re in a creative job where the environment is less conservative .
If you can pull it off , it ’s a sleek look .
c. Choose Your Lapel Type
Avoid narrow and extra wide and keep it somewhere in the middle .
Also consider whether you prefer a notched lapel – which is customary – or a more dramatic peaked version .
Classic notched Lapel
Classic and conservative , a notched lapel always looks sharp .
The Peak Lapel
The peak lapel is a bit more daring and stylish .
d. Do You Want Single or Double - Breasted ?
The single breasted suit should be your default choice for both work and play .
The double - breasted version is a dashing , continental choice that ’s chic , but not for men on the shorter or heavier side as it adds fabric to your midsection .
If you ’re interested in the double - breasted jacket , make sure you have a single breasted one in your closet first .
e. Choose the Type of Jacket Vent
Double Vents ( also known as side vents )
Double vents are more European and a bit more suave .
They make it easier for you to reach into your pockets without having to fold your jacket up .
But they ’re the most expensive to make , so they ’re less available than the center vent .
Center Vent
Is modern yet more traditional .
You ca n’t go wrong with a center vent .
No Vent
Ventless jackets are the cleanest and dressiest in appearance , but they are n’t very convenient .
The wearer needs to bundle them up to access his pockets .
f. Choose Pleats or No Pleats on Pants
Men ’s fashion is getting further and further away from pleats , but they still do come in a more subtle fashion than it used to .
It can be flattering to heavier men who need some extra stretch but it ’s always flattering to go for flat - front if you can .
Personally , I hate pleats and would love if I never saw them on a pair of pants again , but some men do prefer them .
So to each his own .
g. Cuffs or No Cuffs ?
Cuffs add weight to the bottom of your pants , helping it to hang properly .
They ’re better for taller guys , but not for shorter guys because it shortens the silhouette of the legs .
Step 3 : Know Your Exact Measurements
This seems obvious , but make sure you know your exact size , not just the general category of measurements in which you think you fall under .
As a matter of fact , you should recheck your size each year .
Even if you ’ve bought a suit before , do n’t keep asking for the same size out of habit .
As you gain or lose weight or grow older and gravity takes its toll , your suit size will change .
A suit jacket size is determined by measuring the thickest part of your chest in inches .
1. Begin by measuring just under your armpits and across the chest and over the shoulder blades .
Just relax and do n’t flex .
Make sure you keep the tape measure parallel to the floor when you do this .
This will help assure you ’re measuring the thickest part of the chest area .
2 . You should take an overarm measurement where you place the tape measure over the outside of your arms at your sides and across the thickest part of your chest .
Once you have this measurement subtract 7 inches to receive a corresponding chest measurement .
Then compare this measurement with the chest measurement and take the larger of the two .
3 . Trouser sizes are determined by measuring the waist at the belt line .
In most cases , the belt line will be found just on top of your hip bones .
Now that you have all your measurements , on to next step .
Step 4 : Purchasing The Suit
If you ’re not used to buying suits , a good place to start looking is a department store , for example Barney ’s , Bloomingdales or Saks has a vast selection .
Step into the store and take a look at the different styles and types of suits they have .
See what grabs your attention .
Look at prices .
Ask for a salesman when you ’re good and ready .
Once you see something you like , grab it to take to the fitting room .
Checking The Fit
The shoulders of a jacket are crucial to a good fit .
Check this area first to determine if the proper suit size has been chosen .
( If you stand sideways against a wall and the shoulder pad touches the wall before your arm does , the suit is too big )
Very few men can buy a suit without having the collar raised , lowered , or shortened .
Look in a three - way mirror .
The jacket collar should hug the back of neck with a half inch of shirt collar showing above it .
If the shirt is hidden or there is a buckle of excess jacket fabric , try a different jacket ( a tailor can also fix this )
The jacket should not be too long , for example not halfway down your thigh
For the right length : your jacket should be long enough to cover your buttocks .
If you have very long legs , however , you may want to wear your jacket slightly longer than your buttocks to make your legs appear shorter and more balanced .
If your legs are very short , you ’ll want to wear your jacket just above the bottom of your buttocks in order to give the illusion of longer legs .
The sleeves should end at the hinge of your wrist , but leave some room to allow a quarter inch of shirt cuff to show .
You should be able to easily button the jacket without it straining , but there should n’t be too much space between the button and your chest — no more than a fist ’s worth .
Turn sides and look at the way the pants hang .
Legs should fall straight and center evenly over each foot .
Pants should sit more at the hip almost like a pair of jeans , not at the navel
You should n’t have to wear a belt ( you do n’t really need one ) , and you should n’t need suspenders to keep your pants up , it should sit naturally on your waist and stay there
If your waist in nine inches smaller than your jacket size , you ’ll need to have your suits custom - made or get a semi-custom suit .
You cannot successfully alter pants with that much drop from shoulder to waist with just a nip and tuck .
* Beware of the sales guy who may talk you into buying a suit a size too big because he will say , “ Well you want to be comfortable … ” or “ this suit will last you for the rest of your life , you ’ll grow into it ! ” Uhhh… NO .
If you can , take someone with you that you can trust ( who ’s blunt and honest ) to tell you if something looks horrible .
Step 5 : Take It To The Tailor
Your tailor will become your best friend .
A good tailor can make small tweaks that will be the difference from you exuding style confidence and your outfit being lackluster .
After choosing a suit that ’s an exceptional fit , you may want to take it to a tailor for some final touches .
You will always have more versatility with a suit that fits you well ( a bit on the slim side ) because it gives you the option to dress the jacket down with a pair of jeans .
If your pants are an inch or too wide or too tight , a tailor can usually fix them , but do n’t buy ones that are more than an inch too big or small ( it will look bad even after alterations ) .
A tailor usually will need to alter the length of the sleeves .
Insist that you ’d like a quarter inch of shirt cuff to show .
The sides of a jacket often need tapering so they contour to your torso .
And check out the collar :
Many times there is a roll in the back of the suit jacket , up near your neck .
A good tailor can correct this .
They can also take your pants in at the thigh , or shorten the length .
After you have had it altered , do n’t forget to try it on again before leaving .
Your suit should be well fitted , but not like a straight jacket .
Pretend like you ’re hailing a cab and see if it ’s comfortable to lift your arm .
The last thing you want is your suit to burst at the seams while you ’re hailing a cab for you and your date .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Scientists involved in a historic “ Big Bang ” experiment to begin this week hope it will turn up many surprises about the universe and its origins -- but reject suggestions it will bring the end of the world .
And Robert Aymar , the French physicist who heads the CERN research centre , predicted that discoveries to emerge from his organization ’s 6.4 billion euro ( $ 9.2 billion ) project would spark major advances for human society .
“ If some of what we expect to find does not turn up , and things we did not foresee do , that will be even more stimulating because it means that we understand less than we thought about nature , ” said British physicist Brian Cox .
“ What I would like to see is the unexpected , ” said Gerardus t’Hooft of the University of Michigan .
Perhaps , he suggested , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) machine at the heart of the experiment “ will show us things we did n’t know existed . ”
Once it starts up on Wednesday , scientists plan to smash particle beams together at close to the speed of light inside CERN ’s tightly - sealed Large Hadron Collider to create multiple mini-versions of the primeval Big Bang .
Cosmologists say that that explosion of an object the size of a small coin occurred about 13.7 billion years ago and led to formation of stars , planets -- and eventually to life on earth .
A key aim of the CERN experiment is to find the “ Higgs boson , ” named after Scottish physicist Peter Higgs who in 1964 pointed to such a particle as the force that gave mass to matter and made the universe possible .

But other mysteries of physics and cosmology -- supersymmetry , dark matter and dark energy among them -- are at the focus of experiments in the 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) circular tunnel deep underneath the Swiss - French border .
FEARS OF DISASTER
CERN , the European Centre for Nuclear Research , says its key researchers -- and many ordinary staff -- have been inundated by e-mails voicing fears about the experiment .
There have been claims that it will create “ black holes ” of intensive gravity sucking in CERN , Europe and perhaps the whole planet , or that it will open the way for beings from another universe to invade through a “ worm hole ” in space - time .
But a safety review by scientists at CERN and in the United States and Russia , issued at the weekend , rejected the prospect of such outcomes .
“ The LHC will enable us to study in detail what nature is doing all around us , ” Aymar , who has led CERN for five years , said in response to that review .
“ The LHC is safe , and any suggestion that it might present a risk is pure fiction . ”
Cox , from the School of Physics and Astronomy at Britain ’s Manchester University , was even more trenchant .
“ I am immensely irritated by the conspiracy theorists who spread this nonsense around , ” he said .
When the experiment begins soon after 9 a.m. ( 0700 GMT ) on September 10 , disaster scenarists will have little to work on .
In the first tests , a particle beam will be shot all the way around the LHC channel in just one direction .
If all goes well , collisions might be tried within the coming weeks , but at low intensity .
Any bangs at this stage , said one CERN researcher , “ will be little ones . ”
PRESS RELEASE
Paulson to Candidates :
Say Nothing , While I Stampede Congress
Sept. 21 ( EIRNS ) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Presidential candidates Obama and McCain to hold off presenting their own plans for the financial meltdown , while he briefed Congress that they must enact his own plan immediately .
On CNN's Late Edition today , a Huffington Post correspondent reported that Paulson had asked both Presidential candidates to hold back and propose nothing , while Paulson presented his own plan to Congress .
Obama , who was meeting with former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin on Thursday and about to present something , dutifully obeyed Paulson , the correspondent said , while McCain , being the loose cannon that he is , began instead to talk about his own plan for an MFI — a Mortgage Finance Institution .
American economist Lyndon LaRouche has called Paulson 's hyperinflationary bailout a treasonous swindle .

SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN ( R ) , ARIZONA :
Well , I appreciate the fact that they want to alert the American people , but I do believe that it would be helpful if we had some specificity .
I think Americans are on the alert now .
I think they 're very guarded and very alert to anything that they think might be untoward or suspicious .
And so I think I 'd like to have some specificity speaking , I think , for my constituents .
KING : In other words , what do we do with the warning ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
In other words , what should we be on the lookout for ?
If we are supposed to be on alert , what are we supposed to be alerted to ?
I appreciate the fact that they have all of our law enforcement people all over the country on full and complete alert , and I 'm comforted by that .
But I 'm not exactly sure what Americans are being warned against .
KING : So are you saying that you would tell the public , if you were in that position , if the threat were a building here , you would tell them this is the threat ?
MCCAIN : I would try to be specific , but I also understand , and I know most Americans are aware of the fact that they do n't want to betray the sources of their information , because that 's a critical aspect of this whole war to combat terrorism .
KING : Then why say anything ?
MCCAIN : It 's a tough call .
I do n't know , to tell you the truth .
KING : Were senators briefed ?
MCCAIN : No . I was not .
But again , I think that we should be warned , and particularly are those who are in law enforcement and military , et cetera .
But I would , if at all possible , we would -- I would like to have some more specificity associated with this warning , so that we would not be in fear of the unknown , which is probably one of the greatest problems that we face in this war on terror .
KING : Senator ; , did you think there would be the reaction there has been to your piece in " The Wall Street Journal " ?
MCCAIN : It was a lot more than I thought it would be .
KING : In essence , you were saying -- put it in your own words and then we 'll get some specifics .
MCCAIN : I 'm saying that we are in a battle for the survival of United States of America .
We have identified the enemy , and we have to do whatever is necessary to eradicate that enemy as quickly as possible , using whatever means , reasonable means necessary to do so .
I say " reasonable " because I do n't contemplate the use of weapons of mass destruction .
But that means that issues such as whether Ramadan is coming , the status of our coalition , civilian casualties -- as tragic as they are -- and other issues are all secondary to our mission , which is to seek out and destroy the enemy wherever they are .
KING : And you say : " We can not fight this war from the air alone .
We can not fight it without casualties .
We cannot fight it without risking damage to humanitarian and political interests .
So be it . "
In other words , for want of a better term , gung - ho .
MCCAIN : For want of a better term , we can't allow our primary mission to be impacted significantly by these other issues , as important as they may be by themselves , because if we allow this enemy to succeed , and indeed survive in the case of Mr. bin Laden , then we will be placing the future of the United States of America in jeopardy .
And so , let 's do what 's necessary , including ground forces , if necessary , in certain respects , and -- and do it as quickly as possible .
KING : Have you heard , senator , from the White House or the Defense Department about your piece ?
MCCAIN : I have not , but I did watch Secretary Rumsfeld over the weekend on several talk shows , and he did n't seem to be in disagreement .
KING : You also -- do you take into account -- would you if you were president take into account the feelings of Pakistan ?
MCCAIN : I certainly would .
But I also would take into account the fact that if we fail , the chances of General Musharraf staying in power are extremely dim .
And the quicker we succeed and the quicker we prevail , the more solid that regime will be and the better opportunity we will have to keep our coalition together .
I think one of the reasons why some of our friends in the area are nervous is because they 're not positive that we 're in there to stay , that we 're in it to the end .
KING : As the president of Pakistan told this show last week , you people leave ...
MCCAIN : And he 's got a point .
After the Persian Gulf War , there was a perception on the part of many leaders in that part of the world that we made a significant mistake by leaving Saddam Hussein in power , and he now to , in the view of every objective observer , continues his efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction .
KING : How do you see , senator , ground troops in this war ?
Do you perceive them doing what ?
MCCAIN : You know , I 'm -- as you mentioned at the beginning of the show , I 'm an old pilot .
But I do n't pretend to have the knowledge and expertise that the Pentagon has and other military experts have .
But I believe that you would have to have some troops on the ground so that you could stage operations out of -- out of certain areas in Afghanistan in order to eradicate these terrorist cells .
I do n't think that you can do the job by air power alone .
And I think history authenticates that .
KING : So do you see this as commandos cave by cave ?
MCCAIN : I think that good intelligence is our first requirement , which has not been that good in the past .
And then I think it requires operations from both air and on the ground to isolate and eradicate these various organizations .
And I recognize full well , as everyone does that 's ever been there , that the winters are harsh , the terrain is hostile , and the people are very hard to find .
But that does n't mean that we do n't carry out the job , and that 's why I say it may take some ground operations as well .
KING : And wars have been definable .
We know when an enemy surrenders a war is over .
MCCAIN : Um-hmm .
KING : How in your view does this war end ?
MCCAIN : We have Mr. bin Laden taken care of , when the terrorist cells are eradicated in Afghanistan , there is a government of some kind of coalition , of some kind of minimal viability in Afghanistan .
And then we have to consider the other states that harbor terrorists and are a threat to our survival .
And of course , the next step is Iraq , and we have to address that issue .
KING : And I 'll get to that .
What part do we or the U.N. play in that new state in Afghanistan ?
MCCAIN : I think it would be an ideal role for the United Nations .
I think they 're very good at peacekeeping , not very good at peacemaking .
And I think our participation and help would be important .
But I also think our allies , both in and from without the region , who also have vital national security interests at stake , could take up that burden to a large degree .
KING : The president talked about patience today .
We 'll ask Senator McCain about that word and how he would apply it to this event .
And also about Iraq and other things .
Senator John McCain is with us , lots of great guests tonight .
Do n't go away .

GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
The American people are very patient and they appreciate the efforts of the government and they appreciate the efforts of the military .
They understand better than most , better than the world that this is going take a long period of time , and they are prepared for this .

( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
KING : We are back with Senator John McCain of Arizona .
The president said today , the necessity of patience .
Do you advocate patience ?
MCCAIN : Oh , I think the president is exactly right , and I think he 's doing a great job leading the country and maintaining the support of the people .
I think that what he is saying , which was not necessarily what some others in the administration were saying -- and he 's been saying it consistently -- is that it 's going to require patience , we 're in for the long haul .
But we also have to , as quickly as possible , exert maximum amount of force , in my view , including , by the way , dramatically escalating the air attacks , particularly on the Taliban lines that are facing the Northern Alliance .
KING : So you would disagree with Senator Biden 's idea of reducing that air effect ?
MCCAIN : I had n't heard Senator Biden 's views , but I 'd ...
KING : Well , he expressed concerns about the possible fallout from a lengthy air campaign , saying it would reinforce stereotypes about the United States as a high - tech bully .
MCCAIN : Well , I talked to Joe about that .
He said that he was -- those remarks were taken out of context .
But I -- but setting that aside , the harder we hit them with maximum force the shorter this whole campaign is going to be , in my view .
And as the president has so eloquently stated , the more we convince our adversaries that we 're in it for the long haul , then the shorter this conflict can be , because again there 's this question of our staying power .
And I 'm convinced the American people will stay for a long , long time in this conflict and support the president .
KING : How about Iraq ?
MCCAIN : Saddam Hussein is developing weapons of mass destruction as quickly as he can .
The Czech government has revealed meetings , contacts between Iraqi intelligence and Mohamed Atta .
The evidence is very clear .
I think that the timing is a question of -- of a strategy , but I also believe that Saddam Hussein , in his present state , poses a threat to the security of the United States of America .
So we will have to act , I think .
But that decision is made , I believe , after we take care of this particular situation we are facing now .
KING : Do you envision taking it to Iraq ?
MCCAIN : I envision doing what is necessary to eliminate threats wherever they exist .
The president stated time and time again those countries that harbor terrorists will be held responsible .
Iraq has done a lot more than that , and I think they 'll be held responsible .
KING : So you -- are we talking semantics , or you would take it to them ?
MCCAIN : I would -- I would , quote , " take it to them " if there was the continued perception , which I believe there will be , at the time , at the proper time where they pose a threat to United States national security .
But again , I think we ought to take care of one problem at a time .
KING : All right .
You were an aviator .
Where do you stand on this aviation concept of should it be federalized or should it be federal rules with private handling it ?
MCCAIN : The flight attendants and the pilots and all those associated with aviation believe that it's a law enforcement function .
We do n't -- we do n't contract out the FBI or the Boarder Patrol or any other law enforcement function of government .
We need to do that .
The fact that some people seem to be worried about these people being members of unions , I do n't understand that argument .
We 're talking about a national security issue .
Americans do not have confidence yet in flying on airliners .
We need to give them that confidence by passing this legislation , and I hope we will do it soon .
KING : And I think Andy Card said that he would , the president would sign even the Senate version .
MCCAIN : Which , by the way , was 100 to nothing .
It 's been described as a Democrat bill .
The vote was 100 to nothing in the United States Senate .
I hope that the House will move , and I hope we will get an agreement .
And obviously , my preference is that the top 140 airports in America have federal employees .
But the point is that it 's time to act .
KING : And what about anthrax and the Senate and office buildings and leaving town ?
Where are we today ?
MCCAIN : I think our agencies of government are doing everything that they can to track this down and address the issue .
I think Tom Ridge is very well - placed to speak on this issue to the American people when we need one voice .
And I think we 're going to get it with Tom Ridge there .
And I know it 's a terrible challenge .
I -- I do n't have the scientific knowledge or expertise to make a judgment on how serious this is .
But I 'm sure we will prevail over this one as well .
KING : We have a reversal here .
I was at -- I was in Washington yesterday at the Redskin game .
And a military official said to me , we have something weird going on , Senator McCain .
We have servicemen overseas writing home worried about the people at home .
MCCAIN : Well , that -- that shows the gravity of this threat to America .
They are trying to frighten us .
They are trying to shake our resolve .
And they are trying to destroy the things that we believe in .
And that 's why this conflict is so important , and that 's why we have to do whatever is necessary to bring it to an end as quickly as possible .
KING :
There never will be a total victory over terrorism , will there ?
I mean , there will always be terrorism somewhere somehow .
MCCAIN : Sure .
There will always be .
Just like there was the Oklahoma City bombing and other acts of domestic terror .
But there 's a great difference between the fact that we may be exposed to acts of terror , and countries who harbor , finance , provide training , and an environment for these people to be able to develop , coordinate , and carry out attacks of terrorism on the United States of America .
Wherever they are , if they 're rooted out and if they 're on the run , they 're going to be dramatically reduced in their effectiveness and their ability to inflect -- inflict these acts of terror upon the people of this country .
KING : And one other thing on Ramadan .
You say : " We must reject appeals to suspend military operations to accommodate the religious practices of affected populations . "
In other words , you can never consider that in war ?
War is hell -- period ?
MCCAIN : The last time I know I was Christmas of 1914 , the Germans and British came out of the trenches and fraternized .
Look , the Egyptians attacked .
There was an attack on Israel during Ramadan .
The Iranians and the Iraqis fought through several Ramadans .
The fact is that the Koran does n't explicitly prohibit it .
So I do n't think it 's an issue anymore than fighting on Christmas is , something we 'd rather not do , but something that certainly should not be an overriding factor .
KING : Always good talking with you .
Thank you so much , senator .
MCCAIN : Thank you , Larry .
KING : Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , a great decorated hero and a member of the Armed Services Committee .
More senators , more guests coming .
Lots of big guests coming this week .
We 'll be telling you about that , too .
We 'll be right back .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) ASHCROFT :
If people take these warnings seriously , they go about their lives , but they participate with patience in the additional steps that are taken by law enforcement authorities , they are very likely participating in the prevention of terrorism and in the disruption of terrorism .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We now welcome to LARRY KING LIVE , all in Washington , Senator Richard Lugar , Republican of Indiana , member of Foreign Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence ; Congressman Christopher Shays , Republican of Connecticut , chairman of National Security , Veterans Affairs , International Relations Subcommittee .
Tomorrow , the Government Reform Committee -- he 's a member -- holds an oversight hearing on the safety of postal workers and the U.S. mail .
And Congresswoman Jane Harman , Democrat of California , ranking member of the new House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security .
They held an open hearing on domestic preparedness and emergency response to terrorist attacks today in New York City .
We start with Senator Lugar .
What do you make of what Attorney General Ashcroft had to say today about terror threats and informing agencies to deal with it ?
SEN .
RICHARD LUGAR ( R ) , INDIANA :
Well , I presume that Attorney General Ashcroft felt that by the time a briefing or even faxes were sent to 18,000 law enforcement officers , this would be intercepted by most news organizations , and it was best simply to inform the American people that there is a serious threat .
Likewise , I suppose to give the public an indication that if they 're inconvenienced further by law enforcement or security people , whoever they may be , that this is the reason .
I think that 's about all you can say about it .
I would agree with Senator McCain it would have been useful to have more specifics .
I presume the reason there were not specifics is that this would have violated intelligence sources and methods , and given away more than we needed to give away .
KING : You were not briefed , Senator Lugar , on it .
LUGAR : My office was told that the secretary was going or the attorney general was going to do what he was going to do .
So I was prepared to listen , and did with most Americans .
REP .
CHRISTOPHER SHAYS ( R ) , CONNECTICUT : Congressman Shays , what did you think ?
SHAYS : I think both senators have covered it well .
I just want you to know , I 'm on the alert , I 'm ready .
I can't any more ready than I am .
KING : To do what ?
SHAYS : That 's the whole point .
You know , I 'm just alert , and so are the American people .
So it 's almost like ...
KING : So you look both ways when you leave your house ?
What alert means ?
SHAYS : Well , it means -- it means I do n't park to the car in front of me as tightly in case I have to get out .
It means I notice who comes on airplanes .
It means a lot of things .
And it means I 'm careful how I open my mail .
I 'm doing everything I can do .
KING : Congresswoman Harman , what did you make of the alert today by the attorney general and the FBI director ?
REP .
JANE HARMAN ( D ) , CALIFORNIA : I think it was a mistake .
Rudy Giuliani this morning told us to go about and live our normal lives , and then all of a sudden we hear there 's something else coming , that 's going to make people dive under their mattresses again .
I think it 's very important that the administration speak with one voice .
I think that should be Tom Ridge .
The message should be reassuring , and we should get specific information about what we 're supposed to do .
Everyone is already on alert .
It makes no sense except for a bureaucratic cover - your - posterior reason to do this .
KING : Senator Lugar , the New York mayor was also asking police around the country to -- they must be informed by federal , FBI and other officials , to share intelligence with local police and government officials .
That should be mandatory .
Do you agree ?
LUGAR : Well , certain intelligence should be shared .
Once again , it 's a matter of degree .
And I would say that as much as can be shared ought to be .
For the same reason we have all been discussing this evening , the American people ought to be cut in on as much as possible , because we 're in this together .
KING : And Congressman
Shays , tomorrow your subcommittee is going to hold a hearing on information sharing between federal and local law enforcement officials .
What are your views ?
SHAYS : Well , first , let me just say Senator Lugar makes the point that I just want to emphasize .
We have tremendous ability to do investigative work with our local law enforcement agencies and we are n't doing it .
And the bill that we just recently passed that was signed into law requires the FBI to share information with INS and the State Department , which they were n't do doing .
But they need to take advantage of the incredible ability to get information on the local level , and they need to do it right away .
( CROSSTALK )
KING : I 'm sorry .
Go ahead .
SHAYS : I was just going to say , in terms of our hearing tomorrow , we -- the postmaster is going to be there .
He 's going to tell us what they 're doing .
We 're going to hear from all four of the major unions in the post office facilities to give them a chance to express their concerns .
They have a lot of frustration .
They deserve to be heard .
And we do -- we need to listen to them .
KING : Tomorrow night , Congresswoman Harman , on this program , together , Secretary Thompson of Health and Human Services and Dr. Jeffrey Koplan , the head of the Centers for Disease Control , will appear .
And there have some who are saying that we 're sort of up in the air on this , that the facts have n't been forthcoming , that somebody said that Secretary Thompson does n't have any medical background , he 's in a tough position .
What 's your thought on how well we 're handling this domestic problem ?
HARMAN : Well , I was at the CDC last week .
About 10 of us went down there .
It 's the most talented group of people in the shabbiest facilities you 've ever seen , and they 're working as fast as they can to get on top of this .
But they were hampered last week when they never received the actual letter delivered to Senator Daschle , so they did n't know the exact level of sophistication of the anthrax it contained .
I think there are too many voices , too many messages .
Tom Ridge needs statutory authority .
He needs to be the voice delivering the administration 's message on homeland security .
KING : Senator Lugar , he 's going to be , is n't he -- Senator Lugar , is n't he going to be ?
He 's going to have three press conferences a week ?
LUGAR : That 's the plan , but I agree with Congresswoman Harman that this needs to happen very soon .
And three a week may not be enough .
We do n't know day by day how much interpretations require , but there must be one voice .
And even more importantly , whether briefing or not , he needs to have the authority to try to bring together all these disparate agencies .
All well and good to talk about intelligence getting to local police officers and sheriffs , but that 's not going to happen in America without a very strong political push , with the president standing right behind Tom Ridge , and perhaps , as some have suggested , legislative authority , budget authority , ability to crack heads , to finally make something of what otherwise is going to be a very disparate system .
SHAYS : Larry , can ...
KING : Congressman Shays , you were going -- yeah , go ahead , Chris .
SHAYS : He needs to do what the three commissions have said .
We need to assess the terrorist threat , we need a strategy , and we need to ultimately reorganize .
But the key for me right now is to develop the assessment of the threat and the strategy .
And I care less about him speaking to the public .
I want him to catch up .
He 's on a high learning curve .
I think it 's important that he get the other government agency people to speak with the same basic message , but I do n't think he has to be the only one we hear from .
KING : Let 's take a call .
Tampa , Florida , hello .
CALLER : Yes , Larry .
My question for the panel is , with the impending danger that Mr. Ashcroft has actually told the nation , what advice would you have for parents and teachers , the children for impending danger , and maybe try to explain to them the situation and maybe calm fears , but yet actually educate them for the future ?
KING : Yeah , Congresswoman Harman , what would you say ?
Kids are going to go trick - or - treating tomorrow night all over America .
HARMAN : Well , reassure your kids that they 're going to be safe and then watch them carefully .
I think trick - or - treating is fine as long as you go to a neighborhood you are familiar with , parents are there , and they watch for signs of trouble .
I think as we 've all told our kids over the years , do n't eat any candy that is n't sealed , and it 's the same message .
Again , I think we should be out .
I think we should live our lives as Americans , but be watchful and vigilant .
KING : Senator Lugar , are you -- we know Congressman Shays is .
Are you watchful and vigilant ?
LUGAR : I certainly am , every day .
Each one of us is , and we will have to continue to be for a long time .
I think it 's very important we discuss these incidents , and the world with our children and our grandchildren as I 've been doing .
And I 'm sure that 's true of most members of Congress .
That 's a very human dimension with grandchildren and children scattered over the country and others who are worried about us ...
KING : Talk about it .
LUGAR : Back here -- read about the Hart Building , for example .
I 'm right in the middle of the Hart Building , right in the same corridor with Senator Daschle and ventilation and so forth .
Now , we had a pretty good briefing today .
I learned much more again about anthrax , about the way they 're going to fumigate that building .
In fact , I might finally have an office November 13th .
KING : Let me get a break .
I 'll pick right up with you , Dick .
By the way , Senator Daschle will be with us on Wednesday night .
When we come back , James Kallstrom will join us .
We 're going to keep our panel .
We 'll come back to them .
But we 're going to spend some moments with the director of the recently created New York State Office of Public Security , former assistant director of the FBI , James Kallstrom will be with us .
As we go to break , the latest edition of TIME magazine out today has an exclusive photo essay on how President Bush is rallying his team in these troubled times .
The photographer is Brooks Kraft .
Here 's a look .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We now welcome to LARRY KING LIVE , James Kallstrom , director -- and by the way , our panel will be back with us in a little while .
Director of the recently created New York State Office of Public Security , former FBI assistant director in charge .
He was , among many other things , he led the FBI 's investigation into TWA 800 back in July of ' 96 , where his face was a daily figure on American television .
Why did you take this job ?
JAMES KALLSTROM , DIRECTOR , NEW YORK STATE OFFICE PUBLIC SECURITY :
Well , like many , I 'm sure , that sat on the couch and watched this horrendous thing unfold , had this gnawing feeling in your heart that you had to do something and use the skills that were amassed over the last couple of decades .
So when the governor called me , which I did n't expect to get a call , but when he did , it was -- it was nice that he would give me the chance to contribute .
KING : Do you have clout , Jim ?
KALLSTROM : Oh , big - time clout .
He 's pretty much given me a pretty broad look at the entire state , all the operations .
I can tell you , the state of New York is well - positioned and we 're looking to make it even better - positioned .
The point of getting good relevant information down to the cops on the street , the sheriffs on the street , the people that are driving around 24 hours a day , walking beats , and that know the communities , Larry , that 's the key to this , and we 're working overtime to make that happen .
KING : Did you hear from the attorney general today -- I 'm sure you heard his statement -- had you heard prior what these warnings were about ?
KALLSTROM : Yes , we did hear prior .
We had a conference call with Governor Ridge , and we discussed the entire matter , and I discussed it with Governor Pataki and the law enforcements leadership here in New York state .
KING : Do you think Senator McCain was right when he said you should be specific and tell us what the threats entailed ?
KALLSTROM : Well , I understand what he 's saying , but you know , we have to play it -- I understand what the congresswoman is saying also .
I do n't know where I come down on the type of broad threat , but I can tell you , having worked in that business for a long , long time , there are things that you know that if you disclose in any specificity those sources would dry up or that information be irrelevant .
So it is a tightrope that you walk , Larry .
You know , why they decided to come out with these broad , general threats , I guess you 'd have to ask them .
KING : Well , let 's take an example of what could happen tomorrow night .
There 's a report that President Bush is planning to attend tomorrow night 's World Series game at Yankee Stadium ; at Madison Square Garden , maybe 6 miles from the stadium , Michael Jordan returns to the NBA tomorrow night at a sold - out event at Madison Square Garden .
Is tomorrow night a troublesome night for you ?
KALLSTROM : It 's another night in New York .
I mean , New York does those things , and they do it does better than anybody else here in the city and in the state .
We 're concerned about those events , obviously , but I can tell you that every crucial step will be taken .
And we 're confident that we 're all going to have a good time in New York tomorrow .
KING : So but you are -- are you not concerned ?
KALLSTROM : Absolutely we 're concerned .
We 'd be stupid not to be , Larry .
But let 's not forget , you know , this is the greatest country in the world .
We 're the good guys .
We have nothing , nothing to fear , nothing to be ashamed of .
They did this to us .
They 're the bad guys .
We 're the good guys .
We 'll think out of the box .
We 'll get these people , believe me .
Everybody is supermotivated , like I 've never seen .
And we are going to do all right here .
And everybody should enjoy our way of life and our society , and this great city and this great state and this great country .
And I can tell you that law enforcement and all those that support law enforcement are energized , and we will see this through .
We have to have a long view here .
And we can't let every bump in the road or every bit of collateral damage , you know , get us off this path and this 24 - hour news cycle .
You know , we start seeing some collateral damage -- we have to look beyond that .
KING : Now , you were in the Bureau , and Mayor Giuliani testifying today -- and Congresswoman Harman was there asking questions -- said that the Bureau and other federal agencies should share a lot more information with local agencies .
Now , you 've left the Bureau and you 're a state agency .
Should they share more ?
KALLSTROM : I think absolutely , that we should share not maybe the raw intelligence .
That 's not as critical .
But we need to put in the minds and the eyes and the brains of law enforcement , the people on the street , the relevant facts .
If there 's terrorists in the United States right now , somebody is looking at them , Larry .
Police officers are seeing them come and go from places they live , where they eat , where they go to restaurants , whatever they do .
We have to think ahead , think out of the box , think what those clues will be .
After the fact , after 9 - 11 , it was sort of unbelievable that they sort of lived the way they did in this country .
And we could have wrapped them up in five minutes if we had a few clues .
So what are those clues now ?
That 's what we 're trying to figure out .
And we will figure it out .
KING : And we will be calling on you again .
But one other thing for this time , why are you so optimistic ?
KALLSTROM : Well , I 'm an optimistic person , but I look at the people that are around me .
I look at all of us that are in this business that give our life for public safety and national security , and I 've never seen people as energized , Larry .
And if the country can hang together and all the politicians can hang together , we will see this through .
We 'll be a stronger nation for it .
And we will be just -- not -- a better nation than we were .
So I 'm a very confident .
KING : Thanks for being with us .
We 're going to call on you again .
James Kallstrom , outstanding official , former assistant director of the FBI and now the head of the New York state office of public security .
He 's their director .
Now back to our panel .
Senator Lugar , what did you make of what James Kallstrom had to say in general ?
LUGAR : Well , I 'm pleased that he's on the job .
And it 's obvious that he 's just gotten there -- he 's had a lot of experience .
But at the same time , we 're back to the same questions you were asking earlier .
How specific , how do you coordinate with the locals ?
How do you get information to the American people ?
And the question tomorrow night was a very difficult question , and we wish him every success .
KING : And it 's also Halloween .
LUGAR : Exactly .
KING : Yeah , Congressman Shays , what did you make of generally -- Kallstrom , of course , is one of the veterans of police work .
SHAYS : He 's a superb appointment , and what better way to get the FBI kind of involved in local activity than to have him in New York City .
And he 's right .
This -- this day you mentioned , day tomorrow , is like a typical day in New York .
Lots of great things happen in that wonderful city .
KING : And Congresswoman Harman ?
HARMAN : Well , this issue of FBI failing to share information with local law enforcement was the topic this morning at our hearing in New York .
Following the hearing , actually at 2:30 this afternoon , FBI Director Bob Mueller in Toronto for a police chiefs meeting announced that he would increase cooperation .
The point , however , is that in New York City there are 40,000 police in the NYPD .
There are only 11,000 FBI agents nationwide .
Just by the numbers , you 've got to have local law enforcement know what 's up , otherwise they can't protect New Yorkers and visitors who are at Yankees Stadium or any place in New York .
KING : Some other -- other items , Senator Lugar .
What do you make about new concepts of restrictions on immigrants , Arab nationalists and others ?
LUGAR : I 'm certain we 're going to revisit immigration in a big way .
Now , the question is how much the American people are prepared to pay for this .
In essence , 400,000 persons might be tracked around the United States as to why they came in , why they overstayed .
Likewise , the problem of students , most of them here very legitimately , and at the behest of our own universities .
They pay full tuition .
They 're very important .
Yet at the same time , one of the basic themes the president talked about today were the overstaying or the fraudulent stays of hijackers that came as students .
These are very tough and expensive issues , and we 've got to tackle them along with a whole lot of other things simultaneously .
KING : We 'll take a call .
Fairfield , California , hello .
CALLER : Hi .
KING : Hi .
CALLER : My question is about the anthrax .
KING : Yeah .
CALLER : The Daschle and Brokaw letters -- it closed down the Capitol , and now the mail , the postal services , they 're like thousands of people on the Cipro or whatever .
What about the mail that went to the hundreds of homes , the -- people that received mail from these post offices ?
KING : I believe today in New Jersey , Congressman Shays -- you 're the expert in this area -- someone not identified , not with the Post Office , not with the media has been affected with anthrax .
So does she have a good question ?
SHAYS : Well , it 's a very important question .
And the post office is going to be looking for ways to protect mail .
They 're going to potentially irradiate the mail , make sure that bacteria is n't sustainable .
I mean , we 're going to be looking at a lot of things we did n't even think a few weeks ago we would ever have to consider .
But there 's tremendous ingenuity in this country , and you 're going to have entrepreneurs who are going to be able to come and say , we have something that can meet your need .
It will just take us a little time .
KING : So you are -- of course , you 've been pessimistic in some areas .
In this area , you 're optimistic ?
SHAYS : Oh , I have been -- I have n't been pessimistic about our solutions .
I 'm just pessimistic that people wo n't realize this is a war and that we 're in a race with the terrorists .
If they know we 're in a race with the terrorists and know why we have to fight this war , they 'll know why our resources need to be spent to deal with all the problems we 're going to be facing .
And as long as they know that , I 'm very , very hopeful .
KING : What did you make of the hearings today , Congressman Harman ?
HARMAN : I thought they were terrific .
We had 10 members of Congress , Mayor Giuliani , and his lead , first responder group -- police , fire , health and so forth .
And then we had three governors from Georgia , Oklahoma and Florida -- Jeb Bush was there .
And they were talking about terrorist incidents in their state and how they dealt with it .
The Olympics in ' 96 , and obviously the Oklahoma Federal Building bombing , and the anthrax scare in Florida .
They 're competent .
We had the sheriff of Los Angeles County -- your new home , Larry -- Lee Baca talking about how well - prepared L.A. is .
Those are the successes .
The problem is , what about other parts of the country where they 're not up to that level ?
If one part of the country is n't safe , we 're all not safe .
The , you know , the -- it 's only -- we 're only as strong as our weakest link , and that 's the challenge .
And that is why , again , I feel so strongly that we need a coordinated homeland security program .
We need budget authority for Tom Ridge .
We need one voice speaking for our entire government .
The war at home is just as deadly , and perhaps more deadly , than the war we 're fighting abroad .
KING : And one quick question for Senator Lugar before we thank you .
Senator , since you 're on Foreign Relations , we 're now in the fourth week in Afghanistan .
What do you make of that operation ?
LUGAR : I think the operation is going well .
I think that people are impatient and they want success right away .
I have confidence that the military people in fact are setting the stage to defeat Osama bin Laden , and in fact , our most basic problem will be probably to hold together some government in Afghanistan after we have expelled the Taliban , and likewise , in Pakistan , next door .
Now beyond that , John McCain said earlier tonight , we have some other cells in other places .
And we 're going to think ahead how we maintain the coalition , how we maintain the same spirit that we have out in Afghanistan .
KING : Thank you all , Senator Richard Lugar , Congressman Christopher Shays and Congresswoman Jane Harman .
Coming next , Steven Engelberg and Judith Miller , two of the three that wrote the runaway bestseller " Germs : Biological Weapons and America 's Secret War . "
As we go to break , more pictures from the new issue of " TIME " magazine .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We now welcome to LARRY KING LIVE , return visit for Judith Miller , senior writer of " The New York Times , " recipient of an anthrax scare letter .
Did not have anthrax , however .
She 's coauthor of " Germs : Biological Weapons and America 's Secret War . "
Along with her , one of the three authors , Stephen Engelberg , investigative editor of " The New York Times , " and considered , of course , another expert in this growing field .
" Germs " is the book they co-wrote .
William Broad is the other writer .
It 's No. 1 on " The New York Times " nonfiction bestseller weeks -- for the weeks of October 28 and November 4th .
We congratulate them on that .
And Judith , what did you make of the Ashcroft warning today ?
JUDITH MILLER , CO - AUTHOR , " GERMS " : I was a little mystified and a little worried .
I share Senator McCain 's feeling about it .
I think that it's one thing to tell Americans to go out and shop and lead normal lives , but I think it 's kind of hard to do that if at the same time every week they 're also saying , you know , be afraid , be very afraid , there 's something out there , we can't tell you what it is .
So I 'm not really certain what purpose it serves to issue a warning like that .
KING : Do you have a laryngitis , Judith ?
MILLER : I 'm afraid , Larry , I do .
I 've been trying to keep quiet all day so that I can talk to you tonight .
KING : You 're coming through .
It 's just I 'm concerned .
You 're all right , though ?
MILLER : I 'm fine .
We know what it 's not .
Let me put it that way .
KING : People get anthrax scares and have a soar throat or something , you worry .
MILLER : I know .
This is just ordinary laryngitis .
KING : Stephen , what did you make of the Ashcroft - Mueller hearing ?
STEPHEN ENGELBERG , CO- AUTHOR , " GERMS " :
Well , I mean , I 'm with Judy .
KING : Not hearing .
Mini press conference .
ENGELBERG : I 'm with Judy .
I think that our government would do well to stop saying over and over again , be afraid .
I mean , I think that the only thing you can conclude from this is that they want to tell us , should anything happen , well , we 've been warned .
And I understand that we in the press have a habit of beating up on them , you know , if they do n't come forward with all possible intelligence .
But the fact of the matter is , if I were Osama bin Laden and I were trying to execute a sort of psychological operation against the United States , I would these kinds of undifferentiated constant warnings of threats .
It just does n't help an American .
What 's the appropriate thing to do at this point ?
What do you do when you hear one of these threat warnings ?
KING : Judith , where are we now ?
What do we know that we did n't know weeks ago ?
MILLER : Well , we do know , Larry , that the spores in the Daschle letter were very pure and were able to float through the air .
They formed an aerosol , a deadly one for at least three people .
We also know -- and this we did n't know before -- that somehow , through the bundling process of the post office , anthrax could escape a sealed letter .
I mean , the fact of the matter is I think we know now that we do n't know as much as we thought we knew about anthrax .
And it highlights the lack of research that 's been done in this field .
We also know today that there is not , and tonight , the additive in the anthrax , that General Parker today said that there was silica .
And that 's a different additive altogether .
KING : Meaning ?
So , that means ?
MILLER : Well , it means that -- one of the things it means is that this is an additive that was used in the American weapons program a long time ago .
That does n't mean that it's an American who did it or that it 's anyone from an American program .
It 's simply another clue that one day may help us pin down this source of anthrax .
But we still do n't know that source .
We 're still all speculating .
KING : Stephen , you recently wrote that this bioterrorism attack has plunged the public health establishment into unexplored territory .
Does that give you great concern ?
ENGELBERG : Yes , it does .
I mean , if you look at the kinds of things we were sort of studying in the book , we looked at these massive bioterrorism events : infectious diseases spreading through whole cities , crop dusters spraying germs .
As far as I know , no government scenario ever examined the threat from a letter because it was considered too small .
And yet , look what 's happened .
Our public health laboratories are strained to the breaking point .
We 've had all kinds of confusion from public officials about how to handle this .
You know , if we 're lucky and this is as bad as it gets , I think we 've had an extremely valuable and important wake - up call , and it 's really exposed the vulnerability what we 're going to have to address in the coming years .
KING : Judith , what 's your biggest worry right now tonight ?
MILLER : Tonight ...
KING : Other than laryngitis .
MILLER : Other than I may not have any voice by the end of the program .
I guess I worry all the time about whether or not Americans are being frightened unduly .
I think that the kind of preparations that are under way are basically the right ones .
I could quarrel with whether or not I think Cipro is the right drug to be prescribing .
I do n't .
But in general , I think Americans have to be confident , and when you listen to Jim Kallstrom talk , and Senator Lugar , Jane Harman , Christopher Shays , these are some of the people who 've really been fighting this battle for some time , trying to alert Americans .
And now , the government is alerted .
So I 'm not worried .
I do n't go to bed at night wondering whether or not America or New York is going to be attacked .
I worry that people will forget that recovery , real biodefense is a long - term proposition and an expensive one .
And I 'm worried that attention will flag .
KING : Take care of yourself , Judy .
Thank you , Stephen .
MILLER : Thank you .
KING : " Germs : Biological Weapons and America 's Secret War . " Judith Miller and Stephen Engelberg co-authors .
When we come back , an extraordinary musical experience .
We end every show with one .
We 're going to hear from Diamond Rio .
Do n't go away .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We now welcome , joining us from Nashville , the band .
They are Diamond Rio. Marty Roe is the lead singer .
They took part in a national benefit for the victims of October -- on September 21 .
They did it on October 21st .
They 're in for the annual charity tournament .
They 're going to do a big benefit concert in New Jersey on December 14 .
And they 're going to sing their great song , " One More Day . "
It 's up for both single and song of the year .
How did you come -- we 've only got a quick amount of time here , Marty ?
How did you come to write this ?
MARTY ROE , DIAMOND RIO :
To do the song ?
We recorded the song basically when we first heard of it .
It 's true .
The lyric is about -- I think we all get kind of caught up in the hustle and bustle of day - to - day life , and this is kind of about stripping away all of that and getting back to what really matters .
KING : It 's a great number .
ROE : Thank you .
KING : Let 's hear it .
From Nashville , here they are to close it out , Diamond Rio and " One More Day . "

When we first heard about EFiX - a simple USB dongle that 'll let you magically install Leopard on your PC - it sounded too fantastic to be true .
Well , I used it to turn my gaming PC into a Mac Pro over the weekend , and I 'm somewhat amazed to say this , but it works perfectly .
Advertisement
I grabbed all the updates straight from Apple - including 10.5.5 last night , so you do n't have to wait for a hacked patch like you would running a typical Hackintosh - installed a whole bunch of software and have been using it for several days .
It runs beautifully , just like a real Mac Pro .

The Process
There are , of course , rules you have to adhere to , as there tends to be when using black magic .
The major one with EFiX , and its only real " catch , " is that you have to use the supported hardware , not a very long list indeed .
But outside of the Gigabyte motherboard requirement ( reportedly some Asus boards using a P45 chipset also work ) , it 's actually fairly generic .
I just happened to have everything on the list .
If you 've got the hardware , the whole process is simple , so that even if you 've never cracked your desktop before , you could still get this done with a quick search online for the requisite know - how .
I plugged the EFiX dongle into a USB header on my motherboard - not , as you might have assumed , to a USB port on the outside .
That 's really it for getting your hands dirty , though .
I restarted my computer , selected EFiX as the boot device - it was listed under hard drives , actually - and was greeted with a drive selector .
After selecting the Leopard disc , it started installing without a hitch .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Okay , there was a slight hitch .
My video card , an Nvidia 8800GT , is n't supported by the firmware EFiX ships with .
EFiX already has the update on the site , but its updater is only coded for 32 - bit Windows .
If , like me , you run Vista 64 - bit , you will have to install Vista 32 - bit on the drive you intend to put Leopard on , just to update the stupid firmware .
After I did that , everything was peachy .
The only slight inconsistency is that my 8800 GT shows up as a 256MB card , when it 's actually a 512MB card , and my 1066MHz RAM is only running at 800MHz apparently .
But that 's sorta trivial .

The Numbers
Advertisement
Here are some benchmarks compared to some numbers Adam over at Lifehacker ran for his Hacktinosh vs. a MacBook Pro and Mac Pro.
Obviously , my hardware is newer - a 3GHz E8400 Wolfdale Core 2 Duo , 4GB RAM ( running at the slower 800MHz , rather than 1066MHz ) and an Nvidia 8800 GT ( with the OS only recognizing half of the memory ) .
The total guts of my computer cost just under $ 800 when I put it together in May , hard drive included .
( Mac Pros start at $ 2,300 . )
Advertisement
Day to Day
One thing to keep in mind is that EFiX has to interlope every time you want to boot to Leopard , so a cold boot takes at least two minutes , between booting to EFiX , picking Leopard , then loading it up .
And when you go into Windows , EFiX will show up as an attached USB drive .
These are n't dealbreakers - once you 're up , performance is great .
Overall , the experience is really incredible for how smooth and seamless it is .
Updates , installing software , everything is just like a real Mac .
The best way to put it is this : I 've got a Mac Pro now .
I occasionally feel like Windows is running just a smidge more slowly , but benchmarks compared to before I installed EFiX do n't support that creeping feeling , so I chalk it up to paranoia .

Is the dongle worth $ 170 $ 155 ( EFiX USA originally quoted me $ 170 ) ?
That 's a personal question .
Do you wanna go through the usually more complicated - but free - Hackintosh process ?
Perhaps the best way to look at it is this :
If you 've already got the supported hardware , it 's like buying a Mac for $ 155 , since you can still have your trusty PC just a restart away on the same machine .
Also , even as simplified as it is , you still need to know what you 're doing .
There 's no official tech support , though there is a very active forum that provides helpful answers to queries .
Updated : EFiX USA is handing all of the distribution in the US for E - FiX.com , who actually does n't do any of that .
They were selling units on eBay but their main site looks like it 's up now .
So far in our dealings with the company ( who sent us EFiX to review ) we have n't had any reason to think they 're scamming anyone , but it 's understandable if you wanna approach this with caution .

The real news , the headlines , should not rest on Sarah Palin as they still do , but on the economic situation in the US .
So I will start with what I consider to be a major scandal and deal with Palin as the ultimate “ Manchurian Candidate ” below the fold .
The major scandal I am talking about is the bailing out at your expense of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as reported by the New York Times and the Washington Post .
I add here excerpts from major economic newspapers :
The Financial Times :
The US Treasury has moved closer to a rescue plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two struggling government - sponsored mortgage groups whose fate is key to the future of the US housing industry and financial markets .
The exact form of the proposed government rescue remained unclear , but share prices for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac declined 30.3 per cent and 26.6 per cent respectively in after - hours trading , reflecting investor concerns that the rescue plan would wipe out holders of equity in the groups while guaranteeing their debt .
( read more )
The Wall Street Journal :
It is also expected to involve the government injecting capital into Fannie and Freddie .
That could happen gradually on a quarter - by - quarter basis , rather than in a single move , one person familiar with the matter said .
( read more )
Reuters :
Senior Bush administration and Federal Reserve officials called in top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Friday and told them that the government was preparing to place the two companies under federal control , officials and company executives told the New York Times .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson were present at meetings with James Lockhart , the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , the regulator of the two companies , and with Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron on Friday , Reuters can confirm .
There were separate meetings with the two CEOs .
( read more )
Bloomberg :
The Washington Post reported that the government would make quarterly injections of funds as the companies ’ losses warranted , avoiding a large up - front taxpayer cost , citing sources it did n’t name .
Debt and preferred shares would be protected , and common stock would be diluted while not wiped out , the Post said .
The New York Times said most or all of both the common and preferred shares would be worth little or nothing .( read more )
In the case of Fannie Mae the history , as I understand it , goes like this : Founded in 1938 by the government with your money .
Then , to cover the Vietnam War costs , what already belonged to you was sold to you for which you spent some more of your money .
Then is was provided with some healthy GSE competition , ( Freddie Mac also sponsored with your money ) and left out to fare in the shark infested waters of the financial industry , always , as a GSE , fostered with guarantees from your money .
Finally saved with your money which nixed your common shares ( in short : your money ) and now being artificially kept alive to protect the fat cats investments with your money .
Impressive indeed .
I dare state that , had this happened in France , there ’d be Government buildings on fire by now .
Things will get better soon .
There ’s always this Maverick Ticket running now , which will change all that , standing up against Big Oil , Big Finance , oh yes and Big Business as a whole .
Just vote for another Republican ticket and everything will change .
Not so fast !
Sarah Palin is a godsend for Big Business !
Why ?
The rumours that Sarah Palin , who increasingly takes the focus away from the Republican Presidential candidate ( serves him right ) reveling in her own famebubble , has stood up to the oil companies are patently false .
Very rightly
The Independent calls the following the real Sarah Palin scandal :
But the woman who could soon be a 72 - year - old ’s heartbeat away from the United States presidency has an environmental policy so toxic it would make the incumbent , George Bush , blush .
Mr McCain has stressed he is concerned about global warming and has come out against drilling in the Arctic reserve .
But , in recent weeks , he has wobbled on the issue .
And environmentalists are describing Mrs Palin , who denies climate change is man-made , as “ either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading ” .
She wants to start drilling .
She wants to block US moves to list the polar bear as an endangered species .
And she has allowed big game hunters to shoot Alaska ’s bears and wolves from low - flying planes . [ … ]
The Palin administration has allowed Chevron to triple the amount of toxic waste it pours into the waters of Cook Inlet .
This , even though the number of beluga whales in the bay has collapsed from 1,300 to 350 – the point of extinction – because of pollution and increased ship traffic . {… ]
Trish Rolfe , who runs the Sierra Club ’s Alaska office , thinks Governor Palin has been a disaster for Alaska ’s environment .
“ The idea that she stands up to the oil companies is a joke , ” she says .
“ The governor pays lip service to the issue of global warming but denies it is man made .
She will not even spend money to help the Inupiaq villages which are about to fall into the sea . ” ( read more )
If John McCain is elected President and he dies or is incapacitated in office this woman will be President .
John McCain is 72 years old and his health is already compromised .
His running mate is the ultimate “ Manchurian Candidate ” if only by accident and the folly of an irresponsibly acting old man .
( Natural News )
A new generation of genetically modified ( GM ) crops , engineered to produce pharmaceutical or industrial products and ingredients , poses an even more serious threat to health and the environment than older GM crops , the Union of Concerned Scientists has warned .
Presenting at the conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston , the group warned that the primary risk comes from the possibility of genetic contamination , in which the modified genes from a GM plant spread via normal cross-pollination to the same or closely related species of domestic or wild plants .
This would lead to pharmaceutical and industrial chemicals potentially entering the food supply of humans and wildlife .
Most commercial genetic engineering to date has focused on making food crops more resistant to herbicides or pests .
Even this degree of modification has raised concerns about cross-pollination and contamination of non-modified varieties , and the health impacts this could have on humans and wildlife .
According to plant geneticist Paul Gepts of the University of California - Davis , it is essentially impossible to keep modified genes from spreading .
" Gene flow is really a regular occurrence among plants , " Gepts said .
" So if you put a gene out there , it 's going to escape .
It 's going to go to other varieties of the same crop or to its wild relatives .
It 's clear that zero contamination is impossible at present .
"
In fact , a number of cases of contamination of non-GM crops with modified genes have been well - documented , leading in many cases to major economic losses as crops intended for food involuntarily found themselves in the same category as crops not approved for human consumption .
And while no cases of human health problems from this contamination have ever been proven , the risk is expected to increase as large - scale cultivation of second - generation GM crops begins .
Largely a U.S. phenomenon , wide - scale planting of GM crops has mostly been rejected in Europe .
Ironically , however , studies show that the European public feels less strongly negative about crops engineered for medical benefits - the very plants that are most dangerous .
" With the products we are talking about , there 's the potential for [ consequences ] to be much more serious than what we have seen so far , " said Robert Wisner of Iowa State University .
So-called " pharma " crops , or crops modified to produce pharmaceutical chemicals and ingredients , are becoming an increasingly popular area of research , and the biotechnology industry has been promoting their supposed benefits over conventional drug production methods .
According to advocates of the technology , drug - producing plants could be grown cheaply in poorer countries , and edible drugs would eliminate the expensive need for refrigeration and a supply of sterile needles .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already allowed outdoor test trials of these crops in 35 states .
This means that genetic contamination may already have occurred , and would certainly worsen if large - scale commercial farming begins .
Among the chemicals produced by pharma crops are disease treatments , anticoagulants , artificial blood , hormones , enzymes and antibodies intended to target tooth decay or cancer .
Another popular area of research is " edible vaccines , " or plants engineered to deliver a vaccine when eaten .
A related area of research is into plants that produce industrial or research chemicals , such as substances used to manufacture plastics , detergents , paper and personal care products .
Other chemicals engineered into plants include laboratory diagnostic chemicals and enzymes used in biofuel manufacture .
The Union of Concerned scientists has warned that many of the chemicals produced in these plants are toxic or otherwise bioactive .
" What would be the impact societally , economically , if for example , cornflakes were contaminated by some sort of drug or chemical ? " asked Karen Perry Stillerman , senior food and environment program analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" I think it 's really hard to say , because there is a variety of different drugs and chemicals that might be manufactured in plants this way .
Our perception is that some of them might be toxic , but all of them would certainly cause tremendous economic upheaval .
" It is for this reason that both the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Products Association have expressed concerns about the possibility of pharma and industrial genetic contamination of the food supply .
The USDA is currently revising its GM crop guidelines , with new rules expected by the end of the year .
In response to this ongoing process , the Union of Concerned Scientists has urged the USDA to ban all outdoor cultivation of GM pharma and industrial crops , if the species modified is also one used for food production .
This ban would not go as far as the measures some people say are needed .
According to Gepts , outdoor cultivation poses the greatest contamination risk , because pollen and seeds can be carried to other locations by wind , birds and other animals , and even from falling on farm machinery .
He says that growing crops in greenhouses or underground , or using non -food crops such as tobacco , would eliminate much of this contamination .
It would still be possible , however , for pollen or seeds to be carried out of a greenhouse on someone 's clothing .
And the Union of Concerned Scientists acknowledges that while cultivating non-food pharma crops outdoors would reduce the risk of food contamination , it might still place wildlife at risk .
"
If these crops are grown out of doors , grazing wildlife , pollinators , herbivorous insects , and soil microbes will be exposed to pharma / industrial compounds that may have adverse effects , " the organization writes on its Web site .
" The crops could also outcross with wild and weedy relatives , perpetuating the pharma / industrial transgenes in nearby ecosystems . "

“ Bigger is better and biggest is best , ” in Mr. Lewis ’s worldview , Ms. Bush said .
Even so , the Merrill deal is laced with some contradictions .
Only a year ago , Bank of America appeared to have given up on investment banking after suffering extensive losses in a business in which it had little experience .
Mr. Lewis had spent more than $ 625 million to expand into investment banking , only to see all of its trading businesses soaked in red ink .
A few months ago he said at a conference that he would not spend “ petty cash ” for an investment bank .
Apparently , Mr. Lewis was willing to forgo those misgivings because he saw a Merrill takeover as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity after years of a frustration trying to build an investment bank from scratch .
The deal would vastly expand Bank of America ’s reach into equities and emerging markets .
It strengthens its roster of top investment banking executives .
And it gives the bank Merrill ’s brand and its “ Thundering Herd ” of 16,000 brokers to help push its credit cards and loans .
“ This was almost a perfect fit , and we thought it was close enough to the bottom that we could make the deal work and be very good for our shareholders , ” Mr. Lewis said .
“ I do n’t think it will come out of the doldrums in the next week or so , but as soon as the market gets its legs again , you will see a higher value . ”
The stock market is more hesitant , concerned that Mr. Lewis may have moved so quickly that he could eventually find himself exposed to more troubled Merrill assets than he bargained for  in addition to the risky mortgage portfolio he inherited from Countrywide .
Mr. Lewis said he was confident that the deal was the right move , but conceded possible hurdles in the near term .

Continuing where Bush / Cheney left off in ' 04 , it 's clear that the John McCain campaign will say and do anything to " win . "
Their latest knowing lie , in an attempt to fool America ( again ) : a new campaign video released today .
The ad is a complete lie , and of course , they know it .
But they do n't care .
It 's politics first , country last for the McCain / Palin ticket .
The ad not only misrepresents Obama 's comments about " lipstick on a pig , " it also purposely misrepresents comments from Katie Couric on " sexism . "
Worse still , the shameless McCain / Palin campaign inaccurately displays the text of the ad on their website , furthering the misrepresentation of Couric 's comments on sexism in " this election , " as the actual ad says , even though the comment is represented as being on " the election " in the campaign 's transcript of the ad .
Breaking it down to answer to the several purposeful lies and distortions within , here 's the first part of the ad's script as posted this morning on McCain 's website ...
CHYRON : Sarah Palin On : Sarah Palin GOVERNOR PALIN :
Do you know , they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull : lipstick .
CHYRON : Barack Obama On : Sarah Palin BARACK OBAMA : Well , you know , you can , you know you can ... put...uh... lipstick on a pig ... it 's still a pig .
First problem , Obama was very clearly not referring to Palin in his taken - wholly - out - of - context comments .
Here 's what he actually said :
OBAMA : Let 's just list this for a second .
John McCain says he 's about change , too .
Except --- and so I guess his whole angle is , " Watch out , George Bush , except for economic policy , health - care policy , tax policy , education policy , foreign policy , and Karl Rove - style politics .
We 're really gonna shake things up in Washington . "
That 's not change .
That 's just calling some --- the same thing , something different .
But you know , you can --- you know , you can put lipstick on a pig ; it 's still a pig .
Obama also went on to say immediately after the above : " This is a guy who supported George Bush 90 % of the time .
What does that say about somebody 's judgment that they agree with George Bush 90 % of the time ?... You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called ' change , ' it 's still going to stink . "
So far , among all the phony , ginned - up , opportunistic , disingenuous outrage , the McCain camp has not objected to the " old fish " comment .
For the record , last October , as Hillary Clinton was the Democratic front - runner , McCain had used the well - worn lipstick / pig analogy himself , as reported by Chicago Tribune :
McCain criticized Democratic contenders for offering what he called costly universal health care proposals that require too much government regulation .
While he said he had not studied Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton 's health - care plan , he said it was " eerily reminiscent " of the failed plan she offered as first lady in the early 1990s .
" I think they put some lipstick on a pig , but it 's still a pig , " he said of her proposal .
Of course , the misrepresented comments from McCain 's appalling ad have been presented as a phony controversy all over the so - called " liberal media " for the last 18 hours or so .
It apparently began in the Wall Street Journal , was echoed on Drudge , who posted " OBAMA : ' LIPSTICK ON A PIG , STILL A PIG " under a photo of Sarah Palin , and from there , of course , it went viral in the " liberal media " as it always does after they receive their assignments from Drudge .
Fox " News , " naturally , has been delighted to continue misrepresenting the comments all morning long today , never bothering to offer the actual context ( as easily available to them in the previously linked video . )
The ad then goes on to show CBS ' Katie Couric discussing the issue of sexism in " This Election , " with a clip of Couric saying : " One of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life . "
Her comments , however , were actually made in June , in relation to coverage of Hillary Clinton 's campaign against Obama .
Worse still , the McCain website 's transcript of the ad misleads readers into believing the comments by Couric were on " The Election , " as opposed to " This Election , " as the actual video ad claims .
A screenshot from the actual ad is at the right .
The inaccurate script , as posted misleadingly on the McCain website , continues below ...
CHYRON : Katie Couric On : The Election CBS ' KATIE COURIC :
One of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life .
And for one last lick of dishonest desperation in the ad , the final bit of irony is found in its tagline that few in the corporate rightwing media are likely to point out .
The ad obnoxiously concludes with the assertion that it 's Obama who is " ready to smear . "
CHYRON : Ready To Lead ?
No Ready To Smear ?
Yes
Obama 's response today , of course , had it right when he said :
...
" It would be funny , except the news media decided that that was the lead story yesterday . "
" What their campaign has done this morning is the same game that has made people sick and tired of politics in this country .
They seize on an innocent remark , try to take it out of context , throw up an outrageous ad , because they know that it ’s catnip for the media . " ...
" It would be funny , except the news media decided that that was the lead story yesterday . "
" The McCain campaign would much rather the story be about phony and foolish diversions than about the future . "
" This happens every election cycle – every four years this is what we do .
We ’ve got an energy crisis , ... we have an education system that is not working for too many of our children and making us less competitive .
We have a economy that is creating hardships for families all across America .
We ’ve got two wars going on – veterans coming home , not being cared for .
And this is what they want to talk about .
This is what they want to spend two of the last 55 days talking about ! "
" You know who ends up losing at the end of the day ?
It 's not the Democratic candidate ; it ’s not the Republican candidate .
It 's you the American people .
Because then we go another year or another four years or another eight years without addressing the issues that matter to you . "
" Enough !
I do n’t care what they say about me .
But I love this country too much for them to take over another election with lies , and phony outrage and Swift Boat politics .
Enough is enough .
These are serious times and they call for a serious debate about where to take the nation ... "
" Spare me the phony outrage , spare me the phony talk about change , we have real problems in this country right now . "
He was forced to further respond to a questioner and added :
" This whole thing about lipstick ... nobody actually believes that these folks are offended .
Think about it … everybody knows it 's cynical .
Everybody knows it 's insincere .
The media knows it . "
" This is a game that we play .
It is a game .
It 's a sport .
And maybe if this was n't such a serious time that would be okay . "
He 's right , of course .
And so is the baby below who seems to understand it all far better than those who are foolish , selfish , and self - loathing enough to continue their support of the reprehensible McCain / Palin campaign ...

ST LOUIS , Aug 31 ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain , a former prisoner of war in Vietnam , on Sunday issued some of his harshest criticism to date of the use of torture against terrorism suspects during President George W. Bush 's administration .
In an interview on Fox News , the Arizona senator laid out his differences with Bush on a number of issues , citing torture as a key sticking point between him and the current president .
" I obviously do n't want to torture any prisoners .
There is a long list of areas that we were in disagreement on , " McCain said of Bush .
Fox interviewer Chris Wallace asked McCain if he was suggesting that Bush did want to torture prisoners .
" Well , waterboarding to me is torture , OK ? " McCain responded .
" And waterboarding was advocated by the administration , and according to a published report , was used . "
Bush has said the United States does not practice torture .
But the Central Intelligence Agency has admitted using waterboarding , a form of simulated drowning , and a recent Justice Department probe cited cases of sleep disruption , " short shackling " and other physical techniques against terrorism suspects captured after the Sept. 11 attacks .
McCain suffered torture at the hands of his captors during more than five years in a Vietnam prison camp .
Though a strong advocate of the war in Iraq and Bush 's " surge " policy that increased U.S. troop levels there , McCain has been a critic of harsh interrogation techniques against terrorism suspects , including those held at the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
McCain has clashed with Bush on other issues as well including climate change and high federal spending .
" The first thing we would do is rein in spending , " McCain said .
For all the fire and motion they 've produced in the last thirty years , religious conservatives do n't have many political triumphs to trumpet .
Abortion is still legal , segregation is dead , gays are marrying , and creationism has been beaten back to the poorest , most ignorant corners of the educational system .
That 's why I find it so amusing to watch Republicans work themselves into a froth over McCain 's vice presidential pick , Alaska governor Sarah Palin .
Practically unknown outside Alaska , Palin has gained a name within the religious right because of her decision not to abort her baby after learning he would be born with Down 's syndrome .
Palin has no exposure to federal politics - her only experience has been as mayor of a tiny Alaskan town and less than two years as governor .
I think it 's fair to say that McCain did n't envision her as his Dick Cheney .
Palin was meant to address two of McCain 's weaknesses - women and religious conservatives .
It was always inevitable that McCain would pick someone with ties to the religious right , even though he'd have preferred Lieberman or Ridge .
Abortion is non-negotiable in the Republican party , and none of McCain 's buddies are ideologically acceptable .
However , most people thought Tim Pawlenty , the governor of Minnesota , would be McCain 's logical pick .
Why was Palin picked over Pawlenty ?
Pawlenty is also a religious conservative star , he 's been governor three times longer , and has expressed much more interest in foreign affairs than Palin .
( That is to say , any interest ) McCain would like people to believe that she was chosen as a Hillary substitute , or at least a competent second - in - command .
A more cynical interpretation is that McCain chose her precisely because he knew she would be ineffective .
Palin has the biography to satisfy religious conservatives , but she does n't have any contacts within the Washington establishment that would allow her to influence his policies .
She 'll be trotted about during the campaign , throw some red meat to the " agents of intolerance " that McCain needs to win in November , but once the election is over she 'll be consigned to the fundraising circuit and one of McCain 's buddies - probably Lieberman - will be annointed defacto vice president .
If the goals of the religious right were n't so contemptible , I might almost have pity for them .
Like blacks ( prior to Obama ) and gays in the Democratic party , they do n't have any real influence on policy .
Why should they ?
So long as abortion is the litmus test , there 's no one else to vote for .
The Republican party only needs them every four years .
That McCain could gain the nomination without their help when every other serious candidate was pandering to the religious right hints at how little power they really have .
Perversely , the only way the religious right could maintain their illusion of power is to deny McCain the presidency by staying home on November 2 .
If so meager a bone as Sarah Palin is all that 's required to christen him as their saviour , there 's no reason for the Republican party to treat them as anything except the subservient curs they 've become .
So .
That Couric interview ?
Did n't seem to instill much confidence in anyone that we 're dealing with anything other than a stunt that 's gone horribly awry , like suspending a campaign to fix the economy .
Like , people who thought she was dumb are shocked at just how dumb .
( Or incurious , whatever you want to call it !
You can't be a complete idiot and be a successful politician in Alaska , after all . )
( That was a joke . )
So would it maybe alarm you to know that her insane answers to Katie 's pretty standard - issue questions were based off of pre-written notes ?
That 's the contention , anyway , of some Daily Kos diarist , whose proof is that Palin appears to look down a couple times .
If she did have notes , she sounds like she got them from the dumbest kid in class .
Honestly , what did these notes say ?
" MAKE NO SENSE " ??

Julia Galvin came to Finland looking for a man that would carry her 120 kg over a 253 - metres track – the incentive being the chance to win the wife - carrying world title and beer worth her body weight .
In the end the Irish woman was carried by an English man through a pool and across hurdles .
She did not make the gold , but said she would keep trying until the title and the beer was hers .
" I think I am worth carrying because I am a walking party , " she said .
Wife - carrying is one of a host of bizarre contests that Finns , who can tend to gloominess in the long winter dark , have devised for the scant months of summer when the sun hardly sets and people 's mood turns frolicsome .
Forty - eight couples from 13 countries , including Kenya , Australia and Canada , gathered in the remote Finnish village to complete the track .
Estonia reigned supreme once again , as Alar Voogla sprinted home in just over one minute to win the Baltic country 's 11th title , with Kirsti Viltrop clinging upside - down to his back .
" Yesterday we have had a really bad luck , because we fell and we lost our first place in the sprint and today it 's super , " Viltrop said , after completing the main track .
Germany took away the silver and England the bronze , while hosting Finns had to do with a win for the 100 - metre sprint , organised as a side - competition to the world - known event .
While some competitors are nearly professional athletes , others do it for fun or as a hobby .
Third - place winners Ash Davies and Aila Bruce put extra thought in designing their costume , to get the extra edge .
" We came with our costume designer all the way from England – she has designed this especially , so we can compete , streamline you know , aerodynamic tuning , " Davies said .
Some 5,000 people came to view the event , set deep in forests and lakes a couple of hours ' drive from the Arctic Circle .
The contest is rooted in the legend of Ronkainen the Robber , said in the 19th century to have tested aspiring members of his gang by forcing them to lug sacks of grain or live swine over a similar course .
It also purportedly stems from an even earlier tribal practice of wife - stealing , in honour of which many contestants now take up the challenge with someone else 's wife .
It has also inspired others to organise events such as sauna sitting , swamp football , cell phone throwing or karaoke singing .
All are part of a summer bonanza of events that rake in visitors and cash for as long as the midnight sun shines .

Is This How Americans Will Live A Few Years From Now ?
Americans both love and hate pioneers and cowboys at the same time .
Our cultural icons are those hard - working men and women who do their own thing and become really successful .
Yet , on a day in and day out level , we teach people to get in line and follow the route laid down before them .
We see people work their entire lives and peacefully retire , all the while never rocking the boat .
We see those hardworking but line - toeing people get replaced by younger people with fresh ideas .
We do n’t want to be those people quietly ushered out the door , but the majority of us show up and toe the line .
Part of the problem is that we have conceptually tied together financial security and happiness .
We see artists and creatives struggle and assume that they ’re desperate and unhappy because of their financial situation .
We do n’t see that they ’re happy doing what they love – we just see their broken - down vans .
One of the most significant advancements of Tim Ferriss ’
4 - Hour Workweek is his very forceful presentation of those who would rather show up to a job they hate every day but be comfortable with their misery rather than creating their own freedom while being insecure about the prospects .
“ Better the hell we know , ” indeed .
Another contributing factor to our schizophrenia is how we value people .
On the one hand , we think that human lives are priceless and equal .
But in the trenches , we very quickly evaluate people by how much income or exchange they command .
Those who command more income get more respect , and those who generate ideas and identities that sell get a larger share of our attention .
We learn this from a very early age , as well .
We learn that art , creativity , and free expressiveness are the wrong path because , obviously , the path that leads to financial insecurity is the wrong path .
Rather than asking ourselves what we enjoy , we ask ourselves first how we ’ll make money .
Those who have quit walking “ the right path ” are liberated up until the point in which they have to explain what they ’re doing to someone who believes in “ the right path ” nonsense .
It ’s at those points in which they have to deal with the condescending attitude of those people who think they ’re just naive and will soon grow up .
( Go ahead , try to get people on “ the right path ” to talk about happiness without referring to economic position and material stuff .
It ’s a strange combination of funny and tragic that they can ’t . )
We know that family , friends , creative pursuits , and quality leisure are the stuff that human life is made of , yet we march to the beat of the dollar everyday .
Untangle measures of happiness from money and security .
Money is a means to an end , not the end itself .
If you know this , you probably live from the outside - in .
If you truly understand it , you ’re on the path to living from the inside - out .
Just a warning , though .
People will love and hate your individuality .
You will rock boats , and you will unsettle people ’s reality as your path challenges theirs .
You may become alienated from those you were once close to .
You ’ll no longer be schizophrenic , but people will think you ’re crazy .
And that ’s the true irony .
Presidential candidates usually have to wait until they ’re elected to start obstructing investigations into their own wrong - doing .
But ready on day one as he is , John McCain and Sarah Palin are getting a jump on this front too .
I ’m not sure I ’ve ever seen an instance of a president , let alone a presidential candidate , quite this nakedly doing everything in his power to shutdown an investigation .
And look closely — Palin herself has at this point entirely turned the obstruction over to the McCain campaign .
They ’re even the ones who make the announcements .
( I wo n’t get into the battery of lawyers plumbers up in Alaska getting all the small fry to clam up and digging up dirt on all Palin ’s accusers . )
Meanwhile , the claim that the Obama camp has ‘ tainted ’ the trooper - gate investigation is truly risible .
This investigation was well underway and already looking bad for Palin and her husband well before John McCain picked her as his running mate .
( We know : we were already covering it . )
What I do not think that many people know is that this investigation up in Alaska has actually been authorized and is being run by Republicans .
They make up a majority in the state senate .
The committee member overseeing the investigation happens to be a Democrat .
But at any moment of their choosing , they could pull him off the case , overrule his decisions , or shut the investigation down entirely .
Palin ’s response to this — to the question of how Obama could have tainted the investigation which is under the control of Alaska Republicans — is to claim that there are actually a lot of Republicans in Alaska who oppose her .
And that ’s true .
But observing that a sizable number of officeholders of your own party think you ’re probably a crook too does not amount to an affirmative defense .
Really , it does n’t .
The fall back defense , when claims about Obama ’s ‘ taint ’ fall flat , is that Palin ’s someone who ‘ shakes things up ’ .
That ’s what she ’s done in Alaska and that ’s what she ’s going to do in Washington .
But a pattern of crony hiring and politicized firings of public officials all followed up by stonewalling and obstruction of justice really would not amount to ‘ shaking things up ’ in Washington .
After eight years of President Bush , that ’s more like steady as she goes .
Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to enter any pleas at the international war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands on Friday , forcing the judge to enter not guilty pleas in his name .
When asked how he would plead to the first charge , Karadzic responded : " I will not plead , in line with my standpoint as regards to this court . "
His comment was in reference to his legal challenges to the court 's jurisdiction in the case .
Tribunal Judge Iain Bonomy then asked whether Karadzic would have the same response to the remaining 10 charges .
" Absolutely , " Karadzic replied .
The judge then entered pleas of not guilty on Karadzic 's behalf , as required by the court rules .
It was Karadzic 's second appearance in The Hague - based courtroom of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia since his arrest late last month after 13 years on the lam .
The 63 - year - old faces 11 charges , including genocide and crimes against humanity , for allegedly masterminding the worst atrocities perpetrated by Serb forces in the 1992 - 95 Bosnian war , which claimed an estimated 100,000 lives .
' I have stopped using a false name ' : Karadzic
Early in the brief hearing , Karadzic demanded that the court tell him the status on several submissions he has made questioning whether the court should be able to prosecute him .
He asked whether the court was representing the international community or just NATO member countries .
" I have stopped using a false name , so I think that all the parties should do the same , " said Karadzic .
Karadzic was practising alternative medicine and writing for a Serbian magazine under a false name when he was arrested in Serbia in July .
Bonomy stated that it was standard court procedure for a plea to be entered before the court considers such challenges .
Karadzic also reiterated his intention to represent himself , though he said he has assembled a team to help him .
That decision will see the former Bosnian Serb leader follow in the footsteps of his mentor , the late Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic .
Milosevic 's war crimes trial was drawn out over four years as he regularly launched into diatribes and posed rambling questions to witnesses , drawing frequent rebukes from the tribunal judges .
On March 11 , 2006 , he died of a heart attack in his prison cell before a verdict was reached .
Karadzic 's next court hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 17 , when Karadzic plans to challenge the court 's jurisdiction .

The Obama campaign has released a whole bunch of videos by " Next Generation " veterans - those who served and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Here 's the first :
And here 's one from partial - amputee Jon Kuniholm , who talks about his experiences , addresses the " phony troops " meme and directly asks John McCain how long he 'll support a " mission " that amounts to puting up figurative " accomplished " banners at regular intervals .
There 's also one from veterans and military family members in Virginia and another from Bobby Wise , who served in Iraq and is veterans field director for the Obama campaign .
All good , powerful stuff and these veterans and military family members really do make the best spokespeople for why Barack Obama is stronger and smarter on national security and veterans issues .
Michelle Moore , Mr. Lindsey ’s lawyer , said he had always maintained his innocence and produced time cards showing he was at work at a dry cleaner when the attack occurred .
Mr. Lindsey ’s boss also testified at trial that he was working .
Ms. Moore blamed eyewitness misidentification and faulty police photo lineup procedures for Mr. Lindsey ’s conviction .
Mr. Lindsey , who had a previous conviction for aggravated robbery , became a suspect in the rape , near White Rock Lake , after pleading guilty to attempted rape in a separate case , a legal maneuver that Ms. Moore said “ was a business decision ” to avoid a lengthy sentence .
The police then included his picture in a photo lineup mailed to the White Rock Lake victim about a year after she was assaulted .
The woman was raped by a shirtless man , and Mr. Lindsey was one of two shirtless men among the six photos .
He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison .
Ms. Moore and Mr. Lindsey questioned why previous judges and district attorneys ignored his repeated requests for postconviction DNA testing , a legal avenue open to Texas inmates since 2001 .
Mr. Lindsey said he sent six DNA testing requests by letter , at least two of them by certified mail , to the district clerk and then the court but never received a response .
Coincidentally , the judge who ran the court that Mr. Lindsey said ignored his requests was Henry Wade Jr. , son of the legendary Dallas prosecutor who put behind bars many of the inmates now being freed by DNA testing .
Reached by phone on Friday , Judge Wade said it was unlikely he ever would have seen the letters .
They would routinely be opened by the district clerk ’s office , he said , and DNA testing requests would be forwarded to the district attorney at the time , Bill Hill .
In attendance at Mr. Lindsey ’s court hearing were fellow exonorees , a half - dozen wrongly convicted men who each served on average about 20 years in prison .
One by one , they introduced themselves to Mr. Lindsey , the newest member of their fraternity .
When rioting St. Paul cops arrested Amy Goodman , CREDO Mobile published the video and issued an action alert with the odd declarative title This is America .
We do n’t arrest journalists here . .
The first problem is the false subject .
We do n’t arrest journalists , or anyone else .
Government cops arrest people .
I do n’t , and neither do you .
So , let ’s rephrase : This is America .
Police do n’t arrest journalists here .
But what ’s the do n’t supposed to mean here ?
If it ’s supposed to be a simple declarative statement , then it ’s obviously false .
Police evidently do arrest journalists here ; I know because I saw it happen in the video CREDO linked to .
Obviously , even though the statement seems to be declarative , it ’s actually intended to do something other than state a fact .
The statement is being made in the context of an outraged action alert , so it seems fair to interpret it as a normative claim instead of a descriptive claim .
If I say You just do n’t treat people that way , what I ’m saying is that you should n’t treat people like that .
So let ’s rephrase : This is America .
Police should n’t arrest journalists here .
That ’s certainly true .
Police should n’t arrest journalists .
But then what ’s the purpose of the This is America and the here ?
It ’s true that police should n’t arrest journalists in America ; but that ’s no less true in Egypt or China .
Police should n’t arrest journalists anywhere .
So what did CREDO really mean ?
There ’s another voice in which people sometimes use this kind of talk — a voice different from the statement of fact , and a voice different from the expression of a moral judgment .
It is the voice of authority laying down an expectation for others to follow .
( We do n’t use that kind of language in this household ; Catholics do not use birth control ; etc. )
And I think here we have a clear understanding of what it was CREDO meant to say , and what purpose the This is America is supposed to serve .
Not content with simply pointing out the fact that it ’s wrong for police to arrest journalists — that this kind of conduct is violent , repressive , tyrannical , and indeed evil — what they wanted to do was to cite an authority on their side .
The authority is supposedly wrapped up in the idea of America ( meaning the U.S.A. ) — U.S. norms , U.S. political culture , and the U.S. Constitution .
But what good does it do to try to assume the voice of authority here ?
What justifies the claim ?
What purpose does it serve ?
In St. Paul , several different police agencies , ramrodded by the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s department , staged massive pre-emptive raids against houses where activists were staying and against the RNC Welcoming Committee ’s convergence space .
Many of the imprisoned protesters were held for days without charges .
Many were abused by their jailers , including a woman being knocked to the ground and dragged by her hair , several protesters being denied prescription or over - the - counter medications for serious medical conditions , and a 19 - year - old activist named Elliot Hughes , who was beaten and tortured for over an hour because , according to the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s department , he was being verbally disruptive .
There is little or no evidence that any legal authority , either executive or judicial , will ever hold any of these cops or jailers accountable for what they did .
Nobody in a position of authority disapproves .
Nobody in a position of authority cares .
Whatever source of authority CREDO hopes to invoke here is a dead letter ; the very people that it gave the power to interpret it and enforce it have decided that there ’s nothing to forbid police to harass and terrorize journalists like this .
If those authorities are right , then CREDO ’s attempt to speak in the voice of authority is fraudulent : the authority that they are trying to invoke has nothing to say for them .
If those authorities are wrong , then CREDO ’s attempt to speak in the voice of authority is idle : the same system that they hope to call to their aid is constructed so that CREDO can do nothing about it .
The first step is admitting that you have a problem .
We live in a state where the highest authorities consider this repressive violence perfectly acceptable behavior in the name of Law and Order .
And it is long past time to give up on the delusion that the Authorities and the Law will get our back against this kind of abuse of power .
They have n’t .
They are n’t .
They wo n’t .
It is long past time to give up on the voice of authority and its false promises .
To be willing to make our demands in the voice of morality , to speak up for our rights as human rights , not as the easily - revoked privileges of a paper constitution .
America , if that means the political entity that rules over this territory , is not our friend , or our ally .
It will do nothing for us .
When we protest , it will turn those very cops on us .
We are in no position to lay down expectations or give orders to our occupiers .
We have no authority that they will ever recognize .
What we have to do is to speak to the justice of our cause , and the righteousness of our resistance against acts that are unjust and tyrannical , no matter where they may be committed .
Peace , freedom , and justice are good enough to stand on their own , just as they are , whether in America , or Egypt , or China , or anywhere else in the world .
Happy International Ignore the Constitution Day , fellow citizens .

Although 2008 did not set a record for minimum sea ice it did set a record for speed melting .
Arctic sea ice declined at a rate of 32,700 square miles a day in August .
That ’s about the size of Maine .
Every day .
And that ’s compared to 24,400 square miles a day lost in August 2007 — the record holder for minimum sea ice .
The 2008 results were surprising , says NASA , because last winter had near - normal ice cover .
“ We saw a lot of cooling in the Arctic that we believe was associated with La Niña , ” says Joey Comiso of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
“ Sea ice in Canada had recovered and even expanded in the Bering Sea and Baffin Bay .
Overall , sea ice recovered to almost average levels .
That was a good sign that this year might not be as bad as last year . ”
But alas the sprint in August — the fastest - ever melt — undid the gains of the winter .
Here ’s what it looked like :
“ Based on what we ’ve learned over the last 30 years , we know that the perennial ice cover is now in trouble , ” Comiso says .
“ You need more than just one winter of cooling for the ice to recover to the average extent observed since the measurements began .
But the trend is going the other way .
A warming Arctic causes the surface water to get warmer , which delays the onset of freeze up in the winter and leads to a shorter period of ice growth .
Without the chance to thicken , sea ice becomes thinner and more vulnerable to continued melt . ”

What does it mean that Barack Obama , a black man , has won his party ’s nomination ?
One story is that Obama is the Jackie Robinson of politics .
He has broken a color barrier ( nowadays called a glass ceiling ) and entered the big leagues .
Other men and women of color will now enter the lists for the presidency .
But the fact is that our society is not now more color - blind than ever before .
This can not be so when it is apparently a highly successful American social policy to imprison as many black men as possible on drug offenses .
If others do follow in Obama ’s footsteps , that means only that there is an up - and - coming crop of people like him who have learned the same lessons as he has in the nation ’s law schools and other statist incubators .
Another story is that the Obama moment is a special moment for black people ( now often called African - Americans ) .
The idea is that it is a " notable marker on the long road to freedom , justice , equality and shared power in spite of the ruts and road blocks in the way … "
I contest this story too , which is the kind of tale we expect to hear from self - anointed black leaders who claim to speak for the street and do n’t .
I would be truly shocked if very many black people get off on Obama ’s nomination ( for more than a few seconds ) and feel a profound sense of satisfaction that now freedom , justice , equality , and shared power are at hand or even a wee bit closer .
I ’d be shocked because nothing essential has changed in their lives and nothing will because of him .
Symbols of power do not fill the gas tank , and if they claim to or do , there is a hidden price tag .
There are many more such stories , but let these two stories suffice because the meaning that I see in his nomination is vastly different .
Obama has won a competition , but this does not mean he is " the best man . "
It comes closer to meaning that he is the worst man , just as McCain is in his party .
Competition for producing disk storage gives us more and better storage at lower prices .
There is even a law , called Moore ’s law , that predicts the course of this progress over time .
But competition for the presidency follows a different law , which is that candidates are ever more deceitful , cunning , crafty , two - faced , and power - hungry .
They are more and more criminal in their endeavors .
Among Democrats , we retrogress , if that is possible , from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson to Bill Clinton .
Republicans should not be left out of this retrogression .
Clearly , George W. Bush marks a new low .
In politics , there is a race to the bottom .
Rozeff ’s law is that the number and severity of presidential acts that reduce social welfare follow an upward time trend .
Whether it is a square root function , linear , or exponential is left for future research .
Obama ’s nomination merely means that a black man has won the race to the bottom in securing his party ’s nomination .
This means that a black man has been found who has mastered the trade of delivering criminal actions suavely while conning enough of his victims so that he does not rend the State over which he presides .
It means that a black man can lie as smoothly as a white man or woman , that he can switch positions as easily as a candidate of another race , and that he is equally adept at punching and counterpunching at his opponents .
As far as its meaning goes concerning my voting neighbors , it appears that Obama has successfully peddled a politics of hope .
I am certain that he could demolish me in an instant in the eyes of his followers by calling me a cynic .
He is explicitly trying to overcome what he calls cynicism .
That ’s a clever ruse — a campaign ploy .
Cynicism is a belief that selfishness dominates human action .
Obviously , Obama is calling for selflessness .
When a politician does that , watch out .
The con-man wants you to smile as he impales you .
Selfishness has nothing to do with how Americans feel .
Perhaps helplessness and frustration do .
Having been manipulated into an increasingly helpless and deteriorating condition by their own governments , it is no wonder that Americans should voice despair .
Despair is not cynicism either .
Despair is a rather realistic reaction to being tied up , bound and gagged , and rendered helpless by the State .
One cannot expect a man of the State like Obama to do what needs to be done to alter that condition significantly .
One can expect him to play upon the emotions generated by such conditions to his own and his party ’s advantage .
Race is not much of an overt issue in this campaign .
For me it is no issue at all because I wo n’t vote .
I do not vote .
I do n’t believe that politics and voting are a viable means to demolish the State , which is what I think needs to be done if we are to make serious headway against its crimes against humanity .
Voting , in my opinion , merely endorses and prolongs the agony .
But even if I did vote , race would still be a non-issue for me .
The choice is between two men who both want power and relish power .
Either one will use it to the fullest in the blind and arrogant belief that he is a savior .
It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee .
I would not indulge in voting based on the fantasy that I actually could predict what these men would do once they become criminal - in - chief .
Either one will surely surprise us in many dreadful ways , and that will be that .
I am sure that those who are following the campaigns up to now have already detected some rather shocking backtracking if not about - faces .
In the end , the nomination of Obama has , I believe , very little meaning in terms of race .
It is not terribly unusual for candidates to elicit a degree of enthusiasm among his followers , as he has .
It is not unusual for candidates to offer grand agendas and promises , as he has .
The metal tarnishes rather quickly .
Obama ’s time arrived .
A black man ’s time arrived .
No year between 1944 and 1970 was the right time for Adam Clayton Powell , Jr. , a charismatic and likeable figure , to seek much less secure a presidential nomination .
What does it now mean except that any person , regardless of color , racial background , looks , religion , or sex , can win the race to the bottom , that any person ( who passes certain minimal requirements ) can win the nomination for the presidency ?
That any person can achieve the inglorious and criminal end of one day becoming President of these United States .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
From Rasmussen :
Polling this week in Colorado , Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Virginia shows that Barack Obama has gained a net 3 to 5 percentage points in each state compared to the previous Fox News / Rasmussen Reports poll .
Polling this week in Colorado , Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Virginia shows that Barack Obama has gained a net 3 to 5 percentage points in each state compared to the previous Fox News / Rasmussen Reports poll .
In Pennsylvania , Obama now leads by eight percentage points , 50 % to 42 % .
In Virginia , it ’s Obama 50 % and McCain 47 % .
The candidates are within a single point of each other in Colorado ( Obama 49 % , McCain 48 % ) , Florida ( Obama 47 % , McCain 47 % ) , and Ohio ( McCain 48 % Obama 47 % ) .
National polls and other state polling conducted by Rasmussen Reports indicate that Obama gained ground before last Friday night ’s debate , probably as a result of the economic turmoil that has dominated the news .
Since the debate , the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows little change in the national numbers .
Regardless of the timing and the cause , however , the overriding trend from the past week is a shift in the battleground states that favors Obama .
They are plucked off pizzas and discarded from caesar salads across the country , but somebody , somewhere has been eating too many anchovies .
The fish that has divided food fans for years is today named on a list of unsustainable fish and shellfish that ethical consumers should not eat .
Anchovy is among dozens of " fish to avoid " highlighted by the Marine Conservation Society ( MCS ) .
Anchovy populations in the Bay of Biscay have been struggling since 2002 , as overfishing left fewer adult fish to provide eggs .
The fishery suffered a complete failure in 2004 and is now officially closed .
Stocks in the other big European anchovy fishery - off the Portuguese coast - are also critical .
Anchovies are still legally caught there , though quotas have been restricted .
In a report on hundreds of types of fish , the society has awarded each kind a ranking from 1 to 5 , after assessing its biology , stock status , management and the impact of the farming or fishing method .
Sixty - nine received the worst rating of 5 , including monkfish from north and northwest Spain , North Sea cod and dogfish .
Others to avoid include the Atlantic salmon , common skate and swordfish .
The society 's list does not label entire species unacceptable to eat , but tries to explain that whether a certain type of fish is sustainable or unsustainable depends on where and how it was caught .
It gives Dover sole caught by wasteful beam trawling in the North Sea and Irish Sea a 5 rating and says they should be avoided , while those from a sustainable fishery off Hastings are rated 2 and recommended .
Such detail is rarely made available to consumers , with current legislation only requiring the common name and rough geographical location to be included on labels .
The society is calling for better labelling in restaurants and shops to help consumers choose more environmentally - friendly options .
Sam Wilding , a fisheries officer with the society , said : " Labelling of seafood sold in the UK is lacking detail , and as such is not fit for purpose .
This is leading to confusion .
It is vital that consumers are given better information to act upon if we are to reduce the tragedy of overfishing . "
He said anchovies in European waters were at an all - time low .
" There are not many anchovy left in European waters , and we say people should avoid them , to give populations a chance to recover . "
Willie Mackenzie , oceans campaigner at Greenpeace , said : " You pick up some tuna in a supermarket and it might say it comes from the Indian and Pacific oceans .
Well , that covers half the world , it could be one of several different species , and it could have been caught in lots of different ways .
We really need better labelling with more detailed information to help consumers do the right thing . "
Chris Brown , head of ethical and sustainable sourcing at Asda , said more detail risked confusing customers .
He said Asda stocked marlin , which features on the MCS 's " fish to avoid " list , but claimed it was sustainable because it was not deliberately targeted , but caught as inevitable " by - catch " in a sustainable tuna fishery off Sri Lanka , and would otherwise be disposed of .
" I ca n't write all of that on the label , " he said .
Brown said it was down to retailers to take more responsibility , and accused some restaurants and supermarkets of confusing the situation by selling sustainable ray , but labelling it as unsustainable skate , because customers are more likely to buy familiar species .
The society said cod demonstrated why precise labelling was important , with cod from the north - east Arctic a more sustainable choice than those from the North Sea .
The MCS has certified some cod fisheries in the Pacific as sustainable , and also said consumers could choose organically - farmed Atlantic cod .
Wilding called on shoppers and diners to ask more questions about the source of their fish .
" Our advice is to ask the waiter or waitress .
They might not know at the moment but part of what we 're trying to do is to improve training , and raising awareness is important for that . "
He said the society had produced a pocket - sized version of the list that could be used as a reference .
Philip MacMullen , head of environmental responsibility at the industry body Seafish , said : " It is genuinely difficult to be sure of all the details of any given fish supply line .
To this extent advice given via lists ... must match the reality of the available information .
We should not be raising unrealistic expectations .
The complexities of fisheries also mean that it is difficult to rely on a simple eat - and - avoid list .
Fish stocks are dynamic and can change their status quite quickly . "
A GOP congressional leader who was wavering on giving President Bush authority to wage war in late 2002 said Vice President Cheney misled him by saying that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had direct personal ties to al - Qaeda terrorists and was making rapid progress toward a suitcase nuclear weapon .
That 's one of the revelations in the new book , " Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency , " by The Post 's Barton Gellman .
Another is the inside story about how Cheney managed the process that led to his selection as vice president .
Gellman reveals that Cheney did not fill out his own questionnaire for potential running mates ; that ostensible top contenders for the ticket were not actually interviewed by Cheney or Bush ; that the heart surgeon who vouched for Cheney 's health never met him or reviewed his medical records ; and that longtime counselor Dan Bartlett warned Bush " we 're getting our asses kicked in the media " because the campaign knew so little about Cheney 's record .
Two former Republican governors , Frank Keating of Oklahoma and John Engler of Michigan , accuse Cheney of leaking closely held information from Keating 's questionnaire in order to damage his bid for a cabinet post .
" Dick Cheney coming into my life has been like a black cloud , " Keating tells Gellman .
The Post published excerpts of the new book in Sunday 's and Monday 's editions .
It expands on a Pulitzer Prize - winning series Gellman wrote with former Post investigative reporter Jo Becker in 2007 .
" Angler " is based on hundreds of previously unpublished interviews with present and former Cheney advisers , senior officials in federal agencies , diplomats , judges , military officers , senators and members of Congress .
Among those who spoke on the record to Gellman are Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley , White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and his predecessor Andrew H. Card Jr. , senior presidential advisers Dan Bartlett and Karl Rove , and numerous high ranking Justice Department alumni , including John Ashcroft and James B. Comey .
Cheney and President Bush declined to be interviewed .
Some of the book 's most significant news describes a three - month conflict between the Justice Department and the vice president 's office over warrantless domestic surveillance .
In addition to the excerpts published in the Post , Gellman 's account of that program includes a scene in which the top White House national security lawyer begins hearing rumors of " the vice president 's special program . "
John B. Bellinger III , who had not been informed of the operation , confronted Cheney 's counsel , David S. Addington .
" I 'm not going to tell you whether there is or is n't such a program , " Addington replied , glowering .
" But if there were such a program , you 'd better go tell your little friends at the FBI and the CIA to keep their mouths shut . "
Cheney 's accusations about Saddam Hussein , described by former House Majority Leader Richard Armey , came in a highly classified one - on - one briefing in Room H - 208 , the vice president 's hideaway office in the Capitol Building .
The threat Cheney described went far beyond public statements that have been criticized for relying on " cherry - picked " intelligence of unknown reliability .
There was no intelligence to support the vice president 's private assertions , Gellman reports , and they " crossed so far beyond the known universe of fact that they were simply without foundation . "
Armey had spoken out against the coming war , and his opposition gave cover to Democrats who feared the political costs of appearing to be weak .
Armey reversed his position after Cheney told him , he said , that the threat from Iraq was actually " more imminent than we want to portray to the public at large . "
Cheney said , according to Armey , that Iraq 's " ability to miniaturize weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear , " had been " substantially refined since the first Gulf War , " and would soon result in " packages that could be moved even by ground personnel . "
Cheney linked that threat to Saddam 's alleged personal ties to al Qaeda , Armey said , explaining that " we now know they have the ability to develop these weapons in a very portable fashion , and they have a delivery system in their relationship with organizations such as al Qaeda . "
" Did Dick Cheney ... purposely tell me things he knew to be untrue ? "
Armey said .
" I seriously feel that may be the case ... Had I known or believed then what I believe now , I would have publicly opposed [ the war ] resolution right to the bitter end , and I believe I might have stopped it from happening . "
Gellman writes that Cheney was never the shadow president alleged by critics .
He describes a trajectory of power in which the vice president began the first term with " a brief so wide - ranging and autonomous that he was the nearest thing we have had to a deputy president . "
But after the near - meltdown at the Justice Department in March 2004 , Bush " came to see disadvantages in the arrangement , and over time it changed . "
Even when Cheney lost some of his influence , Gellman reports , he remained effective at slow - rolling initiatives he did not like .
One senior foreign policy adviser , Aaron Friedberg , described the tactics as " rope a dope . "
" Angler " recounts a meeting in the Situation Room in which the frustrated president , jamming a finger toward Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , demanded the start of long - delayed criminal proceedings against terrorist suspects held at Guantanamo Bay .
" We are going to have a trial , " Bush said , " and the proceedings are going to start by the end of January " 2004 .
Cheney and Rumsfeld failed to turn up for three consecutive meetings called by Rice to carry out the president 's command .
On their third no - show - - a month after Bush 's deadline expired -- CIA Director George Tenet exploded in profanity , Gellman reports .
And Rice began to cry .
A privately funded rocket was lost on its way to space Saturday night , bringing a third failure in a row to an Internet multimillionaire ’s effort to create a market for low - cost space - delivery business .
The failure occurred a little more than two minutes after launch , about the time of first stage separation , and the vehicle appeared to be oscillating before the signal was lost .
“ We are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on that vehicle , ” said Max Vozoff , a launch commentator for the company , on a Webcast of the event soon after the live video feed from the rocket went dead .
The two - stage Falcon 1 rocket was manufactured by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation , based in Hawthorne , Calif .
Japanese convenience stores have sold video games , dvds , music and concert / amusement park tickets for 10 years or more now .
The main thing holding back such glorious implementation in American stores is likely the security factor , what with our crime rate being an order of magnitude worse .
Maybe this will take off and midnight release parties will become much much easier to get to .
Or maybe a 7 - 11 clerk will get murdered and his shipment of Madden 2010 will get stolen and the practice will stop .
Time will tell .

We Are Change Colorado confront globalists Henry Kissinger and CFR president Richard Haass during the RNC in Minnesota .
Members of We Are Change Colorado caught up with globalist kingpin Henry Kissinger and CFR president Richard N. Haass during the RNC proceedings in Minnesota , who were both dismissive towards hard questions about policies related to terrorism and depopulation measures .
Dr. Kissinger grinned at mention of the New World Order before dismissing any knowledge of National Security Memo # 200 , which calls for the use of “ food as a weapon ” and otherwise advocates depopulation schemes that include extreme measures to be used against the ‘ lesser developed countries ’ in the third world , whose population growth supposedly threatens the National Security interests of the United States .
Kissinger penned the memo in 1974 while serving in the Ford Administration .
Kissinger told We Are Change cameras that he believed terrorism and 3rd population explosion were directly connected .
Activist Joby Weeks also asked the former National Security Adviser if he believed AIDS could be a manufactured threat tied to depopulation schemes , to which Kissinger said he ‘ had no idea ’ before absurdly claiming he had “ never heard of ” NSSM 200 .
When he was reminded that he wrote the memo , he blurted out “ Oh , come on ! , ” possibly thinking that his infamous memo was being tied to the notion of AIDS being a manufactured bio-weapon .
Kissinger , who was closed followed by police security and who was also mobbed by star - struck sycophants who have either over - looked or never understood his inherent evil ( exercised repeatedly over the decades in brutal foreign policy , from the third world to the Vietnam & Laos and now in Iraq ) , left the scene quickly after questions were put to him .
Richard Haass , who was presiding over a Council on Foreign Relations discussion panel , told We Are Change cameras that there was no need of oversight in regards to the CFR .
“ We have no power ; if people want to listen to us , that ’s great , if not , that ’s fine . ”
This is a gross understatement of a think tank so powerful that it has staffed virtually every administration ’s National Security Council and many other cabinet positions , including Vice President , Secretary of Defense , and Secretary of State , since the early 1950s .
While its policy recommendations are technically separate altogether from government , its influence is more than dominant in government ’s thinking .
Haass and the other CFR members present laughed at and brushed off concerns about one Philip Zelikow , who wrote a CFR white paper in Foreign Affairs in December 1998 about the potential for ‘ catastrophic terrorism ’ to “ divide our past and future into a before and after

WASILLA , Alaska --
The biggest project that Sarah Palin undertook as mayor of this small town was an indoor sports complex , where locals played hockey , soccer , and basketball , especially during the long , dark Alaskan winters .
The only catch was that the city began building roads and installing utilities for the project before it had unchallenged title to the land .
The misstep led to years of litigation and at least $ 1.3 million in extra costs for a small municipality with a small budget .
What was to be Ms. Palin 's legacy has ...
Sami al - Haj walks with pain on his steel crutch ; almost six years in the nightmare of Guantanamo have taken their toll on the Al - Jazeera journalist and , now in the safety of a hotel in the small Norwegian town of Lillehammer , he is a figure of both dignity and shame .
The Americans told him they were sorry when they eventually freed him this year -- after the beatings he says he suffered , and the force - feeding , the humiliations and interrogations by British , American and Canadian intelligence officers -- and now he hopes one day he ’ll be able to walk without his stick .
The TV cameraman , 38 , was never charged with any crime , nor was he put on trial ; his testimony makes it clear that he was held in three prisons for six - and - a - half years -- repeatedly beaten and force - fed -- not because he was a suspected “ terrorist ” but because he refused to become an American spy .
From the moment Sami al - Haj arrived at Guantanamo , flown there from the brutal U.S. prison camp at Kandahar , his captors demanded that he work for them .
The cruelty visited upon him -- constantly interrupted by American admissions of his innocence -- seemed designed to turnal - Haj into a U.S. intelligence “ asset ” .
“ We know you are innocent , you are here by mistake , ” he says he was told in more than 200 interrogations .
“ All they wanted was for me to be a spy for them .
They said they would give me U.S. citizenship , that my wife and child could live in America , that they would protect me .
But I said : ‘ I will not do this -- first of all because I ’m a journalist and this is not my job and because I fear for myself and my family .
In war , I can be wounded and I can die or survive .
But if I work with you , al - Qaeda will eliminate me .
And if I do n’t work with you , you will kill me ’ .
” The grotesque saga began for al - Haj on 15 December , 2001 , when he was on his way from the Pakistani capital Islamabad to Kandahar in Afghanistan with Sadah al - Haq , a fellow correspondent from the Arab satellite TV channel , to cover the new regional government .
At least 70 other journalists were on their way through the Pakistani border post at Chaman , but an officer stopped al - Haj .
“ He told me there was a paper from the Pakistani intelligence service for my arrest .
My name was misspelled , my passport number was incorrect , it said I was born in 1964 – the right date is 1969 .
I said I had renewed my visa in Islamabad and asked why , if I was wanted , they had not arrested me there ?
” Sami al - Haj speaks slowly and with care , each detail of his suffering and of others ’ suffering of equal importance to him .
He still cannot believe that he is free , able to attend a conference in Norway , to return to his new job as news producer at Al - Jazeera , to live once more with his Azeri wife Asma and their eight - year old son Mohamed ; when Sami al - Haj disappeared down the black hole of America ’s secret prisons the boy was only 14 months ’ old .
Al - Haj ’s story has a familiar ring to anyone who has investigated the rendition of prisoners from Pakistan to U.S. bases in Afghanistan and Guantanamo .
His aircraft flew for an hour and a half and then landed to collect more captives -- this may have been in Islamabad , the Pakistani capital -- before flying on to the big American base at Bagram .
“ We arrived in the early hours of the morning and they took the shackles off our feet and pushed us out of the plane .
They hit me and pushed me down on the asphalt .
We heard screams and dogs barking .
I collapsed with my right leg under me , and I felt the ligaments tearing .
When I fell , the soldiers started treading on me .
First , they walked on my back , then -- when they saw me looking at my leg -- they started kicking my leg .
One soldier shouted at me : ‘ Why did you come to fight Americans ? ’
I had a number -- I was No. 35 and this is how they addressed me , as a number -- and the first American shouted at me : ‘ You filmed Bin Laden . ’
I said I did not film Bin Laden but that I was a journalist .
I again gave my name , my age , my nationality . ” After 16 days at Bagram , another aircraft took him to the U.S. base at Kandahar where on arrival the prisoners were again made to lie on the ground .
“ We were cursed --- and again the Americans walked on our backs .
Why ?
Why did they do this ?
I was taken to a tent and stripped and they pulled hairs out of my beard .
They photographed the pupils of my eyes .
A doctor found blood on my back and asked me why it was there .
I asked him how he thought it was there ?
” The same dreary round of interrogations recommenced -- he was now “ Prisoner No. 448 ” -- and yet again , al - Haj says he was told he was being held by mistake .
“ Then another man -- he was in civilian clothes and I think he was from Egyptian intelligence – wanted to know who was the “ leader ” of the detainees who was with me .
The Americans asked : ‘ Who is the most respected of the prisoners ?
Who killed ( Ahmed Shah ) Massoud ( the leader of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance Afghan militia ) ? ’
I said this was not my business and an American soldier said : ‘ Co-operate with us , and you will be released . ’
They meant I had to work for them .
There was another man who spoke perfect English .
I thought he was British .
He was young , good - looking , about 35 - years - old , no moustache , blond hair , very polite in a white shirt , no tie .
He brought me chocolate -- it was Kit Kat -- and I was so hungry I could have eaten the wrapping .
” On 13 June , al - Haj was put on board a jet aircraft .
He was given yet another prison number – No. 345 -- and once more his head was covered with a black bag .
He was forced to take two tablets before he was gagged and his bag replaced by goggles with the eye - pieces painted black .
The flight to Guantanamo took 12 to 14 hours .
“ They took us on a boat from the Guantanamo runways to the prison , a journey that took an hour . ”
Al - Haj was escorted to a medical clinic and then at once to another interrogation .
“ They said they ’d compared my answers with my original statement and one of them said : ‘ You are here by mistake .
You will be released .
You will be the first to be released . ’
They gave me a picture of my son , which had been taken from my wallet .
They asked me if I needed anything .
I asked for books .
One said he had a copy of One Thousand and One Nights in Arabic .
He copied it for me .
During this interview , they asked me : ‘ Why did you talk to the British intelligence man so much in Kandahar ? ’
I said I did n’t know if he was from British intelligence .
They said he was .
“ Then after two months , two more British men came to see me .
They said they were from UK intelligence .
They wanted to know who I knew , who I ’d met .
I said I could n’t help them . ”
The Americans later referred to one of them as “ Martin ” and they did not impress al - Haj ’s senior interrogator at Guantanamo , Stephen Rodriguez , who wanted again to seek al - Haj ’s help .
“ He said to me : ‘ Our job is to prevent “ things ” happening .
I ’ll give you a chance to think about this .
You can have U.S. citizenship , your family will be looked after , you ’ll have a villa in the U.S. , we ’ll look after your son ’s education , you ’ll have a bank account ’ .
He had brought with him some Arabic magazines and told me I could read them .
In those 10 minutes , I felt I had gone back to being a human being again .
Then soldiers came to take me back to my cell -- and the magazines were taken away .
” By the summer of 2003 , al - Haj was receiving other strange visitors .
“ Two Canadian intelligence officers came and they showed me lots of photos of people and wanted to know if I recognized them .
I knew none of them .
” In more than 200 interrogations , al - Haj was asked about his employers the Al - Jazeera television channel in Qatar .
In one session , he says another American said to him : “ After you get out of here , al - Qaeda will recruit you and we want to know who you meet .
You could become an analyst , we can train you to store information , to sketch people .
There is a link between Al - Jazeera and al - Qaeda .
How much does al - Qaeda pay Al - Jazeera ? ” “ I said : ‘ I will not do this -- first of all because I ’m a journalist and this is not my job .
Also because I fear for my life and my family .
’“ Many beatings followed -- not from the interrogators but from other U.S. guards .
“ They would slam my head into the ground , cut off all my hair .
They put me into the isolation block -- we called it the ‘ November Block ’ -- for two years .
They made my life torture .
I wanted to bring it to an end .
There were continual punishments without reason .
In interrogations , they would tighten the shackles so it hurt .
They had n’t allowed me to receive letters for 10 months -- even then , they erased words in them , even from my son .
Again , Rodriguez demanded I work for the Americans .
” In January of last year , Sami al - Haj started a hunger strike -- and began the worst months of his imprisonment .
“ I wanted my rights in the civil courts .
The U.S. Supreme Court said I should have my rights .
I wanted the right to worship properly .
They let me go 30 days without food -- then I was tied to a chair with metal shackles and they force - fed me .
They would insert a tube through my nose into my stomach .
They chose large tubes so that it hurt and sometimes it went into the lung .
They used the same tube they had used on other prisoners with muck still on it and then they pumped more food into me than it was possible to absorb .
They told us the people administering this were doctors -- but they were torturers , not doctors .
They forced 24 cans of food into us so we threw up and then gave us laxatives to defecate .
My pancreas was affected and I had stomach problems .
Then they would forbid us from drinking water . ” Al - Haj says he completed 480 days of hunger strike by which time his medical condition had deteriorated and he was bleeding from his anus .
That was the moment his interrogators decided to release him .
“ There were new interrogators now , but they tried once more with me .
‘ Will you work with us ? ’ they asked me again .
I said ‘ no ’ again -- but I thanked them for their years of hospitality and for giving me the chance to live among them as a journalist .
I said this way I could get the truth to the outside world , that I was not in a hurry to get out because there were a lot more reporters ’ stories in there . ”
They said : ‘ You think we did you a favor ? ’
I said : ‘ You turned me from zero into a hero . ’
They said : ‘ We are 100 percent sure that Bin Laden will be in touch with you ...’
That night , I was taken to the plane .
The interrogators were watching me , hiding behind a tennis net .
I waved at them , those four pairs of eyes .
” The British authorities have never admitted talking to Sami al - Haj .
Nor have the Canadians .
Al - Jazeera , whose headquarters George Bush wanted to bomb after the invasion of Iraq , kept a job open for Sami al - Haj .
But Prisoner No. 345 never received an official apology from the Americans .
He says he does not expect one .

You ’ll remember the Durham fish oil “ trial ” story , possibly the greatest example of scientific incompetence ever documented from a local authority .
Initially they said – to blanket media coverage – that they were running a trial on fish oils , giving pills to 3,000 children to see if it improved GCSE performance .
I pointed out , along with several academics , that their experiment was incompetently designed , for no good reason , and so would only produce false positive results .
They responded that this was okay , as they had n’t called it a “ trial ” .
This was very simply untrue : they had , repeatedly , in press releases , and interviews , and who cared anyway , because whatever you called it , this was still a stupid experiment .
Durham ’s response was to edit the online version of their press release to remove the word “ trial ” .
Then I asked what they were going to do in this experiment , how they were going to measure results , and more .
They refused to give me this information – for an experiment by a public body performed on thousands of children – so I used the Freedom of Information act .
They still refused .
Then hundreds of you wrote to their information commissioner , using the FoI , and they refused again , accusing us of running a “ vexacious campaign ” .
Then the GCSE results for Durham came out : they were n’t too great , so I asked for the results of the “ trial ” .
Durham refused to give me this information .
Then they announced , bizarrely , untruthfully , in a formal response to a written question : “ It was never intended , and the county council never suggested , that it would use this initiative to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of using fish oil to boost exam results . ”
This was , once again , very untrue .
Durham ’s own press release had clearly said they were giving out the pills “ to see whether the proven benefits it has already brought children and young people in earlier trials can boost exam performances too ” .
All the press coverage said the same .
The council ’s chief schools inspector Dave Ford said “ the county - wide trial will continue until the pupils complete their GCSE examinations next June , and the first test of the supplement ’s effectiveness will be when they sit their ‘ mock ’ exams this December . ”
Suddenly this trial did not exist .
Now , bafflingly , suddenly , in defiance of their previous denials , Durham have released some results .
“ Detailed analysis of the outcome of the initiative , ” they say “ shows that pupils who took the Omega - 3 supplement did better than those who did not . ”
Hardly .
Let ’s try to disentangle what they think they ’ve done .
“ Initially , just over 3,000 Year 11 pupils began the study , taking the Omega - 3 tablets at school and at home .
By the time GCSE examinations came around , 832 pupils had 80 per cent or greater compliance . ”
This is appalling .
2,168 of their subjects dropped out of the trial : they must count these people in the results .
They do not .
This makes the rest of their claimed results even more meaningless .
“ Mr Ford and his colleagues then sought to identify the same number of Year 11 pupils who had not taken the supplement and match them to those who had , according to school , gender , prior attainment and social background . ”
They originally said they were going to compare childrens ’ predicted GCSE performance ( whatever on earth that means ) against actual performance .
Of course , they refused to say how they would analyse this , despite hundreds of requests : and it is vitally important that people performing experiments are clear what they are measuring , and how they will analyse it , before they begin , otherwise they can move the goalposts and get a false positive result afterwards , by slicing the cake a dozen different ways .
“ The GCSE results of 629 ‘ matched pairs ’ – fish oil takers and non-fish oil takers – were then analysed . ”
Who are these 629 ?
I thought it was 832 ?
But more importantly , by selectively only looking at the results from the pupils who were most highly adherent to the capsules regime , they have skewed their sample , entirely unnecessarily .
They have , in fact , simply discovered that school performance is better in children who are more highly adherent to a school regime involving pills , and who are , in all probability , also more adherent to everything at school , harder working , better performing , from completely different families , with higher aspirations , and so on .
If you wanted to design an experiment to produce a spurious false positive result , you could not do any better than this .
This result has nothing to do with the pills , it is laughably incompetent science , in an experiment performed on thousands of Durham children .
It has been widely reported in the local press , and in the Telegraph ( doubtless with more to come ) as “ perhaps there is something in this preliminary stuff ” .
Every journalist is baffled by the details .
Some report that there is “ controversy ” , in the classic style of journalists who simply report “ two sides ” .
But there are not two sides here : there is nothing in this work .
It is not “ controversial ” .
A crap unpublished result presented in a press release from an incompetent experiment analysed incompetently in god knows how many different ways by incompetent people who have shrouded themselves in secrecy and demonstrated themselves to be incapable of making reliable true statements about their own research – or even whether it exists – is not a “ maybe ” .
Fish oil pills are now the biggest selling food supplement product in the UK , with a market size of £ 110 m .
Nobody has ever tested them .
Most damningly of all , Durham council had the children , and the pills , necessary to perform a decent piece of research .
The only thing they were missing was the rigour , and help was offered .
The only real question now is this : why has Dave Ford performed a incompetent experiment on thousands of children ?
And more importantly , why has Durham Council let him ?
Speedy Congress approval for a $ 700 billion plan to bail out the U.S. banking system is paramount to avoid a meltdown of the markets , analysts told CNBC on Wednesday .
But at the same time lawmakers need to make sure they ask the right questions before handing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke a blank check , they added .
" What do you think we will be discussing on this programme if this package falls over ?
The answer is we will be discussing total carnage in the credit markets and potentially massive financial systemic risk , " Anthony Fry of Evercore partners said .
Paulson and Bernanke were forced to defend their bailout plan in front of a US Senate Committee , as many argued that the package lacked vital details .
Hearings will resume later on Wednesday .
The legislation , which would allow the government to buy bad mortgages and other troubled assets from financial institutions , has faced numerous delays , weighing on the markets .
" We are in crisis mode , and there is a real desire to see some way in which we can stabilise the markets , " said Dr Herbet London , President of the Hudson Institute , who also ran as a Republican Candidate for the Mayor of New York in 1989 .
But crucial questions still need to be answered , he added .
" Where do you draw the line and say the Federal government ca n’t own Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG ?
It is quite extraordinary " .
Treasury Secretary Paulson asked Congress to act swiftly on the $ 700 billion plan , which , he says , will help to ensure financial stability , while Ben Bernanke warned lawmakers that a rejection of the plan would further hurt the U.S. economy , which is already under pressure .
Political debate intensified with presidential candidates from both camps raising doubts about the Bush administration 's package , and demanding conditions that could continue to stall its implementation .
" I think what McCain is going to ask for is , ' give me some guarantees , give me an understanding of what is going to happen going forward .
I will obviously buy into this proposal , but I want to make sure the people who represent the free market individuals in my party are satisfied with the direction this is taking , ' " said London .
John McCain , who a week ago said the economy was fundamentally sound , has also expressed worries about giving too much power to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama urged Congress to approach the bailout proposal in a bipartisan manner , and that a blank cheque should n't be given without oversight and accountability .
" In the case of Obama , he is probably coming out way ahead on this matter , " London conceded , as Obama urged Washington to recognise that true economic recovery requires addressing not just the crisis on Wall Street , but the crisis on Main Street .
Vice - Presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , former mayor of the small town of Wasilla , Alaska , may have waited as little as eleven days after after assuming office before precipitously firing Mary Ellen Emmons , Director of the Wasilla Public Library , over Ms. Emmon 's steadfast refusal to ban books .
In 1996 , Palin first ran for the Office of Mayor of Wasilla .
According to articles in the Alaskan newspaper , The Frontiersman , Mayor Palin asked the director of the town 's free public library if she " could live with censorship of library books . "
Palin was not specific about which books , what topics or passages would be questionable in nature .
Rindi
White reports in today 's edition of the Anchorage Daily News that in December of 1996 , " Emmons told her hometown newspaper , the Frontiersman , that Palin three times asked her -- starting before she was sworn in -- about possibly removing objectionable books from the library if the need arose . "
White goes on to further state that " Emmons told the Frontiersman she flatly refused to consider any kind of censorship . "
In response to the firing of Emmons , the well respected former Wasilla mayor , John Stein , told local newspapers that Palin felt some voters thought the library held inappropriate books and " asked the library how she could go about banning books , " Stein further stated the head librarian , Emmons , was " aghast " at Palin 's question .
" The librarian , who resisted mayoral censorship , was fired shortly after Palin took office . " [ CBS News ]
Several of the conversations between Palin and Emmons took place within a new and very radical political environment for the small town of Wasilla , one wherein Palin , during her very first days in office , asserted her newfound authority by instituting a mandate requiring all department heads obtain her direct permission before talking with any reporter on any subject at any time .
" She put a gag order on those people , something that you 'd expect to find in the big city , not here . "
[ The Frontiersman ]
A visit to the Wasilla Public Library website reveals that the current " hottest " library book in town is " Twilight " by Stephenie Meyer , one in a series of books about how Bella , a young sweet mortal , and Edward , the handsome teenage vampire , deals with their ongoing emotional struggle between desire to remain chaste and instinctive ' blood lust ' .
Meyer 's highly popular non-explicit story line on this unusual couple is now complete and although Bella and Edward remain virgins until their marriage in the final installment , some parents find her books quite controversial and most unsuitable for teenage readers .
Further search through the library website gives us more clues as to the quality of this small town library .
An avid reader in Wasilla would find themselves among a goodly assortment of books and the ability to request even more from state library sources .
There is a variety of fiction on hand appealing to the young , including Harry Potter fans , as well as many works by writers popular with adults .
Wasilla Public library contains a decent reference section and their political offerings present a variety of views , even including a small number of Ann Coulter books .
The Catcher In The Rye has survived ban in Wasilla to this day .
There is a small , but well selected , number of sex education books for adults and those designed for parents to teach their children about sex from the early years on , even several books on the topic of gay and lesbian sexuality .
Books suitable by most standards can be found for teenage readers regarding bodily changes , self - esteem , chastity and even responsible sex .
All books on sex , of course , are located in the Adults Only Section , including what is most likely Wasilla 's only copy of the ancient Kama Sutra .
A review of the Wasilla Public Library policy section tells us they will not release member information to " any agency of local , state or federal government except pursuant to such process , order or subpoena as may be authorized under the authority of federal , state or local law relating to criminal , civil or administrative discovery procedures or legislative investigatory power . "
This little library takes the privacy of Wasilla 's citizens seriously as they will resist even a subpoena for information " until such time as proper showing of good cause has been made in court of competent jurisdiction . "
The Wasilla library affirms " the right of each individual to have access to constitutionally protected materials , " the " right and responsibility of parents to determine and monitor their own children ’s use of all library materials and resources " and further affirms their willingness to help parents develop guidelines to protect their children on the Internet .
Finding lengthy and detailed positions in all library policy areas , it was puzzling to discover the current Materials Selection Policy states only that the method for selecting library materials is " in the process of being revised and finalized . "
It is just as puzzling what Sarah Palin found objectionable in the town 's public library or why she could not articulate to Emmons exactly what she found offensive and why .
Anne Kilkenny , a resident of Wasilla , who has known Palin for many years , was troubled enough by the firing of Mary Ellen Emmons , that she told her own story of Sarah Palin .
Per Kilkenny , Palin brought up the idea of banning some of the library books during a City Council meeting in October of 1996 .
Per Rindi
White , the conversation Kilkenny witnessed between Palin and Emmons went as follows :
Next Page 1 | 2

Two things are clear .
The talks have not borne much fruit , so suspending them is almost cost free , at least in the short term .
The downside is that the talks have been a way for the two countries , which do not have diplomatic relations , to have face - to - face conversations .
Several Iraqi politicians said they believed that the Iranian suspension was as much in retaliation for the United States ’ criticism of Iran ’s nuclear program as it was for Iraq policy .
“ Some Iranian officials believe that Iraq is a better location to pressure the Americans over Iran ’s diplomatic crisis with them , ” Ali al - Dabbagh , an Iraqi government spokesman , told Al Hurra , a satellite channel , on Monday evening .
In addition , Iran loses nothing in Iraq by denouncing strikes on Shiite civilians , especially since it has also said it approves of the Iraqi government ’s effort to halt the activities of illegal militias .
While those two positions may sound contradictory , they are plausible here .
The Iraqi government also says it wants to help civilians and is taking aim only at the militias .
The reality is that when forces go after insurgents in urban areas , it is impossible to avoid hitting some innocents as well .
Fellow Shiites are not the only ones disturbed by the fighting ; a delegation from Anbar Province , which is almost entirely Sunni , made the long and dangerous journey to Sadr City on Monday to show solidarity with the poor Shiite community .
As American helicopter gunships barraged nearby neighborhoods and people ran inside to take shelter , representatives of influential Sunni tribes , including the Janabi and Hebi , stood shoulder to shoulder with distinguished Shiite tribal leaders in Sadr City .
Ali al - Hebi , 40 , said , “ The people in Sadr city are like our families , and we are worried about them . ”
“ We must find a solution for them , and we advise them to not repeat our fault in Falluja , ” he added .
“ The loss of any blood is forbidden , according to our religion as Muslims , and if we do not help them , we will be responsible before history for what will happen here . ”
The sheiks ’ visit was reminiscent of a similar journey by Shiites in 2004 , organized by followers of the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr .
They gathered food and supplies and brought them to Sunnis in Falluja who were besieged by American forces at the time .
A Muslim emirate is not the best place to mix champagne and beach romance .
A British couple is facing up to six years in prison for allegedly having public sex near the surf in Dubai , a split - personality emirate that toys with Western permissiveness but is ruled by Islamic tenets .
The couple -– Vince Acors and Michelle Palmer -– face up to six years in jail for indecency and having unmarried sex .
A trial on the charges is expected to begin next week .
The British Broadcasting Company quoted Palmer , who was reportedly fired from her job at a publishing house after the incident , as saying :
“ We were just kissing and hugging .
We did n’t have sex together .
I was lying on top of him .
I have been to Dubai for 2 1 / 2 years without committing any kind of offense .
I ’m sorry . ”
Authorities in Dubai -- the flashy , financial hub of the United Arab Emirates -- said the couple met at a champagne brunch , got in a taxi and were arrested on the beach by a policeman who spotted Palmer sitting on Acors with her shirt off .
“ The lady is innocent , ” Palmer ’s lawyer , Hassan Mattar , told the media after the couple appeared in court this week .
“ The medical reports from the police show she did n’t have sex . ”
Foreigners make up about 85 % of the UAE 's population of 5.6 million , and cultures often collide .

Hahn was still hurting early in the Democratic convention week over the fact that her candidate , Hillary Clinton , did not get the presidential nomination and wo n't be on the ticket .
" I think this may have been the last chance in my lifetime to elect a woman president , " said the Los Angeles councilwoman .
But that does n't mean this ardent Democrat will consider a vote for John McCain , now that he has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running - mate .
" I think when all is said and done it was always about more than having a woman in the White House , " Hahn said by phone shortly after 11 a.m .
Denver time , as her plane home was about to begin taxiing .
" John McCain 's priorities are just not in line with most women's .
The stakes are just too high .
Hillary said it in her speech .
' Were you in it just for me ? ' "
Hahn may be typical of most women Democrats in Denver over the last week .
She is the first woman elected to office from a family of staunch Democratic men ( all of whom served , however , mostly in nonpartisan office ) :
Her late father Kenneth Hahn , the legendary county supervisor ; her uncle Gordon Hahn , a state assemblyman and councilman ; and her brother Jim Hahn , Los Angeles mayor , city attorney and controller .
McCain can be assumed to be trying to reach Hillary Clinton supporters who are rooted less deeply in Democratic politics than the Hahns .

One of the features of Javascript is closures , Javascript closures keep the local variables of a function even after it returns .
That happens when a function is declared inside another function , the local variables of the outer function will still exist even after the outer function returns .
function outer ( ) { var name= " mabdelghani " ; var inner=function ( ) { alert ( name ) ; } ; return inner ; } var testFunction=outer ( ) ; alert ( testFunction ) ; testFunction ( ) ;
In the above code snippet , a function inner is defined inside another function outer , the local variable name is available even after function outer returns .
The result of the following line
alert ( testFunction ) ;
is
function ( )
{
alert ( name ) ;
}
and the result of the following line
testFunction ( ) ;
is mabdelghani
Which means that the inner function which is referenced by testFunction does n’t keep a copy of the name variable and it references the value of the local variable inside outer function though that function is returned .
It ’s not necessary that the local variables in closures are to be declared before the inner function , They can be declared anywhere in the outer function before returning from it .

My , what a difference a desperate and politically cynical choice for VP makes .
" I have had a strong and a long relationship on national security , I 've been involved in every national crisis that this nation has faced since Beirut , I understand the issues , I understand and appreciate the enormity of the challenge we face from radical Islamic extremism .
" I am prepared .
I am prepared .
I need no on - the - job training .
I was n't a mayor for a short period of time .
I was n't a governor for a short period of time . "
Extra amazing considering McCain said this just last night at the Presidential Forum on Service : ( h/t Kos )
" Listen , mayors have the toughest job , I think , in America .
It 's easy for me to go to Washington and , frankly , be somewhat divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . "
Wow .
Not only does McCain completely reverse himself on the experience gleaned from serving as mayor , he admits that it 's easy for him to be " divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . "
First some background from the BBC :
“ Two Spanish cartoonists have been found guilty of offending the royal family and fined 3,000 euros ( £ 2,100 ) each .
Their cartoon , on the front page of the weekly satirical magazine El Jueves in July , depicted Crown Prince Felipe and his wife Letizia having sex .
The edition was pulled from newsstands across the country by police .
A judge said that El Jueves ’ Guillermo Torres and Manel Fontdevila “ had vilified the crown in the most gratuitous and unnecessary way ” .
Torres had drawn the cartoon and Fontdevila , the paper ’s cartoons editor , wrote the caption .
“ Do you realise , ” says the crown prince in the cartoon , “ if you get pregnant this will be the closest thing I ’ve done to work in my whole life . ”
That referred to an announcement by the government that it would pay Spanish couples for each new baby they had .
Several months before , in April , the royal couple had their second baby , Sofia .
‘ Gratuitous and unnecessary ’
Prince Felipe and Letizia were portrayed in an “ explicit sexual posture ” prosecutors said .
Slandering or defaming the Spanish royal family can carry a sentence of up to two years in prison .
During their short trial , the defendants said they had done nothing wrong and had depicted members of the royal family in cartoons many times before .
Trade unions representing journalists have accused the Spanish judiciary of impeding freedom of speech , says the BBC ’s Steve Kingstone in Madrid . ”
First off , the Spainish police can try to erase something all they want , but thanks to this wonderful thing called the internet , nothing can be smothered for long .
So here is the illustration that is causing all the hubbub ( click for a larger image ) :
First off , boo - fucking - hoo .
it ’s not even that graphic .
None of the ‘ ol in - out , no money shot , just a little bit of the side of one tit .
Big fucking deal .
Oh , and banning it will do you a lot of good .
If they had just ignored it like sensible people , it would have just ended up forgotten in the trash at the end of the month .
Now , bastards like myself are going to throw this thing up all over the place and millions of people will be talking about the royal couple doing it doggystyle for weeks , if not months .
I thought it was bad enough what happened with the Danish Mohammed comics from last year , but at least they were concerned about people dying with that one ( stupid though it is ) .
So now in Europe you ca n’t have comics that make fun of religious figures or royal families …
Soon to be followed by anything that is critical of the government or government figures in general , soon to be followed by comics in general …
Boss Tweed is Pleased .

Democratic vice - presidential nominee Joe Biden said yesterday that he and running mate Barack Obama could pursue criminal charges against the Bush administration if they are elected in November .
... [ H ] is statements represent the Democrats ' strongest vow so far this year to investigate alleged misdeeds committed during the Bush years .
" If there has been a basis upon which you can pursue someone for a criminal violation , they will be pursued , " Biden said during a campaign event in Deerfield Beach , Florida , according to ABC .
" [ N ] ot out of vengeance , not out of retribution , " he added , " out of the need to preserve the notion that no one , no attorney general , no president -- no one is above the law . "
Obama sounded a similar note in April , vowing that if elected , he would ask his attorney general to initiate a prompt review of Bush - era actions to distinguish between possible " genuine crimes " and " really bad policies . "
" [ I ] f crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " Obama told the Philadelphia Daily News .
" You 're also right that I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems we 've got to solve . "
Congressional Democrats have issued a flurry of subpoenas this year to senior Bush administration aides as part of a broad inquiry into the authorisation of torturous interrogation tactics used at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
Three veterans of the Bush White House have been held in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to respond to subpoenas : former counsel Harriet Miers , former political adviser Karl Rove , and current chief of staff Josh Bolten .
The contempt battle is currently before a federal court .
I 've never been a huge Joe Biden fan , although I was happy enough with his selection as Obama 's running mate .
I knew Obama was n't going to pick someone great like Russ Feingold , Barney Frank or Donna Edwards so I was happy to see him pick someone competent who would help him win electoral votes .
The yesterday I read something that gave e real hope -- not the kind from a bumpersticker , the kind that I never thought I would see in American politics .
Ironically , the hope came from a British newspaper , theand it held out the chance for something even better than impeachment , criminal charges against Bush .
Like everyone , I missed the ABC - TV revelation , fascinated instead to be watching the slo - mo Sarah Palin train wreck .
But Biden is actually talking about making right what Nancy Pelosi got so very , very , very wrong and tarnished her historical achievement .

Overview of conditions Arctic sea ice extent on August 24 was 5.47 million square kilometers ( 2.11 million square miles ) , a decline of 1.85 million square kilometers ( 714,000 square miles ) since the beginning of the month .
Extent is now within 580,000 square kilometers ( 220,000 square miles ) of last year ’s value on the same date and is 1.84 million square kilometers ( 710,000 square miles ) below the 1979 to 2000 average .

Conditions in context
Since our August 11 update , sea ice extent has declined at a fairly steady yet brisk pace .
Since August 8 , atmospheric circulation has settled into a pattern with high pressure covering most of the Beaufort , Chukchi , and East Siberian Seas .
Recent ice losses have been most pronounced along the northern edge of eastern Siberia , which is consistent with generally southerly winds and above - average temperatures in this region .
Based on NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer — Earth Observing System ( AMSR - E ) satellite images from the University of Bremen the wider , deeper Northwest Passage through the Parry Channel is almost open .
The United States National Ice Center confirms that Amundsen ’s Northwest Passage is navigable .
The AMSR - E data furthermore indicate that the Northern Sea Route ( also called the Northeast Passage ) is open .
Last August , the Amundsen and Parry Channel routes both opened , but the Northern Sea Route remained blocked .

Changing ice thickness
As discussed in a number of previous postings ( July 17 , April 7 ) , sea ice thickness is a key measure of the health of the sea ice .
While the NASA ICESat sensor can give an overall picture of ice thickness over the Arctic Ocean , the most accurate way to measure ice thickness is by taking point measurements on the ground .
Don Perovich , Jackie Richter - Menge , Bruce Elder , and Chris Polashenski at the United States Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory track the evolution of sea ice thickness year round using autonomous buoys .
The buoys are deployed as part of the North Pole Environmental Observatory , the Beaufort Gyre Observatory , and the DAMOCLES project .
The buoy data have indicated increased amounts of melt on the underside of the ice cover in recent years ; bottom melt last year was particularly extreme .
The pattern for 2008 has been more mixed .
The ice at some buoy locations has thinned by more than a meter through the melt season because of strong melt both on the surface and the underside of the ice .
Other locations show strong thinning caused by surface melt , while only modest thinning is apparent in others .
Differences in surface melt from location to location reflect factors such as air temperature , the ice albedo , and cloud conditions .
The wide range in bottom melt points to variations in the amount of ocean heat absorbed .
In recent days , the buoys have indicated sub - freezing temperatures with surface melt coming to an end ; however , bottom melt will continue for at least two to three more weeks and the ice extent decline , while slowing , will also continue .

Steve Saville On The US $ Rally
A line of thinking within the " gold community " is that direct central bank intervention caused last week 's US $ surge .
Specifically , some gold - market analysts / observers have said that the catalyst for the rally was the purchase , by foreign central banks , of $ 28B of US government securities during the weekly period ending on Wednesday 6th August .
However , while $ 28B is the largest weekly increase ever in marketable US securities held by foreign central banks , it is not way out of line with earlier increases .
For example , between January and July of this year there were 4 weeks during which foreign central banks made net purchases of more than $ 20B of US securities , and none of these accumulations had a big effect on the currency market .
It should also be noted that the weekly volume on the foreign exchange market exceeds 10 TRILLION dollars , so it really makes no sense to assert that a $ 28B purchase could affect this market 's trend so dramatically .
Of course , if you annualise last week 's purchase of US securities you end up with a very large number ( almost 1.5 trillion dollars ) , but it is not reasonable to annualise volatile weekly figures .
Annualising the data from a much shorter time period is only appropriate in cases where the relatively short time period is , or is likely to be , representative of the entire year .
Having said all that , we are well aware that central bank manipulation of the currency markets occurs every week in one form or another , with one of the most popular forms being commonly referred to as " jawboning " .
The practice known as " jawboning " involves central bankers making statements designed to influence market prices by influencing the expectations of market participants .
Last Thursday , for instance , the head of the ECB threw a wet blanket over expectations that Europe 's central bank was likely to implement additional rate hikes over the coming months .
This , we suspect , had a greater effect on exchange rates than the aforementioned purchase of securities , although we doubt that intervention of any form was the primary cause of the dollar 's reversal .
The US $ is very under -valued relative to the euro on a purchasing - power - parity basis , so a lot of pressure has been required to PREVENT the dollar from rallying .
And the main source of this pressure has , in our opinion , been strength in oil and other commodities .
A self - reinforcing cycle has been in place over the past year , with rising commodity prices leading to speculative US $ selling and a falling US $ leading to speculative commodity buying .
This self - reinforcing cycle has not ended , but when several high - profile commodities eventually buckled last month under the weight of either falling demand or rising supply the self - reinforcing aspect began to operate in the opposite direction .
In particular , clear evidence that intermediate - term declines were underway in the commodity sector prompted US $ buying ( or the unwinding of US$ short positions ) and some US $ strength , which , in turn , exacerbated the declines in commodity prices and led to more US $ buying .
In summary , there is no need to concoct manipulation theories in order to explain the dollar 's rebound .
A more plausible explanation for the currency market turnaround is that the recent intermediate - term trend reversals in the commodity markets removed the pressure that had previously been preventing the US dollar from moving back towards fair valuation .
We think the dollar 's move back towards fair valuation is still in its infancy , but the market looks over - extended in the very short - term so some consolidation is likely over the coming 1 - 3 weeks .
The US$ & The Gold Sector
Many people will be asking the question : why is the US $ rallying when its fundamentals are so terrible ?
From our perspective , however , a more reasonable question is : why has it taken so long for the US $ to rally against the euro given that the US $ is extremely under -valued relative to the euro and the euro 's fundamentals are just as bad ?
The answer , we think , is that the currency market has believed that the US Federal Reserve would be as ' easy ' as it needed to be to help the banking system through its crisis , while the ECB would continue to focus on minimising currency depreciation .
We think the market was / is right to believe that the Fed will do whatever it takes to maintain the solvency of the major banks , but traders now appear to be coming around to the view that the ECB will also be loosening the monetary reins .
Take away the interest - rate ' prop ' and the euro suddenly becomes free to fall under the weight of its own over - valuation .
It is also worth mentioning that the recent sharp downturn in the world of commodities has probably had an important effect on perceptions , and hence on relative valuations , within the currency market .
The reason is that with the prices of most commodities now in intermediate - term downward trends the decision - makers at the ECB should feel free to pay more attention to the serious economic slowdown currently underway , and less to the inflation problem .
So Much For The Manipulation Theory
Since I made those comments the Fed issued a report showing that there was a small decline in marketable securities held by foreign CBs during the week ending 13th August .
This means that the best part of the US dollar 's recent surge occurred while foreign CBs were net sellers .
So much for that manipulation theory .
The Great Unwind
I 've been surprised by the magnitude of the sell - off in gold and particularly in gold stocks .
I had expected that gold would get hit during the initial phase of a US $ rally , but not by as much as it has been hit .
The amount of leverage employed in the gold market has obviously been a lot greater than I had thought , leading to gold getting caught up in what you 've termed " the great unwind " .
Gold is n't money ( money is , by definition , the general medium of exchange , which gold clearly is n't ) , but it should be analysed as if it were money because its major trends are solely determined by monetary factors .

Town hall meetings are important , but the presidential candidates have also campaigned more prominently on the Web this year than ever before .
How do the sites stack up ?
A new study finds that Sen. Barack Obama 's online social network of registered users is more than five times larger than Sen. John McCain's , according to each campaigns ' calculations .
The research by the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism finds that while Obama showed a clear advantage online with interactive features that were more advanced , and more of them , for most of the campaign , in the last few weeks McCain 's campaign has narrowed this Internet gap by adding features such as social networking .
Overall , the Obama site has attracted more users than McCain 's site , according to figures posted this week on Hitwise , an Internet usage research company .
For the week ending Sept. 6 , the Obama site attracted 56 percent of the online traffic to the two candidates '
Web sites from a sample of 10 million U.S. Internet users .
Online election battle
The Pew researchers analyzed the two candidate 's official sites in August and September , measuring several components , including engagement and participation of members , social networking , content and language used .
Some findings of the online review include :
Both candidates '
Web sites include tools for user engagement , allowing users to register to vote and organize meetings with neighbors .
Obama 's
Web site makes it much easier for supporters to take action , while the McCain site offers only the more basic grassroots functions .
As of Sept. 9 , Obama boasted 510,799 MySpace friends , compared with McCain 's 87,652 such friends .
That gives Obama a more than 5 - to - 1 lead in number of friends , down from a 7 - to - 1 advantage in August .
Obama also showed a lead on Facebook with 1,726,453 supporters to McCain 's 309,591 .
Obama 's
Web site has twice as many videos posted to his official YouTube channel and far more YouTube channel subscribers , by an 11 - to - 1 margin .
The word " change , " which was part of the Obama campaign motto , is now less prominent on his site 's information pages .
On McCain 's site , the word is now among the top 20 most frequently used words .
The leading term on both sites is the word " America , " which includes " American " and " Americans . "
The McCain campaign has fully integrated his vice presidential pick , Sarah Palin , into the Web site 's home page , while the Obama home page displays his vice presidential pick , Joe Biden , much less prominently .
Flashy or not
In general , McCain 's campaign Web site has fewer bells and whistles , with fewer videos and fewer social networking capabilities than Obama's .
That difference could reveal something about the candidates ' personalities and campaign strategies , according to another review of the candidates '
Web sites .
" I would n't be surprised if the McCain design team realized that a flashy , Flash - driven site might alienate a group of voters looking for something simple and honest — an antidote to the slick , new media poster boy , Barack Obama , " said Johanna Blakley , deputy director of The Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication , who headed up the latter review .
" This old - school site design may be a calculated choice . "
At the other extreme , Blakley said , the blue backdrop on Obama 's site actually sparkles .
" It 's rare that a campaign Web site actually shimmers , so I suspect that this look and feel was meant to capture the ' glow ' surrounding Obama 's candidacy , " Blakley said .
While Obama 's site is all about social networking , Blakley found it difficult to access profiles and commentary from registered users on the site .
" While I respect the effort to create a community around a candidacy , " she said , " the coercive emphasis on raising money and donating time will probably turn many political novices off . "
Best Horror Slot Games
Do you like to have that extra little thrill of having a good scare whenever you sit down to do a little gaming in a virtual casino ?
Well , if so , you may have already found a few games you consider being your favourite , but there are so many out there that you may have yet to find the most exciting game of all .
Any of the games that have made our list here of the four very best horror - themed slot games could give you that spine chilling feeling as you spin away on the reels of these expertly crafted games .
We hope you get a chance to try all four , and that you find your newest favourite game amongst those on our list .
So , without further ado , here are the four absolute best games in scary horror - themed slots : Lost Vegas
This bone - chilling game sets you up in the middle of the Vegas strip that has been taken over by a hoard of bloodthirsty zombies .
It provides you from the get - go with the choice of playing with reels full of either regular human characters or with ragged bloodthirsty zombie ones .
Of course , we all know exactly which option we all choose when faced with this simple decision .
So , as you spin away on reels full of grotesque zombies , it presents you with plenty of opportunities to win some money as a bonus to the sheer thrill of playing this ultra-exciting slot offering from the fresh - faced powerhouse Microgaming .
There are different bonuses based on whether you choose to play as a survivor or as a hungry for brains zombie , with the infected players ’ bonus possibly being the more lucrative of the two .
You trigger the free spins bonus round by either landing three scatter symbols in one of the 243 pay - lines of the cascading symbols , or by having one scatter symbol on the board when the randomly occurring zombie fistful of cash appears .
The fistful of money can happen after any losing spin where you did n’t hit any winning paying lines .
You never know when that mangled hand will reach up from the bottom of your screen and offer you an extra cash prize even though you did n’t land on any winning lines .
But let ’s get back to the free spin bonus .
The zombie characters landing on screen in every spin infect the reel they land on and spread the virus , which wipes out the low paying symbols and replaces them with more lucrative possibilities , awarding you generous prize money in the process .
Playing on Lost Vegas you can win as much as 2,155 times your bet amount , which itself can be as high as 45 coins .
As you can see , this game has some serious winning potential .
Put this together with the creative design elements that will have you experiencing a rise in blood pressure and you have a top - notch home run of a game being hit by the game ’s creators .
Blood Lore – Vampire Clan Another blood - curdling horror themed slot is this gothic vampire - based game from big - time game designer Netent .
In this game , you are stuck in a dark musty mansion with some unsavoury characters who are out to suck the blood from your body .
The chilling soundtrack itself is enough to send a cold shudder down your spine .
The game ’s setting is just the beginning of the dark ambience that creates such a great horror - themed gaming option for us lovers of the genre .
In this wonderfully dark 5 - reel 3 - row slot game , you have many ways to win a pretty penny .
This is just icing on the cake for thrill - seeking players of all kinds .
The bonuses begin with the red - headed beautifully seductive vampire queen herself .
Her lips dripping with blood , she serves as the game ’s wild symbol and can replace any symbol in the field after a spin to create winning lines .
Also , when you get paid for your winning lines that include the blood - sucking firecracker of a woman , you will be pleasantly surprised to find that your prizes have been automatically doubled just because of her mere ominous presence .
Next up in the way of bonuses is the free spin round .
This hot win creating an offer is triggered by the wolf howling in front of a full moon which is the scatter symbol of this game .
Landing on either three , four , or five of these symbols in any winning line will trigger a round of 12 , 16 , or 20 free spins , respectively .
Your free spin winnings will pile up as the creepy sound effects and characters roll by , spin after spin , and all of your winning combinations are tripled for payouts .
Landing on a winning line with the vampire queen during this bonus round will compound the bonus winnings to give you six times the regular payouts for any of the 243 ways of potential winning lines .
This game will have you on the edge of your seat as you win or lose by the luck of the draw , but also because of the dark ambience , the game creates that touches your soul in such a way that all horror - themed game lovers will be thrilled to experience .
Plus , there is an extra “ gamble ” feature , but we will let you discover this little gem on your own because there has to be some mystery that will just keep the game surprising you with all of its wonderful additions .
Circus of Horror Another uber - creepy horror - themed slot game is this wonderful little gem , which is another game from the creators at Netent .
This time the creep factor comes from a variety of dark characters that range from mummies and chainsaw - wielding psychopaths to vampires and wild vicious beasts that look like they come straight from hell to hunt you down in the setting of an old abandoned circus that suddenly springs to life in the dark of night .
There are even evil necro nurses prancing around the fairgrounds , and then there are the creepy killer clowns who are by themselves more than enough to make your very soul tingle with overwhelming fear .
These fearsome characters are the high paying winning symbols and also the symbols that trigger the many bonus features embedded within the grim circus setting of the game that are your genuine chances to hit some big wins .
The clown , for example , who laughs alone will have you looking over your shoulder as he instils a bit of paranoia in you during gameplay , is the wild symbol .
He can replace any other symbol to create a winning line in the classic video slot set up of 5 - reels with 3 - rows that makes up the field of play .
Except he can not take the place of Devora , the purple - haired snake lady , who is the games scatter symbol or the vampire Nosferatu , who is the bonus game triggering symbol .
The many bonuses offered in this game just put a sweet topping to the already enjoyable gameplay and start with the free spins bonus .
Landing on three , four , or five Devora symbols in any winning line triggers a round of eight , 12 , or 16 free spins with a multiplier that triples all winning earned during them .
Keep in mind , that landing on more Devora symbols can re-trigger the bonus round and just keep adding to your free spin count , so there is a possibility of winning some excellent amounts with long - lasting free spin bonuses possibly continuing on and on .
During the free spins , you have the possibility of seeing bloody knives get thrown at the clown wild symbol and making him become a stuck wild for the remainder of your free spin round .
Also , you have the possibility of seeing the third reel begin to bleed and ooze , in which case the whole reel becomes wild and helps create a lot of winning combinations for the rest of your free spin bonus round .
All of these can combine to make the free spin bonus round a money - making gem for those lucky enough to hit many of the various bonus options during the game .
This is because they can all combine to make it possible to win some suitable amounts of cash that , again , will also double at the end of the round .
Then , there is the Electric Chair bonus game embedded within this dark carnival .
This is triggered by landing Nosferatu in reels two , three , and four for a winning line .
When this happens , the game whisks you away to a dark funhouse with the vampire strapped into an electric chair .
You then get to decide which of nine distinct body parts you will electrocute first to torture this evil character .
The game continues until you either go to flip the electrocution switch and nothing happens or you make it through all the body part electrocutions .
In the end , all of your winnings are doubled as just another great bonus that keeps the game extra interesting .
A final bonus offering is another “ gamble ” feature that we will again leave it up to you to discover on your own .
You will be happy to find out about this little addition that can add some multipliers to your winnings .
All in all , the Circus of Horror game will have you thrilled and chilled to the bone with its gruesome and amazing graphics plus the chilling sound effects and music will have you getting your fill of creep factor .
Full Moon Fortune
Our final horror themed slot game is set in the 1800s England and starts on a dark and foggy night along a backcountry road .
Your character , Dr Blackwood , is attacked by a fearsome creature of the night .
Luckily , you survive the attack , but it has lasting effects .
Now , whenever the full moon rises by appearing in the fifth of the 5 - reels , you turn into a werewolf and every Dr Blackwood symbol in the entire field becomes a multiplier wild , substituting for any symbol except the scatter symbol and creating many winning possibilities for your bankroll to grow by offering up to five times multiplier for every winning combination created .
This high variance game from indie game producer Ash Gaming offers you the chance to win it big , with a top jackpot of $ 125,000 !
That is an incredible amount of money to win on a virtual slot game , and you have to be very lucky to land everything just right to win it .
Winning this jackpot starts with you landing on at least three of the tombstone scatter features .
This triggers the free spins bonus and three tombstones get you one free spin with a one - time multiplier , but four tombstones get you two spins with a two times multiplier .
Finally , if you happen to land on five tombstones in a paying line will trigger three free spins with a triple multiplier bonus , but that is not all .
Landing on five tombstones will also trigger a bonus round , where you find yourself in the graveyard that is dark , gloomy , and very creepy .
But while you are there , you can begin to pick from the tombstones , and they can turn into more free spins and more multipliers with a possibility of racking up 20 free spins at a 25 times multiplier .
The tombstone picks just keep adding until you land on a collect symbol and the round ends , or you clear all the tombstones that were winners from the graveyard .
Then your free spins with the multipliers begin and you can win it hugely if you hit all the paying lines with the best combinations you can max out your winnings with that stunning $ 125 k jackpot amount , if you had bet the max amount on the spin that triggered the round , to begin with , along with all 20 payout lines .
The game is grand for high rollers who are looking to score that maximum jackpot win that is a small fortune , or us more regular joes who cannot afford the 50 cent bet for each of the 20 lines that equates to ten dollars per spin .
Instead , it offers a bare minimum bet of just one penny and you can bet on any amount of lines between one and all 20 .
So , the game offers a chance for penny players to enjoy a game with a magnificent story , some killer graphics in transitions and bonuses , and also some dark creepy sound effects and music .
This makes for a very great horror - themed game that was made for everyone to enjoy playing , no matter their gaming budget .

## @brief A simple variant of processing .
Pool that accepts requests # from different threads .
# Import ' multiprocessing ' package ( formerly known as ' processing ' ) : try : #
Tested with python 2.6 b3 from multiprocessing import Pool except ImportError : #
Tested with standalone processing 0.52 from processing import Pool import threading , sys class MultiThreadedPool : " " " A simple variant of processing .
Pool that accepts requests from different threads : makes sure that requests being processed by the worker processes are not redundant .
When a thread B submits a request which is already being processed in the background for another thread A , then B does n't re-submit the request : it waits for the same result object as A .
This package makes the following asumption : - the result of the function to call is entirely determined by its arguments ( resp. " function " , " params " )
As a consequence , in order to determine whether a " request " has already been submitted by another thread , we ONLY compare the couples ( function , params ) .
If a submitted request has the same couple ( function , params ) as a request in progress , then we wait for this request to be completed ( valid result , or exception )
This Pool should be safe wrt exceptions in the remote function .
Only the map ( ) and imap ( ) methods are implemented . " " " __lock = None # threading .
Lock object __inflight =
None # dict : ( function , params ) -> processing .
ApplyResult obj __workers =
None # processing .
Pool object def __init__ ( self , processes = None , initializer = None , initargs = ( ) ) : " " " See processing . Pool.__init__ ( ) " " " self .

Due to a limitation of processing 0.52 , we have to wake up additional threads waiting for the result by hand .
The correct fix to processing would be to replace self._cond.notify ( ) in ApplyResult::set ( ) by self._cond.notifyAll ( ) " " " for key , job , i_am_owner in jobs : # Begin workaround # processing .

Tacitly acknowledging criticism that she 's been diminished in part by an overly protective media shield , Sarah Palin will take a more forward - leaning approach and do additional interviews in the weeks ahead , a top aide said today .
" She 's seen the reviews and heard the criticism , but she 's a fighter , " said this aide .
" And now she 's in a fighting mood . "
Palin heads to McCain 's cabin in Arizona today to prepare for her Thursday debate , and while she 's there she 'll do a round of conservative talk radio interviews .
" Talk radio is a convenient , powerful and effective outlet , " said the aide .
Rush Limbaugh , who hosts the most popular radio show in the country , noted in an e-mail that he does n't invite guests on and alluded to his rocky relationship with the top of the GOP ticket .
" The McCain camp does n't trust me , " Limbaugh said .
But asked if he'd welcome a call from Palin , the conservative talker said : " Of course . "
The move to reintroduce Palin comes after much criticism for a stumbling interview she gave to CBS ’ Katie Couric last week ; increased conservative grousing about the campaign 's decision to roll out the GOP vice presidential nominee through high - stakes and high - profile mainstream media interviews ; and the suggestion by some observers that she even drop off the ticket .
Quite the contrary , Palin , her family and aides are determined to remind voters what they so liked about the governor in the first place .
After the debate and talk radio hits , the plan is to find a way to let Palin be Palin , moving her away from the pre-fab talking points and letting the down - home daughter of Wasilla be herself .
" She wants to tell her story more , and people around her do , too , " added the source .
" This is a governor very much on her toes , very much fed up with inaccuracies and fictions about her own life and career . "
To this end , Palin was far more aggressive in another interview with Couric today , this aide said
Sitting with McCain for their first joint interview a week after the widely panned sit - down with Couric , Palin interjected when the CBS anchor brought up a report about the Wasilla Assembly of God , the governor 's childhood church and one she still attends at times , seeking to pray gays away from homosexuality .
" Sarah Barracuda showed up today , " the aide said , reprising the feisty former point guard 's high school basketball nickname and one that has been largely forgotten since her post - convention cosseting .
" We 're encouraging CBS to run entire thing , " the aide said of today 's session .
" Run it end to end online . "
Of concern to McCain 's campaign , however , is a remaining and still - undisclosed clip from Palin 's interview with Couric last week that has the political world buzzing .
The Palin aide , after first noting how " infuriating " it was for CBS to purportedly leak word about the gaffe , revealed that it came in response to a question about Supreme Court decisions .
After noting Roe vs. Wade , Palin was apparently unable to discuss any major court cases .
There was no verbal fumbling with this particular question as there was with some others , the aide said , but rather silence .

In a development which may untwist a few knickers around the internet , NASA scientists have now explained just what their Phoenix robot lander has found in the soil of Mars - and what the implications are for possible discovery of life on the Red Planet .
Following news that the White House had received secret briefings in advance of any public announcement , internet speculation was rife .
Some believed that life - or anyway hospitable conditions for it - had been found .
Others said that no , in fact proof positive had been found that Mars could not harbour life , perhaps casting doubt on the value of President Bush 's ambitious plans to send a manned mission there .
The truth is somewhat more mundane , according to NASA .
Some unusual chemicals , normally seen as poisonous , have been found in the Martian soil at the lander 's location .
However , according to the NASA boffins , the presence of these perchlorates does n't mean that life can't exist on Mars .
" Finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life , but it does make us reassess how we think about life on Mars , " said Michael Hecht from NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - in charge of one of the Phoenix 's main dirt - sniffing instruments .
NASA says :
Perchlorates are found naturally on Earth at such places as Chile 's hyper -arid Atacama Desert .
The compounds are quite stable and do not destroy organic material under normal circumstances .
Some microorganisms on Earth are fueled by processes that involve perchlorates , and some plants concentrate the substance .
Perchlorates are also used in rocket fuel and fireworks .
So , if we 're following this correctly * , there could possibly be Martian animals with perchlorate - fuelled metabolisms , living off perchlorate - concentrating plants .
Though there would be a significant risk of these creatures catching fire or exploding if upset - not unlike Terry Pratchett 's Discworld dragons , in fact .
On the other hand , you do get the vibe that NASA would really rather not have found perchlorates - indeed would have infinitely preferred it if a little green man had walked up and peered into Phoenix 's cameras by now .
More from NASA here . ®
* SCIENCE QUALITY WARNING :
The chance that we are following this correctly is roughly equivalent to that of a man with no arms throwing a handful of jelly through a falling doughnut at fifty yards without touching the sides .

I believe that one of the best ways to reduce spending is to limit your exposure to advertising .
Marketers employ powerful persuasive techniques to circumvent our rational minds , encouraging us to spend our hard - earned money on things we do n't really need .
This is n't anything new .
Advertising has been a pervasive part of American culture for more than a century .
I recently picked up some 100 - year - old magazines for cheap at a garage sale .
One is the May 1904 issue of Women 's Home Journal .
.
The other is the October 1909 issue of Collier's .
While it 's fun to read the articles — the Wright brothers fly a plane over Manhattan !
Admiral Dewey at home ! — it 's even more fun to look at the ads .
They provide a fascinating glimpse of the rise of U.S. consumerism .
A few advertisements show products that are still familiar today :
Some of the ads demonstrate new technology that now , 100 years later , we take for granted :
And , of course , certain ads seem quaint or dated :
Of course , there were questionable financial schemes being advertised even back then .
People have always been lured by the promise of quick riches .
Some of these ads offer guarantees of “ perfectly safe ” returns of 12 - 18 % a year , while others offer sure ways to make a couple hundred dollars in just a few days while working from home .
Some of the “ make money ” ads offered legitimate opportunities .
This one from the October 1909 issue of Collier 's seems to give a peek into the origins of the now familiar bowling alley .
There are two interesting differences between the ads in the 1904 Women 's Journal and the 1909 Collier's .
In the former , there are several advertisements for carriages :
But five years later , there are no ads for carriages at all .
Instead , there are several full - page ads for automobiles !
( Unfortunately , the magazine was way too big for my scanner , so I can only get about half of this ad . )
It 's also interesting to see the rise of credit .
Though consumer credit has been used for centuries , the sort of credit we think of ( using installment payments ) is a more recent development .
For a long time , it carried a social stigma , but that eased during the first part of the twentieth century .
The 1904 Women 's Home Journal contains one ad ( for pianos ) that offers installment purchases .
The 1909 Collier 's promotes several companies with “ easy terms ” .
I loved reading these old magazines , and intend to keep my eye out for similar bargains in the future .
Actually , Kris and I are stopping at an antique store later this afternoon .
I should set myself a $ 10 budget and then see if I can't find a couple of magazines to take home .
Amy Pearl is the sort of Democrat who made the Barack Obama campaign nervous .
A volunteer who ran Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s Palo Alto campaign office during the primary season , she had doubted Obama ’s experience and arrived at the Democratic convention here unsure how she would vote in November .
She left town Friday with her mind made up :
She is for Obama .
For all the glitter of a convention that literally ended in fireworks , the Obama campaign ’s mission was a simple one : winning over the Amy Pearls .
Obama entered the convention as the nominal head of a Democratic Party cleaved into factions -- one devoted to him , another to Clinton .
The four - day convention was his best chance before election day to cement the two halves into a coalition that would serve as a durable and expanded political base .
Republican John McCain seemed eager to peel off aggrieved Clinton supporters with his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
But various women ’s groups and Clinton loyalists said Friday that the Palin pick would n’t spur defections .

“ Gov. Palin and John McCain are a good match because they both want to overturn Roe v.
Wade , they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the Bush administration , and they both offer more of the same , ” said Ellen Malcolm , president of EMILY ’s List , which works to elect female Democratic candidates and endorsed Clinton in the primaries .
Buoyed by new poll results , Democrats wrapped up the convention feeling better about their prospects .
“ We ’re going to beat the hell out of ‘ em in November ! ” exclaimed Don Fowler , a former Democratic National Committee chairman who backed Clinton during the primaries .
On the convention ’s most important night , Obama could not have asked for a bigger audience .
Apart from the more than 84,000 spectators who watched him accept the nomination Thursday in a football stadium , the television audience smashed records .
More than 38 million people saw him deliver his speech on TV , apparently a new high , according to Nielsen Media Research .

By the convention ’s end , the Gallup daily tracking poll showed Obama had taken a race that was dead even and built an 8 - point lead .
The margin could grow when the polling data account for everyone who saw the speech .
Obama ’s bounce exceeds that of his most recent predecessor .
Democratic Sen. John F. Kerry lost a point after his nominating convention in 2004 .
The average post - convention bump for Democratic candidates since 1964 is 6.2 points , according to the nonpartisan publication National Journal .
Mending divisions in Denver was a feat of stagecraft , choreography and delicate ego - management .
Crucial to the project was the Clinton family .
In the end , both Sen. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton cooperated with the Obama team .
But former associates of Bill Clinton said he was initially unhappy with the speech assignment the campaign gave him .
He was asked to talk about national security when he wanted the focus to be the economy .
His wound up delivering a speech that touched on both .

One Clinton aide said Friday that the Obama campaign made no effort to force a single topic on the former president -- and that it would have been useless in any case .
“ People who understand him know he ’ll say whatever he wants to say , ” the aide said .
“ He will never give a speech on just one topic .
Ever . ”
Despite his palpable disappointment over his wife ’s defeat , Clinton made it clear that he wanted Obama to win : “ Last night Hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect Barack Obama , ” Clinton said Wednesday .
“ That makes two of us . ”
A convention meant to showcase Obama could have gotten wildly sidetracked by the roll call vote that played out Wednesday .
Hillary Clinton had wanted her name entered into nomination .
A roll call could have underscored the intra-party feuding .
But Clinton aides said they yielded to the Obama campaign in the mechanics of the vote .
It was cut off after 32 states and territories had weighed in , so as not to prolong the image of a party divided .
The capstone was when Clinton herself moved to end the voting and make Obama the nominee by acclamation .
“ Hillary moving for acclamation just put the Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing , ” Fowler said .

Pearl , the Clinton volunteer from the Palo Alto area , said one consideration was especially important to her : Clinton ’s treatment at the convention .
She did n’t want to see Clinton disrespected .
On the final day of the convention , Pearl sent an e-mail to Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean .
She thanked him for working to give Clinton ’s “ campaign and accomplishments full expression . ”
“ It totally worked .
I told you it would create more unity than trying to force unity by ignoring the divisions ! ” she wrote .
Dean wrote back in an e-mail : “ I never had any doubt that Hillary would do what she did .
She is a true star , putting the country ahead of herself . ”

Not all Clinton supporters are appeased .
Reports are circulating that some state delegations browbeat Clinton delegates into voting for Obama .
Asked if some delegates felt that kind of pressure , Olivia Anne Morris Fuchs , a Kentucky delegate who backed Clinton , said , “ Absolutely . ”
But others are prepared to let the long fight end .
Lorraine Hariton , a Clinton delegate , said : “ There are various stages in the grief process .
I ’m at a place where I ’ve moved on and realized how important it is for us to win the White House and go on . ”

John McCain campaign manager Rick Davis–under the spotlight because of his work for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac–is skipping a Wednesday lunch with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor .
On Tuesday , word came that McCain political director Mike DuHaime will substitute for Davis because he is “ heading out on the trail ” today .
Davis is the subject of stories in the New York Times and Newsweek about his work for the failed mortgage market makers .
At issue right now : did Davis contradict McCain ’s statement that he has not been involved with Fannie and Freddie for some time .
Barack Obama tells Supporters to Get in The Face of Non-Supporters
This is the man who will unite the country ?
This is the man who offers hope ?
This is the man who offers change ?
This is the man who will transcend party lines ?
This is the man that will heal America ?
This is the man who will heal our souls ?
This is the man who will lower the sea levels ?
This is the man who will forgive our sins and give us everlasting life ?
Barack Obama has claimed that he wants to change the tone in Washington , he has said that we need to end partisan politics as usual .
What he really means by this is that it is time for Republicans to shut up and agree with him .
His record shows a complete lack of bi-partisanship , so how does he propose we unite the country ?
I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors .
I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican .
I want you to argue with them and get in their face , ”
By asking his supporters to argue and bully non-supporters to his side .
To bicker and quarrel with opponents .
This does n’t sound like a new tone to me .
Do n’t tell us you are going to be different when you offer more of the same .
His message of hope has been replaced by politics as usual .
This is Barack Obama ’s community organizer skills on full display here .
Lisp 's 50th Birthday Celebration
Richard P. Gabriel
In October 1958 , John McCarthy published one in a series of reports about his then ongoing effort for designing a new programming language that would be especially suited for achieving artificial intelligence .
That report was the first one to use the name LISP for this new programming language .
50 years later , Lisp is still in use .
During the past five decades , it has been changed and turned , which led to dialects differing in many respects from the original design , but the central corner stones remained the same , making it one of the oldest programming language still in use today , second only to Fortran .
The final design for the first incarnation of Lisp was published in an issue of the Communications of the ACM in 1960 .
That version of Lisp pioneered numerous languages features that are nowadays taken for granted .
To name but a few : Lisp introduced a conditional expression , which was taken over in other languages as the ubiquitous if statement ; it introduced recursion and first - class functions , the essential ingredients of functional and many other programming languages ; it introduced reference semantics for variables , without which object - oriented programming would not exist ; it introduced symbolic expressions , a generic and uniform representation for data ( later reinvented as XML ) and programs , the latter enabling program transformations from within an application ; it introduced garbage collection for the very first time in programming languages ; and it even already had a combination of metadata and dynamic dispatch in the form of symbols and property lists .
Lisp is clearly one of the most influential programming languages in the history of computer science : Timothy Hart added macros to Lisp in the 1960's ; Warren Teitelman invented an advice facility for Lisp in the 1960's as the very first precursor to aspect - oriented programming ; Carl Hewitt used Lisp as a platform to develop backtracking ( essential for logic programming ) and the actor model ; Alan Kay acknowledges the heavy influence of Lisp on Smalltalk , the first explicit object - oriented programming language ; Brian Smith developed the concept of computational reflection using Lisp as a starting point ; Paul Graham used Lisp to develop the first continuation - based web application ; and even today Lisp is on the forefront for the upcoming Web 3.0 .
We would like to celebrate Lisp 's 50th birthday .
OOPSLA 2008 is an excellent venue for such a celebration , because object - oriented programming benefitted heavily from Lisp ideas and because OOPSLA 2008 takes place in October , exactly 50 years after the name Lisp has been used publicly for the first time .
John McCarthy has already agreed to give a talk about the early history of Lisp , returning to OOPSLA after his keynote talk at OOPSLA 2007 .
Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel will repeat their HOPL - II talk about the Evolution of Lisp from 1992 , using a particularly unusual set of slides .
Pascal Costanza will talk about the recent developments in the Lisp community , which has seen a surprising resurrection after its wake from the AI Winter .
We will invite other influential Lispers , covering important aspects in the development of Lisp during the past five decades .
Finally , we will have an open panel discussion about the next 50 years of Lisp .
OOPSLA 2008 will take place in Nashville , Tennessee , USA from October 19 to October 23 .
OOPSLA is the major annual conference on object - oriented programming worldwide and continues to attract several hundreds of the brightest minds in this field both from industry and academia since over 20 years .

New Energy Project Will Be Even Larger than the Pickens Plan
September 16th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Move over , T. Boone Pickens .
You ’re about to be overshadowed by Babcock and Brown .
Australian developer Babcock and Brown has announced that it is working on a 79.5 MW wind farm in the Texas Panhandle — but the company has much larger ambitions than a single farm .
Majestic Wind Farm is only one part of a $ 1 billion effort company to build 567.5 MW of wind power throughout Texas , Wisconsin , and South Dakota .
But there ’s more .
Babcock and Brown ’s current plans are part of an even bigger project in the Texas Panhandle Loop to create 8,000 MW of power from renewables , natural gas , and coal - fired plants .
Companies including Airtricity , Celanese , and Occidental Energy Ventures will join Babcock and Brown in the massive effort .
Compare that to Pickens ’ plan to install 4,000 MW of wind power in Texas — a staggering number in its own right .
And lets not forget that Pickens is only one man , while the larger plan is part of a combined effort from multiple companies .
Babcock and Brown has n’t announced a completion date for the 8,000 MW plan , but its Majestic Wind Farm will be up and running by the end of the year .
Here ’s hoping for an even bigger project to come along and steal Babcock and Brown ’s thunder .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
This article is adapted from the first chapters of Steven Brams ' book , Mathematics and Democracy , published by Princeton University Press and reproduced here with kind permission .
The book is reviewed in this issue of Plus .
Please note that the AV system discussed in this article ( " approval voting " ) is not the same as the one that was put to the British public in a referendum in May 2011 ( " alternative vote " ) .
It may come as a surprise to some that there is a science of elections .
It can be traced back to the Marquis de Condorcet in eighteenth century France , Charles Dodgson ( better known as Lewis Carroll ) in nineteenth century England , and Kenneth Arrow in twentieth century America .
Since Arrow published his seminal book , Social choice and individual values , more that fifty years ago — for which in large part he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1972 — there have been thousands of articles and hundreds of books published on everything from the mathematical properties of voting systems to empirical tests of the propensity of different systems to elect centrist candidates .
One person , one vote .
US presidential candidates Barack Obama ...

The 2000 US presidential election highlighted , among other things , the frailty of voting machines and the seeming arbitrariness of such venerable US institutions as the Electoral College and the Supreme Court .
Political commentary has focused on these aspects but has given very little attention to alternative voting systems , about which the science of elections has much to say .
The system used in the US — and many other places , including the UK — is known as plurality voting ( PV ) .
PV is based on the " one person , one vote " principle : every citizen casts only one vote for his or her preferred candidate , and the person with most votes wins .
But PV has a dismaying flaw : in any race with more than two candidates , PV may elect the candidate least acceptable to the majority of voters .
This frequently happens in a three - way contest , when the majority splits its votes between two centrist candidates , enabling a more extreme candidate to defeat both centrists .
PV also forces minor - party candidates into the role of spoilers , as was demonstrated in the 2000 US presidential election with the candidacy of Ralph Nader .
Nader received only 2.7 % of the popular vote , but this percentage was decisive in an extremely close contest between the two major - party candidates .
... and John McCain .
( Photo by River Bissonnette . )
In this article I make the case for an alternative to PV in multi-candidate elections called approval voting ( AV ) .
With AV , voters can vote for , or approve of , as many candidates as they like .
Each candidate receives one vote for every voter he or she was approved by , and the candidate with most votes wins .
At first sight it may seem strange that voters ' preferences , such as who they like most and least on their list of approved candidates , does not play a part in AV .
But by seeing AV in action , we 'll find that it offers greater flexibility than other voting systems , more sensitivity to voters ' preferences , and also has the ability to prevent unpopular results .
Common sense
A few points in favour of AV meet the eye even without a detailed analysis .
Under AV , voters can do exactly what they do under PV — vote for a single candidate — but if they have no strong preference for one candidate , they can express this by voting for all candidates they find acceptable .
If a voter 's preferred candidate has little chance of winning , that voter can also vote for a more viable candidate without worrying about wasting his or her vote .
Minority candidates do not suffer from AV since their supporters will not be torn away simply because there is another candidate who , though less appealing to them , is considered a stronger contender .
Under AV , they can vote for both .
Today the candidate supported by the strongest minority often wins .
Under AV , by contrast , the candidate with the greatest overall support will generally win .
AV is likely to cut down on negative campaigning , because candidates will have an incentive to broaden their appeal — not just trash their opponents — in order to gain the approval of supporters of other candidates who are willing to approve of them as well .
Under AV voters are more likely to vote in the first place , because they have greater ability to express their preferences .
Also , AV is easy to use and understand .
And since it does not violate any state constitutions in the US ( or , for that matter , the constitutions of most countries in the world ) , it requires only an ordinary statute to enact .
What makes a winner ?
To understand why the kind of voting system chosen can crucially influence the result , let 's look at an example .
Suppose we have an election with four candidates , a , b , c and d .
The voters split into four groups , with preferences as shown in table 1 .
Group 1 , with 100 voters , prefers a to b , b to c and c to d.
Group 2 , with 50 voters , favours c over b , b over d , and d over a .
Group 3 , with 45 voters , has favourite c , ahead of d , followed by b and then a .
Group 4 , with 10 voters prefers d over b , b over c , and c over a .
Group 1 , 100 voters a b c d Group 2 , 50 voters c b d a Group 3 , 45 voters c d b a Group 4 , 10 voters d b c a Table 1
Which candidate should win ?
In plurality voting , where each voter votes only for his or her top choice , a wins with 100 votes , ahead of c with 95 votes and d with 10 votes .
The majority is narrow , though , and unlike c , a is ranked last by all but one of the four groups .
Single transferable voting
In an STV election , voters rank the candidates in order of preference .
In the first round of counting , only first choices will be looked at .
If a single candidate has a majority of votes , then he or she is declared elected .
If not , the candidate with the least number of votes is eliminated and his or her votes transferred to the candidates that were ranked second by those who ranked the eliminated candidate first .
This process is repeated until a candidate has a majority of votes .
If at any stage several candidates stand for elimination because they each received the same low number of votes , then one of several tie - breaking methods can be applied .
As an example , consider the following 3 - candidate , 9 - voter election , with preferences as follows : Group1 , 4 voters a c b Group 2 , 2 voters b c a Group 3 , 3 voters c b a
Here candidate b is eliminated first , with his or her 2 votes going to candidate c. Candidate c then wins over a by 5 votes to 4 .
For an election with just one winner , STV is the same as instant run -off voting .
STV can also be used when candidates are competing for more than one seat .
In this case , a quota is used to establish when a candidate is declared elected .
Voters ' preference might be better represented using a scoring system .
To each candidate allocate 3 points for every voter who ranked him or her top , 2 points for every voter who ranked him or her second , 1 point for every voter who ranked him or her third , and 0 points for every voter who ranked him or her last ( such a scoring system is known as the Borda count ) .
Borda counts are rarely used in political elections , but they are often used to assess the acceptability of a result .
It is now c who wins with 395 points , ahead of b with 365 points , a with 300 points , and d with 170 points .
Single transferable voting ( STV ) , a system which is more sensitive to voters ' preferences than PV , does in fact elect c in this example .
STV is used in Ireland and several ex-British colonies like Malta ; see the box on the right for a description .
Another important idea in election theory is to see how candidates would fare if they were pitted against each other , tournament style , in pairwise contests .
When a is pitted against b , then b wins because 105 of the 205 voters prefer b to a .
In fact a , the PV winner , loses every single pairwise contest — he is what is called a Condorcet loser .
Candidate b , on the other hand , who is nobody 's first choice , wins every single pairwise contest , making her the unique Condorcet winner .
In general , there might not be a candidate who beats all others in pairwise contests ( see the box below ) , but if there is , one can make a strong argument that any voting system should elect him or her as a winner .
In our example , PV , as well as STV and the Borda count , fail to do so .
No Condorcet winner Consider a 3 - voter , 3 - candidate election , with the following preferences Voter 1 a b c Voter 2 b c a Voter 3 c a b
In pairwise contests a beats b , b beats c and c beats a , so there is no Condorcet winner .
So how does AV fare in this situation ?
Perhaps surprisingly , AV can elect any one of the three winners — the PV winner ( a ) , the Borda - count winner ( c ) , and the Condorcet winner ( b ) — and even d ( group 1 votes only for a and all other groups vote for d and candidates they rank above d ) .
Which of these candidates is actually chosen in a given election depends on the voters ' strategies .
If each voter decides only to approve of his or her first choice , then a wins , as under PV .
If all groups approve of their top two candidates , then the Condorcet winner b wins with 160 votes , compared with 100 votes for a , 95 votes for c , and 55 votes for d .
If the voters in groups 1 , 2 and 4 approve of their top three candidates and those in group 3 of their top two , then the Borda count winner c wins with 205 votes , ahead of b with 160 votes , d with 105 votes , and a with 100 votes .
This might seem strange at first , but it illustrates one of the strengths of AV .
For a given election , there are several possible outcomes .
Which outcome is actually chosen depends critically on where voters draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable candidates .
Where voters draw this line often reflects where the biggest drop - off is in the intensity of their preferences .
In my view , this is critical information in the selection of a social choice , but it is absent from most other voting systems .
Acceptability versus preference
Plurality voting in the US presidential elections .
Our example was , of course , carefully chosen and simplified to make this point .
But what can we say about AV in a more general setting , wherein there are an unknown number of voters with a plethora of preferences ?
With some assumptions on voters ' behaviour and some logical reasoning , it 's possible to show that the flexibility of AV remains intact .
The assumptions are necessary , because no rational analysis can take account of voters behaving irrationally or voting against their own interest .
In our case , the assumptions are simple , but not too simplifying : we assume that voters always approve of their favourite candidate and never approve of their least favourite , and that if they approve of a certain candidate a , then they also approve of all the candidates they prefer to a .
We also assume that each voter has a strict order of preference , with no two candidates taking equal place .
It 's now possible to prove that what we saw in the example above can occur in any election , no matter how many people vote and what their preference profiles are .
We can prove that a Condorcet winner , if one exists , will always be one of the possible AV winners .
Whether or not the Condorcet winner actually wins the election depends on how many voters choose to put him or her on their approval list .
The point is that AV is guaranteed to give the Condorcet winner at least a theoretical chance .
The argument to show that the Condorcet winner is always a possible winning outcome of AV is simple .
In an AV election , each voter hands in his or her list of approved candidates , so a candidate is a possible winner of AV if there 's a set of approval lists that gives the candidate the most votes .
Suppose that candidate c is a Condorcet winner , and suppose that every voter who has n't ranked c last approves of c but no - one they have ranked below c .
Those who have ranked c last may approve of any number of candidates ( except c , of course ) .
Now look at any other candidate x .
The voters will split into three groups :
Those who prefer c to x ;
Those who prefer x to c , but did n't put c last ;
Those who put c last .
According to our assumptions , voters in groups 1 and 2 approve of c , while voters in group 3 do not .
So we have
Number of approvals of candidate c = number of voters in group 1 + number of voters in group 2 .
Voters in group 1 do n't approve of candidate x , those in group 2 definitely do approve of x , and those in group 3 may or may not .
So
Number of approvals of candidate x ≤ number of voters in group 2 + number of voters in group 3 .
Now c is the Condorcet winner , so c can beat x in a pairwise contest .
This means that more people prefer c to x than prefer x to c .
In particular , more people prefer c to x than put c last .
Consequently , there are more voters in group 1 than in group 3 , so overall candidate c receives more votes than candidate x .
This works for any candidate x , so if voters approve of candidates in this way , then c wins the election .
The proof illustrates the point : AV can elect a Condorcet winner as long as sufficiently many people find him or her acceptable .
In fact , Condorcet winners usually win under AV .
Majoritarian compromise Under MC first choice , then second choice , and then lower choice votes are counted until at least one candidate has a majority of votes .
If more than one candidate has a majority , the candidates with most votes wins .
As an example , consider the following 3 - candidate , 9 - voter election , with preferences as follows : Group 1 , 4 voters a c b Group 2 , 2 voters b c a Group 3 , 3 voters c b a
Here no candidate receives a majority when only first choice votes are counted , so second choices are counted next and added to the first choices .
Candidate c now receives a majority with 9 votes , over 4 for a and 5 for b , so c is the MC winner .
A similar result holds for winners of the Borda count — indeed of any similar scoring system — and for winners of STV and another common voting system , the majoritarian compromise ( MC ) .
Relatively simple arguments show that each of these is always a possible AV winner .
Conversely , our example above shows that none of them need be the AV winner .
In effect , voters can fine - tune their strategies under AV , but not the other systems , making outcomes responsive to information that reflects not only their preferences but also their approval .
What about unpopular results ?
Giving a range of candidates the theoretical chance to win is one thing , but what about keeping candidates out ?
Suppose that in a 3 - candidate 300 - voter election , voters split into three groups with the following preferences :
Group 1 , 100 voters a b c Group 2 , 100 voters b a c Group 3 , 100 voters c b a
Under AV , voters are able to prevent each of the three candidates from winning .
If voters in groups 1 and 3 only approve of their top choices and voters in group 2 approve of their top two choices , then candidate a will win and candidates b and c will both lose .
If voters in groups 1 and 2 only approve of their top choice and voters in group 3 approve of their top two choices , then candidate b will win and candidates a and c will lose .
By contrast , the Condorcet winner b wins under the Borda count ( and any similar scoring system ) and MC .
STV chooses either a or b , depending on who is eliminated first .
Thus , AV is the only system with the power to prevent all three candidates from winning .
Conclusion
There are more aspects of AV that can be analysed mathematically — the impact of strategic voting , the stability of election results , or ways of refining AV — but these go beyond the scope of this article .
What we 've seen is that AV subsumes the outcomes of a range of other voting systems , giving voters , collectively , the chance to choose an outcome that one or more of the other systems might preclude .
Use your vote , even if it 's only one !
At the same time , AV winners are no indiscriminate set , for they always allow for Condorcet and Borda count winners as well as STV and MC winners .
Despite the bigger menu that AV permits , voters are better able to prevent candidates from winning than is possible under other voting systems .
AV is n't ideal in all situations : in elections with more than one winner , for example for a council or legislature , AV is not desirable if the goal is to mirror a diversity of views , especially from minorities .
Neither should the election of Borda or Condorcet winners be eschewed completely — but , by the same token , they should not be the be-all and end - all for judging whether outcomes are desirable or not .
Rather , the pragmatic judgements of sovereign voters about who is and who is not acceptable offer , in the form of AV , a simple and compelling alternative to PV .

Apologies - from
The Register , no less - for appearing to give the impression that the latest piece of Euro - surveillance was not actually part of an ongoing dastardly plot to have each and every one of us " pushed , filed , stamped , indexed , briefed , debriefed and , er , numbered " .
Half an apology , perhaps .
We reported recently that the European Parliamentary Transport Committee plans to put in place a scheme to pass data back and forth across national boundaries .
Trojan horse for future spying ?
Or just reasonable concern over road safety ?
We opted then , and still do , for the latter .
However , a report , The State of Things to Come ( pdf ) , published last week by Statewatch , suggests otherwise .
Statewatch is a voluntary organisation committed to monitoring the state and civil liberties in Europe , which it has been doing since its establishment in 1991 .
The Statewatch report is a formal response to a report ( pdf ) by the EU " Future Group " , billed as the work of the Informal High Level Advisory Group on the Future of European Home Affairs Policy .
This outlines a five year EU strategy for justice and home affairs and security policy for 2009 - 2014 .
The proposals in the EU report include a range of extremely controversial measures including techniques and technologies of surveillance and enhanced cooperation with the United States .
The Shape of Things to Come examines these proposals in some depth .
Their focus , however , is on three highly worrying aspects of what might be described as geek - driven policy making .
First is that one of the drivers fundamentally altering the balance between state and individual is technology itself .
As we has previously noted - in the area of CCTV , for instance - the fact that we can carry out more accurate surveillance and monitoring is argument enough for doing so .
Tony Bunyan , Statewatch director and author of this report , gives the example of a recent debate about the age at which children should be fingerprinted for passports .
" This debate , " he explained , " was carried out in a committee that deals with technical issues .
It was totally devoid of any moral or political input . "
The concern now is the where of landfall .
If the storm continues further west before turning ( see Chuck 's update below ) , then Texas City / Baytown will be in a very bad place , and that 's > 1MMBBL all by itself .
The next two maps represent the current NHC track ( the further " left " the storm goes the worse it is for TX City and Baytown , note red storm surge in this track , Baytown is at the back of the bay ) and the GFDL track below ... as of this update the eye was wobbling to the left of the NHC track , which is n't a good thing for Texas City .
Updated 9/12 2300 EDT -- next update in the morning when we know more about where and how much power / wind was involved .
Hurricane Ike 's current track currently is headed directly for Houston / Galveston and is expected by the National Hurricane Center to be Category 2 ( or perhaps a 3 ) at a late Friday / early Saturday am landfall , which remains in striking distance of over 5 million bpd of US petroleum refining capacity .
( A little perspective : 5 MMBBL is about 30 % of US capacity ( about 15 MMBBL ) , and a bit less than 6 % of global capacity ( ~85 MMBBL ) ) .

Here is the latest update from Chuck Watson at KAC / UCF Chuck updating at 20:45 EDT :
Texas City is on the borderline .
Water levels still rising , but if the storm resumes a NW trajectory Right Now it might not flood ... much .
I do n't think Ike is intensifying .
Max FL winds on the latest passes were 103 knots , which gives surface winds of 90 knots .
Buoy 42035 , offshore from Galveston , has been holding steady at 45 knots .
Winds at Texas City also holding at 35 - 40 knots .
Water levels at Pleasure Pier are holding steady , and there are * very * preliminary signs the offshore winds at Baytown are starting the drop the water levels there .
That 's the good news .
The bad news is the center of the vortex has been moving due west the last hour or so and is now basically on the NHC track .
Hopefully it will turn back NW soon , or water will start blowing into the back of the bay again .
Still cautiously non-pessimistic Baytown wo n't get serious flood damage .
Staying with three scenarios ( relative to Galveston ) : 1 ) 20 miles west : Very Very Bad for Texas City .
Very Bad for Baytown .
Pt Arthur some damage but not so bad .
2 ) Direct Hit : Bad for Texas City , Baytown escapes worst of it .
Bad for Pt Arthur .
3 ) 20 mi east : Not so bad for Texas City .
Baytown Escapes , Pt Arthur ?
Oh , you mean Lake Arthur .
Remember that swath of heavy damage for most hurricanes , even intense ones , is only 50 - 75 miles wide .
Also recall that damage is exponential - 110 mph winds may be 10 % higher than 100 mph winds , but will cause 20 % more damage .
as of Sep 12 ( 16:00 EDT ) :
Ike remains atypical in structure .
Interestingly , the wave and wind fields are stronger on the back side of the storm than in the right front quadrant , due to wind and fetch considerations .
The " eyewall " is visible on radar , and looks to make landfall on the north side of Galveston Bay , to the right of the current NHC track .
Expect them to shift a bit north in the next advisory .
Given this structure , I seriously doubt Ike can intensify much before landfall .
However , the wide wave field and potential for 20ft storm surge along a wide stretch of coastline will still cause a lot of coastal damage .
The track and intensity forecast has enough confidence to start looking at very detailed impacts .
Offshore , I 'm not expecting much damage .
The wave field , while extensive , is within the design margins of all but the older , less productive platforms .
30 ft waves sounds like a lot in the Gulf , and I would n't want to be out in it , but you have to get above 50 ft to really cause significant damage .
The refineries remain a significant concern .
I 'm less concerned about wind , unless we get unlucky and something breaks that should n't .
The big question now is down to flooding , and the main facility I am worried about is the Texas City complex .
If the storm tracks to the NE of the bay , and winds blow offshore , it may avoid flooding .
But a leftward wobble could inundate this complex , and take out over 1 MMBBL / day capacity for several months .
The big Exxon - Mobil Baytown complex is a bit better protected - the storm will have to take a significant leftward jog to flood it .
It looks like Port Arthur area is in for big flooding if the current trends continue , but the refineries are further inland , and if the storm starts moving faster there may not be enough time for the surge to build inland .
30 Day Outage Probabilities ( Refinery Capacity ) : 1 MMBBL : 70 %
3 MMBBL : 30 %
5 MMBBL : 10 %
and from Calculated Risk and Tanta , here 's a complete geek out for you , which is powered by hurricane - tracking software from Stormpulse.com .

Also , the MMS reported today that :
97.5 % of the oil production and 94.4 % of the natural gas production in the Gulf has been shut - in ; Personnel have been evacuated from a total of 596 production platforms , equivalent to 83.1 % of the 717 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico ; Personnel from 101 rigs have also been evacuated -- this is equivalent to 83.5 % of the 121 rigs currently operating in the Gulf ; that staff has been evacuated from 452 production platforms ( 63.0 % ) and 81 rigs ( 66.9 % ) – ( 95.9 % of the oil production and 73.1 % of the natural gas production has been shut - in as a precautionary measure for Hurricane Ike . )

Here are depictions of various Texas cities storm surge maps under different Hurricane scenarios from Weather Underground .
Chuck Watson has put together a dynamically updating page that will reflect the latest damage models / forecasts at this link : KAC / UCF models .
We will be updating this thread with damage estimate and breaking news as this story unfolds .
A note on our modeling process : we take the official NHC track , the raw computer model tracks like GFDL , HWRF , LBAR , etc , and even run our own in - house fast cycle track / intensity models .
These track and intensity estimates are feed to our main hurricane model ( TAOS ) , which computes the wind , waves , storm surge , currents , etc. at each point in our database of over 50,000 elements in the GoM like rigs , platforms , pipelines , pumping stations , refineries , etc .
We then have engineering models for each type of infrastructure that calculates the damage and estimated down time for that element , as well as downstream impacts ( eg if a pipeline is down , the upstream elements can't pump and the downstream elements do n't get product ) .
PRODUCTION /INFRASTRUCTURE
MAPS AND REFINERY INFORMATION
Here 's a link to a really good map of oil refining / SPR storage facilities in respect to the path of Katrina ( NB : OLD TRACK MAP ! ) and here is a listing of production and refining capability for the state of LA .
Just to give you a rough idea of where things are , the map above is a probability swath for Katrina ( OLD TRACK MAP ! ) with the Thunder Horse platform as the red dot , and the other purple dot represents the Mad Dog development ( 100,000 bd ) ; the Holstein development that produces at peak , around 100,000 bd of oil ; and the Atlantis field that may have ramped up to around 200,000 bd in all .
Put together these projects have the potential of around 650,000 bd , but as can be seen , they were sitting in an uncomfortable spot relative to the track of the Katrina .
The white dot is where Port Fourchon is .
This is where the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , or LOOP , is located .
Rigzone pointed out that this is where the foreign tankers offload , Google and Terraserve maps you can see that the area is very low - lying .
One of the big concerns is that there will be sub-sea landslides or other ground movement that might affect the LOOP .
Were this to be disrupted , then foreign tankers would need to be diverted elsewhere , with the likely port being Houston .
Here is a really good link / map ( from " Rod and Reel " no less ) of the LA southern coastline showing all of the Submersible and Floater Gulf rigs .
We have accumulated resources from previous hurricanes below , but we'd like to find updated materials if you know of them .
Recent refinery maps , recent rig maps in the gulf , recent gas fields , SPR facilities , the Intercoastal Canal , pipeline stations and transfer points , etc. , etc . Leave links in the comments please .
Also , here 's the EIA 's Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas Resources pages .
They will also likely come in handy .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices soared Wednesday after the government reported a surprisingly sharp decline in the nation 's petroleum inventories .
U.S. crude for September delivery rose $ 2.99 to settle at $ 116 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil had traded up just 88 cents to $ 113.89 a barrel just before the report 's release .
The commodity surged by as much as $ 4.35 after the release before retreating slightly .
The Energy Department said crude supplies fell by 400,000 barrels during the week ended Aug .
8 . The report also said gasoline supplies fell by 6.4 million barrels , while distillates , which are used to make diesel fuel , fell by 1.7 million barrels .
Economists polled by Platts , a division of McGraw Hill Cos. , had expected the government to report a 500,000 barrel rise in crude stocks , a 2.2 million barrel decline in gasoline stockpiles , and a rise in distillates of 1.9 million barrels .
Refineries were operating at 85.9 % of capacity , down from last week , and a sharper drop than the 86.25 % predicted by the Platts poll .
Concerns that high fuel prices are cutting into demand have sent crude prices sharply lower in recent weeks .
Oil has been trending lower since the end of July and is down about $ 32 , or 21 % , from its all - time high .
However , the larger - than - expected decline in supplies suggested that demand may not have been as low as many investors had thought .
" This suggests that refiners are cutting back , and that should bring gasoline and , to a lesser extent , distillates back up , " said Michael Lynch , president of Stretegic Energy and Economic Research in Winchester , Mass .
The reduced supplies came as fighting continued in a strategically important region of Eastern Europe .
Georgian conflict : Fighting between Russia and Georgia over the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia continued Wednesday , despite a cease - fire brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
According to reports , Russian troops raided the strategically important city of Gori and pressed in the direction of Tbilisi , the nation 's capital .
" The combination of the inventory [ decline ] and the war in Georgia gave people the incentive to buy [ oil ] , " said Lynch .
Georgia serves as an important hub for transporting oil and natural gas between Europe and Asia .
The oil market has largely ignored threats to international supplies over the past few weeks as investors were more concerned about demand .
Georgia 's largest oil pipeline had been shut down before the fighting began due to a fire along its Turkish span , and worries about supply disruption failed to significantly rattle investors a day earlier .
However , Tom Orr , head of research for Weeden & Co. said he believes the oil market has been undervalued , and expressed concern about a disruption in supplies due to the conflict between Russia and Georgia that flared up this week .
" It amazes me how little attention crude oil traders have paid to the conflict between Russia and Georgia .
A month ago crude would have shot up $ 5 or maybe even $ 10 per barrel if it looked like we might lose a million barrels per day of supply , " wrote Orr in a research report .
Fuel - price pinch : Many investors believe the high price of fuel has been taking a toll on U.S. consumers .
The most recent evidence comes in a report on retail sales released Wednesday by the Commerce Department .
The report showed that retail sales had fallen slightly in July , but that sales of gasoline had grown nearly a percent due to higher prices at the pump .
" You strip out the gasoline and there 's not much growth in what [ consumers ] are buying , " said Rachel Ziemba , energy analyst at RGE Monitor .
Demand forecast : Many investors also believe the rising price of crude oil and gasoline has begun to cut demand in the United States , the world 's largest oil consumer .
Gas prices remain more than a dollar higher than where they were 12 months ago .
However , the average price of retail gas in the United States has fallen more than 8 % to $ 3.787 a gallon at the pump over the past 27 days , according to motorist group AAA .
Prices have fallen below the psychological barrier of $ 4 a gallon in all but 8 states , according to AAA data .
But that might be causing a slight uptick in demand .
" With the prices being down at the pump , I think people are starting to drive a little bit more , " said Mark Waggoner , president of Excel Futures in California .
Dollar : Mixed view : Also adding to investor concerns was a mixed U.S. dollar .
The dollar sent conflicting signals to investors on Wednesday , turning slightly lower against the 15 - nation euro , but rising versus the Japanese yen .
The U.S. currency has been steadily gaining strength amid worries about slowing economic growth outside the United States .
Oil is traded in dollars , so when the dollar strengthens , crude oil becomes relatively more expensive for foreign investors .
Oil and other commodities are also commonly used as a hedge against inflation .
Associated Press | August 4 , 2008
WASHINGTON – Consumer spending , after adjusting for inflation , fell in June as shoppers were hit with the biggest increase in prices in nearly three decades .
The Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending dipped by 0.2 percent in June , after removing the effects of higher prices , the poorest showing since a similar drop in February .
The higher prices reflected a big surge in gasoline costs and helped to drive an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending up by 0.8 percent in June , the biggest increase since a 1 percent rise in February 1981 .
The big rise in inflation ate up a part of the billions of dollars in stimulus payments delivered during the month .
Personal incomes rose by a tiny 0.1 percent in June following a giant 1.8 percent increase in May .
Wall Street headed toward a slightly lower opening Monday after the disappointing report on consumer spending .
Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 13 , or 0.11 percent , to 11,293 .
The performance of incomes were skewed by how the department accounts for the billions of dollars in stimulus payments that have been made over the past three months .
Those payments totaled $ 1.9 billion in April , when the program was just getting started , then $ 48.1 billion in May and $ 27.9 billion in June .
Those payouts made incomes and after - tax incomes soar in May compared to April but weaken in June since the level of June payments was lower than they had been in May .

Internet advertising has been abundant , but ABC Radio refused to accept an advertisement for the book during the Don Imus show , said Roger Cooper , the publisher of Vanguard Press , which put out the book .
ABC Radio did not respond to a request for comment .
Mr. Bugliosi , in a recent telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles , said he had expected some resistance from the mainstream media because of the subject matter  the book lays a legal case for holding President Bush “ criminally responsible ” for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq  but not a virtual blackout .
His publisher and publicist said they had expected that Mr. Bugliosi ’s credentials would ensure coverage  he is , after all , fairly mainstream .
His last book , a 1,612 - page volume on the Kennedy assassination , “ Reclaiming History , ” which was published last year , sought to debunk the conspiracy theorists .
It is being made into a 10 - hour miniseries by HBO and the actor Tom Hanks .
Mr. Bugliosi said bookers for cable television , where he has made regular appearances to promote books , have ignored his latest offering .
MSNBC and Comedy Central ’s “ The Daily Show ” were two outlets Mr. Bugliosi had thought would show interest , but neither did .
“ They are not responding at all , ” he said .
“ I think it all goes back to fear .
If the liberal media would put me on national television , I think they ’d fear that they would be savaged by the right wing .
The left wing fears the right , but the right does not fear the left . ”
The CSIRO says the future of the biofuels industry in Australia is looking shaky because production costs are outstripping the profits being returned for alternative fuels .
Senior scientist Dr Tom Beer says large scale production of fuels from food stocks is no longer economically sound .
Darwin's biodiesel plant , Natural Fuels Australia , has gone into voluntary administration , putting 15 jobs at its harbour operation in jeopardy .
Dr Beer believes the plant ran into financial difficulty mostly because of the high cost of the palm oil it used to produce fuel .
" The big problem we have is even where it 's scientifically possible , we can do it in the laboratory , we 're not sure if we can do it on large scale , " he said .
" We 're especially not sure whether we can do it on large scale economically , and that really was the problem with the Darwin plant . "
Dr Beer says it is hoped the industry will use alternatives to food stocks to remain viable .
" All of the biodiesel plants in Australia have had problems because the cost of feed stocks - in the case of Darwin it was palm oil , in the case of some of the others it was tallow - have risen markedly in the past few years since these plants were originally on the drawing board , " he said .
One of the most common things I hear both inside and outside of Microsoft is that people have a difficult time reproducing IronPython performance statistics .
For example , in our performance lab suppose we measure benchmark XYZ as being N % faster or slower under IronPython than CPython , and other IronPython users might observe our measurement of XYZ as being off by an order of magnitude .
There are tons of reasons user A might not see the same performance out of IronPython as user B ( e.g. , different hardware , same hardware with a different OS , different background processes consuming hardware resources , etc ) .
In this post forget about differences in hardware , OSes , background processes and let 's just focus on the CLR version .
Will we get consistent results comparing IronPython performance to CPython under different .NET releases ?
The answer to this is pretty obvious - no .
While our team compiles IronPython to run under .
NET 2.0 , there were performance improvements that went into later versions of .NET which will directly impact IronPython performance .
That is , simply by upgrading to a newer version of .NET you 'll see various performance improvements ( and potentially degrades ) in IronPython without making any other changes to your system .
What if instead of comparing performance on different major .NET versions , we instead looked at performance under .
NET X.Y both with and without security patches installed .
Would IronPython 's performance be the same ?
Somewhat counter - intuitively , the answer is also no .
As a concrete example , the following measurements were taken from a single 32 - bit Vista machine under .NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 SP1 :
float comparisons were 37 % faster under .
NET 3.5 SP1
nested for loops were 30 % faster under .
NET 3.5 SP1
method invocations slowed down 26 % under .NET 3.5 SP1

London film fest artistic directorunveiled a program that includes 15 world , 20 European and 119 U.K. preems .
“ We are excited that London in October will play host to world renowned directors , writers and actors , as well as to some of the most important new voices in international cinema , ” she said and added : “ I spent the weekend reading about the Venice Film Festival and some of the things that I read suggested that it was n’t a vintage year for cinema .
Well , luckily for us , while we do give awards for short films , the fact that we are not a prize - giving festival gives us much freer reign to screen a series of great films . ”
The festival ’s opening and closing gala screenings had already been announced : ’s “ ” reimagines a series of interviews between the British TV personality and the disgraced American president and ’s “ . ”
With films from all over the world , each year there are close to 180 feature films screened as well as documentaries , restored classics , shorts , animation and artists ’ film and video installations , featuring approximately 20 screenings and special events every day .
This year ’s London Film Festival includes a record number of world and European premieres with a total of 189 features and 108 shorts screening .
The big hitters include ‘s “ . ” , ‘s “ “ ; The acclaimed ’s animated documentary “ , ” parts one and two of ‘s revolutionary biopic “ ” and ‘s “ , ” already seen atthis year ; ‘s “ ” follow - up “ , ” the family gala premiere ” ” and ‘s “ ” ( first screening atthis year ) will also play at the event .

After five years of imprisonment and George W. Bush 's " enhanced interrogation techniques , " the man who once drove Osama bin Laden 's car was sentenced by a panel handpicked by the Pentagon to 5 1/2 years .
Since he gets credit for time already served , that makes him eligible for release in 5 months .
His case is subject to mandatory review by a Pentagon official who can shorten the sentence , but is prohibited from extending it .
Prosecutors were seeking a sentence of 30 years to life .
Bush says simply that we will not release anyone who still poses a threat .
Just ignore the ruling of his own concocted military commission , and keep the man locked up ' till he dies .
Some " rule of law . "
Hamdan said he worked as a driver to support his family .
He has a 4th - grade education and two daughters .
He needed a job .
Bush says that makes him one of the " worst of the worst . "
The handpicked panel of military jurists seem to disagree .
The lead judge told Mr. Hamdan , " I hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country , and you 're able to be a provider , a father , and a husband in the best sense of all those terms . "
Mr. Hamdan responded : " God willing . "
It might be understandable if Republicans are upset by the verdict and the sentence .
The case was chosen to be the first prosecution because it was a " slam - dunk . "
In the end , Hamdan was convicted only of what he admitted to from the very beginning : he drove a car for someone because he needed a job .
That someone happened to be Osama bin Laden .
So he provided " material support for terrorism : personnel ; himself . "
But the general Republican mindset is unforgivable .
Most of them , even those not quite bold enough to say it , believe exactly what this commenter wrote in response to a story about the sentence at ABC News :

This exercise of political influence in a uniquely Chicago style was chronicled in the Tribune cartoon " Clout Street " in the early 1980s .

The economy did not create 300,000 jobs in April .
It created 18,000 .
The outlook for higher wages is gloomy as inflation heats up because cost squeezed employers have coerced workers to keep raises small in the months ahead .
In the first quarter salaries rose just 0.6 % and gained only 0.3 % in April as inflation shot ahead at an annualized 9 % to 10 % , not the 3.2 % our government lies about .
This is without a doubt the slowest wage growth in 50 years .
This bears out the government ’s bogus figures .
This is not slack it is a gaping hole in the economy .
The FED and the Bush neocons have boosted the employment figures to mislead the public into believing we are having a full recovery and the sacrifice for that is an increase of ¼ % in the prime rate by the FED , which should have been executed six to nine months ago .
Companies have improved earnings in the S&P by over 26 % in the first quarter by cutting costs , not increasing wages , outsourcing and layoffs .
They still have not regained real pricing power as prices for energy , insurance , raw materials and just about everything else has risen .
There are millions of Americans still out of work because of the massive amount of production and services shipped out of the US as well as outsourcing .
That ongoing problem makes employees fearful to ask for a raise that may put them out on the street .
It is an abject climate of fear .
Even unions are accepting less for fear their jobs will end up in China or India or with some illegal alien who is forced to work for $ 4.00 to $ 5.00 an hour .
In Mexico , incidentally , a person works for $ 10.00 to $ 20.00 a day , if he is lucky .
It is no wonder these poor souls are coming in waves over our border .
At the same time , CEO ’s number one priority is cost reduction .
The swelling profits are there but they are being passed on to shareholders not to the workers .
Once we head into recession and depression , you are going to see major worker unrest .
That should begin in late 2005 .
UBS , the Swiss banking giant , has been fined $ 100 million for laundering money and transferring US currency to Cuba , Libya and Yugoslavia .
These countries are under US trade restrictions .
When UBS was discovered executing these illegal acts they lied about it and tried to cover up the transactions .
The litany of crime goes on and as usual not one of these elitists goes to jail .
The Japanese and Chinese have not been buying US Treasury paper and for that reason alone we believe that rates have to go higher .
Perhaps in June but at least by August 85 % of derivatives as a result will have to be adjusted and that is not going to be easy .
As interest rates climb they will have to be adjusted over and over again .
There will be mistakes and they will bring crisis .
They may even take down the financial system .
Domestic debt is $ 22 trillion .
Government debt is over $ 7 trillion .
The cost of carrying debt will increase profoundly .
Every click up in rates brings Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac closer to bankruptcy ; then there is the collapsing real estate , stock and bond market .
It is going to happen and the only safe refuge will be in gold and silver .
Bill Gross the biggest bond manager says you will lose money in bonds as rates rise .
Warren Buffet is in cash , in euros , out of the dollar and in silver and gold .
How many times do you have to be warned ?
Stay in or buy gold and silver related assets .
Early in May FED governor Pool said , while there is no crisis evident for the obligations of the housing government sponsored enterprises , their capital positions were “ undesirably thin ” and leave the firms “ unnecessarily vulnerable to surprise shocks . ”
He said , “ Clear procedures for closing either company in a crisis should be established .
Should a crisis occur , it will take hold so quickly that GSE obligations will in a matter of hours , or days , become illiquid .
While any holder of GSE debt can exit , not all holders can exit at once . ”
“ There is no question but that a crisis affecting either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would have widespread effect because these firms are so large . ”
After those statements by a top FED official you do not need a roadmap to tell you a major crisis is anticipated .
Our guess is in the second half of 2005 .
By then the 10 - year Treasury note will have risen from 3.65 % to 7.25 % an increase of 3 - 5/8 % .
Thirty - year fixed rate mortgages will have risen from 4 - 5/8 % to 8.25 % .
At those rates 15 % or more of homeowners could easily go bankrupt taking Fannie and Freddie down with them .
Interest rates up 3 - 5/8 % , inflation up 13 % , just like in 1980 , and a plunging dollar all spell much higher gold and silver prices .
When you continually , year after year , issue massive amounts of money and credit you have to expect inflation and in this case a following deflation .
Unsound monetary and fiscal practices not only destroy the value of currency , but also it eventually destroys sovereignty .
These policies rob a society of its assets .
It leaves none unscathed .
The dollar will fall another 35 % to 40 % versus the euro and 300 % versus gold in order to offset the dollar ’s fall as inflation rises .
For dollar holders this is wealth confiscation , plain and simple .
If the FED stops massively inflating in the fall inflation will be over by the end of 2005 .
If they continue to pursue their policy of massively inflating , the only outcome can be hyperinflation similar to Weimer Germany in the early 1920 ’s , followed by a deflationary collapse .
Debt is so large now in the US that it is impossible for them to spend their way to recovery and prosperity .
The Vietnam War and massive spending by Lyndon Johnson set the stage for a fiat currency .
In August 1971 , Richard Nixon was forced to abandon the gold backing on the US dollar .
That was the beginning of the beginning of the end for our now fiat dollar .
We might add we have called the beginning and end of every gold and silver rally since 1960 .
There are only a few brokers and newsletter writers that can make that claim .
The entire problem is even more complicated when you add in the cost of two new wars and occupations .
Both are financed by deficit spending , which adds to inflation , questions the value of currencies and causes a loss of confidence in government ; to say nothing of the needless loss of human life .
As we forecast , these wars and our phony terrorism will go on for years to cover a collapsing world economy .
This is not hard to predict , just read history .
War will be a cover for inflation and eventually deflation .
If these wars are protracted , we could see inflation levels of 50 to 100 % .
It has happened before and surely can happen again .
We are witnessing the twilight of an age ; an age of growth and prosperity unknown in the history of mankind .
A prosperity that is being deliberately snuffed out by the elitists who rule our nation from behind the scenes .
Gold and silver are facing the biggest bull market in history as a result of their machinations .
You can bet all that gold not bought by India , China and the Middle East is being bought by the elitists .
The crooks at Citigroup will pay out $ 2.65 billion to settle a class - action lawsuit brought by purchasers of WorldCom stocks and bonds .
It is expected they will end up paying out over $ 6.7 billion over Enron and the rest of the lawsuits .
Shortly the crooks at JP Morgan Chase will pay out $ 2 billion for fraud as well .
In order to conform to the WTO our Senate passed a bill giving corporate tax breaks of $ 170 billion so international elitist conglomerates could move their offshore tax havens back onshore .
In polite but unmistakeable language , the Departments of Justice and Commerce yesterday told Congress that the new Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008 ( EIPRA ) was a monstrosity so horrifying that only a stake through the heart of several key provisions could make it palatable .
This is the bill , remember , that would give Justice the power to bring civil ( not just criminal ) lawsuits on behalf of groups like the RIAA , seek " restitution " damages , and then turn the money over to the private groups .
In other words , the DoJ could become a pro bono lawyer for the RIAA , freeing the trade group from all that bad PR and the millions of dollars it has spent filing tens of thousand of lawsuits in the last few years .
Plus , the RIAA would still get all the money .
Shockingly , the DoJ did n't think this a really good use of taxpayer - funded resources .
The letter ( PDF ) was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee , which approved EIPRA several weeks ago .
It starts out nicely enough , saying that both the Justice and Commerce departments " truly appreciate the bill 's intention to enhance the tools available for protecting intellectual property rights . "
And then the gloves come off .
" Civil copyright has always been the responsibility and prerogative of private copyright holders , " says the letter , " and US law already provides them with effective legal tools to protect their rights . "
EIPRA could essentially nationalize this function , turning the government into " pro bono lawyers for private copyright holders regardless of their resources .
In effect , taxpayer - supported Department lawyers would pursue lawsuits for copyright holders , with monetary recovery going to industry . "
Because the department has " limited resources , " such a shift in priorities would only occur " at the expense of criminal actions , which only the Department of Justice may bring . "
Then the authors hint obliquely at the current financial crisis and the existing US debt , saying that " in an era of fiscal responsibility , the resources of the Department of Justice should be used for the public benefit , not on behalf of particular industries that can avail themselves of the existing civil enforcement provisions . "
Public Knowledge , one of the DC groups that has been calling for ( and managed to secure ) some changes to the bill , was pleased by the letter , with President Gigi Sohn saying , " Let 's hope Senators get the message . "
The Computer & Communications Industry Association , funded by many of Silicon Valley 's leading lights , also supported the letter .
" At a time when U.S. taxpayers are on hook to rescue the financial industry , why should they also foot the bill for the content industry ’s financial fees ? " said CCIA President Ed Black .
" We appreciate Justice and Commerce alerting Congress to this flaw and support the administration ’s efforts to fix this bill .
This content protection legislation is n't ready for prime time . "
It does n't do much of anything !
It 's kind of expensive !
And it 's available now !
i Phone developer Armin Heinrich has released an application for the iPhone with two noteworthy characteristics :
1 ) Its primary function is to display a handsome glowing red jewel on your iPhone ’s screen :
2 ) It sells on Apple ’s App Store for $ 999.99 , thereby explaining its name : I Am Rich :
( Okay , it does have one other feature :
If you touch the “ i ” in the lower right - hand corner , you get “ a secret mantra … [ which ] may help you to stay rich , healthy , and successful . ”
Unless Heinrich decides to hand out reviewer ’s copies of I Am Rich , I may never learn what that mantra is . )
Heinrich , incidentally , also sells an iPhone calculator app which , at $ 4.99 , most likely appeals to a wider , less well - heeled audience .
Apple ’s policy for approving or rejecting iPhone apps has been a bit fuzzy :
It keeps approving and unapproving Nullriver ’s NetShare tethering utility , and pulled the seemingly innocuous Box Office movie info app .
It seems possible that whatever person or automated system put I Am Rich on the App Store was asleep at the proverbial wheel .
But if I it stays up–and I have to confess that the jokester in me kinda - sorta hopes it does–one thing ’s clear : Practical jokes are acceptable .
At first , all this reminded me of the days when lots of wiseacres put stuff on eBay ranging from babies to kidneys to pieces of space station Mir to their own souls .
The auctions sometimes got bids in the thousands , tens of thousands , or millions of dollars ; eBay tended to look askance at such hijinks , and shut down the sales as quickly as it could .
But those auctions differed from Heinrich ’s offering in at least two crucial ways :
The items in question were usually illegal or impossible to sell , and “ bids ” were clearly pranks that eBay would never have enforced .
Heinrich ’s app. on the other hand , is real and seemingly clearly explained , and the App Store presumably automatically charges your credit card once you agree to buy it .
Wonder if anyone who is n’t rich has been silly and / or bold enough to make the purchase ?
( Via Daring Fireball ’s John Gruber on Twitter . )
Further thought :
Other than me , most of the people who are blogging about this seem to think it ’s an obnoxious travesty , and possibly insulting to iPhone developers who are trying to sell real apps .
The non-jokester in me see the point .
Betcha it gets pulled down –if nothing else , the hassle of dealing with anyone who “ accidentally ” buys it is n’t worth the pain for Apple … and neither is the distraction from all the useful , worth - the - money iPhone apps out there .
Further further thought @ 8:19 pm : Hey , let ’s conduct a poll !
Further further thought @ 4:26 pm on 8/6 : I Am Rich is now missing from the App Store .
Big surprise !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors reported a huge second - quarter net loss Friday of $ 15.5 billion , after restructuring and other charges , as the automaker 's run of troubles continued .
The automaker lost $ 27.33 per share in the quarter , compared to a profit of $ 784 million , or $ 1.37 per share , a year earlier .
Even factoring out those charges , GM posted a stunning $ 6.3 billion loss on operations .
That works out to $ 11.21 per share , far above the $ 2.62 - a- share loss projected by Thomson Reuters .
Last year , the company earned $ 1.3 billion on that basis , or $ 2.29 per share , as it attempted to turn around years of losses .
GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) stock fell 8 % in NYSE trading .
The automaker posted revenue of $ 37.7 billion from auto operations , down from $ 45.8 billion a year ago .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting revenue of $ 44.6 billion .
" We knew what was coming with these results , and we knew what we needed to do to respond and react " said a GM executive on a conference call .
The lost revenue was likely due to a significant decline in vehicle sales .
GM sold nearly 5 % fewer vehicles this quarter than it did over the same time last year .
U.S. sales took the biggest hit , falling 21 % , although foreign sales rose 7 % .
In a press release , GM said its results were impacted by $ 9.1 billion of predominantly non-cash special items .
It named strikes , labor cutbacks , and actions to reduce vehicle output as main reasons for the loss .
" As our recent product , capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate , we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the U.S. economy and auto market , and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our U.S. operations , " GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement .
" We have the right plan for GM , driven by great products , building strong brands , fuel - economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities , " he added .
GM has now lost money in four of the last five quarters .
The auto industry as a whole has struggled recently as high gas prices and a weak economy have kept customers at home .
Last week , Ford Motor Co. ( F , Fortune 500 ) reported the largest quarterly loss in its 105 - year history .
On Thursday , Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services cut its ratings for all three domestic automakers further into junk status .
GM is attempting to get back on its feet after striking key wage and healthcare deals with its labor force last fall .
But critics have said the recent steps GM has taken to right itself - which included cutting 6,100 jobs and reducing its vehicle output by 117,000 - are not bold enough .
What the company really needs to do , they say , is eliminate dealerships , vehicle lines and even whole brands .
GM , long the world 's largest automaker , was outsold by Toyota in the first six months of this year , and experts say the Japanese automaker could overtake GM in worldwide sales for all of 2008 .
For years , Microchip PIC microcontrollers dominated ; PIC16F84 hacks and projects are everywhere .
The 8 - bit 16 F and 18 F lines are supported by several coding environments and easy - to - build serial port programmers .
Microchip ’s 16 - bit PIC24 F is cheaper , faster , and easier to work with , but largely absent from hacks and projects .
We recently used a Microchip PIC24 F microcontroller in a mini web server project , but did n’t find many introductory references to link to .
In this article we ’ll cover some PIC 24 F basics : support circuitry and programming options .
We ’ll also talk about our favorite features , and how we figured them out .
Our next article will outline a web server on a business card based on the PIC 24 F .
The basic circuit
This is the basic support circuit ( full size .png ) for a PIC 24FJ64GA002 .
Some helpful documents are the code examples , application notes , individual datasheets , and 24 F family manual .
Main system power supply
Peripherals and pins on the 24 F PICs operate between 2.0 and 3.8volts .
This is a big advantage over older PICs because the 24 F can directly interface modern 3.3 volt components like SD memory cards .
Some 16 F and 18 F PICs will run at 3.3 volts , but usually at drastically reduced speeds .
As always , put a 0.1 uF capacitor between each power pin and ground to decouple the chip from the power supply ( C1 , C2 ) .
Core power supply
The processor core requires a separate 2.5 volt supply .
A built - in 2.5 volt regulator can be enabled by connecting the DISVREG pin to ground , and placing a 10uF capacitor between the Vcap / VDDCORE pin and ground ( C3 ) .
We ’ve not experienced any problems using a 10 uF low ESR electrolytic capacitor , but in the future we ’ll use a tantalum capacitor as specified in the datasheet .
Speed and crystal
PIC 24Fs have a max clock speed of 32MHz , and complete one operation every 2 clock cycles for a top speed of 16 million instructions per second ( MIPS ) .
Most 24Fs have an internal 8MHz oscillator , but you can also use an external crystal for a more precise timebase .
An internal phase lock loop ( PLL ) can multiply any clock signal by four .
We used a common option : 8MHz internal oscillator multiplied by four ( 32MHz ) , with full IO functions on the external oscillator pins .
The clock mode is set with CONFIG2 .
Use these settings to run a PIC 24 F at 32MHz using the internal oscillator and PLL :
// Internal FRC OSC with 4x PLL @ 32MHz // from p24FJ64GA002.h : //FNOSC_FRCPLL
- internal oscillator //OSCIOFNC_ON
- enable the oscillator pins as IO // POSCMOD_NONE - Primary ( external ) oscillator disabled _CONFIG2 ( FNOSC_FRCPLL & OSCIOFNC_ON &POSCMOD_NONE )
Programming connections
Microchip ’s standard 5 wire in circuit serial programming ( ICSP ) connection is used to program the 24 F .
ICSP consists of a clock line ( PGC ) , bi-directional data line ( PGD ) , master clear and reset ( MCLR ) , and connections to power ( V+ ) and ground ( GND ) .
The MCLR function resets the chip when voltage levels are too low to operate .
Enable it with a 2000 ( 2 K ) ohm resistor ( R12 ) from the system power supply to the MCLR pin .
Optionally , add a button ( S1 ) from MCLR to ground for a manual reset switch .
The programmer also connects to the MCLR pin to reset the PIC and control programming modes .
PIC 24Fs have several sets of programming pins labeled PGDx and PGCx .
Choose the set most convenient for your design .
One catch : you ca n’t use the clock pin of one set and the data pin of another , you have to use the same pair .
The primary pin pair used for debugging is programmed in CONFIG1 with the ICS_PGX option .
This only effects debugging ; programming is still possible from any pin pair .
_CONFIG1 ( ICS_PGx3 )
Coding and Programming
Unfortunately , the 24 F ca n’t be programmed with the hobbyist - favorite serial port programmers .
These are usually 5volt programmers that place 13 volts on the MCLR pin .
24 F PICs are rated for 3.8volts maximum on the MCLR and programming pins , old serial port programmers will destroy them .
The ICD2 is Microchip ’s cheapest programmer for the full 24 F line .
An education discount is available if you have a .edu email .
There are numerous clones too , most notable is the Olimex PIC - ICD2 clone , also sold by Sparkfun .
We ’ve never used it , but it ’s supposed to be an exact clone .
You can also try your hand at building a DIY ICD2 clone , we ’ve had luck with the PiCS Rev B in the past .
You ’ll probably need to build an adapter to use a homebrew ICD2 with a PIC 24 F .
MPLAB is a free development environment for coding , compiling , and debugging all PIC microcontrollers .
We like to program in C , so we downloaded the free , evaluation / student edition of the Microchip C30 compiler that integrates into MPLAB .
HI - TECH ’s C compiler is a fairly popular alternative if you ’re not thrilled about MPLAB .
Microchip ’s low - voltage 18 FxxJ line , such as the Ethernet enabled 18F97J60 , can only be programmed a few hundred times .
That ’s fine for production , but really unfriendly to a developer .
We ’re exceedingly happy to note that the 24 F can be programmed at least 10,000 times .
New features and improvements
We made a list of the things we liked best about the PIC 24 F after using it in a project .
Not all of them are new , sometimes little improvements make designs much simpler .
8 - bit vs 16 - bit
C programmers wo n’t notice many differences between 8 - bit and 16 - bit architectures .
Native 16 - bit math operations will save you a few cycles if you do 16 - bit integer math .
Memory and registers are 16 - bits long , meaning the default 16 - bit variable type counts to 65,536 , rather than 255 .
Peripheral pin select
Peripheral pin select ( PPS ) is our favorite feature on the PIC 24 F .
The digital peripherals SPI , UARTs , timers , etc can be connected to almost any pin on the chip .
PCB designs get really creative because the pin arrangement on a microcontroller rarely matches that on the peripheral you ’re interfacing .
Compare these two designs .
The design on the left uses looping , winding traces to connect a SD card without jumper wires .
On the right , we used PPS to assign pins in a way that lined up perfectly with the SD card .
We spent caffeine fueled nights routing the board on the left , but only hours on the other .
We ’ll find it difficult to ever work with a PIC 16 F or 18 F again because of the complete and total awesomeness of PPS .
Input and output pins are assigned differently : pins are assigned to inputs , outputs are assigned to pins .
A peripheral input , such as the “ serial data input ” ( SDI ) signal of an SPI interface , is set by putting a pin number in its register .
In the C30 compiler , SDI of SPI1 and SPI2 are assigned like this :
// Inputs //SDI1 B12/23/RP12 //SDI2
B1/5/RP1 RPINR20bits .
SDI1R = 12 ; //SDI1 = PORTB12 RPINR22bits .
SDI2R = 1 ; //SDI2 = PORTB1
Output functions are handled in the opposite way .
A group of registers represent the programmable pins ( RPORx ) .
Peripheral outputs are assigned to each pin .
Assign the SPI “ serial data output ” and “ clock output ” lines like this :
// Outputs //SDO1 B11/22/RP11 //CLK1
B10/21/RD10 RPOR5bits .RP10R = SCK1OUT_IO ; //RP10 = SCK1 RPOR5bits .
RP11R = SDO1_IO ; //RP11 = SDO1 // SDO2 B3/7/RP3 //CLK2
B2/6/RP2 RPOR1bits.RP2R = SCK2OUT_IO ; //RP2 = SCK2 RPOR1bits .
RP3R = SDO2_IO ; //RP3 = SDO2
Check the device datasheet and the IO with PPS datasheet ( PDF ) for a complete list of peripheral ( RPINRxx ) and pin ( RPORx ) registers .
Individually configurable pull - up / pull - down resistors
Pull - up and pull - down resistors hold inputs at a known level when there ’s no other signal .
Illustrated below on the left ( S1 ) , a pull - up resistor ( R1 ) normally holds the signal high ( 1 ) .
A button press pulls the signal to ground ( 0 ) .
Without a pull - up resistor , the value on the microcontroller pin will fluctuate wildly ( state undefined ) until a button press pulls it to ground ( 0 ) .
Internal pull - up resistors make it easier to route a button on a circuit board .
An internal resistor holds the signal high until the button pulls it low , saving a resistor and power supply trace ( S2 ) .
PIC 16Fs and 18 Fs sometimes have an all - or - nothing pull - up on 8 pins , but the 24 F adds individually configurable pull - up resistors .
See the IO datasheet ( PDF ) .
CRC hardware module
Cyclic redundancy check ( CRC ) values are used to verify the integrity of data .
Your PC calculated CRCs for the TCP packets that carried this page over the web .
The 24 F has a hardware CRC module that does tedious CRC calculation without processor involvement .
Check out the datasheet ( PDF ) and example code ( ZIP ) .
Real time clock and calender
Microchip added a hardware real time clock and calendar module ( RTCC ) to every 24 F .
It ’s always been easy to add an interrupt - based clock to a microcontroller , but this module takes care of everything without timing concerns .
The RTCC module requires a 32.768 khz watch crystal ( Q1 ) to be connected to the SOSCx pin pair .
Do n’t forget 2 suitable capacitors for your crystal , we used 27 pF ( C1,C2 ) .
There ’s a datasheet for the RTCC module ( PDF ) , and example code ( ZIP ) .
Package sizes
Microchip continues their tradition of offering products in a range of package sizes .
Low pin count parts are available in through - hole ( DIP ) and several surface mount sizes .
As with all manufacturers , though , the largest , coolest , chips are only produced in surface mount packages .
Microchip is a fan of 64 , 80 , and 100 pin thin quad flat packs ( TQFP ) , a square chip with an equal number of pins on all sides .
TQFP is n’t terribly difficult to solder , but the circuit boards can be a pain to make at home .
Conclusion
The past was dominated by 8 - bit PIC 16 F and 18 F - based microcontroller projects .
16 - bit PICs , however , have been largely neglected .
If you ’re already considering a PIC for your next project , check out the 24 F series .
The peripheral pin select feature alone is worth the switch — it simplifies circuit boards , reduces routing time , and saves board space .
We were able to fit an entire PIC 24 F web server on a business card using a home - etched PCB .
Our next article will introduce this simple server prototype .
The project archive ( ZIP ) contains the base schematic for the PIC24FJ64GA002 , and a custom 28 pin part we added to an existing PIC 24 F part library .
Both are for use with Cadsoft Eagle , a freeware version is available for most popular platforms .
The right ’s answer to Obama ’s “ Still ” campaign ad which ridicules , among other things , John McCain ’s inability to use a computer or send an e-mail message is that McCain ’s war injuries prevent him from using a keyboard .
Among those spouting this line are Andrew Malcolm at the Los Angeles Times , Karl Rove in an appearance on Fox News , and Jim Geraghty writing for National Review Online .
However , the claim that war injuries prevent McCain from using a computer are demonstrably false , as shown by the manual dexterity displayed in his appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman earlier this year :
Are those the fingers of a man whose war injuries prevent him from using a keyboard ?
Max sez ,
The Security Group at
the University of California in Santa Barbara has released the
video that shows the attacks carried out against the Sequoia
voting system .
I heard about the video when talking to some members of the
group , but it was never made available to the public before .
The video was
shot as part of the Top - To - Bottom Review organized by the California Secretary
of State .
Even though the review was carried our in July 2007 , the video has
been posted only now , more than a year after ( why ? ) .
The video shows an attack where a virus - like software spreads across the
voting system .
The coolest part of the video is the one that shows how the
" brainwashed " voting terminals can use different techniques to change the
votes even when a paper audit trail is used .
Pretty scary stuff .
The video is
proof that these types of attacks are indeed feasible and not just a
conspiracy theory .
Also , the part that shows how the " tamperproof " seals can be completely
bypassed is very funny ( and disturbing at the same time ) .
Regulation Technology
For many years , Fintech has been invisible from the scrutinizing eyes of governments .
But that is about to change as regulators are pushing steps to make the industry more transparent with the help of Regulation Technology .
Regulation Technology or RegTech is a compliance measure that manages regulatory processes within the financial industry using a mix of IT , AI , and Big Data .
On the outset of fintech , there has been a rise in money laundering , identity theft , and other types of cyberattacks .
Regtech is seeking to combat these by implementing tools that will automatically monitor online transactions in real time basis to mitigate irregularities that might arise .
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
Data Privacy and cybersecurity are two factors that contribute to why regulators are pushing for stringent compliance protocols in fintech .
Above all else , the sensitive consumer and corporate financial data are to be protected the most .
But as many entities get connected , the cyber threats in fintech become more vivid that hampers true financial innovation .
For this reason , fintech companies are now adopting the best practices in cybersecurity .
Many are now switching to cloud technology for an agile business model and swift banking process .
Using cloud technology and cloud computing , fintech companies are given an avenue to manage user data in a secure and trusted infrastructure .
ICO Frauds
We are no strangers to ICO frauds .
Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency , it is susceptible to frauds that can cost millions of dollars .
Time and time again , we hear news about cryptocurrency scams and the common reason why people fall for it is its quick return on investment .
Some scammers create intensive publicity to gain investments on ICOs that fraudsters already own .
Some people use ICO for money laundering , while others are using a pyramiding tactic to encourage more investors before they go untraced .
Due to the illicit activities involving cryptocurrency , some countries have already warned about joining ICOs if not banning it at all .
If you are interested in participating in ICOs , here ’s an ultimate cryptocurrency guide to getting you started .
Innovation and User Experience
User experience drives innovation and that is true in banking and the financial industry in general .
Now more than ever , traditional banks must be able to step up and harness the potential of technology in their business .
Even in the digital era , many people are still either unbanked or underbanked ; the same segment that has the highest share in the use of mobile devices .
This is where alternative financial providers find their opportunity .
The widespread use of mobile devices even in the most impoverished corner of the world has allowed neo - banks to flourish .
With user experience in mind , neo - banks and fintech startups have utilized mobile devices to bring financial services closer to people through mobile payment apps , P2P lending , and other innovative means .
People switching to banking alternatives is the greatest threat to incumbent institutions .
Unless they follow the new paradigm set by fintech , century - old entities will remain at the brink of obsolescence .
THE bicycle once seemed the environmentalist 's dream machine , a solution to air pollution , traffic jams and flabby muscles .
But that was before bicycle makers here in Marin County added gears to some old fat - tire Schwinns and launched the latest rage to roll out of California : the mountain bike , a machine capable of climbing trails and scaring hikers as it roars like a roller coaster in a cloud of dust .
With the number of leg - powered mountain bikes doubling every year , complaints by hikers and equestrians are rising .
In recent months , the bulky bikes - souped - up versions of the old heavy - framed models that were popular before the advent of the European 10 - speed - have been banned by Federal , state and local authorities from many trails in Marin County , in the Santa Monica Mountains south of San Francisco , on Santa Catalina Island near Los Angeles , in Boulder , Colo . , and elsewhere .
In other areas , the bikes have been restricted to fire roads and placed under speed limits of 5 to 15 miles an hour .
'' There 's been damage to property and annoyance to people hiking and horseback riding , '' said Fran Brigmann of Marin County 's Parks and Open Space Department .
Bikes also contribute to erosion .
The issue has torn environmental groups .
The Sierra Club , for example , finds itself divided between members who hate mountain bikes and those who own them .
According to Sally M. Reid , vice president , the club is revising its policy of classifying the bikes along with motorcycles as intruders that should be banned from public lands .
Instead , they have created a new category of nonmotorized vehicles , to be treated more leniently .

Due to a heavy filming schedule , lots of filming was done while the entire crew was on the road .
But because the bus was such a small set , there was no room for the crew .
As such in many scenes , they are actually in shot , hiding under clothes and other props .

Whose pipes ?
In 2005 , AT&T CEO Ed Whitacre famously told BusinessWeek , " What they [ Google , Vonage , and others ] would like to do is to use my pipes free .
But I ai n't going to let them do that …
Why should they be allowed to use my pipes ? "
The story of how the Internet is structured economically is not so much a story about net neutrality , but rather it 's a story about how ISPs actually do use AT&T 's pipes for free , and about why AT&T actually wants them to do so .
These inter-ISP sharing arrangements are known as " peering " or " transit , " and they are the two mechanisms that underlie the interconnection of networks that form the Internet .
In this article , I 'll to take a look at the economics of peering of transit in order to give you a better sense of how traffic flows from point A to point B on the Internet , and how it does so mostly without problems , despite the fact that the Internet is a patchwork quilt of networks run by companies , schools , and governments .
The basics
At the moment , the Internet consists of over 25,000 Autonomous Systems ( AS ) .
An Autonomous System can independently decide who to exchange traffic with on the ' Net , and it is n't dependent upon a third party for access .
Networks of Internet service providers , hosting providers , telecommunications monopolists , multinationals , schools , hospitals and even individuals can be Autonomous Systems ; all you need is a single " AS number " and a block of provider independent IP - numbers .
These can be had from a regional Internet registry ( like RIPE , ARIN , APNIC , LACNIC and AFRINIC ) .
Though one network may be larger or smaller , technically and economically they have equal possibilities .
( Most organizations and individuals do not interconnect autonomously to other networks , but connect via an ISP .
One could say that an end - user is " buying transit " from his ISP . )
In order to get traffic from one end - user to another end -user , these networks need to have an interconnection mechanism .
These interconnections can be either direct between two networks or indirect via one or more other networks that agree to transport the traffic .
A <--> B ( direct )
A <-->C<-->D<-->…<-->B ( indirect )
Most network connections are indirect , since it is nearly impossible to interconnect directly with all networks on the globe .
( The likes of FLAG and AT&T might come close , but even they can't claim global network coverage . )
In order to make it from one end of the world to another , the traffic will often be transferred through several indirect interconnections to reach the end -user .
The economic arrangements that allow networks to interconnect directly and indirectly are called " peering " and " transit " :
Peering : when two or more autonomous networks interconnect directly with each other to exchange traffic .
This is often done without charging for the interconnection or the traffic .
: when two or more autonomous networks interconnect directly with each other to exchange traffic .
This is often done without charging for the interconnection or the traffic .
Transit : when one autonomous network agrees to carry the traffic that flows between another autonomous network and all other networks .
Since no network connects directly to all other networks , a network that provides transit will deliver some of the traffic indirectly via one or more other transit networks .
A transit provider 's routers will announce to other networks that they can carry traffic to the network that has bought transit .
The transit provider receives a " transit fee " for the service .
The transit fee is based on a reservation made up - front for the number of Mbps .
Traffic from ( upstream ) and to ( downstream ) the network is included in the transit fee ; when you buy 10 M bps / month from a transit provider you get 10 up and 10 down .
The traffic can either be limited to the amount reserved , or the price can be calculated afterward ( often leaving the top five percent out of the calculation to correct for aberrations ) .
Going over a reservation may lead to a penalty .
Figure 1 : peering vs. transit
These mechanisms are pictured schematically in the diagrams above .
Diagram I shows peering between two networks .
Diagram II shows transit over two networks .
Diagram III shows transit over three networks where there is a peering agreement between networks C and D , and A and B both pay for transit .
Diagram IV shows how A pays to C , and B and C pay to D for transit .

ACCORDING to economic textbooks , the currencies of economies with large current - account deficits should depreciate relative to those of countries with surpluses .
This will stimulate their exports and curb imports , thereby helping to slim the trade gaps .
America has the world 's biggest current - account deficit and the dollar has dutifully been falling since 2002 .
Oddly , however , the currencies of many other countries with large deficits had enjoyed big gains until recently .
Now , at last , currency markets have started to see sense .
Britain , Australia , New Zealand and Iceland all have large current - account deficits ( along with many other American - style excesses , such as housing and credit booms ) .
Yet over several years until mid-2007 , their currencies perversely rose relative to those of economies , such as Japan and Switzerland , with big surpluses .
For example , despite a current - account surplus of 4.9 % of GDP last year , one of the biggest of any developed economy , Japan 's trade - weighted exchange rate sank by 13 % from the end of 2002 to mid-2007 .
New Zealand , where the deficit reached 8 % of GDP ( bigger than America 's deficit of 6 % of GDP at its peak ) , saw its currency gain 28 % over the same period .
This paradox is the result of the “ carry trade ” , a popular currency strategy that partly explains why trade flows are now dwarfed by cross - border capital flows .
In a world of low interest rates , international investors were hungry for yield , and so piled into currencies that offered higher interest rates , namely those of Britain , Australia , New Zealand and Iceland , as well as many emerging markets .
Those higher interest rates paid by countries with large external deficits were supposed to compensate investors for the risk of currency depreciation .
But as investors borrowed in low - interest currencies , such as the yen , to invest in high - yielding ones , this made the latter currencies stronger .
That , in turn , prolonged global imbalances by making it easier for profligate countries to finance their current - account deficits .
But since the eruption of global financial turmoil last year and the dwindling appetite for risk , carry trades have started to unwind and it has become harder to finance deficits .
As a result , current - account imbalances are once again exerting a powerful influence over currencies .
The chart shows that the weakest currencies this year have been in countries with deficits , from Britain to South Africa .
In contrast , the yen and the Swiss franc have perked up .
The same chart a year or so ago would have shown virtually the opposite relationship .
Increased concern about current - account deficits is also causing investors to discriminate much more between emerging markets .
A popular argument in recent years has been that developing economies are less risky because , unlike a decade ago , they are no longer dependent on foreign capital .
It is true that emerging economies are forecast to have a combined current - account surplus of more than $ 800 billion this year , but this is more than accounted for by China , Russia and the Gulf oil exporters .
In fact over half of the 25 biggest emerging economies now have deficits .
South Korea is running a deficit after a decade of surpluses .
Brazil has also moved back into the red , despite record high prices for its commodity exports .
Others such as India , South Africa and Turkey have had external deficits for many years .
Sticking to our “ mercantilist ” guns
In an article last November , The Economist ranked 15 of the biggest emerging economies according to their economic riskiness .
Based on the size of external and budget deficits , inflation rates and the pace of growth in bank lending , India , Turkey and Hungary were deemed to be most vulnerable .
The ranking attracted a lot of flak in India .
An article in the Times of India accused The Economist of “ mercantilist thinking at its worst ” by treating a current - account surplus as good , a deficit bad .
Agreed , a current - account deficit is not necessarily bad : an economy may be borrowing from abroad to finance investment that will lift future growth .
Nevertheless , a large deficit does mean that an economy and its currency may struggle if foreign - capital inflows suddenly dry up .
And this is what has happened .
This year foreign capital has gone into reverse at the same time as India 's current - account deficit has widened sharply .
Sharmila Whelan , an economist at CLSA , a brokerage firm , forecasts that India 's current - account deficit will rise to almost 4 % of GDP in the current fiscal year , and to 5.5 % next year .
Not only is the trade deficit soaring , largely as a result of higher oil prices ; the overseas earnings of Indian IT services companies ( two - fifths of which come from the financial sector ) are likely to shrink this year .
The nature of the capital inflows financing a deficit also matters .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) is less volatile than speculative capital inflows .
If we assume that net FDI continues at last year 's pace , then it would more than finance the expected current - account deficits in Brazil and Mexico this year .
In contrast , net FDI might finance less than one - third of India 's deficit and only one - sixth of South Africa 's , implying that their currencies are more at risk .
The rupee has fallen by almost 10 % against the dollar since late last year .
Ms Whelan forecasts that it will drop by another 9 % by March 2009 .
Central banks in the developing world are now worried that falling currencies will exacerbate inflationary pressures .
A year ago most emerging economies were intervening heavily to hold their currencies down ; now many in Asia , including India , South Korea , Vietnam and Thailand , are having to sell dollars to prop their exchange rates up .
The prime exception is China , where hot money continues to pour in and where the current account has a massive surplus .
The longer that international investors remain risk - averse , the more attention they are likely to pay to current - account imbalances .
A few currencies seem to have been overlooked : those of Australia , Poland and Hungary have so far held up surprisingly well , despite their gaping external deficits .
All three now look overvalued .
They could be the next dominoes to fall .

It foreshadows McCain ’s ethical collapse , his coziness to fat cats , and his economic non-policy .
Time for the Obama campaign or some independent groups to raise John McCain ’s sordid role in the Keating Five scandal .
And by “ raise ” I mean repeat over and over and over again because it is a messaging twofer .
First , the Keating Five scandal provides a point of origin and touchstone for the dishonest and dishonorable way McCain is running his campaign , which has finally become a central point of attack for the Obama campaign .
Second , the Savings & Loan scandal also goes to the heart of McCain ’s anti-regulation , surround yourself with Washington lobbyists , pass - the - buck - to - a- commission approach to our current economic and financial crisis , another point of attack for the Obama campaign .
We have seen again and again in modern U.S. politics that to create a compelling narrative of any candidate ’s major character flaws , his opponents or the media need to find early hints of that flaw , what I call the quest for foreshadowing ( see below ) .
That was why the Swiftboat ads were so devastating to Kerry , as they all - too - successfully offered an alternative negative narrative to the actual story of Kerry ’s heroic military history .
That was the whole reason Gore ’s opponents worked so hard to keep bringing up past examples of supposed lies and exaggeration , like the myth that he claimed to have invented the Internet , so that they could leap on any seeming exaggeration or misstatement during the 2000 campaign and use it as evidence he was a serial exaggerator or liar .
As for Keating Five , journalist David Sirota on The Rachel Maddow show Tuesday night ( here ) is the first person I ’ve heard frame this issue the right way ( starting at about 2:00 ) :
SIROTA : [ McCain is ] an ideological conservative who is against regulation .
So for him to now run out there and say that he ’s suddenly the guy who ’s going to regulate the economy and regulate Wall Street is beyond absurd .
And I think we have to look at his history .
Let ’s remember that McCain ’s formative economic experience was in the last crisis , the S&L crisis where he was one of the Keating Five .
In that scandal he was somebody who used his Senate position to effectively intervene and press regulators to not get involved and regulate that scandal .
MADDOW : Well , is there a risk as this economic debacle that we are involved in right now starts to resemble the S&L scandal that the Keating Five issue is actually going to be on the table ?
Obama and Biden have stayed away from it thus far .
Some outside groups have touched on it in a very minor way but I think 99 out of a 100 Americans would have no idea what the Keating Five was or what John McCain ’s role was in it .
SIROTA : … I think older Americans might remember the S&L scandal .
I think explaining that McCain was involved in that scandal , used his office in that scandal again to press regulators to get out of that scandal , to not essentially regulate the financial industry .
It ’s completely relevant .
It ’s completely important because it ’s the last example that we have , it ’s actually the only example that we have , of what John McCain would do with a public office with a crisis like this .
Precisely .
McCain sided with his fat cat contributors back then , and he ’s doing it again today .
The other crucial point to hammer home is that McCain acted unethically back then and he is acting unethically today with his dishonest and dishonorable campaign .
Obama is finally starting to make a good case about McCain ’s dishonor and his corruption — and I was very glad to see Senator Claire McCaskill repeat and expand upon the dishonor and dishonesty message on Maddow Tuesday night .
But what the public needs to see to really absorb this message is the back story .
They think McCain has a long history of being a high - integrity maverick , which makes it hard to sell the notion that he is suddenly changed .
But McCain has no such history .
Quite the reverse .
If you read the whole sordid story here ( excerpted below ) , you ’ll see there is no reason for the Obama campaign to steer clear of Keating .
Obama has already been directly attacked for his connection with Chicago businessman and political fund raiser , Tony Rezko — and he no doubt will be again .
But McCain was , as we ’ll see , infinitely closer to then Arizona businessman and political fund raiser , Charles Keating — and McCain , unlike Obama , actually did something wrong .
Keating was the chair of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine , California , and he “ ultimately served five years in prison for his corrupt mismanagement of Lincoln . ”
Lincoln had become “ burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness , and by early 1986 , its investment practices were being investigated and audited ” by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ( FHLBB ) over whether it had violated rules limiting certain kinds of risky , direct investments .
[ Hmm .
That certainly sounds familiar . ]
“ Lincoln had directed FDIC - insured accounts into commercial real estate ventures .
By the end of 1986 , the FHLBB had found that Lincoln had $ 135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated direct investments limit by $ 600 million . ”
The core allegation of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $ 1.3 million to various U.S. Senators , and he called on those Senators to help him resist regulators .
The regulators backed off , to later disastrous consequences .
In 1991 , the Senate Ethics Committee found that McCain had exercised “ poor judgment ” for meeting with federal regulators on Keating ’s behalf .
Others members of the Keating Five were found to have acted improperly .
Many independent observers thought all five got off lightly , especially McCain , who had far closer ties to Keating than the others :
Fred Wertheimer , president of Common Cause , which had initially demanded the investigation , thought the treatment of the senators far too lenient , and said , “ The U.S. Senate remains on the auction block to the Charles Keatings of the world . ”
Joan Claybrook , president of Public Citizen , called it a “ whitewash . ” Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a classic case of the government trying to investigate itself , labelling the Senate Ethics Committee “ shameless ” for having “ let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap . ” Margaret Carlson of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War , minimizing its news impact .
One of the San Francisco bank regulators felt that McCain had gotten off too lightly , saying that Keating ’s business involvement with Cindy McCain was an obvious conflict of interest .
McCain ’s incredibly close ties with Keating foreshadow his incredibly close ties with lobbyists today , especially with the oil industry , whose polluting policies McCain flip - flopped to embrace this year and whose lobbyists McCain now has running his campaign .
As the Washington Post put it in July , “ [ Oil ] Industry Gushed Money [ to McCain ] After Reversal on Drilling , ” which found that “ Oil and gas industry executives and employees donated $ 1.1 million to McCain ” in June — three - quarters of which came after his June 16 speech in which he “ made a high - profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling . ”
Now consider just how cozy Keating was to McCain :
McCain was the closest socially to Keating of the five senators … .
Between 1982 and 1987 , McCain had received $ 112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates .
In addition , McCain ’s wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley had invested $ 359,100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986 , a year before McCain met with the regulators .
McCain , his family , and their baby - sitter had made nine trips at Keating ’s expense , sometimes aboard Keating ’s jet .
Three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating ’s opulent Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay .
McCain did not pay Keating ( in the amount of $ 13,433 ) for some of the trips until years after they were taken , when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln .
So McCain ’s unethical behavior today in his campaign , his cozy relationship with lobbyists and industry fat cats whose agenda he pushes , is nothing new .
The Obama campaign should be running an ad on this , and surrogates should be talking about it .
And if they wo n’t , then independent groups must .
It is a crucial back story that undercuts McCain ’s entire image as an ethical reformer who can clean up Washington .
The Keating Five story foreshadows everything McCain has become .
And foreshadowing is a central component of successful political messaging .
The reason foreshadowing works , and the reason we see so much of it in popular culture and political coverage , is that we believe people ’s individual lives have a pattern–a circularity , a consistency .
We see that repetition ourselves , in our own lives –we see the people around us making the same decisions , the same mistakes , over and over again , and , if we achieve some wisdom and self - awareness in our own lives , we realize we repeat ourselves , too .
As one example , in Getting the Love You Want , one of the basic texts for couples ’ therapists , Harville Hendricks explains that perhaps the single most reliable indicator for why someone falls in love with you is that your negative qualities match those of their opposite sex parent or caregiver .
Thus do we tend to relive the same story as our parents .
Consider an example well - known to social scientists –the “ Linda - the - bank - teller problem . ”
Two researchers gave students the following description of a hypothetical person :
Linda is 31 years old , single , outspoken , and very bright .
She majored in philosophy .
As a student , she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice , and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
They then had the students rank several statements about Linda on a 1 - to - 8 scale with 1 being the least probable and 8 being the most probable .
Two of the 8 statements were as follows :
Linda is a bank teller .
( T )
Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement .
( T&F )
From a purely logical or statistical perspective , statement T must be more probable than statement T&F , since the latter statement presupposes the former is true .
And yet when either graduate and medical students with statistical training or Ph.D. candidates in Stanford Business School ’s Decision Science Program were given this question , more than four - fifths in each group ranked T&F as more probable than T .
They thought it was more likely that Linda was a bank teller and a feminist than just a bank teller alone .
This result caused a big stir among social scientists , but should not be that surprising to us .
We think in terms of a whole person , and we try to scratch out a consistent story from whatever facts we get .
The original description does n’t match Linda - the - bank - teller that well , but makes more sense for Linda - the - feminist - bank - teller .
Our thinking processes are not purely logical , especially when we are judging other people .
As one student remarked after the statistical mistake was pointed out to them , “ I thought you only asked for my opinion . ”
The Jesuits have a maxim , “ Give me the child until he is seven , and I will show you the man . ”
Director Michael
Apted built an entire series of movies around this idea , that the child foreshadows the man ( or woman ) .
He started with Seven Up , the brilliant 1964 film that began to track the lives of 14 British youngsters , followed by films that revisit them every seven years , the most recent being49 Up .
The films show that even seven - year - olds can demonstrate a prophetic view of how their lives will unfold , and that there is indeed much of the child in the adult and vice versa .
Politicians and the media believe that the public believes in foreshadowing .
Why else do so many politicians spend so much time telling their story , crafting a story of humble beginnings ?
Why do so many journalists spend so much time retelling the politicians ’ stories ?
Why do so many journalists spend so much time digging up specks of dirt from the distant past , looking for an event or a symbol that casts a shadow over - or perhaps eclipses entirely - a politicians ’ entire career ?
And since the media is increasingly focused on personalities and entertainment , on storytelling and drama , the pressure to find ( or invent ) foreshadowing will only grow more intense .
The media bards want an epic song to sing , and the best politicians want to write the lyrics .
To repeat a story President Bush told from an October 30 , 2004 campaign speech :
“ Sometimes I ’m a little too blunt - I get that from my mother .
[ Huge Cheers ]
Sometimes I mangle the English language - I get that from my dad .
[ Laughter and Cheers ] . ”
At a Social Security rally with her son in March 2005 , Barbara Bush shared with the audience the story of a stubborn child , concluding , “ So , now you can see where the President ’s tenaciousness comes from — which people also seem to admire so much .
It ’s what you want in a president ; it ’s not what you want in a six - year - old . ”
Give me the child until he is six , and I will show you the president .
And even in this case , we have the ironic transformation , whereby a supposedly positive character trait identified early on , tenaciousness , has in fact become perhaps Bush ’s defining character flaw .
To sum up , foreshadowing works in life for the same reason it works in art : People like straightforward stories and coherent characters .
They like a beginning , middle , and end that somehow connect .
If the golden rule of speechmaking is “ Tell ’em what what you ’re going to tell ’em ; then tell ’em ; then tell ’em what you told ’em , ” then the golden rule of political storytelling is , “ Tell them where you came from , then tell them who you are , then tell them what you ’re going to do ” — but make certain that it ’s all part of the same story and the same extended metaphor .
McCain acted unethically back then , and he ’s acting unethically now .
He was too cozy with corporate fat cats back then , and he is too cozy with corporate fat cats now .
McCain pushed for less regulatory oversight of the financial industry back then — and that has been his history ever since .
The best messages , the truest messages , write themselves .
If you ’re not attacking , you ’re losing .

For many people , it can be difficult to find the personal time to join a gym , in this updated and expanded article we take a look at the primary market manufactured treadmills the SOLE F85 treadmill and the SOLE F80 treadmill from sole fitness ( updated for 2017 / 2018 ) .
When we first published this post way - back in 2015 it was all about the SOLE F85 .
Since then a few things has happened .
Sole Fitness has released a new and updated design ( in 2016 ) .
They have also released more models .
The SOLE F80 treadmill is now a popular choice and a interesting alternative to the it ’s bigger sibling the F85 .
And , that ’s exactly why we have chosen to expand this article with additional facts ( and a easy to understand comparison ) about he SOLE F80 treadmill too .
Between obligations at home and work , and taking the time that one may need to relax , many struggle with effective weight loss .
Fortunately , however , there are numerous solutions available in the forms of home gyms and exercising equipment .
One of the latest and most advanced articles of exercising equipment to be developed by the SOLE company is the F85 SOLE Treadmill .
This particular Sole Fitness treadmill model is designed with numerous innovations that can give people the edge that they need to get started with healthy and effective weight loss .
The overall design is basic and easy to use , while still being durable enough to provide owners with reliable functionality for years to come .
These two treadmills comes with a new design made available in 2016 .
We have updated our pictures to let you judge for yourself if you like the newer design better .
SOLE F85 – Easy to Use Features
The SOLE F85 , like the SOLE F80 , treadmill for indoor workouts was commended for the wide variety of easy to use features that it included in its design .
Individuals will have the opportunity to adjust their level of incline and speed quickly , at their own pace .
A comprehensive display screen works in conjunction with the buttons themselves and make it easy for the user to control the intensity level of their workout .
The console screen itself is a large and vibrant blue screen that contains helpful readouts to help users get more out of their exercising experience .
Individuals will be able to keep track of numerous pieces of relevant information , including their heart rate , pace , speed , and calories burned after a certain amount of time on the device .
The SOLE F85 comes with a detailed 10 inch display ( commercial grade TFT ) , the SOLE F80 on the other hand comes with a slightly smaller 9 inch display ( a liquid - crystal display ( LCD ) flat - panel display ) .
SOLE F80 – Quiet and Durable Treadmill Design
The SOLE F80 treadmill is now marketed with a more intuitive and silent design in mind .
The SOLE F80 has been described as unique in that it can provide users with all of the comfort of a standard deck , but with the addition of a quieter workout as well ( here ) .
Using the machine produces upwards of forty percent less sound , while putting less strain on the motor itself as well .
Reviewers also found that the precise welding on the device ’s frames increased its handling and durability , allowing for a much more reliable experience , even when handled by multiple users .
The treadmill ’s construction also includes some of the most powerful motors and chassis that may be purchased in the training class .
The framework and inclines are designed to support the inclusion of the high quality motors , which feature larger diameters and balanced flywheels to allow for a vibration free surface .
The inclusion of the flywheels themselves allow the motor to operate at a cooler frequency , which extends the life of the motor .
The use of heavier flywheels also establishes a much smoother range of motion .
This allows the treadmill to create a more realistic walking movement , which many users have reported enhanced the quality of their workout .
The SOLE F80 treadmill , even though slightly less expensive , comes with a high build quality .
High Quality Belts and Rollers
In addition to all of the other sturdy and reliable parts included in the construction of the SOLE F80 and the SOLE F85 Treadmills , these devices makes use of durable rollers ( check out the pictures ) .
The rollers used in the machine measure approximately two and three quarters and are sealed with a powerful bearing design , with copper wires to help reduce static as they are used in the device .
Utilizing larger rollers rollers ensures that a higher quality of contact surface is established against the belt , which helps extend both the life of the roller and the belt .
This also establishes a much quieter range of motion for the user .
The belts used are all two ply with four woven layers .
While such belts are featured on this treadmill , the company has said that they used this variety of belts on all of their devices .
The two rubber layers that sandwich the middle layer of PVC with a durable nylon backing ensures that the belts move smoothly over the rollers and deck .
All of the materials work with one another , preventing the other parts of the device from working with excess strain .
The SOLE F85 treadmill is a fold - able treadmill , but the construction is very sturdy , so we do n’t anticipate any problems there .
The SOLE F80 & SOLE F85 Message Boards
While all of these features come together to provide a comfortable exercising experience for the customer , the group has also put in the effort to establish a comfortable environment outside of the customer ’s home , on the internet .
SOLE Fitness offers message boards that are dedicated to different models and devices .
This allows individuals to have the chance to work with both other customers and dedicated staff members to troubleshoot any problems that they may experience with their treadmills , or share stories and experiences relating to the devices .
The message board also provides additional functionality in that they can be effortlessly synced with the treadmill itself .
They can help recap the entire workout after the user is finished with it , allowing them to track their progress and see what types of benefits they are enjoying with the treadmill .
As always , send us your news stories , you can find our contact information here .
This function was designed to help users establish a much more intensive exercising experience that allows them to find their level of comfort with their new treadmills , regardless of if they choose the less expensive SOLE F80 treadmill , or the more expensive SOLE F85 treadmill .
Explosive News : Democrats ' Collaboration at Republican National Convention Exposed .
Secret meetings authorized excessive use of force .
We know the stories of police abuse , mass arrests , targeting journalists , street medics , use of rubber bullets , plastic bullets , wooden baton rounds , mace , tear gas , tasering and other differently lethal methods of crowd control in St Paul and Minneapolis this week .
What is not known is how the local Democratic Party and other so called progressive elected officials collaborated with authorities in the past weeks and months before the RNC Convention in St Paul , giving them legal authority for their excesses and abuses of power .
This is your Independent Journalista's on - the - ground account of what happened and how local elected officials collaborated with the authorities and again abandoned their Oath to Protect and Defend the Constitution from All Enemies , Foreign and Domestic .
This is the news that you will not hear from the corporate media , Air America , the Nation magazine or other so called progressive , alternative media outlets .
This is true , muckraking journalism that honestly speaks truth to power , no matter how uncomfortable it makes some folks .
Now , before we get to the facts surrounding how our elected officials betrayed us and the Bill of Rights , a truth must be stated .
No matter what the local City Councils of St Paul and Minneapolis did , the authorities would have done what they did .
This story is not about that .
It is instead about how the local government knowingly collaborated with them , with no input from citizens and finally passed a Resolution granting them legal authority to use rubber and plastic bullets , wooden baton rounds , tasers and chemical weapons that were deployed against peaceful protesters , journalists and street medics treating the victims of their brutality in a secret meeting with no public allowed .
In the months before the Republicans came to town , there had been a flurry of activity .
Local activists were keeping a close eye on their local elected officials .
Initially , there had been a so called Free Speech Committee set up , supposedly to look at how authorities could allow free speech during the RNC and keep order .
However , local activists immediately developed some serious concerns .
We found out that the Free Speech Committee did not allow any members of the public to add our input .
Only City Council members on the committee and lawyers were allowed to speak .
There was no free speech allowed at the misnamed Free Speech Committee .
Nonetheless , activists followed the Committee 's actions closely and were present during each meeting .
The City Council of Minneapolis is almost 100 % Democratic .
In fact the only real opposition in Minneapolis is the Green Party which currently has one Green on the City Council , Cam Gordon , who was a small light in a very dark room .
But , we were to discover , even that light was to be extinguished .
The so called Free Speech Committee would change the time and locations of its meetings , in an obvious attempt of loosing the local activists who were closely following their intents and actions .
During this time , Councilman Gordon kept the local activist community appraised of when and where these meetings were being held , including last minute changes .
There was much talk of using the Washington Model of crowd control versus other Models .
The Washington Model was touted as being a little less restrictive .
There was also discussion on protest groups being required to register themselves and even their members , to be " allowed " to protest .
At these times , Cam Gordon spoke eloquently on behalf of the community and in opposition to these repressive measures .
When he spoke , he drew cheers from the activists present .
We also waved our protest signs in agreement each time .
We would also boo when the head of the Committee , Paul Ostrow , would make an especially egregious remark .
That was the extent of public participation and free speech at the so called Free Speech Committee meetings .
This went on for moths at a time .
Then suddenly we found out that the Free Speech Committee had their last meeting , July 16th .
The meeting itself was unannounced , unlike the other meetings which at least had a pretense of openness and public inclusion .
At the next Minneapolis City Council meeting July 25th , the recommendation of the misnamed Free Speech Committee was announced .
The Free Speech Committee Resolution passed unanimously , even by our one small light , Councilman Cam Gordon .
The Minneapolis Police were given " legal " authority to shut down any protest or group of 25 people or greater .
They were also authorized to use rubber bullets , mace and the other array of non-lethal weapons on innocent , peaceful demonstrators , practicing our First Amendment Rights .
Also violated repeatedly was the Fourth Amendment Right protecting us citizens against illegal search and seizure .
Police violated the laws of assault and battery and destruction of evidence of their crimes , as evidenced by their targeting journalists .
All talk of the Washington Model was removed .
As this Resolution was passed by the large Democratic majority Minneapolis City Council july 25th , another protest broke out .
Local activists presented each member of the Minneapolis City Council , including Mayor RT Ryback with a Statement of Reprobation , condemning them for this betrayal of our most precious right to Free Speech , Assembly and Peaceful Petition of Our Government .
One of the main organizers , Michelle Gross of Communities United Against Police Brutality , presented the Statement of Reprobation to both Councilman Cam Gordon and the head of the Free Speech Committee , Councilman Paul Ostrow .
Another was handed to Mayor RT Ryback .
During this presentation , a young man , Jude Ortiz with Coldsnap Legal Collective , read aloud the charges against the Minneapolis City Council .
When he did so , he was bundled off the podium by Minneapolis Police and brought to the Hennepin County Jail .
He was later released uncharged .
All Minneapolis City Councils are taped and shown on local Public Access TV - all except for this one , which has never seen the light of day .
Clearly , the " progressive " City Council had something to hide .

China 's crude oil import up 11 % in first half
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2008-07-10 21:58
BEIJING -- China , the world 's second - largest energy consumer , imported 11 percent more crude oil in the first half of 2008 than in the year - earlier period .
Crude imports stood at 90.53 million tons , the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday .
The growth rate was down 0.2 percentage points from last year .
The imports were valued at 64.98 billion US dollars , up 85.8 percent , as world prices surged .
Import prices hit a record high of 849.10 US dollars per ton in June .
Angola , Saudi Arabia , and Iran were the top three oil suppliers .
China also imported 21.01 million tons of refined oil products in the first half , up 16.4 percent year - on - year .
Meanwhile , the country exported 2.37 million tons of crude and 7.88 million tons of refined products , up 30.6 percent and down 0.3 percent , respectively , from a year earlier .
General Electricis expected to be added to a list of financial stocks that can no longer be sold short , according to people familiar with the situation .
The Securities and Exchange Commission Friday temporarily banned short - selling on 799 financial stocks to boost investor confidence on Friday , one day after the UK Financial Services Authority took a similar step .
GE , the parent of CNBC and CNBC.com , makes about half its profit from its financial services unit , GE Capital .
Other companies with large financial services interests such as CIT also are petitioning the SEC to be added to the initial list of stocks released Friday morning .
The SEC ’s emergency order is in effect at this morning and will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. New York time on Oct. 2 , 2008 , the Commission said in a statement .
The order may be extended beyond 10 days if the SEC deems an extension necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors , but the order will not be extended for more than 30 calendar days in total duration , the agency said .
The measure ignited big rallies in financial stocks Friday that have been the target by sellers as the credit crisis worsened .
Professor Ron Appel , speaking at the 10th anniversary conference of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Berne , Switzerland , says they have completed the annotation of human proteins .
Where the Human Genome Project produced a dictionary , this new work is more like an encyclopedia because it looks at life as it is really organized in our body at the molecular level , which will speed up scientific work that aims to improve our quality of life , like how we can combat genetic - based diseases .
Professor Amos Bairoch , head of the SIB 's Swiss - Prot group said : " If human DNA is the script of life , proteins are its actors , its living embodiment . "
Proteins are the essence of life but when they become defective they can cause suffering and often early death .
Man 's knowledge of proteins such as insulin and haemoglobins is crucial to combating diseases such as cancer , Alzheimer 's , cystic fibrosis and haemophilia .
Professor Bairoch said , " The general public would understand some of the entries in our protein encyclopaedia .
Insulin , for instance , is a small protein that controls glucose levels in our blood .
The performance - booster EPO is the protein used illegally by some cyclists .
In the human body it takes many forms .
But we detect its use in sport because competitors use a manufactured form which is not natural . "
The new protein encyclopedia covers a major part of the work of thousands of health researchers around the word .
The data covers 20,325 human proteins .
The information could ultimately be used for developing exact treatments for individual patients based on an understanding of their specific protein set .
It can help improve our chances of defeating a variety of diseases , by enabling researchers to model the interaction between individual patients , diseases and drugs .
Progress on the Human Protein Initiative ( HPI ) project has been rapid .
Ten years ago , there was good data on less than 1,000 proteins .
Two years ago , there were good entries for 15,000 and now the collection is complete .
One of the remaining challenges is still to complete the same encyclopedia of proteins for other animals .
Professor Bairoch said , " More than 45,000 scientific papers were read .
We examined databases that were out there to get a picture of the knowledge which existed .
We had to go out and find the material . "
This new protein encyclopedia is published online and available free to users .
In printed form , it would correspond to 57 volumes of about 1,000 pages each .
The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics director Professor Ron Appel closed the press conference praising the collaboration between five universities and two institutes of technology across the length and breadth of Switzerland .
He said : " Their collective success shows what can be achieved when experts pool their knowledge and vision .
" The SIB is a pioneering institute .
More successes can be expected in future .
These will add to what is already an impressive track record in all the fields of bio- informatics technology research we work in . "
He also emphasised that without the support of the Swiss government and international partners , none of this would be possible , " so we owe a big thanks to them " , he added .
In addition , Professor Bairoch thanked the Swiss government , international funding agencies and all the scientists who contributed to their recent breakthrough .
He said , " ours is just one of the 25 SIB groups working at the frontiers of scientific knowledge for the benefit of mankind . "
Wondering how to organize files on your computer ?
Are the files on your computer starting to seem cluttered ?
If you use your computer often , especially for business purposes , it ’s important that you keep the files on it well - organized .
Organizing your files in a smart way can make necessary tasks easier to accomplish and will ensure that you never have trouble accessing the files that you need .
Luckily , we ’re here to guide you .
Below we ’ll give you 7 helpful tips you can use to organize files on your computer .
1. Have a Clear Game Plan
The first tip to remember when trying to organize the files on your computer is that you should start with a clear plan .
Decide on a filing system that works best for you and then try to stick to it with any new files that you create .
You may decide to sort files based primarily on the date , for example .
You may also want to sort your files based on the filetype or the purpose it ’s being used for whether that includes files related to school , work , or personal interests .
Taking your time to consider a few different file system options early on can be helpful , and if you stick to it , it can help ensure your files remain uncluttered as time goes on .
2. Avoid Common Clutter Zones
One of the best things to remember when keeping files organized is that there are a few common spots that you should generally try to keep clutter - free .
You should generally avoid storing files in the “ Downloads ” folder on your computer or on the desktop for long periods of time .
While you may want to keep files in a download folder momentarily , you should try to move files that you download into a more permanent spot very quickly .
Additionally , keeping too many files on the desktop is also problematic as doing so can add a lot of clutter to your system .
3. Make Use of Sub-Folders
The great thing about organizing files on a computer is that you can use as many subfolders as you want .
Using subfolders can be a big help when trying to keep things organized .
For example , you can have a main folder titled “ Photos ” that you use to store pictures that you ’ve taken .
Then , you can create sub - folders within that folder relating to specific dates , to a specific vacation you had , or to certain topics .
While you may not want to go overboard in your use of subfolders , using 2 - 3 levels of sub - folders when organizing your files can be helpful .
4. Create a Cleanup Schedule
If you ’re not careful when managing the files on your system , clutter can build up quickly .
Ideally , you should place a file into an appropriate folder as soon as you create it , download it , or move it onto your computer from an external disk .
At the very least , it ’s best to stick to a regular schedule of sorting your files and cleaning up your system .
For example , you may set a few minutes aside each Monday to sort your files .
During this time , you can ensure that there ’s nothing in your desktop or download folder that should n’t be there .
5. Delete Files You Don’t Need
If at any point when using your computer you happen to copy a file or create a file that you do n’t need , be sure that you do n’t leave it lying around .
Deleting these files can be helpful for keeping your computer organized .
It can also be helpful for ensuring that you do n’t run out of space on your hard drive .
While you should always be careful not to delete anything important , getting rid of duplicated or unnecessary files is an essential part of keeping your computer uncluttered and fully functional .
6. Choose Folder Names Wisely
While it may seem like a simple tip , it ’s ideal to make sure you ’re naming your folders in a logical way .
Folder names should always be clear and any files you add to it should be relevant to its title .
Folders should always have a name that lets you know what type of file you ’re likely to see in them right off the bat .
Naming folders based on the date , based on the topic , or based on a specific project or client are usually great options for keeping things as clear as possible .
7. Backup Your Files Regularly
The final thing you should remember when organizing your system is that you should take the time to back up your files regularly .
Backing up your files is very important , particularly if you use your computer for business - related duties each day .
You can back up your files in several ways , but in the modern age , it ’s easier to do than ever .
One option is to use a cloud - based file storage service to back up your files .
You may also want to back up your files using an external hard drive .
However , before backing up your system you may want to compress some of your files .
Be sure to learn how to compress PDF files and other important documents before getting started with the backup process .
Understanding How to Organize Files With These Tips
If you ’re wondering how to organize files in the best way , you need to consider implementing some of the tips and strategies above .
By planning carefully and taking the time to organize your system , your computer will become a more useful tool for you to use in your daily life .

Mr Kagan , an architect of American neo-conservatism , is being tipped as a possible Secretary of State should Mr McCain , the Republican nominee , win November 's presidential election .
He used an appearance at the Edinburgh Book Festival to criticise Mr McCain 's Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , saying the Illinois senator did not have a foreign policy .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is ending its program to supervise large independent investment banks now that the five participants have collapsed or reorganized .
The announcement Friday coincided with criticism by the SEC ’s inspector general of the agency for failing to properly supervise broker dealer risk assessments in a program run by the Division of Trading and Markets .
“ TM ’s ( trading and markets ) failure to carry out the purpose and goals of the Broker - Dealer Risk Assessment program hinders the Commission ’s ability to foresee or respond to weaknesses in the financial markets , ” said the inspector general ’s report .
Under the investment bank program , Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N , Lehman Brothers Holding Inc LEHMQ.PK , Bear Stearns , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N -- volunteered to be monitored for capital and liquidity levels .
Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N in an emergency sale engineered by U.S. officials , Lehman has filed for bankruptcy protection , Merrill is being taken over by Bank of America Corp BAC.N , and Goldman and Morgan Stanley have converted themselves into bank holding companies regulated by the Federal Reserve .
“ The last six months have made it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work , ” SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said in a statement .
In July , the SEC and the Federal Reserve formalized a deal to share information about banks , in a move expected to strengthen oversight of the financial markets that were still reeling from the demise of Bear Stearns .
Cox said the SEC will continue to work closely with the Fed , but will be focused “ even more clearly ” on the broker - dealer subsidiaries of the banking conglomerates .
The SEC said it will look closely at the inspector general ’s recommendations on the broker - dealer risk assessment program and will implement them .

An exhibitor at the 2008 Value Voters Summit - sponsored by the Family Research Council and counting among its speakers former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been selling seemingly racist anti-Obama waffles .
The product is pictured below .
Summit security would not allow photographs to be taken inside the exhibit hall .
" I asked the ' chef ' ... if he was at all concerned that this might be viewed as a white man putting a black man into a frying pan , " Raw Story reporter Larisa Alexandrovna wrote Saturday .
" He laughed and said , ' I hope so . ' "
The first image shows a gaping caricature of Obama under the words " Obama Waffles , " with the tagline " Waffling the World Over . "
The second shows Obama in a turban with the words , " Point box toward Mecca for tastier waffles . "
The waffles are also sold online at ObamaWaffles.com .
The site says they are also sold at the bookstore Books - A - Million , though nothing comes up in a search at the bookseller 's website .
According to the the site 's blog , Lou Dobbs , who was also speaking at the convention , lauded the product Friday .
" My wife will love this , " Dobbs purportedly said .
A photograph of Dobbs with a box and one of the sellers is online here .
Sen . John McCain , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. Barack Obama were invited to the conference but did not attend .

For an interesting twist to serving iced tea , add these watermelon and mint ice cubes .
I 've adapted a recipe from Relish magazine , an excellent new food magazine that can be found as a supplement in your Sunday paper .
The ice cubes go well with any drink you want to liven up , not just tea : add it to punch , lemonade , mixed drinks , and so on .
This recipe also works well for making freezer pops and granita .
Watermelon and Mint Ice Cubes
2 -1/2 cups watermelon , cubed
1 to 2 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon sugar
juice of 1/2 lemon
24 mint leaves
Into a medium bowl , press the watermelon cubes through a fine mesh strainer .
Discard the pulp .
To the watermelon juice , add honey to taste , sugar , and lemon juice .
Combine and strain the liquid again into a measuring cup to make for easy dispensing .
It should equal 2 cups , which will fill an ice cube tray entirely .
Place mint leaves in ice tray and pour the liquid over the mint .
Freeze for at least two hours before using .
Yield : 24 ice cubes .
Experts believe a simple test could be developed A common form of skin cancer could be diagnosed by the distinctive chemical " scent " it gives off , say US experts .
Philadelphia 's Monell Center sampled the air directly above basal cell carcinomas and found it was different to similar samples from healthy skin .
They told a conference it offered the chance of cheap and painless testing .
Other scientists are trying to spot the " smell " of cancer , with a UK team using dogs to sniff out bladder tumours from urine samples .
Our findings may some day allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
Dr Michelle Gallagher
Monell Center
All human skin releases chemicals called " volatile organic compounds " , many of which do have a scent .
The researchers from the Monell Center used a technology called gas chromatography - mass spectrometry to identify their precise chemical composition .
A total of 22 patients , 11 with and 11 without basal cell carcinomas , were tested .
All the air samples contained the same ingredients , but the equipment revealed that the patients with cancer had markedly different concentrations of certain chemicals .
Dr Michelle Gallagher , presenting the results of the project at the American Chemical Society 's annual conference , said that a " profile " of the cancer could be built up .
" Our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages , " she said .
She now plans to try to construct profiles of other types of skin cancer , including the much more dangerous malignant melanoma .
Dog detector Dr Carolyn Willis , a dermatology researcher from Amersham Hospital in Buckinghamshire , is trying to develop a cancer test using the same principles - but substituting a living sensor .
Her team has trained dogs to detect subtle changes in the odour of urine which could indicate bladder cancer , and is hoping to detect prostate and skin cancers the same way .
The dog's nose , she said , was one of the most sensitive instruments available , and had the advantage of being attached to a brain already programmed to identify different patterns in the scents it received .
She said : " This has great potential as a screening tool .
The detection of these volatile organic compounds could make a major contribution to diagnosis .
" It 's a non-invasive and simple way of detecting disease . "
Other projects worldwide have included checking the composition of exhaled breath for distinctive chemicals given out by lung tumours .

But that debate also showed that Mr. McCain ’s performances could be uneven .
He stumbled over some words .
He looked confused at several junctures and was slow on the draw , retrieving his time on occasion to amend earlier answers .
At one point , Mr. McCain seemed surprised by a question about whether he believed in evolution .
Yes , he said .
But when some of his rivals said they did not , Mr. McCain went back .
“ I believe in evolution , ” he said .
“ But I also believe , when I hike the Grand Canyon and see it at sunset , that the hand of God is there also . ”
When the topic strays from foreign policy , Mr. McCain ’s interest can fade and he can lapse into his stump speech .
“ McCain ’s major weakness is looking wooden , and when he ’s out of his comfort zone , his sound bites become weaker and his evasions of questions become more obvious , ” said David Lanoue , a political scientist at the University of Alabama and an expert in presidential debates .
What lasts from a review of Mr. McCain ’s national debates  21 this primary season and more than seven in 2000 that included George W. Bush  is that he relishes direct confrontation .
He presents himself as the authority on the broad themes of war and peace , life and death .
And depending on his level of contempt for his opponent , he can drip with condescension , even as he sits calmly with his hands folded in front of him , smiling .
“ I told you once before , Alan , and I ’m sorry I have to tell you again , ” Mr. McCain said to Alan Keyes , a Republican presidential candidate , in 2000 .
“ I ’ve seen enough killing in my life , a lot more than you have .
I know , I know , how valuable and precious human life is . ”
Drawing Mr. Romney , a former governor of Massachusetts , into a trap in the CNN / YouTube debate last November , Mr. McCain said , “ Well , Governor , I ’m astonished that you have n’t found out what waterboarding is . ”
Mr. Romney said he did know , prompting Mr. McCain to express further astonishment that Mr. Romney would not call it torture .
But in that debate , it was Representative Ron Paul of Texas , an opponent of the war in Iraq , who was the object of Mr. McCain ’s most righteous fury .
“ I want to tell you that that kind of isolationism , sir , is what caused World War II , ” Mr. McCain declared , as he doubled back from a question about taxes .
After some boos , he continued , “ We allowed Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude of isolationism and appeasement . ”
In college , when I used to receive a task to write an essay and bring it to my instructor in 7 days , I was usually saying to myself : “ Well , I have a plenty of time , I ’ll be back to this assignment later on ” .
Two or three days after I used to think : “ Maybe I should start dealing with the paper already ? ”
The fifth day was always critical : by that time the necessity to start working on the assignment had been pressing a lot , therefore , I used to try imitating the work on the essay by creating a new file in my PC and looking through some related pages in the course book or in Internet .
In the end of the ends , in the majority of the situations I was getting to the point in around 2 - 3 hours before the deadline .
Chronic exhaustion , stresses , lack of success and personal progress , low self - esteem – those were the outcomes of my usual practice to put things off all the time .
Do I need to mention , in how many other ways the habit to procrastinate can affect your life ?
People can lose their businesses and fortunes , lose their friendships and destroy their lives because of procrastination .
Unfortunately , a real danger of the problem of chronic procrastination has not been fully recognized by our society yet .
Moreover , many specialists tend to connect this problem with time management and inability of a procrastinator to plan his / her time .
This is a great misinterpretation of this problem , and trying to help procrastinators by giving them recommendations to improve their time management skills is a big mistake !
Some experts tend to define procrastination as “ an addictive disorder ” , or simply as an addiction .
Yes , all procrastinators do have a strong addiction : they try to escape from doing the things they do not want or hate doing by one or another reason .
Therefore , they choose to postpone doing things , like other addicts use substances to postpone dealing with mental or psychological problems they face .
As a solution for the problem of putting things off all the time , many psychologists offer looking for a reason of your procrastination and trying to eliminate it .
Well , do you believe that it is really going to work ?
No way !
Chronic procrastination is something like alcoholism or drug abuse : will an alcoholic stop drinking if he finds the reason that has brought him to drinking ?
As I could observe , all chronic procrastinators have a cyclic way of living with their problem .
Usually , when they figure out that their life has become unmanageable and their habit of putting things off is getting out of their hand , they start feeling guilty about their helplessness or not doing anything to change their habit .
They check out information on the net or look for some books and articles related to the problem , learn all those easy tips on how to get rid of chronic procrastination , and make up their mind to start a new life without procrastination .
Next morning they make a list of the things thy need to do , schedule everything very precisely and feel very proud of their work !
Yes , sometimes they even have enough of willpower to complete some first tasks on that list !
Finally , they think : “ Hey , that was a good start !
I got a great progress ! ”
And after this – everything goes on the same way as it was before : panic before the deadlines in school , doing the work in the last minute , being late and frustrated .
This example is quite an illustrative picture .
Real chronic procrastination is a very hard problem – probably , the hardest one that we will have to fight with .
Getting rid of this terrible habit is connected with a very responsible approach to SAYING what you are going to do and DOING what you have said .
That is why a huge motivation will be necessary .
But I ’ll tell you what : do not wait till you have “ a dentist situation ” , when your delays of going to the dentist have led you to the necessity to remove all your decaying teeth and replace them with implants .
Getting the job done on time is much easier and more pleasant , is n’t it ?
Yahoo may be planning for social network domination , but that has n't stopped the struggling search and content portal from announcing a major redesign of its homepage .
It 's the first redesign in over two years , during which time Yahoo has taken a financial beating , so it 's safe to assume that the company has high hopes that this will rejuvenate one of its fundamental properties .
The most significant change Yahoo will offer is a much more customizable version of its homepage , powered by the " widgets " that are popular on similar content portals and social networking sites like iGoogle and Facebook .
More importantly , though , Yahoo is going to allow its home page and these widgets to interact with third - party sites and services , and it offered the example of a Netflix widget that can display customers ' queues and ratings on Yahoo 's homepage .
These changes sound very similar to the features and functionality rolled out in a large update to its MyYahoo 2.0 customizable start page last July .
Yahoo's redesigned and customizable MyYahoo 2.0 start page , from which its upcoming homepage redesign may take inspiration
Yahoo offered no ETA for when these changes will arrive , only saying that they will appear gradually over the next few months .
" You will see a rolling thunder kind of thing , " Ash Patel , Yahoo's Executive Vice President its Audience and Product division , told the Associated Press .
Yahoo is hosting a conference today to get third - party developers interested in building more widgets and integrating other services for its homepage .
In a departure from current practices , Yahoo will begin incorporating more content from third parties in major areas of its site .
In the wake of its decision to close its DRM music store and refund money to customers , it will open a redesigned music section featuring content from new partners like the iTunes Store , Amazon , and presumably Rhapsody , which is Yahoo 's official music partner .
In order to populate Yahoo's news section , it will develop partnerships that will see it feature much more local content from newspapers around the US .
Yahoo hopes its upcoming advertising partnership with Google ( assuming the DoJ lets it fly ) can boost annual revenue by $ 800 million alone , and it clearly hopes that opening its doors to other content and services will better leverage its 500 million worldwide user base , and perhaps draw in a few more .
Considering the social , syndicated nature of the web , the adaptations of its competitors , and the bruised and battered state a failed Microsoft buyout attempt left it in , these sound like positive changes that could help to retool Yahoo in a way that makes it a valuable content and social networking hub .
Washington --
The Justice Department has quietly hired one of the nation 's best - known litigators , former Walt Disney Co. vice chairman Sanford Litvack , for a possible antitrust challenge to Google Inc. 's growing power in advertising .
Mr. Litvack 's hiring is the strongest signal yet that the U.S. is preparing to take court action against Google and its search - advertising deal with Yahoo Inc .
The two companies combined would account for more than 80 % of U.S. online - search ads .

WHO IS YOUR 2008 MATCH ?
WHO IS YOUR 2008 MATCH ?
USA TODAY 's issues game lets you compare your views with those of Barack Obama and John McCain .
Weigh in on the issues , find your match and share the result with a friend .
Enlarge By Alex Brandon , AP Author and Democratic candidate Barack Obama signs a book for a supporter in Columbus , Ohio , in June .
Presidential race one for the books Best - selling authors and presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain again have their names on book jackets — this time in the title only .
The shelf of books about the candidates and their campaigns is more crowded than usual this election season , and publishers are aiming at a wider audience because of the historic race between the Illinois Democrat and the Arizona Republican .
Nearly two dozen books about Obama , including an unusually large number of kids ' books , are out or on the way compared with about a dozen for 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry .
At least half a dozen books are out or coming on McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee .
" There seem to be a particularly large crop of books about Obama , " says Sara Nelson , editor of Publishers Weekly .
That 's not surprising , she says : Obama is a relatively new national figure and , as the first African - American nominee of a major political party , has already made history .
McCain 's story is better known because of his 2000 campaign and the books he wrote about his military service and years as a Vietnam POW .
His life story is " important and riveting and substantial , " Nelson says .
" It 's just that people know it . "
The campaign bookshelf this year will include biographies , comics and humor books ( Barack Obama is Your New Bicycle , and 72 Things Younger Than John McCain ) .
A glossy photo book , The Rise of Barack Obama , features pictures by Pete Souza , who has trailed Obama since he arrived in the Senate in 2005 .
" We have pretty high expectations " for sales , says Natalie King of Triumph Books .
She thinks the photo book will appeal to people who want to know more about Obama : " what is he like as a family man , how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock - star persona that he has been able to create . "
Random House announced Monday it will publish Change We Can Believe
In , a compilation by Obama 's staff of his policy proposals and his campaign speeches .
Two books critical of Obama appeared just this month : The Case Against Barack Obama , by David Freddoso , and The Obama Nation : Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality , by Jerome Corsi , co-author of a 2004 book about Kerry 's Swift Boat record , Unfit for Command .
Corsi 's book debuted on best - seller lists last week .
Media Matters for America , a liberal watchdog group , says the book falsely characterizes Obama 's position on nuclear weapons as far left and incorrectly claims a global anti-poverty bill he is sponsoring would require the U.S. to spend a fixed amount annually on foreign aid .
The Obama campaign would not comment on the critical books , but spokesman Hari Sevugan said Obama 's anti-poverty bill did not call for any specific funding .
He said it would require the president to produce and implement a strategy to reduce global poverty .
Biographies written for children are timed to hit the back - to - school market .
Meghan McCain is writing a picture book called My Dad , John McCain for Simon & Schuster , which will also put out picture books on Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Jean Feiwel , publisher of a children 's book imprint at Macmillan , commissioned Yes We Can , for 8 to 12 year olds , after her daughter 's interest in Obama made her realize kids are following the election .
" This young audience , all of which had grown up essentially with one president , all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that I thought was galvanizing , " Feiwel says .
Still , the new crop of books will have a hard time beating those written by Obama and McCain themselves .
Obama 's autobiography , Dreams from My Father , written in 1995 and re-released in 2004 , and McCain 's Faith of My Fathers , published in 1999 , both spent weeks on best - seller lists .
Paul Begala , the Democratic commentator who is writing Third Term : Why George W. Bush ( heart symbol ) John McCain — one of several anti-McCain books being published — says the definitive Obama book has already been written — by Obama .
" You 'd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this man 's story .
And if you read Dreams from My Father , you 'd say , ' OK , this has been done . ' "
Only half of the books about Obama or McCain now being published will have a shelf life beyond Nov. 4 .
The question is , which half .
The Chicago Tribune will publish a book on each candidate to provide " what you need to know about these candidates , " says Mark Silva , who wrote a book on McCain , due out Sept.
1 . " They 're out there at the time when they 're important to voters .
If they 're in the recycling bins in June of 2009 — life goes on . "

The US 's recent economic history is littered with cautionary tales .
And the hedge fund business is certainly no exception .
Take for instance the failure and flameout of former CNBC anchor Ronald Insana , as told by NYT's Andrew Ross Sorkin .
The bottom line : Making billions ( or even millions ) running a hedge fund is harder than it looks .
Insana 's departure from CNBC :
In March 2006 , Mr. Insana left the network to try his hand at becoming one of those titans , setting up a fund to help investors get into hedge funds , a so - called fund of funds .
Paul Kedrosky , the writer and investor , said at the time that Mr. Insana ’s announcement “ reminded him a little of Lou Dobbs going to Space.com at the peak of the dot - com bubble . ”
Mr. Dobbs ’s adventure , you may recall , did n’t turn out well ; he ’s back on TV .
Hedge fund investors do n't only prefer positive returns , they demand them .
Beating the market is not good enough :
Over the course of more than a year , Mr. Insana raised about $ 116 million .
It was a respectable number , to be sure , but it was n’t $ 3 billion .
And here is where Mr. Insana ran into trouble .
As an investor , Mr. Insana did n’t exactly have the wind at his back .
During the 14 months his fund of funds was up and running , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index fell more than 15 percent .
While some hedge funds managed to eke out gains , many did not .
Ultimately , Mr. Insana ’s fund lost 5 percent .
Oh well , so there were no profits to share in .
At least he got to keep a handsome management fee bounty , right ?
Nope :
That left his management fee , which amounted to $ 1.74 million .
( That ’s 1.5 percent of $ 116 million . ) ... After paying [ his partner ]
Deutsche Bank , Insana Capital Partners was left with only about $ 870,000 .
That would have been enough if it was just Mr. Insana , a secretary and a dog .
But Mr. Insana was hoping to attract more than $ 1 billion from investors .
And most big institutions wo n’t even consider investing in a fund that does n’t have a proper infrastructure : a compliance officer , an accountant , analysts and so on .
Mr. Insana had seven employees , and was paying for office space in the former CNBC studios in Fort Lee , N.J. , and Bloomberg terminals — at more than $ 1,500 a pop a month — while traveling the globe in search of investors .
Under the circumstances , $ 870,000 just was n’t going to last very long .
Insana had no choice but to close up shop :
Two weeks ago , Mr. Insana announced that he was throwing in the towel ....
Mr. Insana probably should have seen it coming .
In 2002 , he wrote a book called , “ Trendwatching : Do n’t be Fooled by the Next Investment Fad , Mania , or Bubble . ”
Oops .
Insana 's failure may not be as epic as others , but , just like the dot - com bubble showed , there 's no easy way to print money ...

The solution to gridlock on our overcrowded roads is to take to the air in a plane - car hybrid that will revolutionise the way society works .
Could flying become a daily means of transportation ?
This vision of the future twenty years hence was revealed at the 2008 Electric Aircraft Symposium held a stone 's throw from San Francisco airport in California .
Plotting the next frontier in green technology was Richard Jones , a technical fellow at Boeing Phantom Works .
He said : " Today I am talking about making aviation available to everyone as a daily means of transportation .
Transportation changes society . "
" When they dumped the horse and cart people took over two continents .
150 years ago steam turned America into a nation .
Today 50 per cent of the world lives in urban areas thanks to the car .
And in the last 50 years , the aviation industry has made one world thanks to the airplane . "
Future transportation
When your 100 mpg ( miles per gallon ) car is stuck in traffic and a 100 mpg airplane whizzes overhead , you 're going to be jealous .
Richard Jones
Boeing 's research group is designing a hybrid aimed at travelling up to 300 miles at a time .
It will use precision navigation systems that would allow the average ' driver cum pilot ' to fly without special training thanks to a computerised ' flight instructor ' built into the cockpit .
This , Mr Jones believes , could make the compact plane easier to drive than a car .
" People will probably be reading a newspaper rather than flying the vehicles . "
He said that they will be powered using electricity and / or batteries making them the " cleanest transportation of the future . "
This sneak peak at the world twenty years from now was eagerly welcomed by the assembled group of engineers , scientists , venture capitalists and chief executives who were brought together by the CAFE Foundation , a non profit organisation that promotes personal air travel .
The organisation 's President Brien Seeley said that there were good sound reasons for believing that such a hybrid will be an everyday part of life .
And with an estimated 1.2 billion cars expected to be clogging up the roads by 2030 he said that it is a no brainer .
" When your 100 mpg ( miles per gallon ) car is stuck in traffic and a 100 mpg airplane whizzes overhead , you 're going to be jealous . "
Personal aviation
An electric glider will soon be available commercially
The symposium was told that the environmental need to find an alternative to the combustion engine is long overdue and growing ever more urgent as fuel prices top $ 120 a barrel and passengers get hit with crippling surcharges for taking to the air .
Dr Ben Santer who is a physicist with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory told BBC News : " We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are changing the chemistry of the earth 's atmosphere by burning fossil fuels in cars and airplanes . "
" If we do n't want to have really serious changes to our climate then we have to figure out other ways of doing business . "
The CAFE Foundation believes the solution is obvious .
Mr Seeley told the BBC : " The electric aircraft promises to solve these problems and produce a real enlightenment of aviation with new technology and a rebirth of popular general aviation and personal aviation travel . "
But there is no reason to wait for Boeing 's hybrid vehicle according to a Slovenian company called Pipistrel .
By the end of the year it plans to deliver the world 's first commercially produced , two - seater electric aircraft to customers .
Their Taurus Electro can climb to 6,000 feet after taking off using a 30 - kilowatt motor .
Recharging the glider 's lithium - polymer battery is meant to take about as long as charging a cell phone .
And weather permitting , the glider can travel 1,000 miles a day .
Pipistrel 's head of research and development Tine Tomazic says they already have over a dozen orders for the plane .
" We are doing it now .
We are flying the world 's first two - seater self launching glider powered by electrical means , powered by batteries . "
" We have seen tremendous demand from existing owners who fly the internal combustion powered version and we think the market potential for the Taurus Electro is just huge . "
Efficient plane
That of course is open to question given that the sticker price for the basic model starts at around $ 132,000 ( £ 67,000 ) .
For the time being it 's probably fair to say that the market for the Taurus Electra and similar planes is limited to enthusiasts and those with money to spend .
People like Google founder Larry Page who was also at the event and owns his own aircraft .
But in order to generate some buzz about electric planes outside of this cosy coterie of ' plane nuts ' CAFE is teaming up with NASA to launch a ' Green Prize ' competition .
It will award $ 50,000 for a craft that achieves at least 100 miles per hour and the equivalent of 100 miles per gallon .
Supporters of such competitions hope it will help convince people that air travel could become the greenest form of transportation .
Speaking to the BBC , Mark Moore of NASA Langely said : " If such an aircraft can achieve greater efficiencies than being stuck in gridlock or even on commercial airlines then we will have something to get excited about .
Boeing 's Mr Jones agrees and says making personal aviation the norm is the ultimate goal .
" It will change society , the way we work , the way we live , the way cities grow . "
Sky 's the limit
And while it may take some time to persuade the public at large that they will be whizzing through the air on a vehicle that is part car and part plane , investors were being told that getting on the bandwagon early will pay off in the long run .
Adam Grosser of venture capital firm Foundation Capital sponsored the event and not unsurprisingly believes personal electric aircraft is a money winner .
" It is vitally important to catalyse an industry like this .
A lot of the stuff you are hearing may take a while to come to fruition and we are willing to wait patiently and invest prudently behind that vision .
But it will take off and the sky 's the limit when it does . "

It looks like Nvidia cards are not the only ones with high failure rates .
According to TG Daily ’s “ industry source , ” all Radeon HD 3850 512MB cards from Diamond Multimedia shipped between January and July are defective as well as a substantial number of HD 3870 512MB cards and X2 models , resulting in computers not starting up and system crashes .
Apparently , the problem stems from design and manufacturing defects at ITC – the company contracted by Diamond to build the cards – and does not appear to affect 3800 - series cards of other manufacturers .
While Diamond itself did n’t manufacture the cards , it appears that the cards were never evaluated by AMD and may have been subject to negligent testing at Diamond .
About 15,000 faulty units have ended up in customer hands or are still being sold – which is a relatively small number considering that a total of 1.9 million 3800 - series have shipped since last November overall .
Alienware , however , found this to be unacceptable and is looking to replace its business relationship with Diamond with another supplier .
Diamond downplayed the issue by saying they “ do not have any extraordinary customer call reports for HD 3850 , 3870 512 MB boards , ” but should you be among those experiencing errors , they ’ll happily replace your card .

House Judiciary to examine claim of White House intel forgery Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 13 , 2008
Print This Email This
The blockbuster claims that White House officials conspired to forge evidence linking Iraq to 9/11 plotters and ignored clear intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein 's lack of WMDs may not be getting as much attention as it should in the US press , but some key lawmakers are beginning to take notice .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers says his staff will investigate these allegations and others aired in Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Ron Suskind 's new book , The Way of the World : A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism .
" I am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration , " Conyers said in a press release Tuesday evening .
" The administrations attempt to challenge Mr. Suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts .
I have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of Mr. Suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter . "
The announced probe garnered quick praise from Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , who has waged a months - long campaign to convince his colleagues and Democratic leaders in the House to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Suskind has said the allegations outlined in his book could be impeachable offenses .
According to Conyers ' office , the Judiciary Committee staff 's investigation will focus on the following areas : · The origin of the allegedly forged document that formed the basis for Bushs 2003 State of the Union assertion that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger ;
· The role of this document in creating the false impression that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had a working relationship with Iraq ;
· The relationship between this document and other reported examples of the Bush Administration considering other deceptive schemes to justify or provoke war with Iraq , such as the reported consideration of painting a U.S. aircraft with UN colors in order to provoke Iraq into military confrontation ;
· Allegations that the Bush Administration deliberately ignored information from Iraqs chief intelligence officer that Iraq possessed no WMDs ;
· The payment of $ 5 million to Iraqs chief intelligence officer and his secret settlement in Jordan , beyond the reach of investigators ;
· The September 2007 detainment and interrogation of Mr. Suskinds research assistant , Greg Jackson , by federal agents in Manhattan .
Jacksons notes were also confiscated .
Kucinich , who was a Democratic presidential candidate earlier this year , last week requested an investigation of the book 's claims .
" If true , " he said , " the Administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war . "

One day before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , Rep. Dennis Kucinich is presenting a petition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with 50,000 signatures urging the impeachment of President Bush — adding to the 100,000 he has already filed .
Calling the Bush administration ’s military response to 9/11 “ errant retributive justice , ” the Ohio Democrat called for a Commission on Truth and Reconciliation to “ compel testimony and gather official documents ” on why the Bush administration went to war in Iraq .
In advance of a news conference today with grass - roots organizations lobbying Congress on the issue , Kucinich said :
Impeachment has been the first step in our efforts toward truth .
The American people were lied to .
We went to war based on lies .
Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 . …
In the face of a destructive war against Iraq , preparations for war against Iran , the initiation of a cold war with Russia , the inevitable destruction of our domestic economy from the extraordinary cost of a great military buildup , and the gutting of civil liberties , the call for impeachment has been the only remedy .
Millions of Americans recognize this .
Kucinich ’s pitch comes one day before the nation mourns the death of 3,000 Americans killed on 9/11 , and one day after Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington endorsed impeachment .
McDermott visited Saddam Hussein ’s
Iraq before the war , earning him the nickname “ Baghdad Jim . ”
Here ’s what he said :
For the last two years I ’ve struggled with the issue of whether the House should impeach a sitting president .
Next to declaring war , impeachment is the gravest matter the House of Representatives must consider .
I fully understand the gut - wrenching consequences such a national debate could precipitate .
Yet there is one fact we cannot over look or escape : America cannot regain its moral leadership in the world if America cannot hold its leaders accountable for their actions at home .
With Bush leaving office in about four months , and a presidential election campaign in full swing , no one in Washington seriously expects the impeachment drive to succeed .
Pelosi has repeatedly taken the issue off the table , saying voters expect Congress to work on economic issues , not spend its remaining months trying to push Bush from office early .
But David Swanson , co-founder of AfterDowningStreet.org , argued in a press release that impeachment is crucial to possible criminal trials against the president and Vice President Dick Cheney once they leave office .
When Cheney and Bush finally face trial in a criminal court , their first line of defense is likely to be , “ We served the American people , whose representatives chose not to impeach us . ”
If on the other hand they are impeached even after having left office , the likelihood of prosecution and of successful prosecution will increase dramatically .

UK judge blocks access to high - school - level courses .
A British judge has ruled that a terrorism suspect cannot take secondary - school level courses in chemistry and human biology .
In a first - of - a- kind ruling , High Court judge Stephen Silber said that the courses would put the suspect — who is referred to as A.E. for privacy reasons — in a “ substantially stronger position ” to carry out chemical and biological attacks .
But scientists are unconvinced .
An AS level in human biology is unlikely to provide much in the way of skills to a potential terrorist , says Charles Penn , a molecular microbiologist at the University of Birmingham .
“ I 'm pretty sceptical that this is a real , tangible risk , ” he says .
The ruling paints a “ misleading image of school chemistry being a subject of particular value to potential terrorists ” , says Richard Pike , chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry .
“ There is nothing on the AS - level chemistry course that cannot be found easily on the web and through other means , ” he says .
A.E. is an Iraqi national with alleged ties to terrorist groups including Al - Qaeda in Iraq , according to the UK government .
Since 2006 he has been subject to a ' control order ' , a special legal instrument that places limits on his freedoms , including his Internet use .
He is subject to surveillance and must seek approval from the Home Office before undertaking coursework .
In September 2007 , he asked for permission to enrol in AS - level courses in chemistry and human biology .
In Iraq , A.E. had been training as a doctor and the courses were the first step in continuing his education , according to his solicitor , Mohammed Ayub , of Chambers Solicitors in Bradford .
The Home Office denied his request , claiming that knowledge gained in the coursework could be used for terrorism .
A.E. contested the decision in court , claiming that AS - level courses were largely harmless ( see Nature 450 , 467 ; 2007 ) .
The 15 - page ruling , released on 21 July , upholds the Home Office 's claim .
Based in part on testimony from an anonymous security official known only as ' X ' , Justice Silber found that A.E. would gain expertise , particularly in using equipment , that might further terrorist activities .
But Penn questions how useful the courses would be for a would - be terrorist .
Even university - level students would have trouble producing large quantities of a pathogen such as anthrax , he says , “ they would n't have a clue where to start ” .

Silber also called into question A.E. 's previous medical training in Iraq , which had been a key part of A.E. 's argument — his lawyer maintained that the AS - level courses would review information he had already learned .
Even if A.E. could learn new techniques from the courses , Ayub adds , he is under such tight scrutiny that he would be unable to do much .
“ The risk is negligible to nil , ” he says .
Ayub says that his client is “ dismayed ” by the ruling , and they are likely to decide whether to take the case to the Court of Appeal within the coming weeks .
Like millions of motorists , Eric Hanson used a Global Positioning System device in his Chevrolet TrailBlazer to find his way around .
He probably did not expect that prosecutors would use it , too  to help convict him of killing four family members .
Prosecutors in suburban Chicago analyzed data from the Garmin G.P.S. device to pinpoint where Mr. Hanson had been on the morning after his parents were fatally shot and his sister and brother - in - law bludgeoned to death in 2005 .
He was convicted of the killings this year and sentenced to death .
Mr. Hanson ’s trial was among recent criminal cases in which the authorities used such navigation devices to help establish a defendant ’s whereabouts .
Experts say such evidence will almost certainly become more common in court as the systems become more affordable and show up in more vehicles .
“ There ’s no real doubt , ” said Alan Brill , a computer forensics expert in Minnesota who has worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service .
“ This follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value .
I think what we ’re seeing is evolutionary . ”
In 2006 , North Carolina ’s second - highest court ruled that , under the state constitution , cities had to give 90 percent of ticket camera revenue to the public school system .
Because the true appeal of ticket cameras is revenue , this ruling caused the cities of Charlotte , Fayetteville , Greenville , Greensboro , High Point and Raleigh to shut down their red light camera programs .
However , according to local news station News 14 Carolina , Fayetteville ’s ticket cameras may be coming back .
But this time it ’s not the city that is making a play for the ticket camera money , it ’s the local school board :
Red - light cameras might be coming back to Fayetteville to catch drivers running stop lights .
Fayetteville removed the cameras last year after the state required 90 percent of fines to go to schools .
The city said it could not afford to pay for the service with the remaining 10 percent . [ … ]
School board member Greg West wants to change that .
He proposed bringing back the red - light cameras after talking with the mayor .
His colleague on the school board , Kim Fisher , thinks it is a good idea .
So the local school board , which has no expertise in traffic safety to speak of , would like to install red - light cameras ?
If they ’re interested in traffic safety , why not let them set speed limits then ?
Or maybe after lunch the cafeteria lady can set up a roadblock and check for proper vehicle registrations .
But surely the school board is n’t in charge of deciding whether or not the cameras are installed …
The school board will now meet with companies who run red - light cameras to come up with a proposal .
That proposal will then be passed on to the school board for a vote .
Wow .

Everyday Anarchy
Part 1
by Stefan Molyneux
May 23 , 2008
Introduction
It 's hard to know whether a word can ever be rehabilitated ' or whether the attempt should even be made .
Words are weapons , and can be used like any tools , for good or ill .
We are all aware of the clich'd uses of such terms as ' terrorists ' versus ' freedom fighters , ' etc .
An atheist can be called an ' unbeliever ' ; a theist can be called ' superstitious . '
A man of conviction can be called an ' extremist ' ; a man of moderation ' cowardly . '
A free spirit can be called a libertine or a hedonist ; a cautious introvert can be labeled a stodgy prude .
Words are also weapons of judgment ' primarily moral judgment .
We can say that a man can be ' freed ' of sin if he accepts Jesus ; we can also say that he can be ' freed ' of irrationality if he does not .
A patriot will say that a soldier ' serves ' his country ; others may take him to task for his blind obedience .
Acts considered ' murderous ' in peacetime are hailed as ' noble ' in war , and so on .
Some words can never be rehabilitated ' and neither should they be .
Nazi , evil , incest , abuse , rape , murder ' these are all words which describe the blackest impulses of the human soul , and can never be turned to a good end .
Edmund may say in King Lear , ' Evil , be thou my good ! ' but we know that he is not speaking paradoxically ; he is merely saying ' that which others call evil ' my self - interest ' is good for me . '
The word ' anarchy ' may be almost beyond redemption ' any attempt to find goodness in it could well be utterly futile ' or worse ; the philosophical equivalent of the clich'd scene in hospital dramas where the surgeon blindly refuses to give up on a clearly dead patient .
Perhaps I 'm engaged in just such a fool 's quest in this little book .
Perhaps the word ' anarchy ' has been so abused throughout its long history , so thrown into the pit of incontestable human iniquity that it can never be untangled from the evils that supposedly surround it .
What images spring to mind when you hear the word ' anarchy ' ?
Surely it evokes mad riots of violence and lawlessness ' a post - apocalyptic Darwinian free - for - all where the strong and evil dominate the meek and reasonable .
Or perhaps you view it as a mad political agenda , a thin ideological cover for murderous desires and cravings for assassinations , where wild - eyed , mustachioed men with thick hair and thicker accents roll cartoon bombs under the ornate carriages of slowly - waving monarchs .
Or perhaps you view ' anarchy ' as more of a philosophical specter ; the haunted and angry mutterings of over - caffeinated and seemingly - eternal grad students ; a nihilistic surrender to all that is seductive and evil in human nature , a hurling off the cliff of self - restraint , and a savage plunge into the mad magic of the moment , without rules , without plans , without a future . . . .
If your teenage son were to come home to you one sunny afternoon and tell you that he had become an anarchist , you would likely feel a strong urge to check his bag for black hair dye , fresh nose rings , clumpy mascara and dirty needles .
His announcement would very likely cause a certain trapdoor to open under your heart , where you may fear that it might fall forever .
The heavy syllables of words like ' intervention , ' ' medication , ' ' boot camp , ' and ' intensive therapy ' would probably accompany the thudding of your quickened pulse .
All this may well be true , of course ' I may be thumping the chest of a broken patient long since destined for the morgue , but certain . . . insights , you could say , or perhaps correlations , continue to trouble me immensely , and I cannot shake the fear that it is not anarchy that lies on the table , clinging to life ' but rather , the truth .
I will take a paragraph or two to try and communicate what troubles me so much about the possible injustice of throwing the word ' anarchy ' into the pit of evil ' if I have not convinced you by the end of the next page that something very unjust may be afoot , then I will have to continue my task of resurrection with others , because I do not for a moment imagine that I would ever convince you to call something good that is in fact evil .
And neither would I want to .
Now the actual meaning of the word ' anarchy ' is ( from the OED ) :
1. Absence of government ; a state of lawlessness due to the absence or inefficiency of the supreme power ; political disorder .
2 . A theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons , but each individual has absolute liberty ( without implication of disorder ) .
Thus we can see that the word ' anarchy ' represents two central meanings : an absence of both government and social order , and an absence of government with no implication of social disorder .
Without a government . . . .
What does that mean in practice ?
Well , clearly there are two kinds of leaders in this world ' those who lead by incentive , and those who lead by force .
Those who lead by incentive will offer you a salary to come and work for them ; those who lead by force will throw you in jail if you do not pick up a gun and fight for them .
Those who lead by incentive will try to get you to voluntarily send your children to their schools by keeping their prices reasonable , their classes stimulating , and demonstrating proven and objective success .
Those who lead by force will simply tell you that if you do not pay the property taxes to fund their schools , you will be thrown in jail .
Clearly , this is the difference between voluntarism and violence .
The word ' anarchy ' does not mean ' no rules . '
It does not mean ' kill others for fun . '
It does not mean ' no organization . '
It simply means : ' without a political leader . '
The difference , of course , between politics and every other area of life is that in politics , if you do not obey the government , you are thrown in jail .
If you try to defend yourself against the people who come to throw you in jail , they will shoot you .
So ' what does the word ' anarchy ' really mean ?
It simply means a way of interacting with others without threatening them with violence if they do not obey .
It simply means ' without political violence . '
The difference between this word and words like ' murder ' and ' rape ' is that we do not mix murder and rape with the exact opposite actions in our life , and consider the results normal , moral and healthy .
We do not strangle a man in the morning , then help a woman across the street in the afternoon , and call ourselves ' good . '
The true evils that we all accept ' rape , assault , murder , theft ' are never considered a core and necessary part of the life of a good person .
An accused murderer does not get to walk free by pointing out that he spent all but five seconds of his life not killing someone .
With those acknowledged evils , one single transgression changes the moral character of an entire life .
You would never be able to think of a friend who is convicted of rape in the same way again .
However ' this is not the case with ' anarchy ' ' it does not fit into that category of ' evil ' at all .
When we think of a society without political violence ' without governments ' these specters of chaos and brutality always arise for us , immediately and , it would seem , irrevocably .
However , it only takes a moment of thought to realize that we live the vast majority of our actual lives in complete and total anarchy ' and call such anarchy ' morally good . '
For instance , take dating , marriage and family .
In any reasonably free society , these activities do not fall in the realm of political coercion .
No government agency chooses who you are to marry and have children with , and punishes you with jail for disobeying their rulings .
Voluntarism , incentive , mutual advantage ' dare we say ' advertising ' ? ' all run the free market of love , sex and marriage .
What about your career ?
Did a government official call you up at the end of high school and inform you that you were to become a doctor , a lawyer , a factory worker , a waiter , an actor , a programmer ' or a philosopher ?
Of course not .
You were left free to choose the career that best matched your interests , abilities and initiative .
What about your major financial decisions ?
Each month , does a government agent come to your house and tell you exactly how much you should save , how much you should spend , whether you can afford that new couch or old painting ?
Did you have to apply to the government to buy a new car , a new house , a plasma television or a toothbrush ?
No , in all the areas mentioned above ' love , marriage , family , career , finances ' we all make our major decisions in the complete absence of direct political coercion .
Thus ' if anarchy is such an all - consuming , universal evil , why is it the default ' and virtuous ' freedom that we demand in order to achieve just liberty in our daily lives ?
If the government told you tomorrow that it was going to choose for you where to live , how to earn your keep , and who to marry ' would you fall to your knees and thank the heavens that you have been saved from such terrible anarchy ' the anarchy of making your own decisions in the absence of direct political coercion ?
Of course not ' quite the opposite ' you would be horrified , and would oppose such an encroaching dictatorship with all your might .
This is what I mean when I say that we consider anarchy to be an irreducible evil ' and also an irreducible good .
It is both feared and despised ' and considered necessary and virtuous .
If you were told that tomorrow you would wake up and there would be no government , you would doubtless fear the specter of ' anarchy . '
If you were told tomorrow that you would have to apply for a government permit to have children , you would doubtless fear the specter of ' dictatorship , ' and long for the days of ' anarchy , ' when you could decide such things without the intervention of political coercion .
Thus we can see that we human beings are deeply , almost ferociously ambivalent about ' anarchy . '
We desperately desire it in our personal lives , and just as desperately fear it politically .
Another way of putting this is that we love the anarchy we live , and yet fear the anarchy we imagine .
One more point , and then you can decide whether my patient is beyond hope or not .
It has been pointed out that a totalitarian dictatorship is characterized by the almost complete absence of rules .
When Solzhenitsyn was arrested , he had no idea what he was really being charged with , and when he was given his 10 - year sentence , there was no court of appeal , or any legal proceedings whatsoever .
He had displeased someone in power , and so it was off to the gulags with him !
When we examine countries where government power is at its greatest , we see situations of extreme instability , and a marked absence of objective rules or standards .
The tinpot dictatorships of third world countries are regions arbitrarily and violently ruled by gangs of sociopathic thugs .
Closer to home , for most of us , is the example of inner-city government - run schools , ringed by metal detectors , and saturated with brutality , violence , sexual harassment , and bullying .
The surrounding neighborhoods are also under the tight control of the state , which runs welfare programs , public housing , the roads , the police , the buses , the hospitals , the sewers , the water , the electricity and just about everything else in sight .
These sorts of neighborhoods have moved beyond democratic socialism , and actually lie closer to dictatorial communism .
Similarly , when we think of these inner cities as a whole , we can also understand that the majority of the endemic violence results from the drug trade , which directly resulted from government bans on the manufacture and sale of certain kinds of drugs .
Treating drug addiction rather than arresting addicts would , it is estimated , reduce criminal activity by up to 80 % .
Here , again , where there is a concentration of political power , we see violence , mayhem , shootings , stabbings , rapes and all the attendant despair and nihilism ' everything that ' anarchism ' is endlessly accused of !
What about prisons , where political power is surely at its greatest ?
Prisons seethe with rapes , murders , stabbings and assaults ' not to mention drug addiction .
Sadistic guards beat on sadistic prisoners , to the point where the only difference at times seems to be the costumes .
Here we have a ' society ' that seems like a parody of ' anarchy ' ' a nihilistic and ugly universe usually described by the word ' anarchy ' which actually results from a maximization of political power , or the exact opposite of ' anarchy . '
Now , we certainly could argue that yes , it may be true that an excess of political power breeds anarchy ' but that a deficiency of political power breeds anarchy as well !
Perhaps ' order ' is a sort of Aristotelian mean , which lies somewhere between the chaos of a complete absence of political coercion , and the chaos of an excess of political coercion .
However , we utterly reject that approach in the other areas mentioned above ' love , marriage , finances , career , etc .
We understand that any intrusion of political coercion into these realms would be a complete disaster for our freedoms .
We do not say , with regards to marriage , ' Well , we would n't want the government choosing everyone 's spouse ' but neither do we want the government having no involvement in choosing people spouses !
The correct amount of government coercion lies somewhere in the middle . '
No , we specifically and unequivocally reject the intrusion of political coercion into such personal aspects of our lives .
Thus once more we must at least recognize the basic paradox that we desperately need and desire the reality of anarchy in our personal lives ' and yet desperately hate and fear the idea of anarchy in our political environment .
We love the anarchy we live .
We fear the anarchy we imagine ' the anarchy we are taught to fear .
Until we can discuss the realities of our ambivalence towards this kind of voluntarism , we shall remain fundamentally stuck as a species ' like any individual who wallpapers over his ambivalence , we shall spend our lives in distracted and oscillating avoidance , to the detriment of our own present , and our children 's future .
This is why I cannot just let this patient die .
I still feel a heartbeat ' and a strong one too !
Ambivalence and Bigotry
It is a truism ' and I for one think a valid one ' that the simple mind sees everything in black or white .
Wisdom , on the other hand , involves being willing to suffer the doubts and complexities of ambivalence .
The dark - minded bigot says that all blacks are perfidious ; the light - minded bigot says that all blacks are victims .
The misogynist says that all women are corrupt ; the feminist often says that all women are saints .
Exploring the complexities and contradictions of life with an open - minded fairness ' neither with the imposition of premature judgment , nor the withholding of judgment once the evidence is in ' is the mark of the scientist , the philosopher ' of a rational mind .
The fundamentalists among us ascribe all mysteries to the ' will of God ' ' which answers nothing at all , since when examined , the ' will of God ' turns out to be just another mystery ; it is like saying that the location of my lost keys is ' the place where my keys are not lost ' ' it adds nothing to the equation other than a teeth - gritting tautology .
Mystery equals mystery .
Anyone with more than half a brain can do little more than roll his eyes .
The immaturity of jumping to premature and useless conclusions is matched on the other hand only by the shallow and frightened fogs of modern ' or perhaps I should say post - modern ' relativism , where no conclusions are ever valid , no absolute statements are ever just ' except that one of course ' and everything is exploration , typically blindfolded , and without a compass .
There is no destination , no guidepost , no sense of progress , no building to a greater goal ' it is the endless dissection of cultural cadavers without even a definition of health or purpose , which thus comes perilously close to looking like fetishistic sadism .
The simple truth is that some black men are good , and some black men are bad , and most black men are a mixture , just as we all are .
Some women are treacherous ; some women are saints .
' Blackness ' or ' gender ' is an utterly useless metric when it comes to evaluating a person morally ; it is about as helpful as trying to use an iPod to determine which way is north .
The phrase ' sexual penetration ' does not tell us whether the act is consensual or not ' saying that sexual penetration is always evil is as useless as saying that it is always good .
In the same way , some anarchism is good ( notably that which we treasure so much in our personal lives ) and some anarchism is bad ( notably our fears of violent chaos , bomb - throwing and large mustaches ) .
As a word , however , ' anarchism ' does nothing to help us evaluate these situations .
Applying foolish black - and - white thinking to complex and ambiguous situations is just another species of bigotry .
Claiming that ' anarchism ' is both rank political evil and the greatest treasure in our personal lives is a contradiction well worth examining , if we wish to gain some measure of mature wisdom about the essential questions of truth , virtue and the moral challenges of social organization . . . .

Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
August 2008
Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup .
The hardest part is making something people want : most startups that die , die because they did n't do that .
But the second biggest cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money .
Fundraising is brutal .
One reason it 's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets .
People who 've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may not have been exposed to that .
Professors and bosses usually feel some sense of responsibility toward you ; if you make a valiant effort and fail , they 'll cut you a break .
Markets are less forgiving .
Customers do n't care how hard you worked , only whether you solved their problems .
Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products , not the way bosses evaluate employees .
If you 're making a valiant effort and failing , maybe they 'll invest in your next startup , but not this one .
But raising money from investors is harder than selling to customers , because there are so few of them .
There 's nothing like an efficient market .
You 're unlikely to have more than 10 who are interested ; it 's difficult to talk to more .
So the randomness of any one investor 's behavior can really affect you .
Problem number 3 : investors are very random .
All investors , including us , are by ordinary standards incompetent .
We constantly have to make decisions about things we do n't understand , and more often than not we 're wrong .
And yet a lot is at stake .
The amounts invested by different types of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million , but the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is .
Investment decisions are big decisions .
That combination — making big decisions about things they do n't understand — tends to make investors very skittish .
VCs are notorious for leading founders on .
Some of the more unscrupulous do it deliberately .
But even the most well - intentioned investors can behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life .
One day they 're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on the spot ; the next they wo n't return your phone calls .
They 're not playing games with you .
They just can't make up their minds . [ 1 ]
If that were n't bad enough , these wildly fluctuating nodes are all linked together .
Startup investors all know one another , and ( though they hate to admit it ) the biggest factor in their opinion of you is the opinion of other investors . [ 2 ]
Talk about a recipe for an unstable system .
You get the opposite of the damping that the fear / greed balance usually produces in markets .
No one is interested in a startup that 's a " bargain " because everyone else hates it .
So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently .
The result is a system like some kind of primitive , multi- celled sea creature , where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing contracts violently .
Y Combinator is working to fix this .
We 're trying to increase the number of investors just as we 're increasing the number of startups .
We hope that as the number of both increases we 'll get something more like an efficient market .
As t approaches infinity , Demo Day approaches an auction .
Unfortunately , t is still very far from infinity .
What does a startup do now , in the imperfect world we currently inhabit ?
The most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down .
Startups live or die on morale .
If you let the difficulty of raising money destroy your morale , it will become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Bootstrapping (= Consulting )
Some would - be founders may by now be thinking , why deal with investors at all ?
If raising money is so painful , why do it ?
One answer to that is obvious : because you need money to live on .
It 's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own revenues , but you can't create instant customers .
Whatever you make , you have to sell a certain amount to break even .
It will take time to grow your sales to that point , and it's hard to predict , till you try , how long it will take .
We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb , for example .
We charged quite a lot for our software — about $ 140 per user per month — but it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even our paltry costs .
We did n't have enough saved to live on for a year .
If you factor out the " bootstrapped " companies that were actually funded by their founders through savings or a day job , the remainder either ( a ) got really lucky , which is hard to do on demand , or ( b ) began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed themselves into product companies .
Consulting is the only option you can count on .
But consulting is far from free money .
It 's not as painful as raising money from investors , perhaps , but the pain is spread over a longer period .
Years , probably .
And for many types of startup , that delay could be fatal .
If you 're working on something so unusual that no one else is likely to think of it , you can take your time .
Joshua Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on Wall Street .
He got away with it because no one else realized it was a good idea .
But if you were building something as obviously necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb , and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your time on client work , you were not in a good position .
Bootstrapping sounds great in principle , but this apparently verdant territory is one from which few startups emerge alive .
The mere fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account should set off alarm bells .
If it worked so well , it would be the norm . [ 3 ]
Bootstrapping may get easier , because starting a company is getting cheaper .
But I do n't think we 'll ever reach the point where most startups can do without outside funding .
Technology tends to get dramatically cheaper , but living expenses do n't .
The upshot is , you can choose your pain : either the short , sharp pain of raising money , or the chronic ache of consulting .
For a given total amount of pain , raising money is the better choice , because new technology is usually more valuable now than later .
But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser evil , it 's still a pretty big evil — so big that it can easily kill you .
Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise money you might have to shut the company down , but because the process of raising money itself can kill you .
To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly orthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors , just as mountain climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal to those used in physically getting up and down mountains .
1 . Have low expectations .
The reason raising money destroys so many startups ' morale is not simply that it 's hard , but that it 's so much harder than they expected .
What kills you is the disappointment .
And the lower your expectations , the harder it is to be disappointed .
Startup founders tend to be optimistic .
This can work well in technology , at least some of the time , but it 's the wrong way to approach raising money .
Better to assume investors will always let you down .
Acquirers too , while we 're at it .
At YC one of our secondary mantras is " Deals fall through . "
No matter what deal you have going on , assume it will fall through .
The predictive power of this simple rule is amazing .
There will be a tendency , as a deal progresses , to start to believe it will happen , and then to depend on it happening .
You must resist this .
Tie yourself to the mast .
This is what kills you .
Deals do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions , where shared plans solidify linearly over time .
Deals often fall through at the last moment .
Often the other party does n't really think about what they want till the last moment .
So you can't use your everyday intuitions about shared plans as a guide .
When it comes to deals , you have to consciously turn them off and become pathologically cynical .
This is harder to do than it sounds .
It 's very flattering when eminent investors seem interested in funding you .
It 's easy to start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward .
But it hardly ever is .
2. Keep working on your startup .
It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup while raising money .
Actually this is hard to do .
Most startups do n't manage to .
Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention .
Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors , somehow that one meeting will burn up your whole day .
It costs not just the time of the actual meeting , but the time getting there and back , and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it afterward .
The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors is probably to partition the company : to pick one founder to deal with investors while the others keep the company going .
This works better when a startup has 3 founders than 2 , and better when the leader of the company is not also the lead developer .
In the best case , the company keeps moving forward at about half speed .
That 's the best case , though .
More often than not the company comes to a standstill while raising money .
And that is dangerous for so many reasons .
Raising money always takes longer than you expect .
What seems like it 's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into a 4 month interruption .
That can be very demoralizing .
And worse still , it can make you less attractive to investors .
They want to invest in companies that are dynamic .
A company that has n't done anything new in 4 months does n't seem dynamic , so they start to lose interest .
Investors rarely grasp this , but much of what they 're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the damage done by their own indecision .
The solution : put the startup first .
Fit meetings with investors into the spare moments in your development schedule , rather than doing development in the spare moments between meetings with investors .
If you keep the company moving forward — releasing new features , increasing traffic , doing deals , getting written about — those investor meetings are more likely to be productive .
Not just because your startup will seem more alive , but also because it will be better for your own morale , which is one of the main ways investors judge you .
3 . Be conservative .
As conditions get worse , the optimal strategy becomes more conservative .
When things go well you can take risks ; when things are bad you want to play it safe .
I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly .
The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the wildly unstable nature of the system you 're dealing with , things probably either already are or could easily become much worse than they seem .
What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable offers you funding on reasonable terms , take it .
There have been startups that ignored this advice and got away with it — startups that ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one , and actually did .
But in the same position I 'd give the same advice again .
Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing Russian roulette with ?
Corollary : if an investor seems interested , do n't just let them sit .
You can't assume someone interested in investing will stay interested .
In fact , you can't even tell ( they can't even tell ) if they 're really interested till you try to convert that interest into money .
So if you have hot prospect , either close them now or write them off .
And unless you already have enough funding , that reduces to : close them now .
Startups do n't win by getting great funding rounds , but by making great products .
So finish raising money and get back to work .
4 . Be flexible .
There are two questions VCs ask that you should n't answer : " Who else are you talking to ? " and " How much are you trying to raise ? "
VCs do n't expect you to answer the first question .
They ask it just in case . [ 4 ]
They do seem to expect an answer to the second .
But I do n't think you should just tell them a number .
Not as a way to play games with them , but because you should n't have a fixed amount you need to raise .
The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an obsolete one left over from the days when startups were more expensive .
A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50 people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount .
But few technology startups are in that position today .
We advise startups to tell investors there are several different routes they could take depending on how much they raised .
As little as $ 50 k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year .
A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire some smart people they know from school .
A couple million would let them really blow this thing out .
The message ( and not just the message , but the fact ) should be : we 're going to succeed no matter what .
Raising more money just lets us do it faster .
If you 're raising an angel round , the size of the round can even change on the fly .
In fact , it 's just as well to make the round small initially , then expand as needed , rather than trying to raise a large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you can't raise the full amount .
You may even want to do a " rolling close , " where the round has no predetermined size , but instead you sell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes .
That helps break deadlocks , because you can start as soon as the first one is ready to buy . [ 5 ]
5 . Be independent .
A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have expenses so low that they could be profitable on as little as $ 2000 per month .
That 's negligible as corporate revenues go , but the effect on your morale and your bargaining position is anything but .
At YC we use the phrase " ramen profitable " to describe the situation where you 're making just enough to pay your living expenses .
Once you cross into ramen profitable , everything changes .
You may still need investment to make it big , but you do n't need it this month .
You can't plan when you start a startup how long it will take to become profitable .
But if you find yourself in a position where a little more effort expended on sales would carry you over the threshold of ramen profitable , do it .
Investors like it when you 're ramen profitable .
It shows you 've thought about making money , instead of just working on amusing technical problems ; it shows you have the discipline to keep your expenses low ; but above all , it means you do n't need them .
There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like it 's going to succeed even without them .
Investors like it when they can help a startup , but they do n't like startups that would die without that help .
At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we 've funded will do , because we 're trying to learn how to pick winners .
We 've now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we 're getting better at predicting them .
And when we 're talking about startups we think are likely to succeed , what we find ourselves saying is things like " Oh , those guys can take care of themselves .
They 'll be fine . "
Not " those guys are really smart " or " those guys are working on a great idea . " [ 6 ]
When we predict good outcomes for startups , the qualities that come up in the supporting arguments are toughness , adaptability , determination .
Which means to the extent we 're correct , those are the qualities you need to win .
Investors know this , at least unconsciously .
The reason they like it when you do n't need them is not simply that they like what they can't have , but because that quality is what makes founders succeed .
Sam Altman has it .
You could parachute him into an island full of cannibals and come back in 5 years and he'd be the king .
If you 're Sam Altman , you do n't have to be profitable to convey to investors that you 'll succeed with or without them .
( He was n't , and he did . )
Not everyone has Sam 's deal - making ability .
I myself do n't .
But if you do n't , you can let the numbers speak for you .
6 . Do n't take rejection personally .
Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself .
After all , they 're more experienced than you .
If they think your startup is lame , are n't they probably right ?
Maybe , maybe not .
The way to handle rejection is with precision .
You should n't simply ignore rejection .
It might mean something .
But you should n't automatically get demoralized either .
To understand what rejection means , you have to understand first of all how common it is .
Statistically , the average VC is a rejection machine .
David Hornik , a partner at August , told me :
The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans received and read , somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour meetings held , about 20 companies that I got interested in , about 5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work , 1 to 2 deals done in a year .
So the odds are against you .
You may be a great entrepreneur , working on interesting stuff , etc . but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded .
This is less true with angels , but VCs reject practically everyone .
The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new investments a year , no matter how many good startups approach him .
In addition to the odds being terrible , the average investor is , as I mentioned , a pretty bad judge of startups .
It 's harder to judge startups than most other things , because great startup ideas tend to seem wrong .
A good startup idea has to be not just good but novel .
And to be both good and novel , an idea probably has to seem bad to most people , or someone would already be doing it and it would n't be novel .
That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges .
You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup investor .
That 's a problem for VCs , most of whom are not particularly imaginative .
VCs are mostly money guys , not people who make things . [ 7 ]
Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas , because most were founders themselves .
So when you get a rejection , use the data that 's in it , and not what 's not .
If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing , look at your startup and ask if they 're right .
If they 're real problems , fix them .
But do n't just take their word for it .
You 're supposed to be the domain expert ; you have to decide .
Though a rejection does n't necessarily tell you anything about your startup , it does suggest your pitch could be improved .
Figure out what 's not working and change it .
Do n't just think " investors are stupid . "
Often they are , but figure out precisely where you lose them .
Do n't let rejections pile up as a depressing , undifferentiated heap .
Sort them and analyze them , and then instead of thinking " no one likes us , " you 'll know precisely how big a problem you have , and what to do about it .
7 . Be able to downshift into consulting ( if appropriate ) .
Consulting , as I mentioned , is a dangerous way to finance a startup .
But it 's better than dying .
It 's a bit like anaerobic respiration : not the optimum solution for the long term , but it can save you from an immediate threat .
If you 're having trouble raising money from investors at all , it could save you to be able to shift toward consulting .
This works better for some startups than others .
It would n't have been a natural fit for , say , Google , but if your company was making software for building web sites , you could degrade fairly gracefully into consulting by building sites for clients with it .
So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into consulting , this could even have advantages .
You 'd understand your users well if you were using the software for them .
Plus as a consulting company you might be able to get big - name users using your software that you would n't have gotten as a product company .
At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company initially , because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer to build merchants ' sites for them if they 'd sign up .
But we never charged for such work , because we did n't want them to start treating us like actual consultants , and calling us every time they wanted something changed on their site .
We knew we had to stay a product company , because only that scales .
8. Avoid inexperienced investors .
Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most dangerous sort , because they 're so nervous .
Especially in proportion to the amount they invest .
Raising $ 20,000 from a first - time angel investor can be as much work as raising $ 2 million from a VC fund .
Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too .
But while the investors can admit they do n't know what they 're doing , their lawyers can't .
One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with an angel , only to receive a 70 - page agreement from his lawyer .
And since the lawyer could never admit , in front of his client , that he 'd screwed up , he instead had to insist on retaining all the draconian terms in it , so the deal fell through .
Of course , someone has to take money from novice investors , or there would never be any experienced ones .
But if you do , either ( a ) drive the process yourself , including supplying the paperwork , or ( b ) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else .
9 . Know where you stand .
The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness .
The worst case scenario is the long no , the no that comes after months of meetings .
Rejections from investors are like design flaws : inevitable , but much less costly if you discover them early .
So while you 're talking to investors , constantly look for signs of where you stand .
How likely are they to offer you a term sheet ?
What do they have to be convinced of first ?
You should n't necessarily always be asking these questions outright — that could get annoying — but you should always be collecting data about them .
Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push them to .
It 's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of information while making the minimum number of decisions .
The best way to force them to act is , of course , competing investors .
But you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion : by asking what specific questions they need answered to make up their minds , and then answering them .
If you get through several obstacles and they keep raising new ones , assume that ultimately they 're going to flake .
You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors ' intentions .
Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate impressions .
Use the data to weight your strategy .
You 'll probably be talking to several investors .
Focus on the ones that are most likely to say yes .
The value of a potential investor is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes , and how likely they are to say it .
Put the most weight on the second factor .
Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply investing .
But also because , as I mentioned , the biggest factor in investors ' opinion of you is other investors ' opinion of you .
If you 're talking to several investors and you manage to get one over the threshold of saying yes , it will make the others much more interested .
So you 're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if you focus on the hot ones ; convincing the hot investors is the best way to convince the lukewarm ones .
Future
I 'm hopeful things wo n't always be so awkward .
I hope that as startups get cheaper and the number of investors increases , raising money will become , if not easy , at least straightforward .
In the meantime , the brokenness of the funding process offers a big opportunity .
Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are .
They'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something that has to be treated as a threat to a company 's survival .
They just think they need a little more information to make up their minds .
They do n't get that there are 10 other investors who also want a little more information , and that the process of talking to them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months .
Because investors do n't understand the cost of dealing with them , they do n't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor to undercut them .
I know from my own experience how much faster investors could decide , because we 've brought our own time down to 20 minutes ( 5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute interview plus 5 minutes of discussion ) .
If you were investing more money you 'd want to take longer , of course .
But if we can decide in 20 minutes , should it take anyone longer than a couple days ?
Opportunities like this do n't sit unexploited forever , even in an industry as conservative as venture capital .
So either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster , or new investors will emerge who do .
In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous process .
Fortunately , I can fix the biggest danger right here .
The biggest danger is surprise .
It 's that startups will underestimate the difficulty of raising money — that they 'll cruise through all the initial steps , but when they turn to raising money they 'll find it surprisingly hard , get demoralized , and give up .
So I 'm telling you in advance : raising money is hard .
Notes
[ 1 ] When investors can't make up their minds , they sometimes describe it as if it were a property of the startup .
" You 're too early for us , " they sometimes say .
But which of them , if they were taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded , would n't offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose ?
An hour old is not too early if it 's the right startup .
What " you 're too early " really means is " we ca n't figure out yet whether you 'll succeed . "
[ 2 ] Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly .
They influence one another directly through the " buzz " that surrounds a hot startup .
But they also influence one another indirectly through the founders .
When a lot of investors are interested in you , it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more attractive to investors .
No VC will admit they 're influenced by buzz .
Some genuinely are n't .
But there are few who can say they 're not influenced by confidence .
[ 3 ] One VC who read this essay wrote :
" We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting .
It creates very bad behaviors / instincts that are hard to erase from a company 's culture . "
[ 4 ]
The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that it would be improper to name names , while simultaneously implying that you 're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to give you term sheets .
If you 're the sort of person who understands how to do that , go ahead .
If not , do n't even try .
Nothing annoys VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them .
[ 5 ]
The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the valuation is fixed at the start , so if you get a sudden rush of interest , you may have to decide between turning some investors away and selling more of the company than you meant to .
That 's a good problem to have , however .
[ 6 ] I would n't say that intelligence does n't matter in startups .
We 're only comparing YC startups , who 've already made it over a certain threshold .
[ 7 ] But not all are .
Though most VCs are suits at heart , the most successful ones tend not to be .
Oddly enough , the best VCs tend to be the least VC - like .

Mr Mukasey voiced disappointment at the court 's Guantanamo ruling A key ruling by the US Supreme Court on Guantanamo detainees will not affect military trials of enemy combatants , the attorney general has said .
Michael Mukasey said he was disappointed with the court 's decision to allow foreign suspects to challenge their detention in US civilian courts .
But he said the trials of " enemy combatants " due to be held at the naval facility in Cuba would proceed .
The court 's ruling has been welcomed by US and foreign human rights groups .
It is seen as a major legal setback for the Bush administration , although it is not clear whether it will lead to prompt court hearings for the detainees .
' Step forwards '
Mr Mukasey said : " I 'm disappointed with the decision , in so far as I understand that it will result in hundreds of actions challenging the detention of enemy combatants to be moved to federal district court . "
He added : " It bears emphasis that the court 's decision does not concern military commission trials , which will continue to proceed . "
We 'll study this opinion to determine whether or not additional legislation may be appropriate
US President George W Bush
Fallout from the ruling Court strikes blow for detainees Supreme Court ruling ( 640 KB )
Some 270 men are held at Guantanamo , on suspicion of terrorism or links to al - Qaeda .
US President George W Bush said he would abide by the ruling even if he did not agree with it .
Thursday 's decision potentially resurrects several cases that had been put on hold in recent months .
Federal judges , law clerks and court administrators studying the 70 - page opinion to work out how to proceed .
And a military lawyer for Osama Bin Laden 's former driver , Guantanamo detainee Salim Ahmed Hamdan , is requesting that charges against his client be dismissed .
" The entire basis for the existence of Guantanamo Bay is gone , " said Navy Lt Cmdr Brian Mizer .
' Inquisition ' Wednesday 's ruling related to two test cases brought by Lakhdar Boumediene , an Algerian arrested in Bosnia in 2001 , and Fawzi al - Odah , a Kuwaiti seized in Pakistan in 2002 , which were consolidated and brought on behalf of 37 foreign nationals at Guantanamo .
Brushing aside the government 's arguments that the detainees were enemy combatants being held at a time of war outside the US , the court said they had " the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus " .
There have been accusations of torture and mistreatment at Guantanamo
This is the right of detainees under the US constitution to be heard by an independent judge .
This is the Bush administration 's third setback at the highest US court since 2004 over its treatment of prisoners who are being held indefinitely and without charge at the base in Cuba .
The court has ruled twice previously that Guantanamo inmates could go into civilian courts to ask that the government justify their continued detention .
In 2004 , the judges found that existing law gave federal courts the right to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals held at Guantanamo because of the unique control the US government had over the land leased from Cuba .
Two years later , it ruled that the president did not have the authority to order the " enemy combatants " there to face military commissions .
The government responded both times by obtaining congressional legislation restricting judicial review of the detentions .
The Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) passed in 2006 removed the right of habeas corpus and set up tribunals to try detainees who were not US citizens .
Last week , five detainees , including key suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , appeared before a military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed dismissed the trial as an " inquisition " .
' Restoring credibility ' President Bush made it clear that the government would " abide by the court 's decision " , although he did so without enthusiasm .

" It was a deeply divided court and I strongly agree with those who dissented , " he told reporters in Rome .
" We 'll study this opinion to determine whether or not additional legislation may be appropriate . "
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , who voted against the ruling , warned that " it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving in a civilian court ... that evidence supports the confinement of each and every prisoner " .
But the human - rights group Amnesty International urged the US government to " finally bring its detention policies and practices in the ' war on terror ' in line with international standards " .
For the American Bar Association , the ruling helped restore the credibility of the US as a " model for the rule of law across the globe " .

Lehman 's shares closed at their lowest level for almost five years .
Lehman Brothers , one of America 's largest investment banks , has denied rumours it is facing funding problems .
The firm told investors that it had not borrowed money from the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday and had liquidity of " well above " $ 40 bn ( £ 20.4bn ) .
The denials , however , failed to reassure the market , as Lehman Brothers ' shares closed down 10 % .
There was also speculation the bank would have to raise up to $ 4bn in additional capital from investors .
In March , Lehman Brothers raised $ 3bn from shareholders to bolster its balance sheet .
At that time , it had to counter reports it was suffering from similar problems to Bear Stearns which collapsed after confidence in the bank failed and clients withdrew funds .
" We did not access the primary broker - dealer facility , " said Lehman Brothers Treasurer Paolo Tonucci , speaking about a US Federal Reserve lending facility available on Tuesday .
" The last time we accessed the facility was on 16 April for testing purposes .
We ended the first quarter with liquidity of $ 34 billion and finished the second quarter with well over $ 40 billion , " he said .
Fox host : RNC protesters should just be left in jail David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The hosts of Fox & Friends were predictably irate on Tuesday about the alleged anarchists who have been witnessed causing disruptions during the Republican National Convention , while ignoring questionable police tactics and seemingly indiscriminate arrests directed against peaceful protesters and journalists .
Gretchen Carlson even appeared to believe that there was no difference between the thousands of orderly protesters and the few dozen individuals who appear in Fox video breaking windows and overturning park benches and litter baskets .
" ' Peaceful , family - friendly march ' -- is that why I was running for cover into Walmart ? " she asked .
Steve Doocy explained to her that there was a distinction .
" These are some of the protesters , and in a moment you 'll see them start to run , " he said , narrating the video he had shot earlier .
" Apparently some of the nitwits , these anarchists behind there , are throwing stuff at some of the police . "
The Fox hosts continued watching the video and making negative remarks .
" Do you know anybody that would grab a cop 's bicycle with them on it and try to take it away ? "
Brian Kilmeade asked .
" They do it on Labor Day because a lot of people have the day off -- even though they do not have jobs , " speculated Doocy .
" They 've got to put them in jail and leave them in jail , " Kilmeade suggested angrily .
" Just leave them there for a week .
... Just say the paperwork got messed up . "
" You ca n't do that , Brian ! " objected Steve Doocy .
" Yes you can , " Kilmeade claimed .
" They 've got rights , " insisted Doocy .
" They 've got a right to free speech . "
" They do n't have a right to jump on top of police cars and destroy them and scare the jeepers out of all the other people , " Gretchen Carlson concluded .
Police in St. Paul arrested 163 people at the protest march , including alleged vandals , peaceful protesters , and several journalists , among them Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! , who was seized when she questioned the detention of two of her producers .
According to a press release , " Kouddous and Salazar face pending charges of suspicion of felony riot , while Goodman has been officially charged with obstruction of a legal process and interference with a ' peace officer . '
Democracy Now !
forcefully rejects all of these charges as false and an attempt at intimidation of these journalists .
We demand that the charges be immediately and completely dropped . "

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) --
The Alaska state trooper at the center of a probe into whether Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power says he has " made mistakes , and I 've learned from those mistakes . "
Alaska state trooper Mike Wooten tells CNN he never drank while driving his patrol car .
But in an exclusive interview with CNN , Mike Wooten , Palin 's former brother - in - law , also denies some of the biggest allegations against him , including drinking while driving .
" I made mistakes .
I fessed up to them .
I was punished appropriately , and I 'm moving on , " said Wooten , 36 , who went through a long , messy divorce and custody battle with Palin 's sister .
In the past week , Wooten 's troubles have suddenly taken on national prominence as Palin stepped into the limelight as Sen.
John McCain 's running mate .
An investigation is under way into whether Palin used her office to push for Wooten 's firing and whether she ultimately fired Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan for refusing to sack Wooten .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , saying her decision to fire Monegan involved budgetary concerns and moving the department in a new direction .
She has acknowledged that aides and members of her family repeatedly discussed Wooten with Monegan or members of his department , but she said at no time did she or anyone else acting at her request use her office to press for Wooten 's firing .
Watch Wooten talk about what matters to him »
Before becoming governor , Palin wrote to state investigators in 2005 , issuing a series of allegations against Wooten .
In 2006 , state investigators found Wooten guilty of " a significant pattern of judgment failures , " including using a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson and drinking beer while operating a state trooper vehicle .
Wooten was suspended for 10 days as " a last chance to take corrective action . "
Speaking Thursday to CNN's Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston , Wooten gave his account of the Taser incident but denied ever drinking while driving .
He said that he was a new Taser instructor , and his stepson was asking him about the equipment .
" I did n't shoot him with live , you know , actual live cartridge , " Wooten said .
Instead , he said , he hooked his stepson up to a training aid " with little clips .
And , you know , the Taser was activated for less than a second , which would be less than what you would get if you touched an electric fence .
...
It was as safe as I could possibly make it . "
He said his stepson was on the living room floor surrounded by pillows , that he " was bragging about it , " and that the family laughed about it .
Asked whether it was a dumb decision , Wooten told CNN , " absolutely . "
The 2006 report called the incident an example of " extremely poor judgment , " and noted that he has been trained in " the risks associated with use of the weapon on a child . "
Wooten insists he has been " under a microscope , and everything I did was heavily scrutinized at the time . "
The father of three , who was married four times , told CNN , " I 'm trying to move on and be the best dad I can to my children .
Be the best trooper that I can be .
You know , I love my job .
I love this state . "
He added that McCain 's choice of Palin as his running mate was " absolutely wonderful for the state of Alaska . "
CNN 's Kathleen Johnston contributed to this report .

“ Simplicity , simplicity , simplicity !
I say , let your affairs be as two or three , and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen , and keep your accounts on your thumb - nail . ” – Henry David Thoreau
By Leo Babauta
If you ’re trying to simplify your life , it ’s best to follow the four simple steps I ’ve outlined before — it ’s just the simplest method .
But sometimes life gets in the way , and you need a workaround , some way to get past your usual obstacles and to trick yourself into keeping things simple .
I use these “ hacks ” myself ( in this case , “ hacks ” refers to workarounds or tricks to reach your goal ) , and I ’ve found them to be effective in many cases .
Please note that you might have read some of these once or twice ( or thrice ) on this blog before , but I thought it would be a useful resource to gather them all into one post .
Also , do n’t try to implement all of them — that would be far from simple .
Not all of them will apply to your life anyway .
Pick one or two and try them out .
Simple tricks to simplify your life :
Three - box decluttering .
If you ’re trying to declutter a room , drawer , shelf , desk … use three boxes to quickly sort everything .
Just quickly go through each shelf or drawer or flat surface at once , putting things into three separate boxes : Trash , Donate , Maybe .
The first two boxes are obvious … the Maybe box is for stuff you ’re not too sure about — you can put this in storage for a few months and decide later .
Put everything else — the stuff you love and use — back neatly .
Create a no-distractions zone .
This is great for when you want to do some focused work — which is just about every day for most of us .
Create a zone with no distractions — no phones , no email , no co-workers or kids or spouses , nothing on the walls , no IM or Twitter , no web surfing .
Just the tools you need to do your work and nothing else .
You could also create a time within your schedule for this distraction - free zone — say 8 - 10 a.m. , for example .
No distractions within that block of time .
You can do email and phone calls before and after , but not during .
I like this hack for when I need to do some writing but have a hard time concentrating .
Create a short - list .
This is for the big - picture simplifying .
If you ’re having a hard time getting your life to something truly simple , create a short list of things you love doing most .
This should be 4 - 5 things .
For me , that ’s writing , reading , running and spending time with my family .
Your short list will be different .
Then , try to eliminate everything in your life that ’s not on the short list , to make room for the things you love .
Deflect all requests for a week .
If you ’re feeling overwhelmed , make the decision that you will not say “ yes ” to any new requests this week .
If you get a new request , politely decline .
If it ’s a request you ca n’t decline , tell them you ’ll get to it next week because you have some projects you need to finish this week .
Then pick one or two or even three projects ( depending on their sizes ) and focus on finishing them this week .
You can worry about new stuff next week .
Repeat this hack when needed .
Go schedule - less .
This works well if you ’ve been over - packing your schedule .
Try this : set a policy that you wo n’t schedule any appointments .
This wo n’t work for some people who have mandatory meetings , but if you control your schedule , you can tell people , “ I ’m sorry , I do n’t make appointments anymore .
Call me on that day and we ’ll see how things are going . ”
Leave your day wide open .
At the beginning of the day , pick a few things to focus on and try to get them done .
If you need to meet with someone , call them and meet .
Single - task .
This is good for those who tend to be all over the place .
I ’ve talked about it many times before : do n’t allow yourself to switch between tasks .
When you ’re working on a report or writing an article , do n’t do anything else .
When you ’re processing email , get to empty and do nothing else .
One task at a time … finish the task … move on to the next .
Try this for one day , focusing on it completely for that day .
If it works for you , try it again the next day .
Start your day with peace .
I love this one , because it ’s so easy to implement and yet it can have such a powerful effect on your day .
When you first rise , do something that is calming and peaceful .
That might be running or walking , having a quiet cup of coffee with a book , watching the sunrise , meditating or yoga … whatever works well for you .
It can be 10 minutes or an hour , but find some peace in the morning and use it to calm you throughout your entire day .

Eat only 7 things .
If you ’re trying to be healthful , but are having a hard time navigating complicated diets , try this hack to simplify things .
Limit yourself to non-packaged foods .
Eat only seven things : fruits , veggies , whole grains , lean protein , lean calcium , beans , nuts , good fats .
Nothing from a box .
This will require that you cook your food , but it does n’t have to be complicated .

Go paperless .
This works great for certain types of jobs — mine , for example .
It wo n’t work for other jobs .
But if you can do it , you can save time filing , save time searching for stuff , save space , simplify your office , and save a few trees to boot .
First , insist that everything be sent via email or through online documents .
Then create a filing system that works for you .
Personally , I like to keep things online , and just archive and search rather than creating a complicated hierarchy of folders , but you might prefer a more traditional system on your hard drive .
Do what works best for you .
For those things that can only be sent via paper , scan and toss .
Try to limit the scanning , and request that things be sent electronically .
Go media free .
If your life is filled with information overload , and you find little time to do the things you love to do , consider eliminating media from your life , at least temporarily .
This includes cable TV , DVDs , newspapers and magazines , Internet news and the like .
Now , I ’m not saying you should eliminate the things you love .
For myself , I would never eliminate reading books , for example .
You might love a certain TV show — in that case , eliminate everything else .
You can go media free for a week to see if it improves your life , and then consider extending it for longer .
This hack wo n’t work for everyone , but I enjoy it .
Limit yourself to 3 tasks .
If your to - do list is long and overwhelming , pick three tasks you want to do today — important tasks that are n’t just urgent but actually have a long - lasting impact on your life .
Focus on getting these three tasks done before anything else .
If you finish early , you can either call it a day or get some bonus tasks done .
Read more .
Limit yourself to one project .
How many projects are you juggling right now ?
If there are too many , you might be limiting your effectiveness .
Instead , focus on one project right now , and put the others on the back - burner .
Try to get that one project done as quickly as possible , and then work on the next one .

5 - sentence emails .
This works well if you spend too much time writing emails .
I got the idea from Mike Davidson , who advocates limiting each email to five sentences or fewer .
This forces you to keep your emails brief and to the point .
It limits the amount of time you use doing email .
And it forces you to decide what ’s important in each email .
I generally follow this rule ( though I break it from time to time ) … and if you get short emails from me , you now understand why .
30 - day rule .
This is a fantastic hack for those ( like me ) who have trouble with impulse buying — that great enemy of simplifying .
The rule is that if you want to buy something , you have to write it on your 30 - day list , with the date that it was added to the list .
After 30 days , if you still want it , you can buy it .
This does n’t apply to necessities such as groceries … which helps you distinguish between wants and needs , a great skill for simplifying .
Only wear a few colors .
I actually do this , and it helps me simplify my wardrobe .
I basically wear only black , blue , grey and green , with some browns thrown in now and then .
This means that it ’s very easy for me to match my clothes , and I do n’t need a lot of clothes .
You ’ll have other colors you love to wear — build your wardrobe around them .
This wo n’t work for people who love having lots of clothes in a wide range of colors , but for myself , it keeps things nice and simple — and I do n’t like thinking about clothes anyway .
One in , two out .
When you bring something into your house , you have to get rid of two things .
The normal rule is one in , one out , but somehow that never seems to work — things still accumulate .
Instead , get rid of two things and things will stay simple .
Work four days a week .
Of course not everyone can set their own schedule , but if you have that luxury , limit yourself to four days a week — 8 hours or less .
You might even set it to 6 hours if you can manage that .
And then make it three days .
But how can you work only four days if you currently work 5 and are overloaded as it is ?
It ’s funny , but you can somehow make it work .
It ’s a well - known law that our work expands to fit the time we give it … and the flip side of that is if you shrink the time , you will shrink the work to fit the time .
If you only have four days in a work week , you will pick the most important tasks .
You will get the work done that needs to be done , and you ’ll naturally eliminate the rest .
You ’ll set a schedule that works .
You ’ll delegate and outsource and automate and eliminate .
And you ’ll have an extra day off .
Try it and see — I bet you can manage it .
Retire early .
This is a radical hack , but it can work for some people .
In fact , it ’s worked for many .
Simply set an early retirement date ( maybe even next year ! ) and force yourself to save up the money you need .
Take a mini-retirement if necessary .
Then go back to work and save up for your next mini-retirement .
Or set your early retirement in five or 10 years , and then never go back to work .
It sounds unrealistic , but if you look at it this way , you can save the money you need to retire .
It means forcing yourself to make choices — do you want to spend impulsively now , or retire early ?
If you cut back on spending you can save more .
Live simply and frugally and invest the difference .
Make more money in the short term so you do n’t need to work as much later .
Limit storage space .
Do you tend to save everything ?
Have tons of stuff in storage , in closets or attics or garages or cupboards ?
The less storage you have , the less stuff you ’ll save — which will save you the stress of having to go through all that storage to find stuff , to organize stuff , to maintain stuff , to get rid of old stuff .
A good example is my desk — I work on a table with no drawers .
This means I do n’t have all the usual stuff in a desk , and forces me to keep things simple .
You can apply this to all areas of life if you like .
Staunch your information flow .
Similar to the media fast , you can cut back on the amount of information coming into your life .
Do you currently have tons of emails coming in ?
Find ways to reduce them — unsubscribe to mailing lists , ask people to stop sending you joke or chain emails ( or block them from your inbox ) , automatically filter things you do n’t really need to read , pre-empt common questions with an FAQ .
Do you read a lot of blog feeds ?
Unsubscribe to those that do n’t give you value .
Do you read a lot of news ?
Pick one news source instead of five .
Send only five emails a day .
I did this for a little while and loved it .
I would pick five important emails to respond to , and that was it .
The rest would be delayed or deleted .
I ended up prioritizing , and while some people did n’t get a response , I also did n’t spend all my time in email .
It freed me , and made me realize that I do n’t have to respond to every email — people will make do .

Jed has a video summary of John McCain ’s Keating Five problem .
What will it take for the corporate media to start making this part of the discussion ?
Since McCain loves to drone on about his extensive history in Washington , this is how he started his career in politics , so it needs to be covered .
It ’s simply unimaginable that we have not heard more though now that an Ohio news team dared ask the question ( the video link is in Jed ’s report ) maybe the national media will jump on board .
Maybe .
OK ...
I know asking for only $ 150 billion is kind of ridiculous but why should Congress commit a whopping $ 700 billion to the Treasury without knowing how that money will be spent ?
Sen .
Chuck Schumer asked Secretary Paulson at today 's hearing how he arrived at the $ 700 figure and asked for an explanation as to why Congress should n't give them only a fraction of that , with the rest contingent upon the situation we find ourselves in in January .
Seems reasonable enough , no ?

" One of you mentioned that you will use about $ 50 billion dollars a month .
If that 's the case , and you 're certainly not going to use all $ 700 billion immediately , and as you can see there are a lot of questions about whether this will work , we understand you 've done your best and you think this will work best , but it 's clear we 're in uncharted waters .
But what about doing this in tranches ?
Why could n't you ask us for $ 150 billion , and on January 15th or January 20th we would come back , we would assess how this worked and grant some more money if it 's really working ? "
The proposed bailout is undoubtedly an intensely complex matter that 's way above my pay grade , but giving Paulson a blank check for a minimum of 3/ 4 of a TRILLION dollars ( and quite likely more ) just does n't make sense .
It seems to me that the Bush administration is trying to rip off the taxpayers one last time , hoping this market " shock " can provide them enough cover to actually make it happen .
Although it 's far from perfect , Schumer 's idea of investing a smaller amount ( if any ) to get us to January -- when a new President and a new Congress take office -- seems much more reasonable .
It only takes a single exposure , and in an instant , your whole day can change .
The infection is rapid and feels potentially unending .
One minute you 're minding your own business and the next you find that you can't stop thinking , humming , or singing " Dancing Queen . "

1 . We are here at Ruby Fringe , so who are you ?
I am Reginald Braithwaite .
I am a software developer and , at the moment , I am doing a lot of work with the Ruby programming language and especially we are trying to reprogram the Ruby programming language .
2 . So what are some of applications that you have worked on over time ?
For instance you worked with Borland Pascal .
Yes , that was actually a really good experience , the company was called Bonnar Associates and the founder of that company Justin Bonnar ended up working for Intuit in California .
We were selling classified advertising systems to companies that do penny savers .
So the things like the buy and sell newspapers that you find here in Toronto or other penny savers .
I have a feeling that industry may have disappeared in the last couple of years , but at one time you could get these big magazines usually printed on very cheap paper , with a lot of car for sale , stereo for sale , garage sale on Saturday , and at the time we were doing this , people were physically laying out the ads .
So they take ads in a big call center and they take the advertisements and so on and they would physically compose the ads .
And some of the really , really , big chains had mainframes that would sort of make the paper and give instructions to these incredibly expensive at the time type setting systems , that could be controlled only by mainframes , do n't even think about PCs in those days .
And Justin had seen Macintoshes but they were too expensive , but he liked the laser writer , so his innovation was we ought to be able to make a system that could print these things on Apple laser writers , and to give you an idea of our sophistication we wrote our application on a mini computer and it would then talk post script directly to the Apple laser writers so we were out putting post scripts which would then do all the ads and then they would just tale the ads which were done on four or five columns on eight and a half by eleven pieces of paper , and they would physically cut them and the use wax , or glue or whatever it is they did , and paste them into a magazine .
So there is no PageMaker , none of that stuff , they just worked with these but it was a wonderful step .
And I am glad you asked about that because as a first experience it was very good .
I got to actually travel to customers and see how they worked , and learned a little bit about the business of selling to organizations , my sales experience was very helpful at that time .
And also I got a really good exposure to what I would call the end to end programmer that is an idea from talking to a customer and that looks really interesting but our business does n't work that way , we need this feature , that feature .
If we were to build this feature , that feature , we would be interested in buying , we 'll be interested in seeing a demo , sort of going through the whole thing from the customer back to doing the technology back to delivering the product .
And that experience has been invaluable with me it's not like I was in the corner just writing printer drivers , or just doing database tuning or something else really specialized , I got a real general overview of a software company as an employee .
And that is I believe served me well .
I should make it clear , as it is actually practiced not as you read about it in textbooks .
Whereas in textbooks we talk about having the requirements and following all these steps , what I actually saw is what happens in most real software companies , I am sorry to say , which is the sales person says " Yes , we can do that for you , you need it by Tuesday , not a problem " , and then he comes back and tells the programmers " By next Tuesday I have got this thing and it is scribbled on the back of my business card , make it so " .
And I am kind of cracking a joke about it , but I am sure many people listening to that who work in our industry will cringe and say " Yes , that happened to me last Wednesday " .
3 . How did you get into the Ruby space ?
What was the language before that ?
So , what led up to Ruby is a long story .
I was interested in Scheme and then I ended up doing some work for a mutual funds company , and we were just sort of getting into the web and so on and we took a look at some of the technologies that were available by doing CGIs with Perl , and some other things for creating web applications .
This company wanted more than websites , right from the beginning they had a very simple requirement : they managed mutual funds for people and people liked to be able to find out what their portfolio is worth , rather than getting it four times a year as required by law , they wanted to be able to tell them and up to that time the way it worked is you called them up on the phone and said " Do you know what it is worth ? "
So right from the beginning they had a vision that once they start a website there ought to be a page on their website where you could go and see the various funds , what the funds net asset value is , NAV , in other words what it is worth today .
And from there , they sort of knew in the back of their head that one day customers would see their whole portfolio there , but the first step they wanted the challenge they gave us as software developers was can there be a web page which is automatically updated once a day so that it shows what the current , yesterday 's , net asset values were , not live like you see today and so on .
But at the time that was a huge challenge .
So we looked at a bunch of technologies and one of them was Java .
Now , I think many people will not remember this but when Java first came out there were no Java server pages , there was a servlet specification , that came out a little bit after Java itself came out , an we had this servlet specification we saw this was not a good way to produce web pages , so we wanted to create our own thing like a Java server page where we could do a template type thing , because we worked with this technology before .
And so we set up to create that , which means we had to create our own language , and I had some background with Scheme , so I said " Our language should be like this " .
And my partner said " Why do we want to use this Lisp like thing ? " and I said " Because it is very easy to parse " .
And that 's how I sold my partner on writing Scheme , so we wanted Scheme to run inside of a servlet so I wrote a Scheme interpreter in the Java servlet .
So you are asking me about Ruby , how does that lead forward ?
Well to learn about Scheme and Lisp I started reading some books and one of them was by a fellow named Paul Graham who wrote on Lisp , and that got me kind of interested and never did anything with common Lisp object system or common Lisp .
I did start getting on some mailing list and Paul was organizing something called the " Lightweight Languages Conference " , and there had been two .
There had been one and I was going to LLC two .
I went to this thing , it was one or two days affair in Cambridge , and this was November 9th 2001 or 2002 .
But I went to this conference and there were two key note speakers , this was in 2001 perhaps .
And the two key note speakers , one first thing in the morning and one at lunch .
The fist thing in the morning key note speaker was a fellow named Joe Armstrong , and the second key note speaker was Matz , so seven years ago Paul Graham had the foresight to realize we were doing a conference about programming languages that the two most important programming languages to learn about would be Ruby and Erlang .
4 . So in 2001 you heard about Erlang and Ruby .
On the same day .
It is actually , I have to be honest with you , though it sounds great as a story , it 's actually overload because it's not a way you can go away and research both of those languages .
And for whatever reason , I did n't get curious about Erlang , but I did get curious about Ruby and I started playing with it from that conference .
And I also played with Groovy , and some other things , but Ruby just stuck .
I really believe there is many rough edges that need to be sanded of , but fundamentally Matz ' approach to try to make programming a joy , or trying to work the way the programmer works , I think he was on to something .
Two maybe reasons if you look at this feature or that feature and say " That 's not what we would like " and so on , but the fundamental thing he tried to do , which was to design the language the way that one might design an Ipod , or one might design a piece of furniture to be comfortable and useful and practical was spot on , and I just found it a joy to work with .
And that got me excited and I have been excited ever since .
5 . What 's the bigger influence in Ruby ?
Do you see both influences in Ruby , do you see both influences of Lisp and Smalltalk equally ?
He 's caught on record saying that Ruby is actually MatzLisp .
However , quite honestly , I see more Smalltalk than Lisp in Ruby in a couple of ways .
First , unlike Scheme , Ruby does n't come down to a couple , like Scheme has five special forms , and everything is actually built out of those five things .
Ruby is n't like that , also Ruby does n't have a meta - object protocol the way common Lisp does .
I find that Ruby is more like start with Smalltalk and then make some functional like things , the way Smalltalk has its own version of blocks , but make lambdas and prox , but build them out of Smalltalk objects which is the way lambdas and prox actually work in Ruby , they are really objects , they are not first class functions on their own right .
It 's not for me to argue with the language 's designer , but I personally feel there is more Smalltalk than Lisp in Ruby today .
6. ou are currently interested in bringing more functional concepts to Ruby with your work on the Rewrite Gem .
So where did that come from ?
Did that come from macros ?
Is there something else in Scheme that inspired that ?
Well , obviously , I have had some experience both with the common Lisp style of what is called the unhygienic macro and with the Scheme hygienic macros .
And I read about Haskell rewriting and on top of that I actually done some work with some XXLTs that wrote some other XXLTs , so I was a little familiar with the idea of transforming trees and all these things kind of came together when I actually run into a problem completely unrelated to Rewrite .
I had been doing some work that involved transforming large chunks of XML and JSON into a different format , and I really wanted a programming language that would be really good for that .
And XXLT is certainly capable of doing anything but it is not a joy to work with .
And at the time I had been inspired by Symbol #to_proc and String # to_proc , and I thought really what we need is Array # to_proc , a way to specify with an array what kind of transformation you want by example , showing what you want and showing an example of what you were going to receive and an example of what you want to create , and finding an easy way to specify the transformation .
Anybody knows XXLT would say " That 's what it does " it just does n't do it in a way that is really obvious and a joy to work with .
So I was really enthusiastic about this .
And then I got involved in writing some other Gems , starting with andand , and a few other things , and I really was disturbed by some of the issues to do with meta programming in the global environment and Ruby , and I would put the plug - in , Matz has talked about , adding selector name spaces to the language 2.0 time frame .
I would really like to see some solution to this problem .
Anyways I have the problem today , not in the Ruby 2.0 time frame , and somehow it clicked with me that my experience with macros as you pointed out , my fooling around with Array to Array # to_proc , and transforming trees , because Ruby programs like Lisp programs , behind the scenes are trees of symbols , that 's the abstract symbol tree or S expressions .
And really what you want to do is transform one kind of tree into another kind of tree .
The trees just happen to represent programs instead of representing the data that one bank might send to another , or something else in the more business like context .
This previous experience with XXLTs this previous experience with Lisp macros and this itch that I wanted to scratch , ho do I do things without constantly opening up the object class , or opening up the nill class , or the array class , or the symbol class , or the string class .
It just came to me : let 's just transform Ruby programs from one form into another and not monkeying around there is an expression out there I will not repeat with the core classes like objects .
7 . So what approach do you use ?
How do you do that ?
How is it implemented the Rewrite ?
So , the Seattle Ruby crew are some phenomenally smart people , and speak of which if I may digress , I am not a smart person .
What I am is a person who is interested in some of the same things that smart people are interested in .
So I will say that the Seattle Ruby people are very smart , and they have written some gems , one of them is ParseTree , and another is called RubyToRuby , which actually reach into the interpreter and extract the symbol tree that Ruby is working with and then they cleaned it up , and I take these gems and what they allow you to do is write something like a block or a proc , and they give you the symbol tree back .
I mean if you give it the symbol tree , they can produce the text of the Ruby code and then Ruby already has a Eval that can take a string .
The painful process that it goes through is you take some code that includes some macros or some transformations you want , you say " I want to apply these transformations to the code " it turns it into a symbol tree , it uses some of the things , very much like XXLT , more like XXLT than macros to be honest with you , in the implementation it simply transforms the tree by applying these rules .
It says " Look for this , turn it into this , look for this , turn it into this " .
And then when it 's finished complying no more transformations it then hands it back to one of these gems RubyToRuby , it says " Give me the source code for the new tree " and then it evaluates the new source code .
So behind the scenes it 's really just taking one tree of symbols and turning it into another tree of symbol using patterns that re-write the tree .
And under the covers or behind the scenes depending on your metaphor , it is very much like the regular expressions , only instead of working on a one dimensional string of symbols , as a regular expression does , these work on trees of symbols .
8 . Have you written a general pattern matcher for S expressions or is this sort of specialized for the Rewrite gem ?
t's what I am working on is very important , so again I apologize for digressing , but I found this to be an important point in my own programming , and I do n't know if that 's a general point but quite often we see something and we are very tempted to say " Oh , this is a special case of a more general thing " , and then we solve the general thing .
However that is an infinite recursion , it 's always the special case of something more general .
And if you are always climbing up the tree into the more general thing you will eventually wind up with a PhD in computer science and no code .
However on the other hand , if we just scrabble around the Earth , and we never sort of pock our head around to see the more general thing .
We are constantly resolving the same problems , we are not even recognizing that two different things we solved are both aspects of the same thing .
So what I try to do is I always try to recognize what the general case is and then discipline myself not to solve the general case until it 's really an imperative , but not to be ignorant of the general case .
So coming back to your question , at the moment I am aware that it is a general case , and I am fighting on an almost daily basis not to make it too general because for example one of the things that really excites me when you look at the world of JavaScript frameworks , the ability to do things like say you see CSS like selectors to modify JavaScript , is very interesting and I can almost smell it in my nostrils , how exciting it would be if we could specify re-writing roles if we could use things like CSS selectors .
When you see a variable inside of a lambda do the following , when you see a variable that shadows another variable , this is for example something that the Java compiler will warn you about , if we had a more general purpose pattern matching agenda that I currently have , and in Rewrite you can write these things using an actual pattern specification language .
At the moment , Rewrite is a little more crude than that .
It looks more like a regular regular expression but you can have some blanks in there , you can have some spots template , so you can say something like Receiver .
andand .
method , where receiver and method are both sort of wild cards , so you can put anything in there , so it can be foo ( bar ) or it can be an expression and so on , transforming into this .
But much more general things which are really exciting to me that I would like to work on like when you see any variable that is nested inside of an expression such that it shadows another variable like do this with it , like rename it or something .
I have n't implemented those but I am aware of it and painfully aware of it .
But I need to get code written so I am not working on that yet .
9 . Probably I should n't mention this but the Smalltalk community has their refactory support is using a pattern matching approach to match the code , but I was n't going to mention it because you will be tempted .
Well , it 's ok to mention it and one of the things that I have noticed is a lot of people of our industry are very ignorant of its history .
They are not aware of what has been accomplished by pioneers working with Lisp , they are not aware of amazing things that have been accomplished by people like Ralph Griswold , who invented the SNOBOL programming language , they are not aware of people talking about the fact that the block syntax and yield was inspired by the CLU programming language , they are not aware of the work that has been done with Smalltalk , and many of these people use Java and always brag about how wonderful the Eclipse refactoring support is and they are completely ignorant to the fact that Eclipse is a Java port of a product originally written in Smalltalk , for Smalltalk using the same technologies , but it just like whoosh right over their head .
And I do n't mean that as a beat , because I believe they are not aware of these things because they have never been made aware of it as opposed they have looked at it and decide it is unimportant .
Hopefully some of the great work that people like InfoQ are doing to get the word out about some of these things will help to spread that seeds that people be curious and say " What 's going on with Lisp , what 's going on with some of these languages that are n't popular today , what 's going on with Smalltalk " and then they will bring that forward , not necessarily they will drop off Java an pick up Ruby or something , but they will say " Hey some of these things apply , I can use them in the programming language I am using today , I can use them in the environment I am using today , there are practical things I can learn from studying these other things that are n't mainstream that I could use with the stuff that pays the rent " .
10 .
Do you think it would be interesting to have a history lesson in the computer science curriculum ?
If there is n't one now , the people who put the curriculums together should be beaten .
Yes , the history is phenomenally important , we have a challenge , probably an industry challenge that is very hard to see the source code for a lot of things that have been written because of the way our laws and proprietary and so on work .
I am not Richard Stallman or anything , but I would certainly love to see a change to copyright law such that software automatically becomes public domain after ten years or something , you know the old stuff somehow just gets out there so people can read .
I can't understand this source code to some of the early Unix systems , but it is gold to try to piece through it and figure it out .
I have seen disassembled I remember I first got into Mackintosh hacking , and looked at dissembled bits of Mackintosh ROM , and just was amazed of the work of people like Eddie ... , but even that is kind of bootleg work .
I would love not only that we teach the history of what we know in academia , but also that we can get to the history of great products that have been written in the commercial world that are out there today , which are inaccessible , which we only get to through anecdotes .
When you meet a person and they give a talk and they open the ... and say a little bit and talk about some commercial product , but we can never download the source code , to say Windows , and see all the wonderful things that must be inside there .
Please have a look at a new impeachment tool that has just been launched : www.PhoneBlockade.com.
Your leadership in keeping the pressure on Congress to hold impeachment hearings has inspired us to create this tool to multiply the effectiveness of the important work you are doing on impeachment .
We are asking people to commit to one 5 - minute call per day to members of the Judiciary Committee , to press them on impeachment .
This tool makes it possible to schedule these 5 - minute calls such that their phones ring off the hook until they take action .
The goal is to make their phones ring all day , every day , until the new Congress convenes ( if they do not hold impeachment before then ) .
It is a way to make sure that Congress knows that we want them to hold this administration accountable and will not rest until they take action .
It only takes 8000 callers to make it impossible for them to continue to act as if business as usual is acceptable .
With 8000 callers , their phones will ring all day , every day !
They seem to believe they can run out the clock without ever having to hold these hearings .
We cannot let them establish this as a precedent .
We hope that with your help we can make this effort succeed and find those 8000 people to make 5 - minute daily calls .
If this succeeds , we will add the rest of Congress to the list .

While it ’s nice to write about issues surrounding gas prices , the latest fuel efficient vehicles and other miscellaneous stuff , I think it ’s time to get back to the real purpose of the site and write about some more gas saving tips .
Today ’s tip not only will help you achieve better gas mileage , but it might also help you figure out if something ’s wrong with your car before it becomes a major and / or expensive issue :
Keep a gas mileage log .
Ever since I started Daily Fuel Economy Tip , I have kept a little pad of paper in the consol of my car so that I can figure out my car ’s average gas mileage for every tank of gas .
Â
It ’s actually pretty easy , does n’t take much time and has allowed me to make a couple quick fixes to my car that helped me get better gas mileage .
Essentially , every time I fill up , I write down my car ’s mileage , the number of gallons it took to fill up my tank and how much money the fill up cost .
Â
From there I just do some simple subtraction to figure out how many miles I traveled between fill ups and then I do some simple division to figure out my car ’s average miles per gallon for that particular tank .
Â Pretty simple .
Aside from being an easy way to figure out what your car really gets ( as we have come to find out , the EPA estimates tend to be pretty far off ) , keeping a gas mileage log is a great way to catch small problems with your car .
Â
Typically , small problems will have an affect on your gas mileage , so if you notice a sudden drop in your car ’s MPG , it might be time to take the car to your mechanic .
Here are some of the things that may be wrong with your car if you ’re experiencing a decrease in gas mileage :
Improperly inflated tires
Misfiring or burned out spark plug
A dirty air filter
Brake pads not disengaging from the rotor
A failing O2 sensor
A dirty fuel injector
Obviously , this list is n’t the be - all - end - all , but it goes to show that a drop in gas mileage can be a symptom of possible problems for your car .
Anyway , I highly encourage you to startÂ a gas mileage log .
Â
It does n’t take a lot of time , but it can be a friendly reminder to try and get the best gas mileage possible , and it can also help you keep your car in good running condition .
PASADENA , California ( CNN ) -- California bank IndyMac will reopen as a " strong and safe institution " under federal management and a new name Monday , days after regulators closed it , the firm 's new CEO said Sunday .
" Come Monday morning , it will be business as usual for all insured customers , " said John Bovenzi , who was placed in charge of IndyMac -- now named IndyMac Federal Bank -- after regulators seized the firm Friday .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees traditional bank accounts up to $ 100,000 and individual retirement accounts up to $ 250,000 .
The bank 's 265,000 customers with insured accounts " should know that their insured money is safe , " Bovenzi told reporters Sunday afternoon .
Customers with deposits beyond the insured limits " are still covered for their insured amounts " and also will " have immediate access to 50 percent of their uninsured balances , " Bovenzi said .
" As assets of IndyMac are sold , they may receive even more , " said Bovenzi , who also is the FDIC 's chief operating officer .
IndyMac was once one of the nation 's largest home lenders .
But the federal Office of Thrift Supervision seized the bank Friday afternoon and transferred control to the FDIC after a two - week period in which customers withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion .
" Our objective is to preserve the bank 's value and return it to the private sector , which we plan to do in the upcoming months , " Bovenzi said .
Watch Bovenzi try to assure customers whose deposits are insured »
Bovenzi said stockholders will likely be " wiped out " once the bank 's assets are sold .
IndyMac shares already were down to 28 cents on Friday , and shareholders wo n't receive the proceeds from the bank 's eventual sale , he said .
During the weekend takeover , customers were closed out of branches and were unable to perform online or phone banking transactions .
However , they still could take cash out of automatic teller machines and write checks , Bovenzi said .
Online and phone banking options will be restored Monday , Bovenzi said .
IndyMac grew rapidly during the recent real estate boom years , specializing in " Alt - A " loans that required little or no evidence of income or assets from borrowers .
But it suffered losses when the market for mortgage - backed securities dried up .

The OTS , which oversaw IndyMac , blamed U.S. Sen.
Charles Schumer , D - New York , for the bank 's failure .
The OTS said a June 26 letter Schumer wrote to regulators questioning IndyMac 's viability prompted the two - week , $ 1.3 billion run on the bank .
On Sunday , Schumer rejected culpability for the bank 's collapse , saying the Bush administration is trying to " blame the fire on the person who calls 911 . "
Schumer , chairman of Congress ' Joint Economic Committee and the third - ranking Democrat in the Senate , said the OTS " ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system , so that there wo n't be other IndyMacs . "
" IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks , " he said .
" It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide , and like Countrywide , it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have .
Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we 're now in . "
The embattled Countrywide Financial Corp. was recently purchased by Bank of America .
Schumer argued the " breadth and depth " of the problems at IndyMac were " apparent for years , and they accelerated in the last six months . "
But OTS , he said , " was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint .
The White House had no immediate response .
IndyMac lost $ 184.2 million in the first quarter of 2008 , on top of $ 614 million last year , and announced last week it was expecting a wider loss for the second quarter .
However , it was not on the FDIC 's list of 90 " problem " banks being monitored by regulators , Bovenzi said .
The FDIC does not publish a list of trouble banks out of concern it could spur a bank run , and Bovenzi would not comment on any other institutions .
When a bank shuts down , some accounts such as annuities and mutual funds are not insured .
About 95 percent of the $ 19 billion in deposits in IndyMac are insured , but that leaves $ 1 billion that was not covered by FDIC guarantees .
Watch financial analyst Suze Orman discuss IndyMac 's collapse »
According to the agency , 10,000 IndyMac customers could lose as much as half of that amount , or $ 500 million .
The agency says the failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund between $ 4 billion and $ 8 billion , based on preliminary estimates .
" This will certainly be a costly failure .
Whether it 's the costliest , we just do n't know at this point , " FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said on a conference call late Friday night .
The failure could also affect premiums paid by all banks for deposit insurance , she added .
IndyMac , with assets of $ 32 billion and deposits of $ 19 billion , is the fifth bank to fail this year .
Between 2005 and 2007 , only three banks failed .
And in the past 15 years , the FDIC has taken over 127 banks with combined assets of $ 22 billion , according to FDIC records .
IndyMac marks the largest collapse of an FDIC - insured institution since 1984 , when Continental Illinois , which had $ 40 billion in assets , failed , according to FDIC records .
The two most expensive banking failures were in 1988 , during the nation 's savings and loan crisis : American Savings and Loan Association in California ( $ 5.4 billion ) and First Republic Bank in Texas ( $ 4 billion ) .

TOKYO -- With PlayStation Portable sales booming in Japan , it 's not surprising that Sony Computer Entertainment is strengthening its online support of the handheld .
Today in Tokyo , the company held a press conference to announce its year - end plans for the PSP .
At the conference , Sony Computer Entertainment Japan president Shawn Layden began by noting that the PSP - 3000 's release date in Japan will be October 16 , two days after the North American launch .
The handheld will retail for ¥ 19,800 ( $ 182 ) , the same price as the current PSP - 2000 model .
The redesigned handheld , the second in as many years , will also be available as part of a ¥ 24,800 ( $ 228 ) value pack , which includes a 4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo , carrying pouch , strap , and wiping cloth .
The color variations available in Japan will the same as in other countries : Piano Black , Pearl White , and Mystic Silver .
After the hardware talk , Sony revealed that Japanese gamers will be able to access the PlayStation Store directly with their PSPs .
Starting this fall , PSP owners will be able to download demos or to buy PlayStation Archive games without having to connect through a PlayStation 3 or PC , which is currently necessary in North America and Europe .
The first game announced for the service is a PSP version of the Japan - only online game Mainichi Issho , which translates roughly as " Everyday Together . "
Sony did not reveal when the functionality would be available outside of Japan .
Sony also announced a new online functionality that will let PSP owners engage in ad hoc play over PlayStation Network - connected PlayStation 3s .
Matchmaking , friends lists , text chat , and voice chat are among the planned features , and the service will be available via download this fall .
All three PSP models ( PSP - 1000 , PSP - 2000 , PSP - 3000 ) will be able to use this service , and Capcom 's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G will be one of the first games to take advantage of the new connectivity .
The conference also saw a number of upcoming PSP games dated for Japan .
Patapon 2 will arrive on November 27 for ¥ 4,980 ( $ 46 ) at retail and via a slightly cheaper ¥ 3,980 ( $ 37 ) downloadable version .
The game will also be offered as part of a hardware bundle for ¥ 23,800 ( $ 219 ) .
Meanwhile , Namco Bandai's Kidou Senshi Gundam : Gundam vs. Gundam will ship on November 20 for ¥ 5,040 ( $ 46 ) solo or as part of a ¥ 24,840 ( $ 228 ) PSP bundle .
Lastly , Square Enix 's Final Fantasy : Dissidia will arrive on December 18 for ¥ 6,090 ( $ 56 ) a la carte or inside a ¥ 25,890 ( $ 238 ) PSP - 3000 package .
Sony also used the conference to talk up the PSP 's dramatically rising sales in Japan .
According to Layden , the handheld was the top gaming machine in Japan from January to August , having sold 2.47 million units --a 189 percent rise over the same period last year .
Sales for the April to August period were particularly good due to the popularity of Capcom 's hit game Monster Hunter Portable 2G .
The handheld sold 1.43 million units in the four - month period , a 227 percent boost over last year .
Layden also mentioned that the PSP 's sell - in and sell - through figures have both surpassed the 10 million mark in Japan .
Software sales have also been good for the PSP , with 6.66 million games sold from January to August , up 171 percent from 2007 .
Of those , 4.19 million were sold after April , a 242 percent increase over 2007 .
The biggest contributor was Monster Hunter Portable 2G , which was released in March and quickly became the first PSP game ever to sell more than 2 million copies in Japan .
As of August , Monster Hunter Portable 2G has sold a total of 2.4 million copies .
Layden commented that the PSP is in a good " positive spiral " condition , meaning that the hardware and software sales are enjoying abundant synergy .
Sony also took the opportunity to offer some insights on how consumers in Japan are using their PSPs outside of gaming .
According to research figures , only 16 percent of PSP owners use their machine to just play games .
Some 69 percent of users said that they use their PSPs for listening to music .
Watching videos came in second place at 58 percent , followed by photo viewing ( 46 percent ) , and surfing the web ( 39 percent ) .
About 25 percent of PSP owners said that they use their handheld for watching TV , given that a PSP digital TV - tuner peripheral is available in Japan .
Watching how McCain has handled himself in the economic crisis has put his temperament front and center in the campaign .
There ’s no way to avoid it .
McCain made it the issue himself :
McCain ’s high - wire intervention in the financial crisis is his latest showstopper move – and his riskiest .
He might succeed , but the candidate ’s penchant for the dramatic has also raised anew potentially damaging questions of his age , executive abilities and , most of all , his temperament .
“ He has been pretty erratic – there ’s no other way to describe what we ’ve seen out of this guy in the last week , ” an Obama aide said of McCain ’s conduct during the financial crisis .
Another Democratic official cited McCain ’s “ erratic , all over the map response to the economic crisis . ”

Democratic vice - presidential nominee Joe Biden said earlier this week that he and running mate Barack Obama could pursue criminal charges against the Bush administration if they are elected in November .
Biden 's comments , first reported by ABC news , attracted little notice on a day dominated by the drama surrounding his Republican counterpart , Alaska governor Sarah Palin .
But his statements represent the Democrats ' strongest vow so far this year to investigate alleged misdeeds committed during the Bush years .
When asked during a campaign event in Deerfield Beach , Florida , whether he would " pursue the violations that have been made against our Constitution by the present administration " , Biden answered in the affirmative .
" We will not be stopped from pursuing any criminal offence that 's occurred , " he continued , going on to praise congressional committees for the deliberate pace of their inquiries into alleged Bush administration misdeeds .
Members of Congress are " doing the right thing , they 're not making false accusations about anything … they 're collecting data , subpoenaing records , they 're building a file " , Biden said .
" If there has been a basis upon which you can pursue someone for a criminal violation , they will be pursued – not out of vengeance , not out of retribution , out of the need to preserve the notion that no one , no attorney general , no president -- no one is above the law . "
Obama sounded a similar note in April , vowing that if elected , he would ask his attorney general to initiate a prompt review of Bush - era actions to distinguish between possible " genuine crimes " and " really bad policies " .
" [ I ] f crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " Obama told the Philadelphia Daily News .
" You 're also right that I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems we 've got to solve . "
When asked about his comments by Fox news today , Biden said he has no evidence that criminal charges would be warranted and no intention of pursuing action against the current president .
" What is true is the United States Congress is trying to preserve records on questions that relate to whether or not the law has been violated by anyone , " Biden said , adding : " But , you know , there 's been an awful lot of unsavoury stuff that 's gone on .
And the mere fact … that it occurred in a previous administration does n't mean [ a subsequent ]
Justice Department , if , in fact , there 's evidence , should n't pursue them .
" But I have no evidence of any of that .
No one 's talking about pursuing President Bush criminally . "
Congressional Democrats have issued a flurry of subpoenas this year to senior Bush administration aides as part of a broad inquiry into the authorisation of torturous interrogation tactics used at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
Three Bush White House veterans have been held in criminal contempt of congressional committees for refusing to respond to subpoenas in an inquiry on the firing of federal prosecutors : former counsel Harriet Miers , former political adviser Karl Rove , and current chief of staff Josh Bolten .
The battle over Miers 's and Bolten 's testimony is currently before a federal court .

Following Demonoid and QuebecTorrent , the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) has threatened is oHunt with legal action .
However , isoHunt has decided to launch a preemptive strike , as it turns the tables and sues the CRIA instead .
The CRIA is known for taking on BitTorrent sites .
In the past year they have threatened Demonoid and other BitTorrent sites , and taken legal action against QuebecTorrent .
Now , they have set their sights on isoHunt , one of the largest BitTorrent sites on the Internet , but this might just backfire .
In May 2008 , isoHunt received a Cease and Desist letter from the CRIA , in which they demanded that is oHunt founder Gary Fung should take the site offline .
If Fung did n’t comply , the CRIA said it would pursue legal action , and demand $ 20,000 for each sound recording the site has infringed .
A similar tactic worked against Demonoid , but the isoHunt founder did n’t back down so easily .
“ We have since tried to come to an understanding , but just as with the MPAA in the US , they ignored our offers of cooperation by the take down of . torrent links to their content files , so long as they provide sufficient identification , ” Gary Fung told TorrentFreak .
Fung has pointed out that , like most other BitTorrent sites , is oHunt has a Copyright Policy , and takes down . torrent files when they receive an appropriate request .
The CRIA simply ignored this , even though they have sent correct takedown notices to isoHunt before ( and isoHunt complied ) , and continued to threaten with legal action .
As an act of self - defense , is oHunt has decided to sue the CRIA instead , and today Fung will file a petition ( pdf ) to ask the Court of British Columbia to confirm that isoHunt –and sister sites Torrentbox and Podtropolis– do not infringe copyright .
“ This is our preemptive strike with a narrowly defined petition for Declaratory Relief that we do not infringe , in anticipation they are going to file their own lawsuit that we do infringe ( their copyright ) , ” Fung told TorrentFreak .
“ Our petition summarizes BitTorrent technology , its open nature and a whole ecosystem of websites and operators that has developed around it , that CRIA does not own copyright to all files distributed over BitTorrent or on isoHunt websites , and we seek legal validation that we can continue to innovate within this emerging BitTorrent ecosystem on the Internet . ”
“ Think of this as a follow up to the QuebecTorrent case , ” Fung says .
“ We intend to take this all the way up to the Canadian Supreme Court unless CRIA settles with us out of court in any reasonable way , ” Fung added .
This is the first case worldwide where a court will be asked to decide whether . torrent files , and BitTorrent search engines in particular , are infringing copyright or not .
Among other things , isoHunt argues that they are just a search engine , like Google , and that they have no control over the files they find elsewhere on the web .
The site is indexing other BitTorrent trackers and indexers , without human intervention , and allows its users to find content that is scattered across the web .
So , should BitTorrent search engines be held liable for the .torrent files that might point to copyrighted data ?
If so , what does this mean for other search engines , and sites such as YouTube ?
This landmark case might be the one to define how files can be distributed online , let ’s hope the Court of British Columbia will make the right decision .
A reader homes in on what we are learning about John McCain :
I 'm poring back in memory , over all the touchstones of McCain 's recent public life , and it's all starting to make sense : his " stands " on tobacco litigation , campaign finance , immigration , taxes , even ( briefly ) torture .
All ultimately about a self - dramatist creating a drama at which he is the center .
All failed efforts , but one now sees that success or failure - or principle - was not at all the point , ever .
Who cares about those things when you get to be at the center of a great drama ?
So now , as with canceling the first night of his own convention ( over a storm , incidentally , that inconvenienced no one ) , he is lurching from one dramatic centerpiece to the next , trying to upset the metrics of this election , trying to recapture that old magic .
In a moment when calm is called for , he sets his hair afire .
Abramoff had been one of the financiers of evangelical leader Ralph Reed ’s brass - knuckled efforts to defeat McCain in the 2000 South Carolina Republican primary .
Book attacks McCain's Abramoff inquiry
A new book released the day after Sen .
John McCain accepted the Republican presidential nomination attacks one of his trademark political successes : his investigation of now - jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2004 and 2005 .
“ The Perfect Villain : John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff , ” by former Boston Globe freelancer Gary S. Chafetz and put out by small independent publisher Martin and Lawrence press , aggressively puts forth the case that McCain ’s investigation into Abramoff was n’t the high - minded reform crusade he has made it out to be on the campaign trail , but rather was pure political payback .

Abramoff had been one of the financiers of evangelical leader Ralph Reed ’s brass - knuckled efforts to defeat McCain in the 2000 South Carolina Republican primary .
Shorly after McCain lost that campaign to Bush , he quit the race .
Chafetz argues that McCain nursed the wounds of that defeat for years , and in 2004 jumped on the chance to investigate Abramoff after the Washington Post published a damning expose of the millions of dollars in lobbying fees Abramoff had collected from his casino - rich Indian tribal clients .
Peppered with new quotes from Abramoff — who met with Chafetz while in federal prison in Cumberland , MD — the book alleges that McCain withheld the vast majority of emails he confiscated during the inquiry , many of which could be exculpatory to the former lobbyist or damaging to McCain allies .
But Chafetz goes further than almost all of the few remaining Abramoff defenders , arguing that McCain deliberately twisted the results of his investigation to paint Abramoff in the worse possible light — and that McCain ’s own actions to benefit his political contributors are similar to the very misdeeds he accused Abramoff of committing .
The McCain campaign did not respond to a request for comment by press time .
On September 4th , just as McCain was getting ready for his GOP acceptance speech , Abramoff appeared in court to receive a four - year jail sentence stemming from his guilty plea in the public - corruption case .
He has already been in federal prison for nearly two years on unrelated fraud charges in a Florida case .
As for Abramoff himself , Chafetz says he appears to have “ battered woman ’s syndrome ” and now believes the accusations against him .
One section of the book relies heavily on documents he found on a Web site that purports to have transcripts of interviews McCain gave while in captivity .
In them , the prisoner of war gave his jailers details about the circumstances of his capture , his missions over Vietnam , and quotes they could use for propaganda purposes .

Clojure has been discussed here before .
It fits in the Lisp family with S - expressions , macros , and functions as values .
Like most Lisps , it 's dynamically typed and impure .
But its target focus is concurrency so symbols are defined immutably by default ; its standard library 's collection structures are immutable and persistent ; and its various mutable concepts are threadsafe except , of course , for the back doors implied by I/O and JVM library interoperability .
See vars , refs , and agents .
What I wanted to highlight is position paper of sorts that Rich Hickey has posted on Clojure 's Approach to Identity and State .
An excerpt :
While some programs are merely large functions , e.g. compilers or theorem provers , many others are not - they are more like working models , and as such need to support what I 'll refer to in this discussion as identity .
By identity I mean a stable logical entity associated with a series of different values over time .
Models need identity for the same reasons humans need identity - to represent the world .
...
In Clojure 's model , value calculation is purely functional .
Values never change .
New values are functions of old , not mutations .
But logical identity is well supported , via atomic references to values ( Refs and Agents ) .
Changes to references are controlled / coordinated by the system - i.e. cooperation is not optional and not manual .
Hickey also addresses the choice to not follow Erlang 's model .
There are other ways to model identity and state , one of the more popular of which is the message - passing actor model , best exemplified by the quite impressive Erlang .
...
It is important to understand that the actor model was designed to address the problems of distributed programs .
And the problems of distributed programs are much harder ...
Clojure may eventually support the actor model for distributed programming , paying the price only when distribution is required , but I think it is quite cumbersome for same - process programming .
YMMV of course .
The essay is worth a read on a couple of levels of interest to LtU .
At an abstract level , it 's a good example of a well - articulated design justification .
Agree or not , it 's clear that Hickey gave thought to his decisions .
Too many language designers fall into the trap of blindly inheriting semantics from a favorite language and end up putting new lipstick on the same pig .
Any language designer would do well to write an essay or two like this before jumping into their venture .
At the specific level , the core approach is certainly worthy of discussion and alternative designs .
Is mutable state really the best way to deal with " working models " ?
Are there things that the pure functional camp can do to make " working models " more convenient , e.g. do Clean 's uniqueness types fit the bill at least for sequential programming , or are they too restrictive ?
Are there things that can make Erlang style actors less cumbersome to use especially when distribution is n't necessary ?

The Death Star plans , codenamed " Stardust " by Galen Erso , were the blueprints of the first Death Star , an Imperial superweapon based on Geonosian designs .

" « The Jedi must not find our designs for the Ultimate Weapon .
If they find out what we are planning to build , we 're doomed . » "
" I will take the designs with me to Coruscant .
They will be much safer there with my master . "
― Archduke Poggle the Lesser , and Count Dooku [ src ]
The Death Star was designed by Geonosians led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser , a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems .
During the First Battle of Geonosis , he gave the plans to Count Dooku , who decided to ferry them to his master Darth Sidious , who would keep them safe .
Dooku was intercepted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in his solar sailer 's hangar , but defeated them and fled from Yoda by dropping a pillar on the two unconscious Jedi .
Dooku met Sidious in The Works on Coruscant . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Sometime after the Second Battle of Geonosis , Supreme Chancellor Palpatine presented the plans to the Republic Strategic Advisory Cell , which started to build the station . [ 3 ]
Following the establishment of the Galactic Empire , Professor Galen Erso and his fellow scientists made modifications to the plans while being guided by Director Orson Callan Krennic . [ 4 ]
Galactic Civil War Edit
Stolen during the Battle of Scarif by the Rogue One squad at the cost of heavy Rebel losses , the remaining copy of these blueprints was transmitted to Princess Leia Organa 's starship and into the hands of members of the Rebel Alliance , stationed aboard the Tantive IV .
However , as the ship arrived at Tatooine to ferry Kenobi to Alderaan , it was intercepted by the Devastator , and Organa , in a desperate gamble , entrusted the blueprints to the memory systems of the astromech droid R2 - D2 .
He and the protocol droid C - 3PO were then sent in an escape pod to Tatooine , where they eventually ended up being purchased by Owen Lars from Jawas , who gave them to Luke Skywalker to look after .
R2 - D2 , however , determined to fulfill the mission given to him by Organa , tricked Skywalker into removing his restraining bolt so that he could seek out Kenobi . [ 5 ]
Luke , worried about his uncle 's reaction , sought out R2 in the Jundland Wastes , where he was rescued by the very Kenobi that the R2 series astromech droid was seeking .
The group returned to Kenobi's home , where Kenobi discovered that R2 - D2 was carrying a message for him from Organa explaining that R2 was carrying information vital to the survival of the Rebellion that needed to be delivered to Alderaan , but that the Tantive IV had been captured by the Empire . [ 5 ]
The group secured passage to Alderaan aboard the Millennium Falcon , piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca .
Upon the ship 's exit from hyperspace at the planet 's coordinates , however , they discovered that it been completely obliterated by the very vessel whose stolen plans R2 - D2 was carrying .
The group managed to hide from the Empire and , in sneaking aboard the vessel to disable its tractor beam , found that Organa was being held prisoner there .
The group , sans Kenobi , hatched a plan to rescue her , while Kenobi disabled the tractor beam .
Though Kenobi was killed in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader , the remainder of the group escaped and made their way to Yavin 4 .
There , the stolen plans were brought to the leaders of the Rebellion as the Empire pursued the tracked Millennium Falcon to the location . [ 5 ]
Upon examination , the Rebels discovered the work of Galen Erso , a scientist forced to participate in the Death Star 's design and construction : a subtle sabotage of the Death Star 's design to include a flaw in the superlaser reactor by which a pressurized explosion would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the entire station .
[ 6 ]
The Rebels determined the best way to reach the reactor was for a starfighter to fire proton torpedoes into a two - meter - wide thermal exhaust port that led directly to the station 's power core , and thus planned an attack with that objective , having observed the Death Star 's defenses were built to withstand assaults from larger vessels . [ 5 ]
Although the target was considered a highly difficult one , and the resulting Battle of Yavin resulted in heavy casualties with Darth Vader coming within a hairsbreadth of defeating the attack , Skywalker , with the aid of the Force , was ultimately able to fire two proton torpedoes perfectly into the port to destroy the Death Star . [ 5 ]
Behind the scenes Edit
The Death Star plans were central to the plot of the original Star Wars film , ultimately enabling the Rebellion to find a key weakness in the Death Star , allowing Luke Skywalker to destroy it .
The plans were also seen in the prequel film Star Wars : Episode II Attack of the Clones , showcasing the early development of the Death Star , known at the time as the " Ultimate Weapon . "
The means by which the Death Star plans were captured by the Rebellion was the subject of numerous , mutually exclusive stories in the Expanded Universe of Star Wars , later rebranded as Star Wars Legends , leading Pablo Hidalgo to comment that " ... if you had to throw a dinner party and invite everyone who had ever stolen the Death Star plans , you'd be surprised at how many place settings you 'd have to worry about . "
The canonical theft is depicted in Rogue One : A Star Wars Story . [ 7 ]
The grid plan animations shown during the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in A New Hope were an actual computer graphics simulation from the Jet Propulsion Labs ( JPL ) made by Larry Cuba and Gary Imhoff as part of a project for school at CalArts , and had been included during filming for Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope ( then known as just Star Wars ) .
Originally , the writers and staff planned to thank JPL for assisting in the graphics , but it was changed to the specific programmers ' names after one of the programmers , Mike Plesset , pointed out that JPL did n't even know their computers had been used .
[ 8 ]
Interestingly , the images in Episode IV ( and consequently Rogue One ) contained in the plans feature the Death Star with its superlaser in the equatorial zone , instead of the upper hemisphere .
This is because in the early drafts for A New Hope , the superlaser was intended to be situated on the center of the equatorial trench , but was then repositioned to the station 's " northern hemisphere . "
However , the film crew forgot to notify Cuba and Imhoff to make the same change to their own designs , thus creating an on - screen blooper .

Four protesters including two Britons have been detained in the Chinese
capital after hanging Free Tibet banners close to the main Bird 's Nest stadium .
The demonstration underlined the clash between competing views of the Olympics in Beijing , as thousands of euphoric spectators cheered the arrival of the torch in Tiananmen Square while foreign activists launched a series of small protests around the city .
Given the massive security operation in the capital and the carefully organised audience , no one expected demonstrations in or around the square during the relay .
Crowds chanted : " Go Olympics - Go Beijing " as the basketball star Yao Ming , one of the nation 's biggest sporting heroes , carried the flame past the portrait of Mao Zedong which hangs on the Tiananmen gate .
US and British campaigners scored a publicity coup by climbing electricity poles at dawn and unfurling outlawed Tibetan flags and banners with Free Tibet slogans in Chinese and English .
Their protest took place just outside the Bird's Nest , where the opening ceremony will take place on Friday .
" We 've done this action today to highlight the Chinese government 's use of the Beijing Olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights mobile phone conversation posted on the internet , " said Iain Thom , one of the protesters , in a recorded mobile phone conversation posted on the internet .
The state news agency Xinhua said police ended the protest in 12 minutes , while Students for a Free Tibet said they were there for an hour before security officers led them away peacefully .
The group said Thom , 24 , was from Scotland while another protester , Lucy Marion , 23 , was from England .
" As far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express
our strong opposition to that .
We will resist all attempts to politicise the
Olympics , " said Sun Weide , a spokesman for the Beijing organising committee .
" We have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations , and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of China . "
Sun said the demonstrators had not been arrested or taken to a police station .
No one had been able to contact the activists by this afternoon
because their phones were off .
A British embassy spokesman said it was requesting immediate consular access .
In a separate incident , a European activist arranged the screening of a
film about Tibetan views of the Olympics in Beijing .
It was halted when his hotel asked reporters to leave , but public security officials waiting at the venue did not intervene directly or approach the man when he left the building .
The video began with an introduction by Dechen Pemba , a Briton of Tibetan descent deported from the capital last month for " splittist activities " .
At the time , she said she had been in China solely in a private capacity and was not involved in any organisations .
The Tibet issue has dogged the Olympics since March 's violent riots in
Lhasa and wider protests across Tibetan areas led to a security clampdown .
Activists responded with demonstrations along the international leg of the torch relay , in turn sparking anger among the Chinese and making them all the keener to focus on celebrations as the flame returned to the capital .
Other protests today included a low - key demonstration by three
Americans who stood in Tiananmen Square - well after the torch had passed through - to shout a denunciation of China 's population control policies .
Police allowed them to leave the area after questioning them briefly .
Journalists received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in Beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint .
The walls had been defaced with slogans including : " One World , Our Nightmare " - a play on the Olympic " One World , One Dream " message - and a list of jailed dissidents .
It was not clear who carried out the protest .
The US swimmer Amanda Beard , an Athens 2004 gold medallist , unveiled an anti-fur advert outside the Olympic village after the authorities prevented her from her staging a news conference in a hotel for " safety " reasons .
The government has designated zones for protest in parks around the city , but human rights campaigners warn that Chinese citizens will be deterred from taking part by the fear of reprisals and several groups have already been denied permits .
Other activists have been unable to enter the country .
Team Darfur , a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan , said that Beijing yesterday revoked the visa of its co-founder and Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek .
He called the decision " part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur " .
Activists argue China has the greatest leverage of any nation over Khartoum because of its oil purchases from and arms sales to the government .
Emmanuelle Moreau , an International Olympic Committee spokeswoman , said organisers should expect people to use the platform of the Olympics to draw attention to their causes .
She said : " The IOC are confident Beijing city authorities will assess the
situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding . "

In the twilight of his eight - year term , George W. Bush is the loneliest guy in town these days .
Remember him ?
With the economy in the tank , the Iraq War dragging on with casualties at 2004 levels ( which we were all horrified about back then ) , Bush ’s popularity is in the cellar and holding .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain is running away from him faster than an Alaskan snow machine .
The media has all but forgotten him , as it covers what the two aspirants to replace him have for breakfast , lunch , and dinner each day .
But historians will not forget him and the few journalists who are still paying attention to him are asking if he is the worst president in history .
Although hard to believe , the answer is probably no .
True , Bush has failed to catch or kill Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , the al - Qaeda leaders who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks , because he got diverted into occupying two Muslim countries in which they are unlikely to be hanging out .
Although such occupations ( " nation - building " if a Democratic president were doing it ) are billed as a necessary part of the " War on Terror , " they have merely inflamed Islamic radicals around the world and increased their terrorist attacks .
Maybe even more important , Bush ’s War on Terror has also undermined the cherished American system of government by unconstitutionally suspending habeas corpus ; enhancing government surveillance of the American public , including unconstitutional spying without court - reviewed warrants ; practicing torture ; and distorting the constitutional checks and balances by expanding the authority of the already imperial presidency .
Yet it could be argued that several other presidents have done worse things .
Although Bush lied us into a war , many presidents have done that , and he appeared to have at least some vague conception that it was in U.S. security interests to do so ( even if safeguarding U.S. oil supplies was the real reason ) .
In 1846 , President James Polk lied to Congress in starting a war with the much weaker Mexico just to blatantly grab huge amounts of its land  the American Southwest , including California .
In 1898 , President William McKinley attacked the frail Spanish Empire to grab its colonies of Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the Philippines .
He annexed Hawaii to boot .
Strangely , the Filipinos were not so grateful about their " liberation " from Spain .
They started a guerrilla war when they found out that instead of gaining their independence , they were going to become the anti-colonial United States ’ first colony .
In the U.S. repression of the insurgency in the Philippine islands , about 200,000 Filipinos died from torture , atrocities , combat , starvation , and disease .
The Spanish - American War made the U.S. a military power and began the long quest for a U.S. overseas empire .
The war also allowed McKinley to become the first modern president  that is , permanently expanding the president ’s powers ( vis - à - vis the other branches of government ) past what the nation ’s founders and the Constitution had ever envisioned .
In making the world safe for war , autocracy , and colonialism , President Woodrow Wilson helped ensure that the 20th century was the bloodiest in human history .
Although the late U.S. entry into World War I tipped the balance in favor of the allies , Wilson frittered away his negotiating power in the post - war peace conference by allowing the British and the French to impose a harsh peace on the defeated Germany in order to get their support for his feckless League of Nations .
The allies ’ grinding Germany ’s nose in the dirt brought Hitler to power and caused World War II .
Wilson also paid the Provisional Government in Russia to stay in the bloody World War I , thus causing the revolution that brought the antiwar Bolshevik party to power .
Wilson then sent U.S. troops to try to defeat the Bolsheviks in the Russian civil war , which contributed to the suspicions that caused the eventual Cold War with the Soviet Union .
Wilson , the most interventionist president in U.S. history , also conducted many military interventions in Latin America , mostly to help U.S. business interests .
He also was the first president ever to mobilize the entire U.S. economy for war and was thus the father of permanent big government .
Wilson ’s violations of civil liberties during World War I were the worst in U.S. history and make Bush ’s look fairly mild .
Although the United States went back to its wise traditional foreign policy of military restraint during the interwar period , Harry Truman brought back Wilsonian interventionism permanently after World War II .
Truman set very bad precedents by purposefully bombing to kill hundreds of thousands of civilians in World War II and the Korean War ; unconstitutionally fighting the Korean War without a formal declaration ; creating the military - industrial - complex that led to the first large permanent peacetime army in U.S. history ; expanding his powers as commander in chief by attempting to seize private steel mills ; and establishing the current informal U.S. empire of overseas alliances and military bases , foreign aid , and profligate U.S. military interventions to police that realm .
In other words , Truman permanently buried the traditional U.S. foreign policy of military restraint .
Make no mistake .
George W. Bush has been a horrible president and is one of the worst in U.S. history .
But of the 42 men who have served as president , these four men  Polk , McKinley , Wilson , and Truman  were probably worse .
As a student of politics and a passionate believer in globalization , I have become increasingly frustrated by the sense that we , the next generation of world leaders , have been completely marginalized by selfish and unimaginative lawmakers in capitols around the world .
It is my hope that this blog can serve as a forum for young , ambitious and articulate men and women who get it .
What kind of world do you want to inherit ?
Under the new rules , any nonresidential skyscraper over 420 feet tall , or about 40 stories , must have a third stairwell and fireproofing capable of staying in place even if hit with 1,000 pounds per square foot of force , provisions that Mr. Frable and a real estate industry group , the Building Owners and Managers Association , want repealed .
As an alternative , Mr. Frable is urging that skyscrapers include specially designed elevators that can reliably operate even during a fire .

Separately , the building owners ’ group has asked the organization to repeal a requirement that buildings taller than 75 feet apply glow - in - the - dark markings on stairwells as a backup if the lights go out .
Such markings are credited with saving many lives on Sept. 11 ; they had been installed at the twin towers after the first terror attack there in 1993 , even though the enhancement was not yet required by city code .
Only a small number of new towers would be subject to all three of the contested changes .
Since 2000 , about 10 nonresidential towers taller than 420 feet have been completed each year in the United States , according to Emporis , a German - based database of tall buildings , compared with about 750 such buildings currently standing nationwide .
The matter will go to a vote next week at a meeting of the code council in Minneapolis , where more than 1,000 building - code officials from around the nation will gather to adopt the 2009 version of the so - called model code , which serves as a template for 20,000 jurisdictions in all 50 states , including skyscraper cities like New York , Houston and Philadelphia .
The council is a nonprofit association that was created in 1994 to try to develop a single national standard for building safety .
The contested provisions will now be reconsidered as part of a comprehensive review of the building code , which is conducted every three years .
Most jurisdictions wait for that larger overhaul before revising their own codes ; as a result , few cities have adopted the tougher skyscraper standards .
States and cities have the option of including or excluding any provision of the model code before making it binding , and many , including New York , make such modifications .
Still , the code is important because it creates a base standard that most jurisdictions try to meet .
Bishop Daniel added : " I have always respected the priest in question and I will continue to respect him .
You cannot discount all the good a person has done in their life just because of one mistake . "
The US is to reopen its investigation into an air strike in western Afghanistan last month in response to " new evidence " about civilian casualties .
The Afghan government says 90 civilians , mainly women and children , were killed in the attack on Azizabad , in Herat province , a figure backed by the UN .
An initial US inquiry found that up to 35 suspected insurgents and seven civilians died .
But last night the military issued a statement announcing a review , after it emerged that film recorded on mobile phones showed rows of bodies of children and babies in a makeshift morgue .
A western official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said one video showed bodies of " tens of children " lined up .
He described the footage as " gruesome " .
" In light of emerging evidence pertaining to civilian casualties in the August 22 counter - insurgency operation in the Shindand District , Herat province , I feel it is prudent to request that US Central Command send a general officer to review the US investigation and its findings with respect to this new evidence , " said General David McKiernan .
" The people of Afghanistan have our commitment to get to the truth . "
The initial US inquiry said its forces along with Afghan soldiers took fire from militants while approaching Azizabad that " justified use of well - aimed small - arms fire and close air support to defend the combined force " .
When scientists learned that PCP , also known as angel dust , can cause every single symptom of schizophrenia , they wondered if chemicals that have the opposite effect could fight mental disorders .
That insight led to them to discover a new class of antipsychotic medications .
To understand how the recreational drug plays tricks on the mind , neuroscientists gave it to lab rats .
Those researchers could counteract the strange behavior of their furry assistants by stimulating brain proteins called glutamate receptors .
Big drug companies , including Eli Lilly , took note of that discovery and started searching for molecules that can push the same psychological buttons in humans .
In the Sept. 15 issue of Chemical and Engineering News , Carmen Drahl told that story , along with the tales of three other experimental medications that could turn the tide against schizophrenia .
Each compound operates in a completely different way , and all of them have been tested on human volunteers .
That is really big news because doctors have been stuck using the same class of pills – dopamine blockers – since the 1950's .
Drahl got the scoop on the new treatments during a special seminar about schizophrenia , which took place last month during the American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia .
LY404039 was discovered by Eli Lilly and works by activating glutamate receptors .
It is furthest along in the approval process .
Unlike other schizophrenia drugs , it does not cause excessive weight gain .
DCCCyB was developed by Merck , and it does the job by blocking glycine transporters
PF - 2545920 was tested by Pfizer , and it gums up a phosphodiesterase enzyme .
TC -5619 was invented at Targacept and it excites nicotine receptors with far more precision than the finest cigarettes .
Schizophrenics tend to medicate themselves by smoking , and new drugs may offer them a similar kind of relief without the serious health risks that come from tobacco products .
If these drugs are approved by the FDA , the social implications could be profound : A great deal of homelessness is caused by psychological problems .
Perhaps some of these new substances will allow people with serious mental illness to become functional and live somewhat normal lives .
Do you have a story about the current generation of antipsychotic medications ?
Please tell us !
Yevloyev 's website is said to be one of the most visited for Ingush news
The owner of an internet site critical of the Russian authorities in the volatile region of Ingushetia has been shot dead in police custody .
Magomed Yevloyev , owner of the ingushetiya .ru site , was a vocal critic of the region 's administration .
The Russian prosecutor 's office said an investigation into the death had been launched , Russia media report .
A post on Yevloyev 's site says he was detained by police after landing at the airport of the main town , Nazran .
The website owner was taken to hospital but died from his injuries .
Reports quoting local police said Yevloyev had tried to seize a policeman 's gun when he was being led to a vehicle .
A shot was fired and Yevloyev was injured in the head .
Fierce critic
Yevloyev was a thorn in the side of Ingush President Murat Zyazikov , a former KGB general .
His website reported on alleged Russian security force brutality in Ingushetia , an impoverished province of some half a million people , mostly Muslims , which is now more turbulent than neighbouring Chechnya .
President Zyazikov had been on the same flight as Yevloyev .
Ingushetia borders Chechnya and has suffered from overflowing unrest .
There is a low - level insurgency , with regular small - scale ambushes against police and soldiers .
In June 2008 , the Human Rights Watch group accused Russian security forces there of carrying out widespread human rights abuses .
HRW said it had documented dozens of arbitrary detentions , disappearances , acts of torture and extra-judicial executions .

Everyone seems to want to know about the economy these days , so we may as well go there .
It 's as great an example as any of a program that not only got out of control , but became so prevalent – so accepted – that we came to take it for granted .
We think of the economy and its rules as given circumstances , when they are actually constructions .
In brief , the money we use is just one kind of money .
Invented in the Renaissance , and protected with laws banning other kinds of money , it has very particular biases that lead to almost inevitable outcomes .
I just finished a book ( more on that later in the week ) , where I make the case that our highly corporatized society was really forged during the Renaissance .
Aristocrats were losing power just as a new merchant class was gaining it .
So they made a series of deals through which merchants ' companies were granted monopoly charters from the monarchs in return for a sweet cut of the proceeds .
Merchants got to lock in their status as newly rich , while monarchs stopped their own descent .
Merchants supported the monarchs whose charters granted them exclusive access to new territories or industries , and monarchs got to do colonial expansion once - removed .
The invention of centralized , national currency was meant to support all this .
Where localities had previously been free to mint their own currency based on the crops they had grown , now they were forced to borrow money from a central bank .
This allowed the issuer of currency – the crown – to extract value from every transaction .
Anyone who wanted to buy anything from anyone else had to run it through the central authority – coin of the realm – one way or the other .
This engendered competition for money , which was now a scarce currency issued at interest , instead of a local currency as abundant as the year 's crop .
Moreover , any business wanting to borrow money for equipment or development had to pay back several times what they had borrowed .
This meant bankruptcy was built into the currency system .
If a business borrows $ 100,000 , for example , they 'll have to pay back $ 300,000 by the time the loan is due .
Where does that money come from ?
Someone else who borrowed .
Meanwhile , local currencies had the opposite bias of centralized currency .
Local currencies lost value over time .
They were really just receipts on the amount of grain that farmer had brought to the grain store .
Since some of that grain was lost to rats or water , and since the grain store had to be paid , money devalued each year .
This meant the money was biased towards being spent .
That 's why reinvestment in infrastructure as a percent of total revenue was so high in the late Middle Ages .
It 's why they built those cathedrals .
They were local efforts , by people looking to invest their abundant wealth into real assets for their communities ' future .
( Cathedrals were built to attract pilgrims and tourism . )
Unlike local currencies , centralized currencies were biased towards retaining their value over time .
Capitalism ( in addition to being a lot of other things ) is the way people get rich simply for being rich .
Capital becomes the most important component in the capital / labor / resources equation .
Since the purpose of the Renaissance innovations was to keep the currently wealthy wealthy , the currency was biased to favor those who had it – and could mete it out at high interest rates to those who needed it for their transactions .
What we witnessed over the past decades has been the necessary endgame of the scenario .
Today , in essence , the central bank lends money to a federal bank , which loans it to a regional bank , and so on , each bank paying interest to the bank above , and charging more to the one below .
By the time the person or business who needs the money gets it , they 're paying an awful lot of interest – so much , that it amounts to a drag on their ability to do business .
The speculative economy , rather than fueling the real economy , drags it down .
The only way for banks – who run such an economy – to make more money is to lend more out .
So they looked for more borrowers , as well as more places to park their cash .
As a result , the things you and I depend on in the real world became investment vehicles .
Homes , oil , resources … you name it .
So the costs of all these things went up not because of any real laws of supply and demand , but because they had become new classes of investment .
As for finding new borrowers , well , that 's why Bush kept talking about " home ownership " as the right of every American , why lending standards were lowered and , of course , why bankruptcy for individuals was made so much harder .
They wanted to lend more money , but did n't have any more qualified borrowers .
By changing bankruptcy laws , they meant to make it impossible for borrowers to cry uncle .
( This was a 150 - million - dollar lobbying effort by the credit industry , over the course of an entire decade . )
Eventually , the tension between the speculative economy and the real economy simply had to become too great .
Lending money , in itself , does n't actually produce anything .
On the contrary , it strains those few who are still attempting to produce things .
It 's what turned so many companies into balance - sheet - driven outsourcing operations .
Only so many bankers and investors can be supported by industry and homeownership .
We 're not really watching an entire economy fail .
We 're watching a particular program fail .
Only because it's not sandboxed like a bad plug - in in Google 's Chrome browser , the resource leak sucks money from everywhere .
If we can adopt what we Boingers might call the " Happy Mutant Approach " to this crisis , however , this is not an entirely hopeless situation .
Yes , corporations may lose the ability to keep us employed as the banking investment they depend on to operate dries up .
But this corporate activity was always extractive in nature , getting ( or , historically , forcing ) people to buy mass - produced , and nationally distributed food and other goods that were once produced locally .
The collapse of centrally controlled commerce and currency simply creates an opportunity for local commerce and currency to revive .
For people to learn to work and live together on a human , local scale – as the original free market advocate , Adam Smith , actually suggested .
Admittedly , this would be a painful transition for many – but it's better than maintaining dependence on a fiscal system designed from the start to turn people and communities into extractable corporate assets .
( Think about that the next time you 're called up to " human resources . " )
Whether or not we 've had time to fully embrace the Craft / Maker / cyberpunk / Boing ethos , our ability to provide for ourselves and one another directly , locally , even socially instead of entirely through centralized commerce , will determine how well we can navigate the near future .
For starters , check out the LETS system and other complementary currencies for how to make your own currency , Bernard Latier 's book The Future of Money free online , and Local Harvest for Community Sponsored Agriculture opportunities near you .
Money can be just as open source as any other operating system .
It used to be .

Conservative columnist : Palin ' clearly out of her league , ' should quit race RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 26 , 2008
Print This Email This After a series of fumbling interviews , Sarah Palin 's sheen is beginning to fade , even among some Republicans .
National Review's Kathleen Parker laments that the hockey mom turned PTA head turned governor actually might not be ready to be a heartbeat from the presidency .
Palins recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity , and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , Ive been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
Ive also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .
In her column on the conservative magazine 's Web site Friday , Parker notes Palin 's life story sets her apart from traditional feminists , but she realizes that those superficialities alone are n't enough to prepare her for the White House .
Unfortunately , as Palin 's recent appearances reveal , she does n't have much else to offer .
Palin filibusters .
She repeats words , filling space with deadwood .
Cut the verbiage and theres not much content there .
Heres but one example of many from her interview with Hannity :  Well , there is a danger in allowing some obsessive partisanship to get into the issue that were talking about today .
And that s something that John McCain , too , his track record , proving that he can work both sides of the aisle , he can surpass the partisanship that must be surpassed to deal with an issue like this . 
When Couric pointed to polls showing that the financial crisis had boosted Obamas numbers , Palin blustered wordily :  Im not looking at poll numbers .
What I think Americans at the end of the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and see whos more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change , and whos actually done it ?
If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself .
Palin's CBS Evening
News sit - down may have been her worst performance in front of a camera to date .
Fortunately for her and GOP nominee John McCain , it seems to have garnered relatively little notice from a press and public paying closer attention to the ongoing economic meltdown and McCain 's ill - fated attempt to sweep into Washington to fix it .
Parker says the fact that Palin is a woman makes observers " reluctant to say what is painfully true , " and she urges the Alaska Governor to drop from the ticket .
McCain can't fire Palin , because that would n't look good , but the vice presidential nominee can cite personal reasons to leave of her own accord -- perhaps she needs to spend more time with her infant son or wants to be there for her pregnant teenage daughter .
Whatever the reason , she needs to retreat from the national stage .
" Do it for your country , " Parker concludes .
It 's about time we start populating the moon , do n't you think ?
I mean , we 've got to do it eventually , so why not now ?
NASA knows what 's up , which is why they 're working on plans for an underground nuclear reactor buried under the surface of the moon .
Badass .
Hit the jump for NASA 's full press release , which describes the plan in more precise terms .
NASA Developing Fission Surface Power Technology CLEVELAND —
NASA astronauts will need power sources when they return to the moon and establish a lunar outpost .
NASA engineers are exploring the possibility of nuclear fission to provide the necessary power and taking initial steps toward a non-nuclear technology demonstration of this type of system .
A fission surface power system on the moon has the potential to generate a steady 40 kilowatts of electric power , enough for about eight houses on Earth .
It works by splitting uranium atoms in a reactor to generate heat that then is converted into electric power .
The fission surface power system can produce large amounts of power in harsh environments , like those on the surface of the moon or Mars , because it does not rely on sunlight .
The primary components of fission surface power systems are a heat source , power conversion , heat rejection and power conditioning , and distribution .
" Our goal is to build a technology demonstration unit with all the major components of a fission surface power system and conduct non-nuclear , integrated system testing in a ground - based space simulation facility , " said Lee Mason , principal investigator for the test at NASA 's Glenn Center in Cleveland .
" Our long - term goal is to demonstrate technical readiness early in the next decade , when NASA is expected to decide on the type of power system to be used on the lunar surface . "
Glenn recently contracted for the design and analysis of two different types of advanced power conversion units as an early step in the development of a full system - level technology demonstration .
These power conversion units are necessary to process the heat produced by the nuclear reactor and efficiently convert it to electrical power .
The first design concept by Sunpower Inc. , of Athens , Ohio , uses two opposed piston engines coupled to alternators that produce 6 kilowatts each , or a total of 12 kilowatts of power .
The second contract with Barber Nichols Inc. of Arvada , Colo. , is for development of a closed Brayton cycle engine that uses a high speed turbine and compressor coupled to a rotary alternator that also generates 12 kilowatts of power .
" Development and testing of the power conversion unit will be a key factor in demonstrating the readiness of fission surface power technology and provide NASA with viable and cost - effective options for nuclear power on the moon and Mars , " said Don Palac , manager of Glenn 's Fission Surface Power Project .
After a one year design and analysis phase , a single contractor will be selected to build and test a prototype power conversion unit .
When complete , the power conversion unit will be integrated with the other technology demonstration unit 's major components .
Glenn will develop the heat rejection system and provide the space simulation facility .
Glenn also will work in conjunction with the Department of Energy and NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
Marshall will develop and provide a non-nuclear reactor simulator with liquid metal coolant as the heat source unit for the technology demonstration .
A nuclear reactor used in space is much different than Earth - based systems .
There are no large concrete cooling towers , and the reactor is about the size of an office trash can .
The energy produced from a space reactor also is much smaller but more than adequate for the projected power needs of a lunar outpost .
Testing of the non-nuclear system is expected to take place at Glenn in 2012 or 2013 .
These tests will help verify system performance projections , develop safe and reliable control methods , gain valuable operating experience , and reduce technology and programmatic risks .
This technology demonstration is being conducted as part of NASA 's Exploration Technology Development Program .

Until lately we were quoting the figure of 20 million trees as the common estimate for the number of trees cut down annually for the production of books sold in the U.S. alone .
Not any more .
And unfortunately , the update is not positive .
We ’re updating this figure to ( approximately ) 30 million trees .
The base for the new estimate is the report ‘ Environmental Trends and Climate Impacts : Findings from the U.S. Book Industry , ’ prepared by The Green Press Initiative and The Book Industry Study Group .
This is probably the most important report that was published recently on the environmental impacts of the book publishing industry .
According to the report the amount of paper consumed annually for books in the U.S. is 1.6 million metric tons ( 2006 figures ) .
To convert it into trees figure , we will multiply it in 20 , as the figures usually used are in the range of 17 - 24 .
So the total we get is about 32 million trees , and if we round it – about 30 million trees .
I was really hoping that the first time we will update the 20 million figure it will be to a lower figure and it also made sense with the growing use of recycled paper for the production of books .
Still , it shows that the growth in production of books ( which means growth in the use of virgin paper ) is faster than the growth of recycled paper usage , which according to our estimates is still less than 10 % of the total paper used for the production of books in the U.S .
And just to be clear – most of these trees that are cut down come from un - farmed sources ( not to mention the fact that tree farms themselves have in many cases a devastating impact on native forests and indigenous communities ) .
Mandy Haggith , the author of the new book Paper Trails explained it to the Independent recently :
No one likes to think of trees being felled , but many of us have a cosy image in our heads that it all comes from recycling or “ sustainable ” woodlands growing in neat rows , perhaps somewhere in Sweden .
It ’s a myth .
Globally , 70 per cent of the 335 million tons of paper the world uses each year comes from natural , un - farmed sources .
In Canada , the UK ’s biggest source of pulp , 90 per cent of its output comes directly from its ancient forests .
I truly hope that this is the last time this number increases .
Steps are being taken by publishers with the support of readers , authors , bookstores , printers , organizations and many others , but we need to move faster to lower these figures .
Eco -Libris , as we stated many times before , sees itself as an agent of change in the book industry and will continue to work with many parties in this industry all over the globe to make sure that the next time we update you with new figures , it will be a lower figure and not just another increase .

Stocks plunged after lawmakers voted against the bailout and major U.S. and European banks needed emergency deals to stave off collapse , sending investors fleeing to the safety of gold and debt .
U.S. November crude settled down $ 10.52 to $ 96.37 a barrel , after touching a session low of $ 95.04 , in the second biggest drop since April 23 , 2003 .
November crude dropped 11.8 percent last Tuesday following a spike in the expiring October crude contract in the previous session .
London Brent crude traded down $ 9.56 to settle at $ 93.98 a barrel .
The House voted 228-205 to reject the bailout bill , which would have authorized the Treasury Department to purchase broken mortgage - backed bonds from banks with the goal of jump - starting stalled capital markets .
“ The bailout package being defeated sent stock markets tumbling , weighing on petroleum as well , ” said Tom Bentz , analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc .
The mounting economic crisis has stirred concerns about oil demand , helping drag prices from a record high above $ 147 a barrel in July .
In addition , investors who had rushed into commodities earlier this year as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar have sold crude for safer havens .
“ This decision is a shock to the system , ” said Sarah Emerson , director of Energy Security Analysis Inc .
“ The oil market is reacting strongly in part because of the implications of a weak economy on demand . ”
Traders also were watching the slow recovery of U.S. oil infrastructure following after Hurricane Ike hit the U.S. Gulf of Mexico .
The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution on Saturday that again ordered OPEC nation Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment work , but it imposed none of the new sanctions Washington and its allies wanted .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
Fifty - six government employees -- including a police officer , a felony court clerk , two corrections officers and 27 school bus drivers and attendants -- were arrested in a scam that used health insurance information to fraudulently obtain prescriptions for the painkiller OxyContin , authorities said Wednesday .
Arrested as " recruiters " in the alleged OxyContin scam , are , clockwise : Janice Currington ; Dwonvalyn Johnson ; Barbara Miller Benaby ; Guyton Wynell ; Marcella Pierce ; and Wanda McNeal .
Sixty - two people were arrested in total and all face charges including racketeering , conspiracy to commit racketeering and grand theft , according to the Miami - Dade state attorney 's office .
Authorities estimate 130 medically unnecessary prescriptions for OxyContin -- more than 12,000 tablets -- were presented to pharmacies .
The drugs have an estimated street value of $ 400,000 , prosecutors said .
OxyContin is a popular painkiller , delivering an instant " high " when it is crushed or dissolved and ingested .
The scam began in January 2003 , when six " recruiters " enlisted a group of people , most of them employees of local government , to participate in the ring , according to prosecutors .
Those employees provided their health insurance identification information , and with that information they obtained unnecessary prescriptions for OxyContin from another codefendant , who was a physician , authorities said .

The defendants filled those prescriptions at pharmacies and sold the pills for cash to another codefendant , authorities said .
In addition , prosecutors said , the defendants submitted claims to their insurance companies for reimbursement for the OxyContin prescriptions .
" There can never be an excuse for helping put dangerous drugs onto our streets , " said Katherine Fernandez Rundle , Miami - Dade state attorney .
" When public employees are a part of the problem and when public medical benefits are used to make the scheme work , these are shameful events .
They are also crimes . "
Among those arrested , according to authorities , were :
• 17 Miami-Dade County Public Schools bus drivers
• 10 Miami-Dade County Public Schools bus attendants
• Six city of Miami Department of Solid Waste employees
• Five Miami-Dade County Public Schools security officers
• Three Miami -Dade County Public Schools custodians
• Two Miami -Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation corrections officers
• Two Miami -Dade County Public Schools teacher assistants
• Two Miami -Dade County Transit bus drivers
• One city of Hialeah police officer
• One city of Miami crane operator
• One Miami -Dade County Circuit Court felony clerk
• One Helen B. Bentley Family Health Center driver

• One Department of Children and Families employee
• One former employee of Family Christian Services

It 's been a while since I published anything about 3D printers , but it is a very interesting development .
In time , 3D printing is likely to lead to the replicator .
A device that can recreate any physical product right inside your home .
This will lead to the same market conditions for physical products as we have today with digital ones .
Just as we no longer need a thousand newspapers to write the same story , we will no longer need a thousand farmers to produce similar crop .
I wrote about this shift in the article , " The Future of News And The Replicators " .
It is fascinating to think about just how much the world will change once we have invented the replicator .
Not just for the future potential of physical things , but also because it teaches us a lot about the shift that we see today in the digital world .
3D printing is still a long way from that future , but it is moving forward at a steady pace .
One problem we have , apart from the resolution being too low and the limitation in materials , is that it is too hard for ' normal people ' to use .
Back in 2008
I wrote about Shapeways where you can upload a 3D model which they will then print for you .
They have since expanded their service to also include an Etsy - type store where you can sell your own 3D printed objects , and there are some cool ones out there like this 3D printed iPad stand for $ 20 .
You can also go out and buy a relatively cheap 3D printer yourself ( there is one on Amazon for $ 4,449 ) .
But the problem in both cases , is that you still have to figure out how to make the 3D model in the first place .
And as we all know , 3D applications are hideously hard to use for normal people .
A couple of days ago I received an email from a startup that is planning to solve this problem .
But they plan to take this a step further and make 3D printing fun for kids .
They are doing it with an iPad app and trying fund it via Kickstarter .
Take a look :
I think this is a brilliant concept that has a ton of potential .
Arguably , the novelty of making pottery is going to wear off fairly quickly .
But imagine , for a moment , that you could create your own toys ?
You know , funny animals like ... Mmmm ... a tiger - giraffe with big lumpy feet called Flumpy :)
On the heels of the announcement that a deal has tentatively been struck to bail out Wall Street , John Kerry appeared on Fox News Sunday and put John McCain 's campaign - suspending stunt into perspective :
Barack Obama was in constant touch with Secretary Paulson almost every single day , sometimes several times a day for the last two weeks .
Barack Obama was the first person to speak and lay out at that meeting at the White House for about seven or eight minutes the entire parameters of what we had resolved .
John McCain , when offered the opportunity to speak , passed , did n't speak until the very end , and when he spoke , did not offer a solution and did not say what he would support .
The fact is that on a Monday of about a week ago , John McCain said the fundamentals of our economy are strong .
Within a few days , John McCain was suspending his campaign because of the greatest crisis since World War II .
He suspended his campaign and it took him 22 hours to get from New York to Washington , a one - hour flight , had time to go do Katie Couric in an interview , had time to give a speech to the Clinton millennium , and when he got here , he wound up -- I mean , he said he was going to interrupt his campaign to come down and save the negotiations .
Most people believe what he did was interrupt the negotiations to come down and save his campaign .
We live in an age of autobiography , one in which young writers cannot even bother to change people ’s names to create a novel , in which a story being true is a greater virtue than being well written , or insightful , or interesting .
I have a few unyielding standards for a memoir :
Either your book must be exceptionally written ( a trait hard to find in memoirs these days ) or you must have done something exceptional .
You must have traveled to the underground or the heavens and come back with fire or golden apples or at least a little wisdom .
It ca n’t just be , “ Daddy hit me , mommy got cancer ” — everyone has a sad story , and it is possible to go through a trauma or experience something significant without gaining any insight .
You would think that the spiritual memoir would be a stand out division — after all , if the writer has seen the face of God , he or she should probably get a good story out of that .
For centuries , people have been telling stories about spiritual experiences , listing out their sins , telling tales of redemption and light at the end of a very dark tunnel .
These past few years , however , have seen a crazy rush on the subject matter , with everyone who has ever thought about religion feeling the need to write about it .
Approximately half the United States population will convert or adapt their religious beliefs at some point in their lifetime , which equals a lot of potential memoirists .
I suppose the thought process behind publishing these books is that since it ’s in the air of our culture , those who are seeking will want to hear other people ’s stories .
But the same rules from other memoirs apply — just because you lived through something , that does n’t mean you have anything interesting to say about it .
Perhaps the bar is set too high by the original spiritual memoirist , St. Augustine .
In his book , he had a great hook — “ Give me chastity and continence , but not yet ” — and managed to invent the concept of original sin .
It ’s not like a recent convert to , say , Judaism is going to top that .
Danya Ruttenberg never really fell from grace , she just sort of shrugged it off .
She declared herself an atheist at 13 , but not because a trauma shook the foundations of her life .
She just found temple boring .
“ The bearded man at the front of the enormous room put his hands out , palms up , and raised them .
We all stood on cue , like well - trained dogs …
It was very irritating , having to keep standing up and sitting down like that .
By the end of service , I could barely contain my contempt . ”
Ah , the teenage years .
Rather than being embarrassed , Ruttenberg lays it all out for us — the social isolation , the Ayn Rand books , the revelations she experienced dancing at Goth clubs .
She builds herself up intellectually , feasting on philosophy , becoming involved in feminist matters , taking college level courses in high school .
But when her mother dies , she finds solace in tradition and ritual .
She begins to pray , and the concerns she had with religion begin to fall away .
Suddenly the patriarchal tone is n’t stultifying ; it instead evokes “ the feeling of a small child looking to a parent for comfort and safety . ”
The question of who wrote the Torah — and the meanings behind the rules laid down — suddenly matter less and less .
“ God was in this book . ”
That is enough for her .
Perhaps when she named her memoir Surprised by God she was thinking , God really is the narrow man-made construct I thought our society was in the process of rejecting .
Surprise !
When people find a window to the divine , they have a tendency to think theirs is the only one .
Ruttenberg is no different .
She falls into the trap of sneering at “ idolatry ” and thinks practicing yoga is “ cheating ” her Jewish tradition .
Yahweh is a jealous God , indeed .
And as far as other seekers go :
If you ’re not practicing a religion to the letter of its law , your experience is not as valid as hers .
“ In order for this to work , one must enter a single practice fully and let go of the attempt to control the terms on which this happens …
A novice practitioner picking and choosing from various disciplines will inevitably miss vital parts of the curriculum — most likely the parts that she most sorely needs , that will require the most work for her . ”
The problem is that Ruttenberg is not a nuanced enough thinker or writer to make proclamations about religion as a whole .
She can quote contemporary writers like Annie Dillard or theologians like Merton , and she does liberally , but whenever she stretches beyond describing her own personal experience , her ideas seem half - formed and unsupported .
Her book fits right into the template of Conversion Memoir .
You could rewrite a few sections and make this a memoir about a woman finding her place in Catholicism .
Confession can be healing , communion brings about a sense of community , sacrificing certain behaviors brings discipline .
It could also be changed around for Islam , or Hinduism , or Buddhism .
These religions have survived because they are good for the soul .
Their practices and rituals feed the needs of their followers .
Ruttenberg is telling us absolutely nothing new .
Had she been able to integrate her younger self — the feminist activist and the student who questioned the origins and implications of every aspect of religious ritual — all while keeping her faith , now that would have been a memoir worth reading .
But Ruttenberg tells us over and over that these questions just stopped mattering as she continued her religious studies .
They ’re never answered — they just fall away .
Ruttenberg ’s unquestioning nature can occasionally become infuriating .
After a trip to Jerusalem , she writes , “ I may personally find the fact that women are n’t allowed to study Talmud in some communities to be morally problematic , but as long as the women in the community freely consent to this worldview , I do n’t have the right to impose my perspective . ”
I had the same reaction as when I heard Wesley Clark say on Real Time with Bill Maher not so long ago that women in Afghanistan like the burqas .
As if it never occurred to Clark or Ruttenberg that if women were “ freely consenting ” to restricted behavior , there were possibly a thousand other restrictions they had grown up with , told was their duty , were made to believe were their burdens because they were born women and therefore inferior .
Her response to the matter is to walk around Jerusalem with a yarmulke and some red lipstick .
Maybe Ruttenberg should be introduced to Robert N. Levine .
While his latest book What God Can Do for You Now seems to have been written in an effort to find the middle ground between fundamentalist works like The Purpose - Driven Life and the atheist bestsellers , he directly addresses the questions that Ruttenberg deems unimportant .
I knew Levine was a kindred spirit when I read that his faith stumbled when he thought about the plague of the death of the first born in Exodus .
He does n’t shrug it off by saying that it ultimately does n’t matter ; he states , “ Perhaps our sources are guilty of faulty intelligence . ”
The Torah , the Bible , and the Quran are not the direct word of God .
They were written by men and they are full of holes and contradictions .
Acknowledging that does not destroy the power of faith — it instead gives you some flexibility .
To Levine , what matters is action .
He does n’t mean keeping kosher or resting on the Sabbath .
“ When you do what God would do if standing in our midst , when you act godly , you will find God. Really . ”
The title is misleading , then .
Forgive me , but it ’s not what God can do for you , but what you can do for God .
That is , protect his creation , take care of your fellow man , and respect yourself .
The spiritual healing comes out of these actions , not from just not turning on the lights one day a week .
While I do n’t agree with most of the arguments laid out in What God Can Do — particularly his idea that God is not omnipotent , and his chapter on why he thinks evolution was guided by an intelligent force — I still enjoyed reading his thoughts .
It was more of a discussion or a debate than a lecture .
I did not feel like he would judge me if I suddenly wanted to take up yoga ( unlikely — I hate all of that breathing ) , or if the way I make sense out of the world is to believe in reincarnation .
Those other parts of religion , the dietary restrictions , the discipline , the rules of how to live are there if you need them , but you can have a relationship with God even if you reject the rest .
And Levine wo n’t call you shallow if you are thoughtful about your beliefs and actions .
I ’ve read more than a half dozen spiritual memoirs in the past year — and attempted to read even more than that but could not get past 50 pages — and it ’s disappointing how unfocused the memoirists become when they look beyond their own lives and needs .
If I ’m looking for a new concept of what God is or a new way to think about the divine , I am obviously looking in the wrong place .
I should put the memoirs down and head back to the theologians and philosophers .

Senator introduces bill to ban practice allowing Bush to secretly change meaning of laws Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008

The Bush administration 's practice of relying on classified legal " opinions " from the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Council to reinterpret laws to mean whatever the president needs them to mean has produced such gems as " extraordinary rendition " and " enhanced interrogation . "
With George W. Bush just a few short months from returning to his Texas ranch full time , two Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would prevent the White House 's next occupant from engaging in similar efforts to rewrite the law .
 This administration has used OLC opinions to develop a secret set of binding rules that fly in the face of laws passed by Congress on matters ranging from torture to warrantless wiretapping ,  Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) said in a news release .
 By hiding these opinions from view , the administration prevents Congress from restoring the rule of law through oversight or legislation .
This bill represents an important step toward curbing secret law and restoring the balance of power between the White House and Congress . 
Feingold , who has been among the fiercest critics of the administration 's power grabs , introduced the OLC Reporting Act in the Senate , with Rep. Brad Miller ( D - NC ) introducing companion legislation in the House .
It 's unlikely the bill will be passed this year -- and even if it was , Bush would almost certainly veto it -- but the legislation provides a starting point for the next Congress to begin undoing Bush 's damage .
According to a release from Feingold 's office , the bill would : · Require the Attorney General to notify Congress within 30 days when the Justice Department issues a legal opinion that : o concludes that a federal statute is unconstitutional ;
o relies on the doctrine of constitutional avoidance ,  which was used by Yoo and his colleagues to justify strained interpretations of the law ;
o relies on other interpretive tools to avoid applying the law to the executive branch ; or
o decides that a federal law has been repealed by a later statute when the later statute does not say so explicitly .
· Retain existing statutory protections for privileged information , while ensuring that Congress receives the information necessary to perform its legislative and oversight functions .
· Protect national security through special procedures for the submission of classified information .
Feingold recently held hearings on Bush 's reliance on secret law in the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , which he chairs .
The Wisconsin Democrat is among the Senate 's fiercest civil libertarians and was an outspoken opponent of the Foreign Intelligence Service Act amendments Congress adopted earlier this year .
In keeping with his focus on instituting corrections in the next administration , Feingold held a hearing Tuesday on restoring the rule of law .
A former physics teacher , Mr Ellerton introduced the philosophy and critical thinking program to Calamvale after joining a network of Queensland teachers which promotes and spreads the teaching of philosophy in high schools throughout the state .
" Some people do n't understand what we mean by philosophy - they think it 's just discussion , " Mr Ellerton said .
" The truth is it 's a rigorous and analytical subject ; you have to do it properly .
We do n't discuss the meaning of life .
As a subject , I think it 's more fundamental than maths or English . "
The teaching of philosophy in Queensland high schools is not new .
The subject has been taught , in one form or another , for 50 years .
Other states have been quick to catch up , with Western Australia introducing a philosophy high - school program in the last year , and Victoria in the past five years .
But in NSW the situation remains uncertain .
The NSW Board of Studies offers philosophy as a distinction course only to students who have already sat the HSC exams .
The course is delivered through universities , and , although it contributes to the student 's UAI , attendance numbers are not high : the Board of Studies data shows only 54 students enrolled in the philosophy distinction course last year .
The Board of Studies also endorses school - developed courses in general philosophy , but only a handful of high schools in NSW that have taken up this offer .
One such high school is Newington College in Stanmore .
The school offers critical thinking courses for each year group , as well as a moral philosophy course for years 10 to 12 .
The school introduced the International Baccalaureate in 2007 , which includes a theory of knowledge component .
Jeremy Hall , a teacher at Newington , believes teaching philosophy in high school is the basis of a good education .
" We live in an increasingly complex world , " Mr Hall says .
" Whether it is genetics , war , globalisation or environmental issues , we need students to be engaged with these issues at a level that goes beyond superficial .
" Philosophy helps students to think critically , provide good reasons for being persuaded and explore their beliefs and values . "
But why are n't more high schools in the state catching on ?
Phil Cam is an associate professor in the school of history and philosophy at the University of NSW and the president of the Philosophy for Schools Association of NSW - a group that aims to introduce philosophy to more high schools around the state .
For him , the lack of philosophy in NSW high schools is nothing short of an embarrassment .
" No one is seriously looking at teaching philosophy in high schools in NSW , " Dr Cam said .
" Philosophy is actually doing very well in other states , so it 's clear we 're behind in educational innovation .
" Would the world be a better place if kids began learning philosophy in school ?
Yes .
It would result in a more inquiring society , a society of thinkers who are rational and reasonable . "
On the world stage , philosophy is part of the high school curriculum throughout Europe and Latin America ; it 's only the English - speaking countries such as the United States , Britain , New Zealand , Canada and Australia that are to catch up .
" I think philosophy will eventually be added as a high school subject throughout Australia , " Dr Cam says .
" It 's a matter of strengthening what 's already happening in the curriculum . "
Mr Ellerton agrees .
In June this year he started the Australian Philosophy Teachers Network , to provide philosophy teachers across the country with the ability to download and share resources freely and easily .
" The problem in Australia is a lack of qualified philosophy teachers , " he said .
" My interest is in distributing and collecting resources for the teachers already teaching , and inspiring a few more to start .
" Overall , I think we need more teachers to bring philosophy into common ground , and understanding how great the skills it gives students are .
It 's a system of understanding the world , and what could be more precious than that ? "
The Queensland program is taught to year 10 , 11 and 12 students at Calamvale and is composed of three strands : deductive logic , critical thinking and pure philosophy .
Students are instructed in the teachings of the great philosophers as well as reasoning , argumentation and spotting fallacies .
Mr Ellerton discovered a newfound scepticism in his students after just one year .
" Once my students realised that they were learning to reason , they seemed to be shocked that it was n't taught to them earlier , " he said .
" I think it 's one of the most important things in life .
A student even said to me that learning philosophy was like flipping a light switch inside his head .
It 's encouraging for me as a teacher to elicit this kind of response . "
True enough , philosophy has left a big impression on students such as Said , and Nikki Greethead and Sara Merlino , who all study under Mr Ellerton .
" I now question absolutely everything , and I take everyone 's word as opinion and not fact , " Said says .
" Being able to distinguish the difference between those two , I think , is priceless .
Learning logic and reason has helped me find my moral compass .
For a long time I 'd been wondering why should I do what someone tells me , and philosophy gave me tools to reason and find answers . "
Nikki found she was " far more likely to think things through now , and ask for more detailed reasoning .
Nothing forces you to ask yourself ' why ' quite like philosophy . "
As for Sara : " I 'm Christian so I had very firm beliefs to begin with .
But I found that even then I was able to become more sceptical and think about things in a different way because I had learnt to reason .
Philosophy is not a yes or no subject . "
It seems that learning philosophy in high school also helps students to draw parallels to other subjects , encouraging their development in different areas .
" What we 've found looking at the final year exams of Queensland students is that those who have studied philosophy perform better across all subjects , " Mr Ellerton said .
" The result is kids who are critical thinkers and informed citizens .
It 's a big call to say the world would be a better place if everyone was taught philosophy young , but what you 'd certainly get is a more informed and critical population , which can only be a good thing .
This is incentive enough to see philosophy subject taught in other states . "

The brain is the key organ in the response to stress .
It reacts in a complex , orchestrated manner that is related to the activation and inhibition of neural structures involved in sensory , motor , autonomic , cognitive and emotional processes .
It is the brain which finally determines what in the world is threatening and might be stressful for us , and which regulates the stress responses that can be either adaptive or maladaptive .
Chronic stress can affect the brain and lead into depression : Environmental stressors ( e.g. job and family situation , neighborhood ) and especially stressful life events such as trauma or abuse are amongst the most potent factors to induce depression .
Since the development of novel approaches to antidepressant treatment is based upon an improved neurobiological understanding of this condition , new information about the cellular changes that take place in the brain is required .
Depression : a growing public health burden
Depression is a chronic , recurring , multifactorial , and life - threatening disorder , which represents a collection of psychological , neuroendocrine , physiological and behavioural symptoms .
Chronicity and frequency of these symptoms constitute the clinical condition .
Depressive disorders affect up to 20 % of people at some time in their life .
In primary care , an estimated 20 % of patients suffer from depression , but often are not diagnosed correctly ( Wittchen , 2000 ) .
Depressive disorders are among the most prevalent illnesses worldwide , producing significant public health and socioeconomic problems ( WHO , 2001 ) .
The immense costs of depression account for approximately 1 % of the gross domestic product in Europe ( approximately 100 billion Euro ) .
Depression is affecting more than 120 million people globally , and is set to rise to become one of the leading causes of disability , second only to cardiovascular disease , by the year 2015 .
Brain changes induced by stress and depression
The areas of the brain that are most affected by the changes caused by depression are the prefrontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus , which are central to emotion , memory and learning .
Structural and functional changes as a consequence of stress and / or major depression are a reduction in volume , neuronal size and density , associated with changes in cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism ( see figure 1 ) .
In addition , there is a reduced density of glial support cells that are instrumental in the communication between nerve cells , which is particularly relevant to the reduced volume of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus .
The shrinkage might explain some of the emotional changes observed in people with depression .
Neurogenesis in the adult brain
The ´stress hypothesis´ of affective disorders has stimulated the development of putative animal models of depression .
Animal models today are generally regarded as invaluable in preclinical research on human psychopathology , and are thus of prime interest in studying the pathophysiology of depression and specific responses to antidepressant drug treatments .
The discovery that the adult nervous system is capable of replacing its cells has attracted considerable interest in the scientific community .
Up to now , neural networks in adults have been thought to be fixed and immutable , without the potential to regenerate :
This assumption was prominently pronounced by the famous Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramon y Cajal , who postulated that „ everything may die , nothing may regenerate " ( Cajal , 1928 ) .
Current research has overcome this view and has shown that the formation of new nerve cells ( =neurogenesis ) also takes place in the adult brain .
Neurogenesis can be modified by positive modulators such as learning , physical exercise , and hormonal influence , as well as negative modulators such as acute and chronic stress .
While stress has been found to inhibit adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus - a brain area that is central to emotion , memory and learning - , antidepressant treatment has the opposite effect .
Moreover , patients with mood disorders often have reduced hippocampal volumes .
This evidence rapidly led to the formulation of the ' neurogenesis hypothesis ' of depression , which says that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is a candidate substrate for both the etiology and the treatment of major depressive disorders .
However , according to the current view , newborn cells in the hippocampus per se may not be critical for the development of depression , but may be required for certain behavioural effects of antidepressants ( Sahay & Hen , 2007 ) .
Recent research has proven that the adult brain is capable of generating new nerve cells ( neurons ) .
Neurogenesis can be influenced by positive and negative modulators .
The role of gliogenesis
There is increasing evidence that in addition to neurogenesis , stress and antidepressant treatment also induce changes in the formation of specific glial support cells ( =gliogenesis ) that are critical for the survival of the neurons in the brain .
There are about 100 times more glial cells than nerve cells , providing energy and nutrition to the neurons .
Besides their ´housekeeping ´ functions , glial cells are instrumental to neural communication and regarded as dynamic regulators of synaptic strength and synapse formation .
They also possess receptors for neurotransmitters and steroid hormones that , similarly to receptors of neurons , can trigger electrical and biochemical events in the cell .
Therefore , structural changes of glial cells are likely to have an important functional significance for the communication between neurons and between neurons and glial cells .
In the adult brain various antidepressant treatment strategies can not only stimulate neurogenesis , but also exert similar stimulatory effects on gliogenesis .
Moreover , animal studies have recently shown that chronic stress inhibits cell proliferation not only in the hippocampus but also in the prefrontal cortex , and that this inhibitory effect can be counteracted by antidepressant treatment ( Czéh et al. , 2007 ) .
The significance of these observations is strengthened by in vivo neuroimaging studies in patients with mood disorders that consistently point to the involvement of prefrontal brain sites in the pathophysiology of the disease .
These imaging findings are further supported by reports on human post - mortem tissues revealing that the number of glial cells in the prefrontal cortex is adversely affected in patients with mood disorders .
Experiments show that stress and depression inhibit the growth of new nerve cells as well as glial support cells , and that this inhibitory effect can be counteracted by antidepressive therapy .
Clinical implications
Within the last two decades , the understanding of the mature brain has changed : Neuronal and glial cell networks in the brain are far from being fixed and immutable - a multitude of factors such as environmental stimulation , learning , growth factors , glucocorticoids , sexual hormones , stress , aging , and several neurotransmitters regulate the generation of new neurons .
Antidepressants stimulate the growth of neurons and glial cells again so the brain changes that occur as a consequence of stress and depression are generally reversible .
Today it is widely believed that neurogenesis in the adult brain is restricted to selected brain regions such as zones of the hippocampus and the lateral brain ventricles .
However , a growing number of recent studies describe the generation of new neurons also in the adult neocortex .
Although small in both number and size , these new cells could have a significant impact on neocortical function .
Interrelation between psychiatric diseases and adult neocortical cytogenesis is suggested by preclinical studies of stress ( inhibiting cytogenesis ) and antidepressive treatment ( stimulating cytogenesis ) , but so far the existence of a causative relationship remains speculative .
Nevertheless these findings should encourage further studies on neocortical cytogenesis and its function in affective disorders such as depression , which may provide additional evidence that impairments of brain neuroplasticity are important features of depressive disorders .
On the basis of this research it might be possible to develop new strategies for more effective therapies of depressive diseases .
These discoveries show that brain cells can be adversely affected by stress and depression which may lead to a new approach to antidepressant treatment .

メイクは落ちたけど毛穴や肌の汚れが落ちてる・・？
クレンジングゲルは敏感肌でも使いやすいメイク落としだと思います。私も乾燥タイプの敏感肌で色々とクレンジングを変えてつかってみましたが・・などなど、なかなかこれはいいぞ！と感じるクレンジングが見つからなかったんですね。そんな中クレンジングジェルを試して見たら、それぞれのクレンジングのいいところを集結させたような使い心地で非常に便利だし肌荒れもしにくかったんです。かなり昔にジェルタイプのクレンジングを使ったときにはイマイチだったのですが、ここ近年で随分いい商品が増えてきたんだなと思いました。肌の調子が大分よくなった現在は、メイク落としもそれぞれ進化したこともあって使えるタイプが増えましたが、それでもしっかりメイクの時、毛穴の汚れが気になるとき、それらにプラスして肌の調子が落ち気味の時にはクレンジングジェルを使います。やっぱり安心して使えるのがいいですよ♪実際に敏感肌の人でクレンジングジェルを愛用しているという口コミも結構見かけます。また敏感肌ブランドでクレンジングジェルを展開している所も多くやっぱり肌の負担が少ないのかなと思います。ミルククレンジングも低刺激と一時期人気がありましたが、敏感肌の場合油分が合わなかったり、落ちが悪くて何度も顔をこするため逆に負担になるなどの口コミもあります。管理人も実際それを感じました。そしてクレンジングゲルに変えてからの方がすごく調子がいいんです♪クレンジングジェルだけでも種類が増えて色々な商品が出てきました。その中でも特に敏感肌の人におすすめなのが、アルマードオーディのクレンジングジェルです。このジェルは本当に肌荒れしないんです。それでいて、メイクもするっと落ちる。柔らかさだけでなくテクスチャーや優しさが水のゲルのような感じで本当に負担が少ないです。肌の調子が落ちているときにはコレ！という位、かなりのおすすめメイク落としです。お値段ちょっと高めではありますが、いい商品なので、肌に優しいクレンジングジェルを探している人には本当におすすめです。（多くの人に試してもらいたいので是非お試しサイズを作ってほしいと思っています笑）もう一つこちら、キールズのクレンジングジェルもおすすめです。その理由は使い心地はもちろん、クレンジングだけでOK、洗顔不要だからです。このクレンジングジェルは泡立てて使えば洗顔料としても使えるタイプ。毎日の洗顔でも使えるほどなので肌にも優しいんだと思うのですが、メイク落ちもいいです。洗顔する必要がなければ、その分刺激が少ないですからね、敏感肌や乾燥肌の人にはおすすめです。肌に乗せたりマッサージすると、ふわ〜っと暖かい、「温感タイプ」のクレンジングジェルも増えてきています。暖かくなるなんて面白い！と興味本位で使っていたのですが、温感ゆえなのか、そのタイプのクレンジングにいい商品が多い傾向があるのかわかりませんが、クレンジングとしていい商品が多いので驚いています。ものすごく暖かくなる、という訳ではないのですが、ふんわ〜り暖かくなると気分もなんだかほぐれます。毛穴も広がる気がして、汚れ落ちもより効果的なんじゃないかな。と思って使っていたら、毛穴汚れもやっぱり結構スッキリしてきました。毛穴汚れや黒ずみにはオイルクレンジングがいいとずーっと思ってきましたが、クレンジングジェルもなかなか優秀、さらに温感タイプのジェルはより効果的です。上のランキングにも温感タイプのジェルクレンジングはランクインしています。おすすめなので、是非使ってみてくださいね♪ダブル洗顔不要と言われているクレンジングって沢山あります。でもいざメイク落とししてみると・・など、やっぱり洗顔しないとダメだなと思うことの方が多かったです。ところが、クレンジングジェルを使うようになってからは、ダブル洗顔しなくても大丈夫かも？と思うことが増えたんです。そして、ついに（？）出会いました！本当にダブル洗顔なしでOKだ！！と感じるクレンジングジェルに。それが当サイトのランキングでも紹介している、マナラとキールズのクレンジングジェルです。この二つはダブル洗顔なしで大丈夫な使い心地です。さっぱり好みの私としては、特にキールズのクレンジングジェルがおすすめ。何しろ、泡立てて使えば普通の洗顔フォームとしても使えるので・・やっぱりそういう商品は使い心地がいいですね。ダブル洗顔不要でいいとなると、時短ケアでササっと洗顔ですみますし、洗顔料+水道代で、お財布にも優しいです。そして、肌を洗う=触る回数が減るのでトラブルにもなりにくい。という訳で、ダブル洗顔不要のクレンジングを探しているのなら、クレンジングジェルは激しくおすすめです。

Did n't McCain lose ?
Money quote :
Mr. McCain needs to come across as optimistic , loose and likable .
He must guard against revealing his lack of respect for Mr. Obama .
And he must grab the " change " banner from Mr. Obama by describing a few things he 'll do internationally that are new and different .
On those points , McCain blew it .
He can't hide his contempt for Obama .
In this angry atmosphere a 26 - year Senate veteran cannot afford to seem offended that a relative newcomer can challenge him .

Mr. Frum noted the difficulty that Dan Quayle , who was elected vice president in 1988 , had in recovering from an early set of mistakes that led him to be ridiculed as an intellectual lightweight .
“ The story of Dan Quayle is he did probably 1,000 smart things as vice president , but his image was locked in and it was very difficult to turn around , ” he said .
“ And Dan Quayle never in his life has performed as badly as Sarah Palin in the last month . ”
Several Republicans said that all of this could ultimately play to Ms. Palin ’s benefit , lowering expectations for her so much that a mediocre performance in the debate could be hailed as a success .
“ Thanks to the mainstream media , quite a low expectation has been created for her performance , ” said Ron Carey , chairman of Minnesota ’s Republican Party .
“ The style of Sarah Palin is going to amaze people .
She is going to be able to amaze people with the substance she is going to deliver . ”
And Mr. McCain ’s aides disputed the expressions of concern and said that if anything , the barrage of criticism and the performance in the few television interviews she has done gave her a low bar to clear in the debate .
“ I seriously hope that people continue to underestimate the most popular governor in America and a woman who speaks to the heart of America ’s economic angst , ” said Nicolle Wallace , a senior adviser to Mr. McCain .
And Mr. McCain , appearing with Ms. Palin in another interview with Ms. Couric on Monday night , offered a hearty endorsement .
“ I ’ve seen underestimation before , ” he said .
“ I ’m very proud of the excitement that Governor Palin has ignited with our party and around this country .
It is a level of excitement and enthusiasm , frankly , that I have n’t seen before . ”
Ms. Palin is getting ready for the debate at a time of enormous uncertainty about a highly complicated issue , the unfolding crisis on Wall Street , which makes preparing for the face off especially hard .
And the McCain campaign appears to be leaving nothing to chance .
Ms. Palin will spend her preparation time at Mr. McCain ’s vacation compound in Sedona , with her husband and children .
She is practicing for the debate with Steve Beigun , a former staff member of Mr. Bush ’s National Security Council ; Randy Scheunemann , Mr. McCain ’s chief foreign policy aide ; Mark Wallace , a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Bush ’s 2004 re-election campaign ; and Ms. Wallace , who was a communications director in the Bush White House .
Here is the article :
Everything You Wanted to Know About the Credit Crisis But Were Afraid to Ask
And here is the meat of his article , which leads to the huge gaping hole which he leaves unfilled :
The crisis occurred ( to greatly oversimplify ) because the financial system allowed entities to place bets on whether or not those mortgages would ever be paid .
You did n't have to own a mortgage to make the bets .
These bets , called Credit Default Swaps , are complex .
But in a nutshell , they allow someone to profit immensely - staggeringly - if large numbers of subprime mortgages are not paid off and go into default .
The profit can be wildly out of proportion to the real amount of defaults , because speculators can push down the price of instruments tied to the subprime mortgages far beyond what the real rates of loss have been .
As I said , the profits here can be beyond imagining .
( In fact , they can be so large that one might well wonder if the whole subprime fiasco was not set up just to allow speculators to profit wildly on its collapse ... )
These Credit Default Swaps have been written ( as insurance is written ) as private contracts .
There is nil government regulation of them .
Who writes these policies ?
Banks .
Investment banks .
Insurance companies .
They now owe the buyers of these Credit Default Swaps on junk mortgage debt trillions of dollars .
It is this liability that is the bottomless pit of liability for the financial institutions of America .
Did you see that bolded section ?
In fact , they can be so large that one might well wonder if the whole subprime fiasco was not set up just to allow speculators to profit wildly on its collapse ...
Many of us have already said that , including a LOT of prominent economists like Michael Hudson .
These people knew the loans they were making were bad loans .
They knew the money would n't be paid back .
Which has always bothered me -- why did they make bad loans on purpose ?
For short term gain ?
Well , yes , at least as far as some of the people involved go , like mortage agents in banks who worked on commission .
But the people in charge were letting them make these loans .
Why ?
Now that is what leads to the real meat of what he 's saying , the " Elephant in the Room " , That Which Shall Remain Unspoken :
They now owe the buyers of these Credit Default Swaps on junk mortgage debt trillions of dollars .
It is this liability that is the bottomless pit of liability for the financial institutions of America .
Somebody , somewhere , is blackmailing the economy .
Because somebody , somewhere , is owed these TRILLIONS of dollars .
And it is THEY who are holding a gun to the economy and demanding payment , and all of Wall Street , and even the Fed , cannot pay this debt .
So WHO is this Tony Soprano - like world figure ?
Who are these people ?
Why are we not identifying them , and talking to them , and negotiating with THEM , whoever they are , to keep from bankrupting the American economy in their favor ?
Somebody , somewhere , is blackmailing the entire United States economy .
Somebody , somewhere , has a gun to our head .
And to the head of the American government .
I want to know who they are .
I want them identified .
Who are they ?
And why are we willing to bankrupt the entire country in order to pay them off ?
Somebody , somewhere , has way more power than they should have .
Who ?
( CNN ) -- Residents living in single - family homes in some parts of coastal Texas face " certain death " if they do not heed orders to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Ike 's arrival , the National Weather Service said Thursday night .
Texans sit in bumper - to - bumper traffic Thursday on a highway from Galveston County into Houston .

The unusually strong wording came in a weather advisory regarding storm surge along the shoreline of Galveston Bay , which could see maximum water levels of 15 to 22 feet , the agency said .
" All neighborhoods ... and possibly entire coastal communities ... will be inundated during the period of peak storm tide , " the advisory said .
" Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single - family one - or two - story homes will face certain death . "
The maximum water level forecasts in nearby areas , including the shoreline of Matagorda Bay and the Gulf - facing coastline from Sargent to High Island , ranged from 5 to 8 feet .
But authorities warned that tide levels could begin rising Friday morning along the upper Texas coast and along the shorelines of the bays .
The advisory summoned memories of the language used to describe 2005 's Hurricane Katrina , which devastated parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast .
" Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks ... if not longer , " an advisory issued at the time said .
" The vast majority of native trees will be snapped or uprooted .
Only the heartiest will remain standing . "
The Ike advisory follows comes on the heels of similarly urgent messages earlier Thursday from federal authorities , who warned of a " massive storm " that could affect roughly 40 percent of the U.S. Gulf Coast .
" Do not take this storm lightly , " Michael Chertoff , secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , said Thursday afternoon .
" This is not a storm to gamble with .
It is large ; it is powerful ; it carries a lot of water . "
Chertoff and representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency said their efforts were focused on evacuations as Ike moved northwest at 12 mph across the central Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph .

Chertoff also urged people not to succumb to " hurricane fatigue , " referring to concerns that authorities were overestimating Ike 's potential impact .
" Unless you 're fatigued with living , I suggest you want to take seriously a storm of this size and scale , " he said Thursday .

White said he 's heard that people who live in areas under a mandatory evacuation order say they plan to stay in their homes .
He strongly urged against it .
" If you think you want to ride something out , and people are talking about a 20 - foot wall of water coming at you , then you better think again , " White said .
At 5 p.m. Thursday , the National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning was in effect between Morgan City , Louisiana , and Baffin Bay , Texas .
A warning means hurricane conditions are likely within 24 hours .
Ike 's forecast track was through Galveston and the Houston metro area as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph .
Currently a Category 2 storm about 700 miles across , Ike could make landfall near Galveston Island as early as Saturday morning .

At 11 p.m. ET , the National Hurricane Center said hurricane - force winds extended outward up to 115 miles from Ike 's center , and tropical storm - force winds extend outward up to 275 miles .
The storm was centered 445 miles east - southeast of Corpus Christi , Texas , and about 340 miles east - southeast of Galveston , and was moving west - northwest at near 10 mph .

Roughly 3.5 million people live in the hurricane 's potential impact zone , FEMA Administrator David Paulison said Thursday .
In Galveston , Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas told the island 's 60,000 people that they should leave .
By 7:30 ET , the city had finished evacuating to Austin thousands of residents who needed assistance leaving because of age , disability or lack of reliable transportation .
Mandatory evacuations remained in effect for low - lying coastal areas northeast and southwest of Galveston , in Chambers , Matagorda and Brazoria counties .
Some Brazoria County residents said they did n't want to leave but realized it was in their best interest to do so .
" You do n't have a choice when you have kids , " Deborah Davis of Freeport told CNN affiliate KPRC - TV in Houston .
Farther inland , about 100,000 residents in low - lying areas surrounding Houston began evacuating Thursday afternoon as Ike headed for the Texas coast , officials said .

But the remaining 4 million residents were told they could stay home , even as government offices and schools prepared to close Friday in Houston in anticipation of the hurricane .
" We are only evacuating areas subject to a storm surge , " said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett , the county 's chief executive officer .
" Yes , we know you will lose electricity .
But you 're not in danger of losing your life , so stay put . "
Ships in port were told to leave , said Port of Houston spokeswoman Linda Whitlock .
The area's two major airports , George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby , also halted all commercial flights .
More than 1,300 inmates from the Texas Correctional Institutions Division 's Stevenson Unit in Cuero were being evacuated to facilities in Beeville and Kenedy , Perry 's office said , and 597 were transferred from the substance abuse Glossbrenner Unit in San Diego , in south Texas , to Dilley .

As governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin , now the mother of a pregnant teen , cut state funds that would have helped house and support teenage mothers .
This on top of the news that both Palin and John McCain have opposed teen pregnancy prevention programs .
Palin apparently stayed consistent with her position — the pregnancy of her own teen was n’t prevented — though she does appear likely to house and support her .
( CNN ) --
The newly appointed al Qaeda chief in Pakistan , Abu Haris , has died of his wounds after a missile attack in northwestern Pakistan , according to a guard who was also wounded in the attack .
The guard said the missiles hit the compound of a key Taliban commander .
Asked about the report , the White House had no comment .
The guard said that the death toll from the attack has climbed to 25 and that at least 20 were injured .
The guard said three other al Qaeda members died Tuesday from injuries sustained in Monday 's attack : Abdullah , a Saudi ; Abu Hamza , another Saudi ; and Zain Ul Abu Qasim , an Egyptian .
The strike apparently targeted Jalaluddin Haqqani , a key Taliban commander who has played a major role in the fight against U.S. forces in Afghanistan , sources said Monday .
Missiles struck Haqqani's residence and madrasa , or religious school , killing two of his three wives and one of his sisters , said his son , Mulawi Jalaluddin Haqqani Badradin .
Haqqani was in Afghanistan when the missiles hit and was not hurt , his son said .
A spokesman for the Pakistani Army , Major Murad Khan , confirmed an explosion Monday morning in North Waziristan , a region near the Afghan border that is rife with Islamic extremists , but he and other spokesmen for the armed forces had no other details .
Four missiles were fired on a madrasa near the city of Miran Shah , sources said , killing three and wounding 12 .
It was unclear where the missiles were fired from , but CNN 's Nic Robertson reported residents saying they saw two predator aircraft fire missiles at Haqqani 's compound .
Haqqani was among the mujahadeen fighters who received U.S. help to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
He more recently has played a major role in fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan .

These Numbers Can't Be Right
Clojure provides several immutable collection types : ordinary lists , associative arrays , and " a hash map and vector both based upon array mapped hash tries " .
Array mapped hash tries ?
What are those ?
The short answer is that they 're hashtables whose bodies are tries ( prefix trees ) made of bitmapped sparse arrays .
( " Array mapped " refers , rather confusingly , to the last part . )
The long answer can be found in two of Phil Bagwell 's papers : Fast and Space Efficient Trie Searches and Ideal Hash Trees .
Nowadays most programmers are used to thinking of hashtables as a primitive data structure , but they 're not as simple as they look .
Ordinary hashtables combine three ideas in their implementation : arrays , hashing , and reprobing .
Arrays are the most space - efficient collection type , so naturally you want to use them for everything , but they have the limitation that they can only be indexed with ( a contiguous range of ) integers .
Hashing fixes this - it turns anything into an integer , suitable for indexing arrays or whatever data structure you please , at the cost of introducing collisions .
Reprobing deals with those collisions , without the inefficiency of chaining .
The combination has the coveted trait of fast constant - time lookup , so almost everyone uses it , but it 's not the only way to build a hashtable .
Each of those three concepts can be used independently of the others .
In particular , hashes can be used to index other structures than arrays .
This is what Clojure does .
Rather than backing its hashtables with ( reprobed ) arrays , it backs them with tries , treating the hashcode as a sequence of 5 - bit integers .
Tries are less efficient than arrays , of course , but they have the advantage of nondestructive update in log time .
Clojure 's collections are immutable , so efficient nondestructive update is a must .
( Mini-rant : I refuse to call it " persistence " .
There are plenty of other words for this - " nondestructive " , " functional " , " incremental " .
Do we have to appropriate a term with a well - established meaning that is both important and likely to be used in the same context ? )
Tries have a singularly confusing name , which may explain how little attention they get .
But they also have a space problem : each node may have a significant number of children , which must be accessed quickly , so an array is the obvious choice .
But most nodes have only a few children , so arrays would waste a lot of space .
Bagwell 's ( and Clojure 's ) solution is to use bitmapped sparse arrays .
Each node of the tree has a bitmap showing which children are present - and then a small array containing only those entries .
For example , in a base - 32 trie , a node with children 1 , 5 , and 11 would be represented by a bitmap 100000100010 and a 3 - element array containing pointers to the children .
This represents a 32 - element sparse array in only 4 words !
It 's not even inefficient to index into , as you can determine the index of an entry by counting the 1 bits below it in the bitmap .
This is supported in hardware on most architectures - but not , alas , on x86 .
National Science Foundation - funded scientists working in an ice - free region of Antarctica have discovered the last traces of tundra -- in the form of fossilized plants and insects -- on the interior of the southernmost continent before temperatures began a relentless drop millions of years ago .
An abrupt and dramatic climate cooling of 8 degrees Celsius , over a relatively brief period of geological time roughly 14 million years ago , forced the extinction of tundra plants and insects and transformed the interior of Antarctica into a perpetual deep - freeze from which it has never emerged .
The international team of scientists headed by David Marchant , an earth scientist at Boston University and Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis , geoscientists at North Dakota State University , combined evidence from glacial geology , paleoecology , dating of volcanic ashes and computer modeling , to report a major climate change centered on 14 million years ago .
The collaboration resulted in a major advance in the understanding of Antarctica 's climatic history .
NSF , in its role as the manager of the United States Antarctic Program , supported Ashworth's , Lewis ' , and Marchant 's research as well as U.S. researchers from Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , Ohio State University and the University of Montana .
Their findings appear in the Aug. 4 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" To me , the most interesting part of the whole story is that we 've documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in Antarctic climate : the transition marks a shift from warm , temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to today 's cold - polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert , " said Marchant .
" The contrast could n't be more striking .
It is like comparing Tierra del Fuego today with the surface of Mars - - and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200,000 years . "
The discovery of lake deposits with perfectly preserved fossils of mosses , diatoms and ostracods , a type of small crustacean , is particularly exciting to scientists , noted Lewis .
Fossils are extremely rare in Antarctica , especially those of terrestrial and freshwater plants and animals .

" They are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the Dry Valleys since their discovery during the first Scott expedition in 1902 - 1903 , " said Lewis .
Robert Falcon Scott was a British Antarctic explorer who perished during an attempt to the first to reach the South Pole in 1912 .
For Ashworth the fossils are a scientific treasure trove .
He said he was particularly struck that some species of diatoms and mosses are indistinguishable from living creatures .
Today , these species occur throughout the world , except in Antarctica .
" To be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal .
To think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on Earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking .
It must mean that these organisms are so well - adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived " said Ashworth , the principal paleoecologist in the research .
What makes the fossils especially valuable is that their context is known following years of detailed mapping of ancient glacial deposits in the western Olympus and Asgard mountain ranges of Antarctica by Marchant and Lewis .
As part of their research , they discovered volcanic ashes which have been dated at Lamont - Doherty geochronology labs by researchers Sidney Hemming and Malka Machlus , coauthors in the study .

Lewis added that the fossils are the best dated so far to come from Antarctica .
The fossil location today high in the mountains is a completely frozen landscape .
Marchant , Lewis and Ashworth , who often spend months living in tents in the Dry Valleys doing their research , all said that the fossil finds stretch their imagination about how the Antarctic continent once looked .
" The fossil finds allow us to examine Antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13.9 million years ago .
It is a unique window into the past .
On land , there are very few places on Earth that contain sediment of this age , and none are as well preserved as those found in the Dry Valleys , " Marchant said .
" The sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers , tundra and lakes , all in remarkable detail .
To study these deposits is akin to strolling across the Dry Valleys 14.1 million years ago . "
" What we 're basically looking at , " Lewis added " is the last hint of vegetation in the Dry Valleys . "
" The fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14.1 million years ago , the area was home to tundra , " wet " glaciers typical of those of the mountains of Tierra Del Fuego in the high southern latitudes , and seasonally ice - free lakes .
The beds of those long - gone lakes contain layers of sediments where detritus such as dying plants and insects would have settled and been preserved . "
" And it 's within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils , " said Lewis .
Ashworth's and the other paleoecologists ' research shows that the lakes supported mosses and diatoms , and the surrounding margins were ‘ minimally colonized ' by insects and shrubby vegetation . "
At 14.1 million years ago , the Dry Valleys were relatively warm .
By 13.9 million years ago , everything was different .
The transition brought the Dry Valleys from a climate like that of South Georgia to one that has Mars as a close analog .
Tom Wagner , program director for Antarctic Earth Sciences in NSF 's Office of Polar Programs , added that " Lewis , Marchant and Ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the Antarctic continent .
It was hanging on by its fingernails -- just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond , everything else around them frozen over -- and then , wham ! , they went too .
And it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried .
When I visited the scientists in the field , they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy . "
" It is one of the most dramatic and long - lasting changes that one can imagine , " Marchant said .
" I do n't know of any other place on Earth where such an enduring change has been documented ; the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change . "
The mean summertime temperatures would have dropped in that period by as much as 8 degrees Celsius .
On average , the summertime temperatures in the Valleys during this temperate period would have been as much as 17 degrees warmer than the present - day average .
What caused the change , Marchant said , " Is really a big unknown " , though theories abound and include phenomena as different as the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and tectonic shifts that affected ocean circulation .
According to Lewis , the freshness of the crystals and glass in the volcanic ash and the preservation of cellular detail in the fossils argues that they have been permanently frozen since 13.9 million years ago .
The climate changed during those millions of years but the temperatures in the mountains never rose high enough to allow groundwater to flow and microorganisms to become active .
This conclusion suggests that even when global atmospheric temperatures were warmer than they are now , as occurred -- approximately 3.5 million years ago during the Pliocene Epoch - - and as might occur in the near future as a consequence of global warming , there was no significant melting of the East Antarctic ice sheet inland of the Dry Valleys , nor were there dramatic changes in environmental conditions in the fossil region .
If this conclusion stands the test of time , it suggests a very robust ice sheet in this sector of Antarctica , and stresses the complex and potentially non-uniform response of Antarctica 's ice sheets to global change .
Wagner also noted , " Other scientists had been to this area before , but had n't noticed anything unusual .
It took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery . "

Who owns the rain ?
Not you , it turns out .
You 're actually breaking the law if you capture the rain falling on your roof and pour it on your flower bed !
A prominent Utah car dealer found that out when he tried to do something good for the environment .
Rebecca Nelson captures rainwater in a barrel , and she pours it on her plants .
" We can fill up a barrel in one rainstorm .
And so it seems a waste to just let it fall into the gravel , " she said .
Car dealer Mark Miller wanted to do pretty much the same thing on a bigger scale .
He collects rainwater on the roof of his new building , stores it in a cistern and hopes to clean cars with it in a new , water - efficient car wash .
But without a valid water right , state officials say he can't legally divert rainwater .
" I was surprised .
We thought it was our water , " Miller said .
State officials say it's an old legal concept to protect people who do have water rights .
Boyd Clayton , the deputy state engineer , said , " Obviously if you use the water upstream , it wo n't be there for the person to use it downstream . "
" Utah 's the second driest state in the nation .
Our water laws ought to catch up with that , " Miller says .
So what about the little guy , watering with rainwater at home ?
Will anybody do anything about that violation of the law ?
Clayton said , " If she really does that , then she ought to have a water right to do it . "
He added that they would not likely make an issue out of it , though , because they have " bigger fish to fry . "
After months of discussion , city and state officials worked out a tentative compromise with the bigger fish , Mark Miller Toyota .
Jeff Niermeyer , the Salt Lake City director of public utilities , said , " He would basically be using a Salt Lake City water right and diverting it under our name . "
State officials say the Mark Miller agreement could become a blueprint for other rainwater projects .
Homeowner projects , although technically illegal , are likely to stay off the state radar screen .

The specifics have changed in our new century , but the vitriolic animus of right - wing populism preached by Pegler and McCarthy and revived by the 1990s culture wars remains the same .
The game is always to pit the good , patriotic real Americans against those subversive , probably gay “ cosmopolitan ” urbanites ( as the sometime cross - dresser Rudy Giuliani has it ) who threaten to take away everything that small - town folk hold dear .
The racial component to this brand of politics was undisguised in St. Paul .
Americans saw a virtually all - white audience yuk it up when Giuliani ridiculed Barack Obama ’s “ only in America ” success as an affirmative - action fairy tale  and when he and Palin mocked Obama ’s history as a community organizer in Chicago .
Neither party has had so few black delegates ( 1.5 percent ) in the 40 years since the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies started keeping a record .
But race is just one manifestation of the emotion that defined the Palin rollout .
That dominant emotion is fear  an abject fear of change .
Fear of a demographical revolution that will put whites in the American minority by 2042 .
Fear of the technological revolution and globalization that have gutted those small towns and factories Palin apotheosized .
And , last but hardly least , fear of illegal immigrants who do the low - paying jobs that Americans do n’t want to do and of legal immigrants who do the high - paying jobs that poorly educated Americans are not qualified to do .
No less revealing than Palin ’s convention invocation of Pegler was the pointed omission of any mention of immigration , once the hottest Republican issue , by either her or McCain .
Saying the word would have cued an eruption of immigrant - bashing ugliness , Pegler - style , before a national television audience .
That would n’t play in the swing states of Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada , where Obama already has a more than 2 - to - 1 lead among Hispanic voters .
( Bush captured roughly 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004 . )
Since St. Paul , Democrats have been feasting on the hypocrisy of the Palin partisans , understandably enough .
The same Republicans who attack Democrats for being too P.C. about race now howl about sexism with such abandon you half - expect Phyllis Schlafly and Carly Fiorina to stage a bra-burning .
The same gang that once fueled Internet rumors and media feeding frenzies over the Clintons ’ private lives now express pious outrage when the same fate befalls the Palins .

But the ultimate hypocrisy is that these woebegone , frightened opponents of change , sworn enemies of race - based college - admission initiatives , are now demanding their own affirmative action program for white folks applying to the electoral college .
They want the bar for admission to the White House to be placed so low that legitimate scrutiny and criticism of Palin ’s qualifications , record and family values can all be placed off limits .
Byron York of National Review , a rare conservative who acknowledges the double standard , captured it best : “ If the Obamas had a 17 - year - old daughter who was unmarried and pregnant by a tough - talking black kid , my guess is if they all appeared onstage at a Democratic convention and the delegates were cheering wildly , a number of conservatives might be discussing the issue of dysfunctional black families . ”
