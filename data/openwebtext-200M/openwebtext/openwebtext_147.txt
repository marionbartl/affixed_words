It ’s too early to say for certain , but there are very encouraging signs that the world ’s standards bodies will vote in favour of a single unified ISO ( “ International Standards Organisation ” ) document format standard .
There is already one document format standard – ODF , and currently the ISO is considering a proposal to bless an alternative , Microsoft ’s OpenXML , as another standard .
In the latest developments , standards committees in South Africa and the United States have both said they will vote against a second standard and thereby issue a strong call for unity and a sensible , open , common standard for business documents in word processing , spreadsheets and presentations .
It ’s very important that we build on those brave decisions and call on all of our national standards committees , to support the idea of a single common standard for these critical documents .
The way the ISO works is interesting .
There are about 150 member countries who can vote on any particular proposal .
Usually , about 40 countries actually vote .
In order to pass , a proposal needs to get a 75 % “ yes ” vote .
Countries can vote yes , no , or “ abstain ” .
So normally , 10 “ no ” or “ abstain ” votes would be sufficient to send the proposal back for further consideration .
In this case , however , Microsoft has been working very hard , and spending a lot of money , to convince many countries that do n’t normally vote to support their proposed format .
So there is something concrete you can do , right now , today , this week !
Find out which body in your country is responsible for your national representation on ISO .
In SA is the South African Bureau of Standards ( SABS ) and in the US I believe it is ANSI .
Your country will likely have such a body .
There is a list of some of them here but it may not be complete so do n’t stop if your country is n’t listed there !
Call them , or email them , and ask them which committee will be voting in the OpenXML proposal .
Then prepare a comment for that committee .
It is really important that your comment be professional and courteous .
You are dealing with strong technical people who have a huge responsibility and take it seriously – they will not take you seriously if your comment is not well thought out , politely phrased and logically sound .
If you have a strong technical opinion , focus on a single primary technical issue that you think is a good reason to decline the proposal from Microsoft .
There are some good arguments outlined here .
Do n’t just resend an existing submission – find a particular technical point which means a lot to you and express that carefully and succinctly for your self .
It can be brief – a single paragraph , or longer .
There are some guidelines for “ talking to standards bodies ” here .
Here are the points I find particularly compelling , myself :
This is not a vote “ for or against Microsoft ” .
In fact , this is a vote for or against a unified standard .
Microsoft is a member of the body that defines ODF ( the existing ISO standard ) but is hoping to avoid participating in that , in favor of getting their own work blessed as a standard .
A vote of “ no OpenXML ” is vote against multiple incompatible standards , and hence a vote in favour of unity .
If the ISO vote is “ no ” , then there is every reason to expect that Microsoft will adopt ODF , and help to make that a better standard for everybody including themselves .
If we send a firm message to Microsoft that the world wants a single , unified standard , and that ODF is the appropriate place for that standard to be set , then we will get a unified global standard that includes Microsoft .
The reason this point is important is because many government officials recognise the essential position Microsoft holds in their operations and countries , and they will be afraid to vote in a way that could cost their country money .
If they perceive that a vote “ no ” might make it impossible for them to work with Microsoft , they will vote yes .
Of course Microsoft is telling them this , but the reality is that Microsoft will embrace a unified standard if the global standards organisation clearly says that ’s a requirement .
Open , consensus based document standards really WORK WELL – consider HTML
We already have an extraordinary success in defining a document format openly , in the form of HTML .
The W3 Consortium , which includes Microsoft and many other companies , defines HTML and CSS .
While Microsoft initially resisted the idea , preferring to push Internet Explorer ’s proprietary web extensions , it was ultimately forced to participate in W3C discussions .
The result is a wonderfully rich document format , with many different implementations .
Much of the richness of the web today comes directly from the fact that there is an open standard for web documents and web interactions .
Look at a classy web page , and then look at a classy Word document , and ask yourself which is the most impressive format !
Clearly ,
Word would be better with an open standard , not one defined by a single company .
A SINGLE standard with many implementations is MUCH more valuable than multiple standards
Imagine what would happen if there were multiple incompatible web document standards ?
You could n’t go to any web site and just expect it to work , you would need to know which format they used .
The fact that there is one web document standard – HTML – is the key driver of the efficiency of the web as a repository of information .
The web is a clear example of why ODF is the preferred structure for a public standard .
ODF , the existing standard , is defined openly by multiple companies , and Microsoft can participate there along with everyone else .
They know they can – and they participate in other standards discussions in the same organisation .
Microsoft will say that “ multiple standards give customers choice ” .
But we know that it is far more valuable to have a single standard which evolves efficiently and quickly , like HTML .
The network effects of document exchange mean that one standard will in any event emerge as dominant , and it is important to governments , businesses and consumers that it be a standard which ITSELF offers great choice in implementation .
People do n’t buy a standard , and they do n’t use a standard document , they use a software or hardware tool .
If the “ standard ” only has one set of tools from one vendor , then that “ choice of standards ” has effectively resulted in zero choice of provider for customers .
Consider the richness of the GSM cellular world , with hundreds of solution providers following a single global standard , compared to the inefficiency of countries which allowed proprietary networks to be installed on public frequencies .
ODF is already implemented by many different companies .
This means that there are many different tools which people can choose to do different things with their ODF documents .
Some of those tools are optimised for the web , others for storage , others for data analysis , and others for editing .
In the case of OpenXML , there is not even one single complete implementation – because even Microsoft Office 12 does not exactly implement OpenXML .
There is also no other company with any tool to edit or manage OpenXML documents .
Microsoft is trying to make it look like there is broad participation , but dig beneath the surface and it is all funded by one company .
The ODF standard is a much healthier place to safeguard all of our data .
I ’d like to thank the team at TSF for the work they put into briefing the South African standards committee .
I hope that each of you – folks who have read this far , will pick up the phone and contact your own standards body to help them make a smart decision .
The USA , South Africa , China , and other countries will be voting “ no ” .
Let ’s not allow heavy lobbying to influence what should be a calm , rational , sensible and ultimately technical discussion .
Standards are important , and best defined in transparent and open forums .
Pick up the phone !

We all know the rules for good passwords .
They should be at least 90 characters long , have no recognizable words or phrases , consist of 30 % lowercase characters , 30 % uppercase characters , and 40 % special characters , and they should be changed daily , if not hourly .
Where I work , if you forget your password , you 're fired on the spot and recommended for execution .
OK , maybe I 'm exaggerating a little , but let 's quit jerking each other around and get serious .
Password security is a big deal .
Enrique knows this as well as the rest of us .
Sadly , two developers he worked with missed the message .
Enrique was doing maintenance work on an application that allows users to register to buy and sell antiques .
The registration process was simple .
Enter a username , address , phone number , email address , and password , and you 're in .
Of course , if the username is taken , you 're asked to enter a different username .
And of course , if the password you 've chosen is in use by another user , your registration fails .
No , I 'm not kidding .
Passwords had to be unique throughout the system .
And judging by lists of user passwords I 've seen , many users probably encountered this issue when trying to use a password of " password . "
The password field of the user table was also the primary key field making it impossible to have duplicate passwords , and they were stored unencrypted to make the verification process easier .
On the bright side , the original developers had n't forgotten to set a unique constraint on the username , but Enrique was intrigued enough to email them and ask them about the architecture .
They sent back a database diagram , and what Enrique saw next chilled him to the bone .
The password field was used as the foreign key throughout the system .
To reiterate , every table that recorded a bit of user information used an unencrypted password to identify the user .
A lot of words ran through Enrique 's head , most of which can't be printed here .
His biggest concern , though , was " what if the user wants to change their password ? "
See , most users have grown accustomed to luxuries like the ability to change their password .
He fired back another email asking this very question .
" Well , we 'd first check that no one else was using that password .
Then we run sp_change_password . "
sp_change_password consisted of a long list of UPDATE statements ; one for each table that had any user related information in it .
Any time new tables were added , they'd have to remember to update sp_change_password .
None of these updates were done within a transaction .
Enrique asked about referential integrity — if a field was updated , other tables would point to data that did n't exist anymore .
" Oh , we had that problem the first time , so we removed all of the foreign key constraints in the database and it works now . "
Since referential integrity was n't preserved , cascading updates were impossible , requiring sp_change_password to be built , but then referential integrity could n't be preserved , and now the circle is complete .
Enrique knew he'd have to push the other developers and let them know how bad of a design this was , so he pointed out possible system exploits .
" Say someone made a script that 'd create accounts like crazy , guessing different passwords each time .
If a password error came back , they'd have a user 's password .
If a username error came back , they 'd have a user 's username .
Eventually a matrix of usernames and passwords would be compiled , then it'd be a simple matter of attempting to log in . "
" Ohhh ... umm ... I guess you 're right , " was all the developer could muster .
" But then we'd have to change every table to use a username as the foreign key , maybe even apply constraints on the server , and change the token each user carries throughout the application to be their username ! "
It was a major change , but Enrique insisted they do the work .
The next day , the boss summoned Enrique to his office .
" I hear there might be some major delays in our project , and I heard a funny rumor that you have something to do with it . "
Enrique explained the situation , and fortunately his boss was not only reasonable , but had enough technical knowledge to understand the problem .
He insisted that further development would come after Enrique 's proposed changes to the system and that all proposed changes would require Enrique 's approval before implementation .

Coins are much sought - after in India 's north - east ( Photos : Subhamoy Bhattacharjee )
Police in Calcutta say that the recent arrest of a grocer highlights the extent of the problem .
They seized what they said was a huge coin-melting unit which he was operating in a run-down shack .
The grocer confessed to melting down tens of thousands of Indian coins into razor blades which were then smuggled into Bangladesh , police said .
" Our one rupee coin is in fact worth 35 rupees , because we make five to seven blades out of them , " the grocer allegedly told the police .
" Bangladeshi smugglers take delivery of the blades at regular intervals . "
Out of circulation
Police say that initially the smugglers took coins into Bangladesh and then melted them down , but as the scale of the operation has increased , more and more criminals in India are melting them down first , and then selling them as razor blades .
To deal with the coin shortage , some tea gardens in the north - eastern state of Assam have resorted to issuing cardboard coin -slips to their workers .
The denomination is marked on these slips and they are used for buying and selling within the gardens .
Notes are more common than coins in Guwahati
The cardboard coins are the same size as the real ones and their value is marked on them .
" We will commit an offence if these cardboard slips go out , but we have to use them in our gardens because there are hardly any Indian coins in circulation here , " said a manager of a tea garden in northern Assam .
He is not willing to be named because the disclosure could cause legal complications for the estate .
' Do our best '
Indian revenue intelligence officials say millions of coins are finding their way into Bangladesh .
They say they have alerted the paramilitary Border Security Force ( BSF ) - which is deployed on the India - Bangladesh border - to check the smuggling .
Coins can even be seen ' for sale ' in Guwahati market stalls
" We are aware of our coins going across the border in some quantities and we will do our best to stop it , " senior BSF official SK Datta told the BBC .
Revenue intelligence officials , who do not wish to be named , say criminals can make five to six blades from a five - rupee coin .
" We are investigating this closely , " said one official posted in north - eastern India .
Earlier , Indian coins were being melted in huge quantities in places like Calcutta .
The mints took corrective action - scaling down the metal content of the coins - but that has not stopped the shortages .
Distributing coins
The authorities have taken various steps to deal with the problem .
In Calcutta alone , India 's central bank - the Reserve Bank of India - has distributed coins worth nearly six million rupees ( $ 150,000 ) to overcome the shortage in the last two weeks , bank treasurer Nilanjan Saha said .
We have to accept very soiled notes of one or five rupees , so soiled that the banks will not change it
Agartala resident Sushil Choudhury
Long queues form outside the bank 's regional office in the city centre every time this happens .
Unscrupulous touts set up makeshift shops and collect as many of the coins as they can , only to sell them later at a premium .
" We stand in long queues but the coins are finished within no time .
Those in front pick them up and we can see some of them later selling the coins at a big margin , " complained small trader Nitai Banik , who needs a lot of coins for his retail trade in small garments .
Begging coins
Shopkeepers ask customers to buy more to make it a round figure so that small change does not have to be given out .
" The shopkeepers give us toffees or cigarettes to make it a round figure , " said student Debolina Sen .
In desperation , some shopkeepers have even turned to beggars to maintain their coin supplies .
The beggars get given coins by passers - by and then sell them on at a profit .
They are worth more melted down as razor blades
" They charge a smaller premium , much less compared to the touts outside the Reserve Bank , " says businessman Tarun Jain .
The coin shortage is most acute in the north - eastern frontier town of Agartala , right on the border with Bangladesh and believed to be a major centre for contraband trade with Bangladesh .
Here , rickshaw pullers tell you that they cannot provide any coins in change because they have none left .
" So we have to accept very soiled notes of one or five rupees , so soiled that the banks will not change it , " says Agartala resident Sushil Choudhury .
In Guwahati , Assam 's capital and the business hub of India 's northeast , small coins like 50 paisa have completely dropped out of circulation .
Here , there , everywhere .
We have to call it something , do n't we ?
Who 's got an idea ?
Let 's call it Toponymy .

House of doom ( again ) for immigration bill Posted by Frank James at 10:03 am CDT
Here 's yet another reason why the immigration - reform legislation being debated in the Senate ( when it 's not in recess as it is now ) has a high probability of winding up where last year 's effort did -- on history 's scrap heap .
It 's a House procedure called the " blue - slip " which House conservatives are very likely to use to throttle the legislation .
As The Hill publication reports :
House conservatives are ready to stop the Senate immigration bill in its tracks with a potent procedural weapon should the contentious measure win passage in the upper chamber .
The trump card conservatives may hold is a constitutional rule that revenue - related bills must originate in the House .
The Senate immigration measure requires that illegal immigrants pay back taxes before becoming citizens , opening the door to a House protest , dubbed a “ blue slip ” for the color of its paper .
House Republicans used the same back - taxes mandate for a blue - slip threat that derailed last year ’s immigration conference .
The new Senate bill still must survive two more weeks of voter scrutiny and contentious amendments , but several conservatives already are lying in wait for the Senate to “ make the same mistake twice , ” as one House GOP aide put it .
“ If we get an opportunity to do it , believe me , we ’ll do it , ” the aide said .
“ I think it ’s going to be a matter of who will get there first .
A number of people in the House are dying to be fingered as the person who killed [ the Senate bill ] . ”
And there you have it .
If House conservatives pull out the old blue slip , as The Hill goes on to report , that would force a majority vote of the House to send the bill back to the Senate where White House and Senate negotiators would be forced to start all over again .
Keep in mind that immigration as an issue scrambles Congress 's normal partisan divide .
Some House Democrats share organized labor 's concerns about the guest - worker provisions in the bill , for instance .
So it 's uncertain whether the legislation 's advocates could even muster the needed House majority to get the battered bill back to the Senate .
And given what it took for those negotiators to achieve the present bill , and with presidential and congressional election politics becoming more of a factor with each passing day , it 's unlikely another bill with broad Senate support could emerge .
Thus it would seem to doom the legislation just like last year .
As Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) warned on May 17 when the negotiators announced that they had reached a new agreement , " This is the last , best chance we 'll have as a Congress .
If this must -- if this somehow collapsed , it would be years before you could recreate this . "
Of course , some senators said the same last year when they announced their agreement on a prior bill the House managed to kill and here we are one year later with another bill .
Given the significant opposition to giving illegal immigrants legal status in Congress and in the country as a whole , immigration - reform legislation may wind up following the course taken by civil - rights legislation between 1945 and 1957 .
This is from Congresslink.org :
The United States Congress began to take its first , tentative steps to enact major civil rights legislation soon after the Brown decision .
Although Congress considered a civil rights bill each year from 1945 until 1957 , every measure failed to pass into law .
It was not until Congress turned its attention to voting rights in 1957 that the first civil rights act of the 20th century actually became law .
Congress followed the 1957 Civil Rights
Act with another in 1960 .
Together these measures made moderate gains for minorities .
More importantly , they foreshadowed increasing support for more substantial civil rights guarantees in the 1960s and contributed to a climate of opinion favoring these guarantees .
Those in favor of giving illegal immigrants legal status may be in for a similar marathon .
in Congress , Immigration | Permalink Comments Classic !
A parliamentary procedure designed to stop the whole process in its tracks !
Republicans are such liars .
I guess that means no money for those faabuulous Border Fences either ?

I have a suggestion .
I know you wo n't agree .
Let 's empty all of our jails and send the prisoners across the border under the cover of darkness to Mexico .
They could then be given the chance to become free citizens of Mexico .
This will save the 25,000 to 75,000 dollar per 1 million prisoners that we pay to maintain them .
Once the Mexican government finds that out they will close the borders themselves .

Its sad that the Senate is working so hard to successfully somewhat fix illegal immigration just so that the House conservatives can squash the hope for reform .
In my opinion , most of the undocumented are not criminals .
Real criminals are murderers , rapists , child predators , and so on .
To label an entire group of undocumented individuals as criminals is absurd , just because they would like to live a better life .
Most Americans take what we have in this country for granted .
Put yourselves in their shoes and im sure you would have crossed the border as well .
Its also ignorant to assume all undocumented are Mexicans , which is what i see all over the news from anti-immigrant groups .
What about the Irish , the Asians , and the Polish , just to name some ?
Guess their skin isnt dark enough .

There is no point on slowing or stopping the inevitable .
You cannot roundup 12 - 15 million people who live , work and who are part of society .
Last time something like that happened was the Nazi roundup of Jews to send them to concentration camps .. the rounding up people part only .
All the Republican party is doing is alienating the fastest block of voters ( latin or of latin descent ) for the next half century .
Half of the immigration hawks were already voted out during the past election and they will continue that trend in elections to come .
That is why Kyl and other surviving hawks are negotiating .
They know the law to be passed will be even more immigrant friendly fi done in 2009 instead of now .

When will the Senate realize that we ( American citizens ) do not want 12 million criminals granted a path to citizenship ?
When will they realize that if they do not remove the incentive the illegals will continue to enter the US with no regard to our laws because they know if they wait long enough they will be granted citizenship .
Unfortunately our representatives in Washington are too busy listening to people who do n't vote because they are here illegally and to businesses that are addicted to cheap labor .
Posted by : MarkJ | May 31 , 2007 11:36:21 AM
Frank James ( who thinks John Edwards was the senator from SOUTH Carolina ) is as usual days behind the news curve reporting on this one .
The US Constitution mandates that tax bills originate in the US House .
See Art I , Sec 7 : " All Bills for Raising Revenue must originate in the House of Representatives ... "
The Illegal Immigration Bill contains several tax measures .
Somebody has to assert the primacy of the US Constitution .
Democrats , Senate Republicans , and Frank James wo n't do so .
It has fallen to House Republicans to do so .
And I hope they do .
Posted by : Bruce | May 31 , 2007 11:40:50 AM
The fact remains that this shoddy piece of legislation should be renamed to " No Alien Left Behind " , another blundering of President Bush , to go along with the war in Iraq .
Tell me Mr.Bush , if I stepped on the lawn of the White House , would I not be arrested and prosecuted for tresspassing ?
Yes ... because I would be breaking the law .
It 's the same principle .
Illegal immigrants do not care about the laws of this country .
They did n't when they entered illegally , and they will not " touchback " or " go home " EVER , for anything .
Wise Up !
We have immigration laws in this country that need to be enforced .
Secure the borders !
Congress better start worrying about the legal , voting , tax paying citizens of this country instead of the lawbreakers they want to pardon and protect .
Americans are tired of it !
Posted by : patricia | May 31 , 2007 11:52:15 AM
Basically , the Democrats hate America so much that they believe only a massive demographic change can redeem the country .
I can understand why certain Republicans support this bill : because businesses want cheap labor , but why should Democrats support it ?
I thought Democrats were AGAINST cheap labor .
How does an influx of millions of low - wage laborers advance the traditional Democratic economic agenda ?
It does n't .
It only advances their hate - America agenda .
Liberal Democrats dream of a socialist revolution with millions of Z - Visa holders as the foot soldiers .

The arrogance of Washington and the media is amazing .
When this " Amnesty bill " was created it was bipartisan , the GOP , Republicans and Democrats etc ....
How stupid does Washington , special interest groups and the media think we are .
This bill has crossed party lines , and the media does n't want to report it that way .
Facts on creating Amnesty bill :
Did some Republicans work on this bill in secrecy ? , Yes .
Did some Democrat 's work on this bill in secrecy ? , Yes .
Did some of Executive branch work on this bill in secrecy ? , Yes .
Can the Republicans bring the bill to the floor ? , NO .
Who controls Congress ?
The Democrat's .
Did the Democrat 's bring the bill to the Senate ? , Yes .
Who is being reported to kill the bill ? , Conservatives .
James reported .
Is n't there anyone from the Democrat party wanting to kill this bill ?
Who .
Will this Amnesty type of bill come back to Congress in the future ?
Yes - just like last year .
Is Legal America PO 'd about giving " illegal " aliens a pass ?
You bet .
Why do " I " keep talking about Washington , because " all " parties are involved , not just one .
Democrat's , Republicans , Independents , special interest groups , & the media .
And I am sick of 2 lines , " bringing them out of the shadows " , " doing work that Americans wo n't do " .
You bet .

I have a proposal for a new bill it read as follows " Throw them all out , period " Posted by : Greg | May 31 , 2007 12:25:22 PM
What are the similarities between Selections for individual landing on moon & U.S.A Citizenship Both have same odds to get thr :)
So , I think its all DIRTY politics who are opposing this immigration bill .
They are share holders in those company who hire illegal workers & but ready to fill there pockets but not ready to give them one chance .
You need their son’s to fight for this country where their parent ’s dnt have any rights what you call it double standards .
They talk about terrorist but did they know by this bill you can scan all illegal people who are here but they not ready to do so bcz there intensions are not right .
They are using all these tactics for Vote bank only .
It ’s shameful that world power American politicians are so greedy for vote bank .
They can support Distractions of Iraq by attacking them but not ready to go for prosper America with immigrants .
If only Native American oppose then only I can understand but if those who all ready here as immigrants how they can ask other not to be here .
Now they say we are legal immigrants
Yes that ’s true but when there parents came here
No one have to go by this kind of bureaucracy at that time .
So what I can say is dnt misguiding us .
I am not saying give them amnesty anyway this bill is not amnesty but do a fair Job …
… If you hang this bill you are playing with national security .
Do n’t for get for shake of national security our troops are there .
You spending tax payer money & Americans blood for American security when you approve war bill on Iraq .
Now you have chance to secure America why you siding your self …….

Here 's a thought ...
Why do all immigrants have to be treated the same ?
Why do n't they have different rules for people who can just walk across the border ( ie. Mexicans ) and rules that apply to those who are not Mexican like perhaps the thousands of Irish who cannot just walk to Ireland .
If you ask me , the non-Mexican immigrants are suffering even worse because they have a harder time getting in and out of the US to go home for weddings and funerals etc ...
Many have n't seen their families in years and cannot return to their homeland even for a simple visit .
Many of whom are people who have been working in the US for 15 or 20 years and have raised American children but still have to live under the radar which is very sad .
Not being here legally really affects the self esteem on these people and it's not that simple to just return home and apply to come to the US legally since the government can ban them from coming back for 10 years !
I mean no disresepct to Mexicans because I know many Mexicans who are unbelievable workers and family oriented people but you cannot lump ALL the immigrants together when you make these immigration rules .
You have to take into account geography in addition to possible criminal records and everything else .
Posted by : stephanie | May 31 , 2007 12:47:43 PM
You cannot throw 12 million people under the bus now , for having been allowed ( yes allowed ) to live , work and raise families here .
The failure of the gov't to enforce laws and the willingness of companies to hire the cheap labor is what has caused this problem .
This is akin to the steroid problem in major league baseball , turning a blind eye to illegal activity because it boosted profits .
The immigration bill currently going through congress seems to be a reasonable compromise to a complicted issue .
Posted by : Steve34 | May 31 , 2007 12:49:05 PM
There 's plenty of ranting , raving and rhetoric on both sides of the immigration debate .

Okay , we all know you can't send them all back .
It just is not realistic .
The people here who are illegal , know they broke the law .
That is why they " live in the shadows " as the new talking point goes .
You can't send most of the children back because they were born here and this is the only country they know .
And you should not punish the child for the sins of his parents .
I still want to know where they are going to get all the English teachers from ...

OK , I 'd like to make a point and ask a question .
I , PG , am going to give you this amnesty , and thats what it is .
10 - 20 million " illegal aliens " ( not immigrants ) have just been given a legal pass in the US .
You are now free , out of the shadows , doing the jobs Americans wo n't do .
You are now legal taxpayers , do you think that ALL social services should cut off ?
You 're legal and illegal relatives arrive at your home , will you report them ?
Should the new illegal alien be deported or be allowed to stay with the family ?
Posted by : PG | May 31 , 2007 1:56:19 PM
So any US Senator or Congressman or Congresswoman
who is stupid enough to vote for Illegal Alien
Amnesty or aka Comprehensive Immigration Reform
and Leave No Illegal Alien Behind is frankly too
damn dumb to be a member of our US Congress and
will be voted out of office on Election Day or
may even find themselves Recall as is about to
happen to both Sell Out Arizona Republican US
Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl as MAIA the
Mothers Against Illegal Aliens Have Just Launched
A Recall Against Kyl and McCain and yes it's the
Same John McCain Republican Presidential Candidate we are talking about here !
Enforce our
Current Immigration Laws !
Deport All Illegal
Aliens And Jail Their Employers and Landlords !
And Watch 20 Million Illegal Aliens Vamoose Back
To Mexico !
Take Back America !

The cost of deporting these 12 - 20 million criminals , and yes , they are criminals whether you want to admit it or not , is far , far , far less than the costs our communities will endure in the decades ahead if this amnesty passes .
The 1986 amnesty is regarded as a terrible mistake by all politicians involved .
Making the same mistake twice , except on a much larger scale , would doom the tax - based infrastructure and eradicate the middle class .
It 's already happening !
Anyone read the article in the Trib . about the overcrowded schools going year - round ?
Anyone read the articles about our hospitals going bankrupt ?
It 's the illegal alien crisis that is to blame , period .
Sorry , no scapegoating here .
Wake up .
It is not , nor has it ever been , the U.S. obligation to ILLEGALLY absorb entire poor populations of foreign countries , despite the rhetoric you hear from illegal alien enablers .
The law must be upheld .
The current illegal migration into the U.S. is the largest migration in all of human history and Bush , ethnocentric special interest groups and big business are hell bent on destroying this country .

Only ignorant minds are scared to make a decision to accept the inevitable .
A changing society is not always good for everyone .
An old ' decide - to - remain - dubious - on - this ' trick is a comfy shade for cowardice .
Two things can be done :
1 . Kick out everyone here illegally ,
2. put everyone here illegally in the system ;
Either one of the two will be a better solution than just rhetorical speeches , writings , or whatever you may call them .
Do we need to bring back Albert Einstein to help our congress with this principle - of - relativity type of dilemma ?
Probably not .
We can delve this ourselves .

I am so sick & tired of these people who say you can't round up 12 to 20 million ilegal aliens ( ILEGAL , not undocumented ) and throw them out of the country .
NO ONE SAID YOU COULD .
You only need to do 2 things .
1 ) Enford the laws that are ALREADY on the books by fining and jailing ANY employer that hire 's ilegals .
2 ) Build the darn fence ( just in case ) .
Problem solved !
Trust me , most , if not all only come here to work and steal our benefits .
They do NOT come here to be law abiding US citizens ( obviously ) .
If there is no work , there will be no ilegals .
Maybe then the only choice they will have is to fight for their rights in THEIR COUNTRY , not ours ...

As the comments show , this is a hot issue and a single issue for many voters .
There is no safe place for candidates .
Therefore , this bill must be made to disappear .
As if by magic , it will go away and come back in an even more lenient form in 2009 or perhaps 2011 .
Health care may take up 2009 .
Elections preclude 2010 .

The Republican party is the BIG LOSER in this debate .
They will NEVER get a single Latino ( or any other minority vote for that matter ) because of their perceived racism and intolerance toward anybody who 's not a WASP .
If they pass the bill , all the rednecks - the Republican 's core constituency - will cry " betrayal " .
Sorry , Republicans , you have messed up big this time .
You might as well pass the bill .
Diversity is good .
Rednecks = racists = Bad .
YES to the Senate Bill .
If we try to deport millions of undocumented workers , we might as well go back in time to Nazi Germany where they used to round up the jews - disgrace .
If there is somebody that should be deported , let 's start with Lou Dobbs and Tancredo - true racists and bigots .

I was one of the illegals for 12 years .
Got a starter job , paid my taxes every year like clockwork ( at a rate which is substantially higher than the natives -- bet you did n't know that ) .
Moved up in the world , started a family , still paying taxes now in the neighborhood of 25 grand a year .
Nine eleven struck , all these visious get - the - illegals people started crawling from under the rocks , they began floating ideas in Congress like siccing bounty hunters after the illegals .
I got fed up , picked up my family and went back to Europe to pay my taxes there .
Americans have forgotten the notion of giving a guy a break , which makes them a pretty miserable bunch .
Not a good thing , taliban - like .

Why Its Sweeping Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Pose Not Only a Civil Liberties Threat , But a Greater Danger As Well
 from FindLaw ( posted with permission )
Congressional Democrats are getting a lot of well - earned heat from rank - and - file members of their party , not to mention editorial writers and bloggers , for their lack of spine in refusing to reject the Bush / Cheney Administration 's sweeping amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Just before Congress departed for its August recess , the Administration jammed through in five days - from start to finish -- the dubiously titled Protect America Act ( PAA ) of 2007 , over the protest of the Democratic leadership .
The only thing good about the PAA is that it is temporary - with a six month expiration date ( although surveillance programs authorized under it can operate for up to one year . )
On her Democracy NOW daily program , Amy Goodman 's ( streaming video ) interviewed Salon.com 's law blogger , Glenn Greenwald , and the president of the National Lawyers Guild , Marjorie Cohn , about the PAA .
The interview nicely sets forth what happened and its broad implications .
Simply stated , Bush threatened to make a political issue of any effort by Congressional Democrats to protect the civil liberties of American .
Bush surely succeeded beyond his most fervent hope in his intimidation of sixteen Democratic members in the Senate and forty - one Democratic members in the House , earning these members a place on " the roll of shame " in the blogosphere .
The Washington Post , the New York Times , and politically - diverse organizations ranging from the John Birch Society and the Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union all agree that the PAA is a serious mistake , and threat to the civil liberties of Americans .
They point out that the law ignores the Fourth Amendment while , at the same time , hiding its actual operations in national security secrecy .
Indeed , Congress was not even certain about the full extent of what it has authorized because President Bush and Vice - President Cheney refused to reveal it .
It is not likely that law - abiding Americans will even know that the U.S. Government 's intelligence gathering operations are listening in on their calls to and from foreign countries , or similarly scanning emails .
For this reason , it is not to be expected that many Americans will care about what the Democratic Congress has given a Republican president who has proven himself insensitive to anyone 's privacy other than his own .
There is , however , a threat in this new law even greater than its robbing Americans of their communications privacy , which commentators and critics have virtually ignored .
This law is another bold and blatant move by Bush to enhance the powers of the Executive branch at the expense of its constitutional co-equals .
Congress was willing to give Bush the amendments to FISA that would make this law effective under current technology .
The 1978 law did not account for the fact that modern digital communications between people outside the United States often is routed through the United States , yet the FISA Court said surveillance of such routed communications required a warrant .
Nevertheless , Bush rejected the legislation proposed by the Democrats because it also contained checks on the use of surveillance powers .
This , of course , is consistent with Bush and Cheney 's general drive to weaken or eliminate all checks and balances constraining the Executive .
This drive was evidenced by countless laws enacted by the Republican - controlled Congresses during the first six years of the Administration , and in countless signing statements added by the President interpreting away any constraints on the Executive .
Thus , when even the GOP Congresses required presidential compliance and reporting , they were thwarted .
The most stunning aspect of the Democrats ' capitulation is their abandoning of their institutional responsibility to hold the president accountable .
The Protect America
Act utterly fails to maintain any real check on the president 's power to undertake electronic surveillance of literally millions of Americans .
This is an invitation to abuse , especially for a president like the current incumbent .
Fixing the Dangerously Deficient Albeit Quickly Sunsetting Protect America Act And Ignoring the White House 's Requests For Even More Power
Though it is quite certain abuses of the surveillance powers under the Protect America
Act will occur , they have not yet occurred .
The failure to provide a check on such potential abuses , however , has already occurred .
It represents the greatest failing of the Democratic Congress in acceding to the demands of Bush and Cheney .
It is this failure that should be a paramount concern of the Congress when it next addresses this temporary law .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to the chairmen of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee , requesting they develop legislation " addressing the many deficiencies " of the temporary law as soon as Congress returns from its recess .
Even though the White House got everything it demanded from Congress , it is requesting even more .
When signing the Protect America Act , Bush said , " When Congress returns in September , the Intelligence Committees and leaders in both parties will need to complete work on the comprehensive reforms requested by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , including the important issues of providing meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our Nation following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 . "
Bush also wants legislative immunity for the American companies , and government officials ( including himself ) , to protect them from criminal prosecution for violating the criminal provision of FISA .
As readers will recall , before Congress caved and gave Bush power to conduct this surveillance , he - and telecommunication companies simply opted to do so illegally .
Now , Bush will claim , with some justification , that because Congress has now made legal actions that were previously illegal , it should retroactively clear up this nasty problem facing all those who broke the law at his command .
If the Democrats fail to stand up to the bullying of this weak president , and ignore his demands for more unaccountability , they might as well start looking for another line of work .
Not only are their fellow rank and file Democrats going to turn on them in 2008 , but the overwhelming numbers of independents who assisted them in regaining power are going to desert them in droves .
At bottom , Democrats truly only need to add one fix to this dangerous law : meaningful accountability .
They must do so , or face the consequences .
No one wants to deny the intelligence community all the tools it needs .
But regardless of who sits in the Oval Office , no Congress should trust any president with unbridled powers of surveillance over Americans .
It is not the way our system is supposed to work .

INTRODUCTION .
S INCE my experiences in Blackwell 's Island Insane Asylum were published in the World I have received hundreds of letters in regard to it .
The edition containing my story long since ran out , and I have been prevailed upon to allow it to be published in book form , to satisfy the hundreds who are yet asking for copies .
I am happy to be able to state as a result of my visit to the asylum and the exposures consequent thereon , that the City of New York has appropriated $ 1,000,000 more per annum than ever before for the care of the insane .
So I have at least the satisfaction of knowing that the poor unfortunates will be the better cared for because of my work .
TEN DAYS IN A MAD - HOUSE .
CHAPTER I .
A DELICATE MISSION .
O N the 22d of September I was asked by the World if I could have myself committed to one of the asylums for the insane in New York , with a view to writing a plain and unvarnished narrative of the treatment of the patients therein and the methods of management , etc .
Did I think I had the courage to go through such an ordeal as the mission would demand ?
Could I assume the characteristics of insanity to such a degree that I could pass the doctors , live for a week among the insane without the authorities there finding out that I was only a " chiel amang 'em takin ' notes ? "
I said I believed I could .
I had some faith in my own ability as an actress and thought I could assume insanity long enough to accomplish any mission intrusted to me .
Could I pass a week in the insane ward at Blackwell 's Island ?
I said I could and I would .
And I did .
My instructions were simply to go on with my work as soon as I felt that I was ready .
I was to chronicle faithfully the experiences I underwent , and when once within the walls of the asylum to find out and describe its inside workings , which are always , so effectually hidden by white - capped nurses , as well as by bolts and bars , from the knowledge of the public .
" We do not ask you to go there for the purpose of making sensational revelations .
Write up things as you find them , good or bad ; give praise or blame as you think best , and the truth all the time .
But I am afraid of that chronic smile of yours , " said the editor .
" I will smile no more , " I said , and I went away to execute my delicate and , as I found out , difficult mission .
If I did get into the asylum , which I hardly hoped to do , I had no idea that my experiences would contain aught else than a simple tale of life in an asylum .
That such an institution could be mismanaged , and that cruelties could exist ' neath its roof , I did not deem possible .
I always had a desire to know asylum life more thoroughly –a desire to be convinced that the most helpless of God 's creatures , the insane , were cared for kindly and properly .
The many stories I had read of abuses in such institutions I had regarded as wildly exaggerated or else romances , yet there was a latent desire to know positively .
I shuddered to think how completely the insane were in the power of their keepers , and how one could weep and plead for release , and all of no avail , if the keepers were so minded .
Eagerly I accepted the mission to learn the inside workings of the Blackwell Island Insane Asylum .
" How will you get me out , " I asked my editor , " after I once get in ? "
" I do not know , " he replied , " but we will get you out if we have to tell who you are , and for what purpose you feigned insanity–only get in . "
I had little belief in my ability to deceive the insanity experts , and I think my editor had less .
All the preliminary preparations for my ordeal were left to be planned by myself .
Only one thing was decided upon , namely , that I should pass under the pseudonym of Nellie Brown , the initials of which would agree with my own name and my linen , so that there would be no difficulty in keeping track of my movements and assisting me out of any difficulties or dangers I might get into .
There were ways of getting into the insane ward , but I did not know them .
I might adopt one of two courses .
Either I could feign insanity at the house of friends , and get myself committed on the decision of two competent physicians , or I could go to my goal by way of the police courts .
On reflection I thought it wiser not to inflict myself upon my friends or to get any good - natured doctors to assist me in my purpose .
Besides , to get to Blackwell 's Island my friends would have had to feign poverty , and , unfortunately for the end I had in view , my acquaintance with the struggling poor , except my own self , was only very superficial .
So I determined upon the plan which led me to the successful accomplishment of my mission .
I succeeded in getting committed to the insane ward at Blackwell 's Island , where I spent ten days and nights and had an experience which I shall never forget .
I took upon myself to enact the part of a poor , unfortunate crazy girl , and felt it my duty not to shirk any of the disagreeable results that should follow .
I became one of the city 's insane wards for that length of time , experienced much , and saw and heard more of the treatment accorded to this helpless class of our population , and when I had seen and heard enough , my release was promptly secured .
I left the insane ward with pleasure and regret–pleasure that I was once more able to enjoy the free breath of heaven ; regret that I could not have brought with me some of the unfortunate women who lived and suffered with me , and who , I am convinced , are just as sane as I was and am now myself .
But here let me say one thing :
From the moment I entered the insane ward on the Island , I made no attempt to keep up the assumed role of insanity .
I talked and acted just as I do in ordinary life .
Yet strange to say , the more sanely I talked and acted the crazier I was thought to be by all except one physician , whose kindness and gentle ways I shall not soon forget .
CHAPTER II .
PREPARING FOR THE ORDEAL .
B UT to return to my work and my mission .
After receiving my instructions I returned to my boarding - house , and when evening came I began to practice the role in which I was to make my debut on the morrow .
What a difficult task , I thought , to appear before a crowd of people and convince them that I was insane .
I had never been near insane persons before in my life , and had not the faintest idea of what their actions were like .
And then to be examined by a number of learned physicians who make insanity a specialty , and who daily come in contact with insane people !
How could I hope to pass these doctors and convince them that I was crazy ?
I feared that they could not be deceived .
I began to think my task a hopeless one ; but it had to be done .
So I flew to the mirror and examined my face .
I remembered all I had read of the doings of crazy people , how first of all they have staring eyes , and so I opened mine as wide as possible and stared unblinkingly at my own reflection .
I assure you the sight was not reassuring , even to myself , especially in the dead of night .
I tried to turn the gas up higher in hopes that it would raise my courage .
I succeeded only partially , but I consoled myself with the thought that in a few nights more I would not be there , but locked up in a cell with a lot of lunatics .
The weather was not cold ; but , nevertheless , when I thought of what was to come , wintery chills ran races up and down my back in very mockery of the perspiration which was slowly but surely taking the curl out of my bangs .
Between times , practicing before the mirror and picturing my future as a lunatic , I read snatches of improbable and impossible ghost stories , so that when the dawn came to chase away the night , I felt that I was in a fit mood for my mission , yet hungry enough to feel keenly that I wanted my breakfast .
Slowly and sadly I took my morning bath and quietly bade farewell to a few of the most precious articles known to modern civilization .
Tenderly I put my tooth - brush aside , and , when taking a final rub of the soap , I murmured , " It may be for days , and it may be–for longer . "
Then I donned the old clothing I had selected for the occasion .
I was in the mood to look at everything through very serious glasses .
It 's just as well to take a last " fond look , " I mused , for who could tell but that the strain of playing crazy , and being shut up with a crowd of mad people , might turn my own brain , and I would never get back .
But not once did I think of shirking my mission .
Calmly , outwardly at least , I went out to my crazy business .
I first thought it best to go to a boarding - house , and , after securing lodging , confidentially tell the landlady , or lord , whichever it might chance to be , that I was seeking work , and , in a few days after , apparently go insane .
When I reconsidered the idea , I feared it would take too long to mature .
Suddenly I thought how much easier it would be to go to a boarding - home for working women .
I knew , if once I made a houseful of women believe me crazy , that they would never rest until I was out of their reach and in secure quarters .
From a directory I selected the Temporary Home for Females , No. 84 Second Avenue .
As I walked down the avenue , I determined that , once inside the Home , I should do the best I could to get started on my journey to Blackwell 's Island and the Insane Asylum .
CHAPTER III .
IN THE TEMPORARY HOME .
I WAS left to begin my career as Nellie Brown , the insane girl .
As I walked down the avenue I tried to assume the look which maidens wear in pictures entitled " Dreaming . "
" Far - away " expressions have a crazy air .
I passed through the little paved yard to the entrance of the Home .
I pulled the bell , which sounded loud enough for a church chime , and nervously awaited the opening of the door to the Home , which I intended should ere long cast me forth and out upon the charity of the police .
The door was thrown back with a vengeance , and a short , yellow - haired girl of some thirteen summers stood before me .
" Is the matron in ? " I asked , faintly .
" Yes , she 's in ; she 's busy .
Go to the back parlor , " answered the girl , in a loud voice , without one change in her peculiarly matured face .
I followed these not overkind or polite instructions and found myself in a dark , uncomfortable back - parlor .
There I awaited the arrival of my hostess .
I had been seated some twenty minutes at the least , when a slender woman , clad in a plain , dark dress entered and , stopping before me , ejaculated inquiringly , " Well ? "
" Are you the matron ? " I asked .
" No , " she replied , " the matron is sick ; I am her assistant .
What do you want ? "
" I want to stay here for a few days , if you can accommodate me . "
" Well , I have no single rooms , we are so crowded ; but if you will occupy a room with another girl , I shall do that much for you . "
" I shall be glad of that , " I answered .
" How much do you charge ? " I had brought only about seventy cents along with me , knowing full well that the sooner my funds were exhausted the sooner I should be put out , and to be put out was what I was working for .
" We charge thirty cents a night , " was her reply to my question , and with that I paid her for one night 's lodging , and she left me on the plea of having something else to look after .
Left to amuse myself as best I could , I took a survey of my surroundings .
They were not cheerful , to say the least .
A wardrobe , desk , book - case , organ , and several chairs completed the furnishment of the room , into which the daylight barely came .
By the time I had become familiar with my quarters a bell , which rivaled the door - bell in its loudness , began clanging in the basement , and simultaneously women went trooping down - stairs from all parts of the house .
I imagined , from the obvious signs , that dinner was served , but as no one had said anything to me I made no effort to follow in the hungry train .
Yet I did wish that some one would invite me down .
It always produces such a lonely , homesick feeling to know others are eating , and we have n't a chance , even if we are not hungry .
I was glad when the assistant matron came up and asked me if I did not want something to eat .
I replied that I did , and then I asked her what her name was .
Mrs. Stanard , she said , and I immediately wrote it down in a notebook I had taken with me for the purpose of making memoranda , and in which I had written several pages of utter nonsense for inquisitive scientists .
Thus equipped I awaited developments .
But my dinner–well , I followed Mrs. Stanard down the uncarpeted stairs into the basement ; where a large number of women were eating .
She found room for me at a table with three other women .
The short - haired slavey who had opened the door now put in an appearance as waiter .
Placing her arms akimbo and staring me out of countenance she said :
" Boiled mutton , boiled beef , beans , potatoes , coffee or tea ? "
" Beef , potatoes , coffee and bread , " I responded .
" Bread goes in , " she explained , as she made her way to the kitchen , which was in the rear .
It was not very long before she returned with what I had ordered on a large , badly battered tray , which she banged down before me .
I began my simple meal .
It was not very enticing , so while making a feint of eating I watched the others .
I have often moralized on the repulsive form charity always assumes !
Here was a home for deserving women and yet what a mockery the name was .
The floor was bare , and the little wooden tables were sublimely ignorant of such modern beautifiers as varnish , polish and table - covers .
It is useless to talk about the cheapness of linen and its effect on civilization .
Yet these honest workers , the most deserving of women , are asked to call this spot of bareness–home .
When the meal was finished each woman went to the desk in the corner , where Mrs. Stanard sat , and paid her bill .
I was given a much - used , and abused , red check , by the original piece of humanity in shape of my waitress .
My bill was about thirty cents .
After dinner I went up - stairs and resumed my former place in the back parlor .
I was quite cold and uncomfortable , and had fully made up my mind that I could not endure that sort of business long , so the sooner I assumed my insane points the sooner I would be released from enforced idleness .
Ah! that was indeed the longest day I had ever lived .
I listlessly watched the women in the front parlor , where all sat except myself .
One did nothing but read and scratch her head and occasionally call out mildly , " Georgie , " without lifting her eyes from her book .
" Georgie " was her over - frisky boy , who had more noise in him than any child I ever saw before .
He did everything that was rude and unmannerly , I thought , and the mother never said a word unless she heard some one else yell at him .
Another woman always kept going to sleep and waking herself up with her own snoring .
I really felt wickedly thankful it was only herself she awakened .
The majority of the women sat there doing nothing , but there were a few who made lace and knitted unceasingly .
The enormous door - bell seemed to be going all the time , and so did the short - haired girl .
The latter was , besides , one of those girls who sing all the time snatches of all the songs and hymns that have been composed for the last fifty years .
There is such a thing as martyrdom in these days .
The ringing of the bell brought more people who wanted shelter for the night .
Excepting one woman , who was from the country on a day 's shopping expedition , they were working women , some of them with children .
As it drew toward evening Mrs. Stanard came to me and said :
" What is wrong with you ?
Have you some sorrow or trouble ? "
" No , " I said , almost stunned at the suggestion .
" Why ? "
" Oh , because , " she said , womanlike , " I can see it in your face .
It tells the story of a great trouble . "
" Yes , everything is so sad , " I said , in a haphazard way , which I had intended to reflect my craziness .
" But you must not allow that to worry you .
We all have our troubles , but we get over them in good time .
What kind of work are you trying to get ? "
" I do not know ; it 's all so sad , " I replied .
" Would you like to be a nurse for children and wear a nice white cap and apron ? " she asked .
I put my handkerchief up to my face to hide a smile , and replied in a muffled tone , " I never worked ; I do n't know how . "
" But you must learn , " she urged ; " all these women here work . "
" Do they ? " I said , in a low , thrilling whisper .
" Why , they look horrible to me ; just like crazy women .
I am so afraid of them . "
" They do n't look very nice , " she answered , assentingly , " but they are good , honest working women .
We do not keep crazy people here . "
I again used my handkerchief to hide a smile , as I thought that before morning she would at least think she had one crazy person among her flock .
" They all look crazy , " I asserted again , " and I am afraid of them .
There are so many crazy people about , and one can never tell what they will do .
Then there are so many murders committed , and the police never catch the murderers , " and I finished with a sob that would have broken up an audience of blase critics .
She gave a sudden and convulsive start , and I knew my first stroke had gone home .
It was amusing to see what a remarkably short time it took her to get up from her chair and to whisper hurriedly : " I 'll come back to talk with you after a while . "
I knew she would not come back and she did not .
When the supper - bell rang I went along with the others to the basement and partook of the evening meal , which was similar to dinner , except that there was a smaller bill of fare and more people , the women who are employed outside during the day having returned .
After the evening meal we all adjourned to the parlors , where all sat , or stood , as there were not chairs enough to go round .
It was a wretchedly lonely evening , and the light which fell from the solitary gas jet in the parlor , and oil - lamp the hall , helped to envelop us in a dusky hue and dye our spirits navy blue .
I felt it would not require many inundations of this atmosphere to make me a fit subject for the place I was striving to reach .
I watched two women , who seemed of all the crowd to be the most sociable , and I selected them as the ones to work out my salvation , or , more properly speaking , my condemnation and conviction .
Excusing myself and saying that I felt lonely , I asked if I might join their company .
They graciously consented , so with my hat and gloves on , which no one had asked me to lay aside , I sat down and listened to the rather wearisome conversation , in which I took no part , merely keeping up my sad look , saying " Yes , " or " No , " or " I ca n't say , " to their observations .
Several times I told them I thought everybody in the house looked crazy , but they were slow to catch on to my very original remark .
One said her name was Mrs. King and that she was a Southern woman .
Then she said that I had a Southern accent .
She asked me bluntly if I did not really come from the South .
I said " Yes . "
The other woman got to talking about the Boston boats and asked me if I knew at what time they left .
For a moment I forgot my role of assumed insanity , and told her the correct hour of departure .
She then asked me what work I was going to do , or if I had ever done any .
I replied that I thought it very sad that there were so many working people in the world .
She said in reply that she had been unfortunate and had come to New York , where she had worked at correcting proofs on a medical dictionary for some time , but that her health had given way under the task , and that she was now going to Boston again .
When the maid came to tell us to go to bed I remarked that I was afraid , and again ventured the assertion that all the women in the house seemed to be crazy .
The nurse insisted on my going to bed .
I asked if I could not sit on the stairs , but she said , decisively : " No ; for every one in the house would think you were crazy . "
Finally I allowed them to take me to a room .
Here I must introduce a new personage by name into my narrative .
It is the woman who had been a proofreader , and was about to return to Boston .
She was a Mrs. Caine , who was as courageous as she was good - hearted .
She came into my room , and sat and talked with me a long time , taking down my hair with gentle ways .
She tried to persuade me to undress and go to bed , but I stubbornly refused to do so .
During this time a number of the inmates of the house had gathered around us .
They expressed themselves in various ways .
" Poor loon ! " they said .
" Why , she 's crazy enough ! " " I am afraid to stay with such a crazy being in house . "
" She will murder us all before morning . "
One woman was for sending for a policeman to take me at once .
They were all in a terrible and real state of fright .
No one wanted to be responsible for me , and the woman who was to occupy the room with me declared that she would not stay with that " crazy woman " for all the money of the Vanderbilts .
It was then that Mrs. Caine said she would stay with me .
I told her I would like to have her do so .
So she was left with me .
She did n't undress , but lay down on the bed , watchful of my movements .
She tried to induce me to lie down , but I was afraid to do this .
I knew that if I once gave way I should fall asleep and dream as pleasantly and peacefully as a child .
I should , to use a slang expression , be liable to " give myself dead away . "
So I insisted on sitting on the side of the bed and staring blankly at vacancy .
My poor companion was put into a wretched state of unhappiness .
Every few moments she would rise up to look at me .
She told me that my eyes shone terribly brightly and then began to question me , asking me where I had lived , how long I had been in New York , what I had been doing , and many things besides .
To all her questionings I had but one response –I told her that I had forgotten everything , that ever since my headache had come on I could not remember .
Poor soul !
How cruelly I tortured her , and what a kind heart she had !
But how I tortured all of them !
One of them dreamed of me–as a nightmare .
After I had been in the room an hour or so , I was myself startled by hearing a woman screaming in the next room .
I began to imagine that I was really in an insane asylum .
Mrs. Caine woke up , looked around , frightened , and listened .
She then went out and into the next room , and I heard her asking another woman some questions .
When she came back she told me that the woman had had a hideous nightmare .
She had been dreaming of me .
She had seen me , she said , rushing at her with a knife in my hand , with the intention of killing her .
In trying to escape me she had fortunately been able to scream , and so to awaken herself and scare off her nightmare .
Then Mrs. Caine got into bed again , considerably agitated , but very sleepy .
I was weary , too , but I had braced myself up to the work , and was determined to keep awake all night so as to carry on my work of impersonation to a successful end in the morning .
I heard midnight .
I had yet six hours to wait for daylight .
The time passed with excruciating slowness .
Minutes appeared hours .
The noises in the house and on the avenue ceased .
Fearing that sleep would coax me into its grasp , I commenced to review my life .
How strange it all seems !
One incident , if never so trifling , is but a link more to chain us to our unchangeable fate .
I began at the beginning , and lived again the story of my life .
Old friends were recalled with a pleasurable thrill ; old enmities , old heartaches , old joys were once again present .
The turned - down pages of my life were turned up , and the past was present .
When it was completed , I turned my thoughts bravely to the future , wondering , first , what the next day would bring forth , then making plans for the carrying out of my project .
I wondered if I should be able to pass over the river to the goal of my strange ambition , to become eventually an inmate of the halls inhabited by my mentally wrecked sisters .
And then , once in , what would be my experience ?
And after ?
How to get out ?
Bah !
I said , they will get me out .
That was the greatest night of my existence .
For a few hours I stood face to face with " self ! "
I looked out toward the window and hailed with joy the slight shimmer of dawn .
The light grew strong and gray , but the silence was strikingly still .
My companion slept .
I had still an hour or two to pass over .
Fortunately I found some employment for my mental activity .
Robert Bruce in his captivity had won confidence in the future , and passed his time as pleasantly as possible under the circumstances , by watching the celebrated spider building his web .
I had less noble vermin to interest me .
Yet I believe I made some valuable discoveries in natural history .
I was about to drop off to sleep in spite of myself when I was suddenly startled to wakefulness .
I thought I heard something crawl and fall down upon the counterpane with an almost inaudible thud .
I had the opportunity of studying these interesting animals very thoroughly .
They had evidently come for breakfast , and were not a little disappointed to find that their principal plat was not there .
They scampered up and down the pillow , came together , seemed to hold interesting converse , and acted in every way as if they were puzzled by the absence of an appetizing breakfast .
After one consultation of some length they finally disappeared , seeking victims elsewhere , and leaving me to pass the long minutes by giving my attention to cockroaches , whose size and agility were something of a surprise to me .
My room companion had been sound asleep for a long time , but she now woke up , and expressed surprise at seeing me still awake and apparently as lively as a cricket .
She was as sympathetic as ever .
She came to me and took my hands and tried her best to console me , and asked me if I did not want to go home .
She kept me up - stairs until nearly everybody was out of the house , and then took me down to the basement for coffee and a bun .
After that , partaken in silence , I went back to my room , where I sat down , moping .
Mrs. Caine grew more and more anxious .
" What is to be done ? " she kept exclaiming .
" Where are your friends ? " " No , " I answered , " I have no friends , but I have some trunks .
Where are they ?
I want them . "
The good woman tried to pacify me , saying that they would be found in good time .
She believed that I was insane .
Yet I forgive her .
It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world .
The women in the Home who were not afraid of me had wanted to have some amusement at my expense , and so they had bothered me with questions and remarks that had I been insane would have been cruel and inhumane .
Only this one woman among the crowd , pretty and delicate Mrs. Caine , displayed true womanly feeling .
She compelled the others to cease teasing me and took the bed of the woman who refused to sleep near me .
She protested against the suggestion to leave me alone and to have me locked up for the night so that I could harm no one .
She insisted on remaining with me in order to administer aid should I need it .
She smoothed my hair and bathed my brow and talked as soothingly to me as a mother would do to an ailing child .
By every means she tried to have me go to bed and rest , and when it drew toward morning she got up and wrapped a blanket around me for fear I might get cold ; then she kissed me on the brow and whispered , compassionately :
" Poor child , poor child ! "
How much I admired that little woman 's courage and kindness .
How I longed to reassure her and whisper that I was not insane , and how I hoped that , if any poor girl should ever be so unfortunate as to be what I was pretending to be , she might meet with one who possessed the same spirit of human kindness possessed by Mrs. Ruth Caine .
CHAPTER IV .
JUDGE DUFFY AND THE POLICE .
B UT to return to my story .
I kept up my role until the assistant matron , Mrs. Stanard , came in .
She tried to persuade me to be calm .
I began to see clearly that she wanted to get me out of the house at all hazards , quietly if possible .
This I did not want .
I refused to move , but kept up ever the refrain of my lost trunks .
Finally some one suggested that an officer be sent for .
After awhile Mrs. Stanard put on her bonnet and went out .
Then I knew that I was making an advance toward the home of the insane .
Soon she returned , bringing with her two policemen–big , strong men–who entered the room rather unceremoniously , evidently expecting to meet with a person violently crazy .
The name of one of them was Tom Bockert .
When they entered I pretended not to see them .
" I want you to take her quietly , " said Mrs. Stanard .
" If she do n't come along quietly , " responded one of the men , " I will drag her through the streets . "
I still took no notice of them , but certainly wished to avoid raising a scandal outside .
Fortunately Mrs. Caine came to my rescue .
She told the officers about my outcries for my lost trunks , and together they made up a plan to get me to go along with them quietly by telling me they would go with me to look for my lost effects .
They asked me if I would go .
I said I was afraid to go alone .
Mrs. Stanard then said she would accompany me , and she arranged that the two policemen should follow us at a respectful distance .
She tied on my veil for me , and we left the house by the basement and started across town , the two officers following at some distance behind .
We walked along very quietly and finally came to the station house , which the good woman assured me was the express office , and that there we should certainly find my missing effects .
I went inside with fear and trembling , for good reason .
A few days previous to this I had met Captain McCullagh at a meeting held in Cooper Union .
At that time I had asked him for some information which he had given me .
If he were in , would he not recognize me ?
And then all would be lost so far as getting to the island was concerned .
I pulled my sailor hat as low down over my face as I possibly could , and prepared for the ordeal .
Sure enough there was sturdy Captain McCullagh standing near the desk .
He watched me closely as the officer at the desk conversed in a low tone with Mrs. Stanard and the policeman who brought me .
" Are you Nellie Brown ? " asked the officer .
I said I supposed I was .
" Where do you come from ? " he asked .
I told him I did not know , and then Mrs. Stanard gave him a lot of information about me–told him how strangely I had acted at her home ; how I had not slept a wink all night , and that in her opinion I was a poor unfortunate who had been driven crazy by inhuman treatment .
There was some discussion between Mrs. Standard and the two officers , and Tom Bockert was told to take us down to the court in a car .
" Come along , " Bockert said , " I will find your trunk for you . "
We all went together , Mrs. Stanard , Tom Bockert , and myself .
I said it was very kind of them to go with me , and I should not soon forget them .
As we walked along I kept up my refrain about my trucks , injecting occasionally some remark about the dirty condition of the streets and the curious character of the people we met on the way .
" I do n't think I have ever seen such people before , " I said .
" Who are they ? "
I asked , and my companions looked upon me with expressions of pity , evidently believing I was a foreigner , an emigrant or something of the sort .
They told me that the people around me were working people .
I remarked once more that I thought there were too many working people in the world for the amount of work to be done , at which remark Policeman P. T. Bockert eyed me closely , evidently thinking that my mind was gone for good .
We passed several other policemen , who generally asked my sturdy guardians what was the matter with me .
By this time quite a number of ragged children were following us too , and they passed remarks about me that were to me original as well as amusing .
" What 's she up for ? " " Say , kop , where did ye get her ? "
" Where did yer pull 'er ? "
" She 's a daisy ! "
Poor Mrs. Stanard was more frightened than I was .
The whole situation grew interesting , but I still had fears for my fate before the judge .
At last we came to a low building , and Tom Bockert kindly volunteered the information : " Here 's the express office .
We shall soon find those trunks of yours . "
The entrance to the building was surrounded by a curious crowd and I did not think my case was bad enough to permit me passing them without some remark , so I asked if all those people had lost their trunks .
" Yes , " he said , " nearly all these people are looking for trunks . "
I said , " They all seem to be foreigners , too . "
" Yes , " said Tom , " they are all foreigners just landed .
They have all lost their trunks , and it takes most of our time to help find them for them . "
We entered the courtroom .
It was the Essex Market Police Courtroom .
At last the question of my sanity or insanity was to be decided .
Judge Duffy sat behind the high desk , wearing a look which seemed to indicate that he was dealing out the milk of human kindness by wholesale .
I rather feared I would not get the fate I sought , because of the kindness I saw on every line of his face , and it was with rather a sinking heart that I followed Mrs. Stanard as she answered the summons to go up to the desk , where Tom Bockert had just given an account of the affair .
" Come here , " said an officer .
" What is your name ? "
" Nellie Brown , " I replied , with a little accent .
" I have lost my trunks , and would like if you could find them . "
" When did you come to New York ? " he asked .
" I did not come to New York , " I replied ( while I added , mentally , " because I have been here for some time . " )
" But you are in New York now , " said the man .
" No , " I said , looking as incredulous as I thought a crazy person could , " I did not come to New York . "
" That girl is from the west , " he said , in a tone that made me tremble .
" She has a western accent . "
Some one else who had been listening to the brief dialogue here asserted that he had lived south and that my accent was southern , while another officer was positive it was eastern .
I felt much relieved when the first spokesman turned to the judge and said :
" Judge , here is a peculiar case of a young woman who does n't know who she is or where she came from .
You had better attend to it at once . "
I commenced to shake with more than the cold , and I looked around at the strange crowd about me , composed of poorly dressed men and women with stories printed on their faces of hard lives , abuse and poverty .
Some were consulting eagerly with friends , while others sat still with a look of utter hopelessness .
Everywhere was a sprinkling of well - dressed , well - fed officers watching the scene passively and almost indifferently .
It was only an old story with them .
One more unfortunate added to a long list which had long since ceased to be of any interest or concern to them .
" Come here , girl , and lift your veil , " called out Judge Duffy , in tones which surprised me by a harshness which I did not think from the kindly face he possessed .
" Who are you speaking to ? " I inquired , in my stateliest manner .
" Come here , my dear , and lift your veil .
You know the Queen of England , if she were here , would have to lift her veil , " he said , very kindly .
" That is much better , " I replied .
" I am not the Queen of England , but I 'll lift my veil . "
As I did so the little judge looked at me , and then , in a very kind and gentle tone , he said :
" My dear child , what is wrong ? "
" Nothing is wrong except that I have lost my trunks , and this man , " indicating Policeman Bockert , " promised to bring me where they could be found . "
" What do you know about this child ? " asked the judge , sternly , of Mrs. Stanard , who stood , pale and trembling , by my side .
" I know nothing of her except that she came to the home yesterday and asked to remain overnight . "
" The home !
What do you mean by the home ? " asked Judge Duffy , quickly .
" It is a temporary home kept for working women at No. 84 Second Avenue . "
" What is your position there ? "
" I am assistant matron . "
" Well , tell us all you know of the case . "
" When I was going into the home yesterday I noticed her coming down the avenue .
She was all alone .
I had just got into the house when the bell rang and she came in .
When I talked with her she wanted to know if she could stay all night , and I said she could .
After awhile she said all the people in the house looked crazy , and she was afraid of them .
Then she would not go to bed , but sat up all the night . "
" Had she any money ? "
" Yes , " I replied , answering for her , " I paid her for everything , and the eating was the worst I ever tried . "
There was a general smile at this , and some murmurs of " She 's not so crazy on the food question . "
" Poor child , " said Judge Duffy , " she is well dressed , and a lady .
Her English is perfect , and I would stake everything on her being a good girl .
I am positive she is somebody 's darling . "
At this announcement everybody laughed , and I put my handkerchief over my face and endeavored to choke the laughter that threatened to spoil my plans , in despite of my resolutions .
" I mean she is some woman 's darling , " hastily amended the judge .
" I am sure some one is searching for her .
Poor girl , I will be good to her , for she looks like my sister , who is dead . "
There was a hush for a moment after this announcement , and the officers glanced at me more kindly , while I silently blessed the kind - hearted judge , and hoped that any poor creatures who might be afflicted as I pretended to be should have as kindly a man to deal with as Judge Duffy .
" I wish the reporters were here , " he said at last .
" They would be able to find out something about her . "
I got very much frightened at this , for if there is any one who can ferret out a mystery it is a reporter .
I felt that I would rather face a mass of expert doctors , policemen , and detectives than two bright specimens of my craft , so I said :
" I do n't see why all this is needed to help me find my trunks .
These men are impudent , and I do not want to be stared at .
I will go away .
I do n't want to stay here . "
So saying , I pulled down my veil and secretly hoped the reporters would be detained elsewhere until I was sent to the asylum .
" I do n't know what to do with the poor child , " said the worried judge .
" She must be taken care of . "
" Send her to the Island , " suggested one of the officers .
" Oh , do n't ! " said Mrs. Stanard , in evident alarm .
" Do n't !
She is a lady and it would kill her to be put on the Island . "
For once I felt like shaking the good woman .
To think the Island was just the place I wanted to reach and here she was trying to keep me from going there !
It was very kind of her , but rather provoking under the circumstances .
" There has been some foul work here , " said the judge .
" I believe this child has been drugged and brought to this city .
Make out the papers and we will send her to Bellevue for examination .
Probably in a few days the effect of the drug will pass off and she will be able to tell us a story that will be startling .
If the reporters would only come ! "
I dreaded them , so I said something about not wishing to stay there any longer to be gazed at .
Judge Duffy then told Policeman Bockert to take me to the back office .
After we were seated there Judge Duffy came in and asked me if my home was in Cuba .
" Yes , " I replied , with a smile .
" How did you know ? "
" Oh , I knew it , my dear .
Now , tell me were was it ?
In what part of Cuba ? "
" On the hacienda , " I replied .
" Ah , " said the judge , " on a farm .
Do you remember Havana ? "
" Si , senor , " I answered ; " it is near home .
How did you know ? "
" Oh , I knew all about it .
Now , wo n't you tell me the name of your home ? " he asked , persuasively .
" That 's what I forget , " I answered , sadly .
" I have a headache all the time , and it makes me forget things .
I do n't want them to trouble me .
Everybody is asking me questions , and it makes my head worse , " and in truth it did .
" Well , no one shall trouble you any more .
Sit down here and rest awhile , " and the genial judge left me alone with Mrs. Stanard .
Just then an officer came in with a reporter .
I was so frightened , and thought I would be recognized as a journalist , so I turned my head away and said , " I do n't want to see any reporters ; I will not see any ; the judge said I was not to be troubled . "
" Well , there is no insanity in that , " said the man who had brought the reporter , and together they left the room .
Once again I had a fit of fear .
Had I gone too far in not wanting to see a reporter , and was my sanity detected ?
If I had given the impression that I was sane , I was determined to undo it , so I jumped up and ran back and forward through the office , Mrs. Stanard clinging terrified to my arm .
" I wo n't stay here ; I want my trunks !
Why do they bother me with so many people ? " and thus I kept on until the ambulance surgeon came in , accompanied by the judge .
CHAPTER V .
PRONOUNCED INSANE .
" H ERE is a poor girl who has been drugged , " explained the judge .
" She looks like my sister , and any one can see she is a good girl .
I am interested in the child , and I would do as much for her as if she were my own .
I want you to be kind to her , " he said to the ambulance surgeon .
Then , turning to Mrs. Stanard , he asked her if she could not keep me for a few days until my case was inquired into .
Fortunately , she said she could not , because all the women at the Home were afraid of me , and would leave if I were kept there .
I was very much afraid she would keep me if the pay was assured her , and so I said something about the bad cooking and that I did not intend to go back to the Home .
Then came the examination ; the doctor looked clever and I had not one hope of deceiving him , but I determined to keep up the farce .
" Put out your tongue , " he ordered , briskly .
I gave an inward chuckle at the thought .
" Put out your tongue when I tell you , " he said .
" I do n't want to , " I answered , truthfully enough .
" You must .
You are sick , and I am a doctor . "
" I am not sick and never was .
I only want my trunks . "
But I put out my tongue , which he looked at in a sagacious manner .
Then he felt my pulse and listened to the beating of my heart .
I had not the least idea how the heart of an insane person beat , so I held my breath all the while he listened , until , when he quit , I had to give a gasp to regain it .
Then he tried the effect of the light on the pupils of my eyes .
Holding his hand within a half inch of my face , he told me to look at it , then , jerking it hastily away , he would examine my eyes .
I was puzzled to know what insanity was like in the eye , so I thought the best thing under the circumstances was to stare .
This I did .
I held my eyes riveted unblinkingly upon his hand , and when he removed it I exerted all my strength to still keep my eyes from blinking .
" What drugs have you been taking ? " he then asked me .
" Drugs ! " I repeated , wonderingly .
" I do not know what drugs are . "
" The pupils of her eyes have been enlarged ever since she came to the Home .
They have not changed once , " explained Mrs. Stanard .
I wondered how she knew whether they had or not , but I kept quiet .
" I believe she has been using belladonna , " said the doctor , and for the first time I was thankful that I was a little near - sighted , which of course answers for the enlargement of the pupils .
I thought I might as well be truthful when I could without injuring my case , so I told him I was near - sighted , that I was not in the least ill , had never been sick , and that no one had a right to detain me when I wanted to find my trunks .
I wanted to go home .
He wrote a lot of things in a long , slender book , and then said he was going to take me home .
The judge told him to take me and to be kind to me , and to tell the people at the hospital to be kind to me , and to do all they could for me .
If we only had more such men as Judge Duffy , the poor unfortunates would not find life all darkness .
I began to have more confidence in my own ability now , since one judge , one doctor , and a mass of people had pronounced me insane , and I put on my veil quite gladly when I was told that I was to be taken in a carriage , and that afterward I could go home .
" I am so glad to go with you , " I said , and I meant it .
I was very glad indeed .
Once more , guarded by Policeman Brockert , I walked through the little , crowded courtroom .
I felt quite proud of myself as I went out a side door into an alleyway , where the ambulance was waiting .
Near the closed and barred gates was a small office occupied by several men and large books .
We all went in there , and when they began to ask me questions the doctor interposed and said he had all the papers , and that it was useless to ask me anything further , because I was unable to answer questions .
This was a great relief to me , for my nerves were already feeling the strain .
A rough - looking man wanted to put me into the ambulance , but I refused his aid so decidedly that the doctor and policeman told him to desist , and they performed that gallant office themselves .
I did not enter the ambulance without protest .
I made the remark that I had never seen a carriage of that make before , and that I did not want to ride in it , but after awhile I let them persuade me , as I had right along intended to do .
I shall never forget that ride .
After I was put in flat on the yellow blanket , the doctor got in and sat near the door .
The large gates were swung open , and the curious crowd which had collected swayed back to make way for the ambulance as it backed out .
How they tried to get a glimpse at the supposed crazy girl !
The doctor saw that I did not like the people gazing at me , and considerately put down the curtains , after asking my wishes in regard to it .
Still that did not keep the people away .
The children raced after us , yelling all sorts of slang expressions , and trying to get a peep under the curtains .
It was quite an interesting drive , but I must say that it was an excruciatingly rough one .
I held on , only there was not much to hold on to , and the driver drove as if he feared some one would catch up with us .
CHAPTER VI .
IN BELLEVUE HOSPITAL .
A T last Bellevue was reached , the third station on my way to the island .
I had passed through successfully the ordeals at the home and at Essex Market Police Court , and now felt confident that I should not fail .
The ambulance stopped with a sudden jerk and the doctor jumped out .
" How many have you ? " I heard some one inquire .
" Only one , for the pavilion , " was the reply .
A rough - looking man came forward , and catching hold of me attempted to drag me out as if I had the strength of an elephant and would resist .
The doctor , seeing my look of disgust , ordered him to leave me alone , saying that he would take charge of me himself .
He then lifted me carefully out and I walked with the grace of a queen past the crowd that had gathered curious to see the new unfortunate .
Together with the doctor I entered a small dark office , where there were several men .
The one behind the desk opened a book and began on the long string of questions which had been asked me so often .
I refused to answer , and the doctor told him it was not necessary to trouble me further , as he had all the papers made out , and I was too insane to be able to tell anything that would be of consequence .
I felt relieved that it was so easy here , as , though still undaunted , I had begun to feel faint for want of food .
The order was then given to take me to the insane pavilion , and a muscular man came forward and caught me so tightly by the arm that a pain ran clear through me .
It made me angry , and for a moment I forgot my role as I turned to him and said :
" How dare you touch me ? "
At this he loosened his hold somewhat , and I shook him off with more strength than I thought I possessed .
" I will go with no one but this man , " I said , pointing to the ambulance - surgeon .
" The judge said that he was to take care of me , and I will go with no one else . "
At this the surgeon said that he would take me , and so we went arm in arm , following the man who had at first been so rough with me .
We passed through the well - cared - for grounds and finally reached the insane ward .
A white - capped nurse was there to receive me .
" This young girl is to wait here for the boat , " said the surgeon , and then he started to leave me .
I begged him not to go , or to take me with him , but he said he wanted to get his dinner first , and that I should wait there for him .
When I insisted on accompanying him he claimed that he had to assist at an amputation , and it would not look well for me to be present .
It was evident that he believed he was dealing with an insane person .
Just then the most horrible insane cries came from a yard in the rear .
With all my bravery I felt a chill at the prospect of being shut up with a fellow - creature who was really insane .
The doctor evidently noticed my nervousness , for he said to the attendant ;
" What a noise the carpenters make . "
Turning to me he offered me explanation to the effect that new buildings were being erected , and that the noise came from some of the workmen engaged upon it .
I told him I did not want to stay there without him , and to pacify me he promised soon to return .
He left me and I found myself at last an occupant of an insane asylum .
I stood at the door and contemplated the scene before me .
The long , uncarpeted hall was scrubbed to that peculiar whiteness seen only in public institutions .
In the rear of the hall were large iron doors fastened by a padlock .
Several still - looking benches and a number of willow chairs were the only articles of furniture .
On either side of the hall were doors leading into what I supposed and what proved to be bedrooms .
Near the entrance door , on the right - hand side , was a small sitting - room for the nurses , and opposite it was a room where dinner was dished out .
A nurse in a black dress , white cap and apron and armed with a bunch of keys had charge of the hall .
I soon learned her name , Miss Ball .
An old Irishwoman was maid - of - all - work .
I heard her called Mary , and I am glad to know that there is such a good - hearted woman in that place .
I experienced only kindness and the utmost consideration from her .
There were only three patients , as they are called .
I made the fourth .
I thought I might as well begin work at once , for I still expected that the very first doctor might declare me sane and send me out again into the wide , wide world .
So I went down to the rear of the room and introduced myself to one of the women , and asked her all about herself .
Her name , she said , was Miss Anne Neville , and she had been sick from overwork .
She had been working as a chambermaid , and when her health gave way she was sent to some Sisters '
Home to be treated .
Her nephew , who was a waiter , was out of work , and , being unable to pay her expenses at the Home , had had her transferred to Bellevue .
" Is there anything wrong with you mentally as well ? " I asked her .
" No , " she said .
" The doctors have been asking me many curious questions and confusing me as much as possible , but I have nothing wrong with my brain . "
" Do you know that only insane people are sent to this pavilion ? " I asked .
" Yes , I know ; but I am unable to do anything .
The doctors refuse to listen to me , and it is useless to say anything to the nurses . "
Satisfied from various reasons that Miss Neville was as sane as I was myself , I transferred my attentions to one of the other patients .
I found her in need of medical aid and quite silly mentally , although I have seen many women in the lower walks of life , whose sanity was never questioned , who were not any brighter .
The third patient , Mrs. Fox , would not say much .
She was very quiet , and after telling me that her case was hopeless refused to talk .
I began now to feel surer of my position , and I determined that no doctor should convince me that I was sane so long as I had the hope of accomplishing my mission .
A small , fair - complexioned nurse arrived , and , after putting on her cap , told Miss Ball to go to dinner .
The new nurse , Miss Scott by name , came to me and said , rudely :
" Take off your hat . "
" I shall not take off my hat , " I answered .
" I am waiting for the boat , and I shall not remove it . "
" Well , you are not going on any boat .
You might as well know it now as later .
You are in an asylum for the insane . "
Although fully aware of that fact , her unvarnished words gave me a shock .
" I did not want to come here ; I am not sick or insane , and I will not stay , " I said .
" It will be a long time before you get out if you do n't do as you are told , " answered Miss Scott .
" You might as well take off your hat , or I shall use force , and if I am not able to do it , I have but to touch a bell and I shall get assistance .
Will you take it off ? "
" No , I will not .
I am cold , and I want my hat on , and you can't make me take it off . "
" I shall give you a few more minutes , and if you do n't take it off then I shall use force , and I warn you it will not be very gentle . "
" If you take my hat off I shall take your cap off ; so now . "
Miss Scott was called to the door then , and as I feared that an exhibition of temper might show too much sanity I took off my hat and gloves and was sitting quietly looking into space when she returned .
I was hungry , and was quite pleased to see Mary make preparations for dinner .
The preparations were simple .
She merely pulled a straight bench up along the side of a bare table and ordered the patients to gather ' round the feast ; then she brought out a small tin plate on which was a piece of boiled meat and a potato .
It could not have been colder had it been cooked the week before , and it had no chance to make acquaintance with salt or pepper .
I would not go up to the table , so Mary came to where I sat in a corner , and while handing out the tin plate , asked :
" Have ye any pennies about ye , dearie ? "
" What ? " I said , in my surprise .
" Have ye any pennies , dearie , that ye could give me .
They 'll take them all from ye any way , dearie , so I might as well have them . "
I understood it fully now , but I had no intention of feeing Mary so early in the game , fearing it would have an influence on her treatment of me , so I said I had lost my purse , which was quite true .
But though I did not give Mary any money , she was none the less kind to me .
When I objected to the tin plate in which she had brought my food she fetched a china one for me , and when I found it impossible to eat the food she presented she gave me a glass of milk and a soda cracker .
All the windows in the hall were open and the cold air began to tell on my Southern blood .
It grew so cold indeed as to be almost unbearable , and I complained of it to Miss Scott and Miss Ball .
But they answered curtly that as I was in a charity place I could not expect much else .
All the other women were suffering from the cold , and the nurses themselves had to wear heavy garments to keep themselves warm .
I asked if I could go to bed .
They said " No ! "
At last Miss Scott got an old gray shawl , and shaking some of the moths out of it , told me to put it on .
" It 's rather a bad - looking shawl , " I said .
" Well , some people would get along better if they were not so proud , " said Miss Scott .
" People on charity should not expect anything and should not complain . "
So I put the moth - eaten shawl , with all its musty smell , around me , and sat down on a wicker chair , wondering what would come next , whether I should freeze to death or survive .
My nose was very cold , so I covered up my head and was in a half doze , when the shawl was suddenly jerked from my face and a strange man and Miss Scott stood before me .
The man proved to be a doctor , and his first greetings were :
" I 've seen that face before . "
" Then you know me ? " I asked , with a great show of eagerness that I did not feel .
" I think I do .
Where did you come from ? "
" From home . "
" Where is home ? "
" Do n't you know ?
Cuba . "
He then sat down beside me , felt my pulse , and examined my tongue , and at last said :
" Tell Miss Scott all about yourself . "
" No , I will not .
I will not talk with women . "
" What do you do in New York ? "
" Nothing . "
" Can you work ? "
" No , senor . "
" Tell me , are you a woman of the town ? "
" I do not understand you , " I replied , heartily disgusted with him .
" I mean have you allowed the men to provide for you and keep you ? "
I felt like slapping him in the face , but I had to maintain my composure , so I simply said :
" I do not know what you are talking about .
I always lived at home . "
After many more questions , fully as useless and senseless , he left me and began to talk with the nurse .
" Positively demented , " he said .
" I consider it a hopeless case .
She needs to be put where some one will take care of her . "
And so I passed my second medical expert .
After this , I began to have a smaller regard for the ability of doctors than I ever had before , and a greater one for myself .
I felt sure now that no doctor could tell whether people were insane or not , so long as the case was not violent .
Later in the afternoon a boy and a woman came .
The woman sat down on a bench , while the boy went in and talked with Miss Scott .
In a short time he came out , and , just nodding good - bye to the woman , who was his mother , went away .
She did not look insane , but as she was German I could not learn her story .
Her name , however , was Mrs. Louise Schanz .
She seemed quite lost , but when the nurses put her at some sewing she did her work well and quickly .
At three in the afternoon all the patients were given a gruel broth , and at five a cup of tea and a piece of bread .
I was favored ; for when they saw that it was impossible for me to eat the bread or drink the stuff honored by the name of tea , they gave me a cup of milk and a cracker , the same as I had had at noon .
Just as the gas was being lighted another patient was added .
She was a young girl , twenty - five years old .
She told me that she had just gotten up from a sick bed .
Her appearance confirmed her story .
She looked like one who had had a severe attack of fever .
" I am now suffering from nervous debility , " she said , " and my friends have sent me here to be treated for it . "
I did not tell her where she was , and she seemed quite satisfied .
At 6.15 Miss Ball said that she wanted to go away , and so we would all have to go to bed .
Then each of us–we now numbered six–were assigned a room and told to undress .
I did so , and was given a short , cotton - flannel gown to wear during the night .
Then she took every particle of the clothing I had worn during the day , and , making it up in a bundle , labeled it " Brown , " and took it away .
The iron - barred window was locked , and Miss Ball , after giving me an extra blanket , which , she said , was a favor rarely granted , went out and left me alone .
The bed was not a comfortable one .
It was so hard , indeed , that I could not make a dent in it ; and the pillow was stuffed with straw .
Under the sheet was an oilcloth spread .
As the night grew colder I tried to warm that oilcloth .
I kept on trying , but when morning dawned and it was still as cold as when I went to bed , and had reduced me too , to the temperature of an iceberg , I gave it up as an impossible task .
I had hoped to get some rest on this my first night in an insane asylum .
But I was doomed to disappointment .
When the night nurses came in they were curious to see me and to find out what I was like .
No sooner had they left than I heard some one at my door inquiring for Nellie Brown , and I began to tremble , fearing always that my sanity would be discovered .
By listening to the conversation I found it was a reporter in search of me , and I heard him ask for my clothing so that he might examine it .
I listened quite anxiously to the talk about me , and was relieved to learn that I was considered hopelessly insane .
That was encouraging .
After the reporter left I heard new arrivals , and I learned that a doctor was there and intended to see me .
For what purpose I knew not , and I imagined all sorts of horrible things , such as examinations and the rest of it , and when they got to my room I was shaking with more than fear .
" Nellie Brown , here is the doctor ; he wishes to speak with you , " said the nurse .
If that 's all he wanted I thought I could endure it .
I removed the blanket which I had put over my head in my sudden fright and looked up .
The sight was reassuring .
He was a handsome young man .
He had the air and address of a gentleman .
Some people have since censured this action ; but I feel sure , even if it was a little indiscreet , that they young doctor only meant kindness to me .
He came forward , seated himself on the side of my bed , and put his arm soothingly around my shoulders .
It was a terrible task to play insane before this young man , and only a girl can sympathize with me in my position .
" How do you feel to - night , Nellie ? " he asked , easily .
" Oh , I feel all right . "
" But you are sick , you know , " he said .
" Oh , am I ? " I replied , and I turned by head on the pillow and smiled .
" When did you leave Cuba , Nellie ? "
" Oh , you know my home ? " I asked .
" Yes , very well .
Do n't you remember me ?
I remember you . "
" Do you ? " and I mentally said I should not forget him .
He was accompanied by a friend who never ventured a remark , but stood staring at me as I lay in bed .
After a great many questions , to which I answered truthfully , he left me .
Then came other troubles .
All night long the nurses read one to the other aloud , and I know that the other patients , as well as myself , were unable to sleep .
Every half - hour or hour they would walk heavily down the halls , their boot - heels resounding like the march of a private of dragoons , and take a look at every patient .
Of course this helped to keep us awake .
Then as it came toward morning , they began to beat eggs for breakfast , and the sound made me realize how horribly hungry I was .
Occasional yells and cries came from the male department , and that did not aid in making the night pass more cheerfully .
Then the ambulance - gong , as it brought in more unfortunates , sounded as a knell to life and liberty .
Thus I passed my first night as an insane girl at Bellevue .
CHAPTER VII .
THE GOAL IN SIGHT .
A T 6 o'clock on Sunday morning , Sept. 25 , the nurses pulled the covering from my bed .
" Come , it 's time for you to get out of bed , " they said , and opened the window and let in the cold breeze .
My clothing was then returned to me .
After dressing I was shown to a washstand , where all the other patients were trying to rid their faces of all traces of sleep .
At 7 o'clock we were given some horrible mess , which Mary told us was chicken broth .
The cold , from which we had suffered enough the day previous , was bitter , and when I complained to the nurse she said it was one of the rules of the institution not to turn the heat on until October , and so we would have to endure it , as the steam - pipes had not even been put in order .
The night nurses then , arming themselves with scissors , began to play manicure on the patients .
They cut my nails to the quick , as they did those of several of the other patients .
Shortly after this a handsome young doctor made his appearance and I was conducted into the sitting - room .
" Who are you ? " he asked .
" Nellie Moreno , " I replied .
" Then why did you give the name of Brown ? " he asked .
" What is wrong with you ? "
" Nothing .
I did not want to come here , but they brought me .
I want to go away .
Wo n't you let me out ? "
" If I take you out will you stay with me ?
Wo n't you run away from me when you get on the street ? "
" I can't promise that I will not , " I answered , with a smile and a sigh , for he was handsome .
He asked me many other questions .
Did I ever see faces on the wall ?
Did I ever hear voices around ?
I answered him to the best of my ability .
" Do you ever hear voices at night ? " he asked .
" Yes , there is so much talking I cannot sleep . "
" I thought so , " he said to himself .
Then turning to me , he asked : " What do these voices say ? "
" Well , I do not listen to them always .
But sometimes , very often , they talk about Nellie Brown , and then on other subjects that do not interest me half so much , " I answered , truthfully .
" That will do , " he said to Miss Scott , who was just on the outside .
" Can I go away ? " I asked .
" Yes , " he said , with a satisfied laugh , " we 'll soon send you away . "
" It is so very cold here , I want to go out , " I said .
" That 's true , " he said to Miss Scott .
" The cold is almost unbearable in here , and you will have some cases of pneumonia if you are not careful . "
With this I was led away and another patient was taken in .
I sat right outside the door and waited to hear how he would test the sanity of the other patients .
With little variation the examination was exactly the same as mine .
All the patients were asked if they saw faces on the wall , heard voices , and what they said .
I might also add each patient denied any such peculiar freaks of sight and hearing .
At 10 o'clock we were given a cup of unsalted beef tea ; at noon a bit of cold meat and a potatoe , at 3 o'clock a cup of oatmeal gruel and at 5.30 a cup of tea and a slice of unbuttered bread .
We were all cold and hungry .
After the physician left we were given shawls and told to walk up and down the halls in order to get warm .
During the day the pavilion was visited by a number of people who were curious to see the crazy girl from Cuba .
I kept my head covered , on the plea of being cold , for fear some of the reporters would recognize me .
Some of the visitors were apparently in search of a missing girl , for I was made take down the shawl repeatedly , and after they looked at me they would say , " I do n't know her , " " or [ sic ] , " she is not the one , " for which I was secretly thankful .
Warden O'Rourke visited me , and tried his arts on an examination .
Then he brought some well - dressed women and some gentlemen at different times to have a glance at the mysterious Nellie Brown .
The reporters were the most troublesome .
Such a number of them !
And they were all so bright and clever that I was terribly frightened lest they should see that I was sane .
They were very kind and nice to me , and very gentle in all their questionings .
My late visitor the night previous came to the window while some reporters were interviewing me in the sitting - room , and told the nurse to allow them to see me , as they would be of assistance in finding some clew as to my identity .
In the afternoon Dr. Field came and examined me .
He asked me only a few questions , and one that had no bearing on such a case .
The chief question was of my home and friends , and if I had any lovers or had ever been married .
Then he made me stretch out my arms and move my fingers , which I did without the least hesitation , yet I heard him say my case was hopeless .
The other patients were asked the same questions .
As the doctor was about to leave the pavilion Miss Tillie Mayard discovered that she was in an insane ward .
She went to Dr. Field and asked him why she had been sent there .
" Have you just found out you are in an insane asylum ? " asked the doctor .
" Yes ; my friends said they were sending me to a convalescent ward to be treated for nervous debility , from which I am suffering since my illness .
I want to get out of this place immediately . "
" Well , you wo n't get out in a hurry , " he said , with a quick laugh .
" If you know anything at all , " she responded , " you should be able to tell that I am perfectly sane .
Why do n't you test me ? "
" We know all we want to on that score , " said the doctor , and he left the poor girl condemned to an insane asylum , probably for life , without giving her one feeble chance to prove her sanity .
Sunday night was but a repetition of Saturday .
All night long we were kept awake by the talk of the nurses and their heavy walking through the uncarpeted halls .
On Monday morning we were told that we should be taken away at 1.30 .
The nurses questioned me unceasingly about my home , and all seemed to have an idea that I had a lover who had cast me forth on the world and wrecked my brain .
The morning brought many reporters .
How untiring they are in their efforts to get something new .
Miss Scott refused to allow me to be seen , however , and for this I was thankful .
Had they been given free access to me , I should probably not have been a mystery long , for many of them knew me by sight .
Warden O'Rourke came for a final visit and had a short conversation with me .
He wrote his name in my notebook , saying to the nurse that I would forget all about it in an hour .
I smiled and thought I was n't sure of that .
Other people called to see me , but none knew me or could give any information about me .
Noon came .
I grew nervous as the time approached to leave for the Island .
I dreaded every new arrival , fearful that my secret would be discovered at the last moment .
Then I was given a shawl and my hat and gloves .
I could hardly put them on , my nerves were so unstrung .
At last the attendant arrived , and I bade good - bye to Mary as I slipped " a few pennies " into her hand .
" God bless you , " she said ; " I shall pray for you .
Cheer up , dearie .
You are young , and will get over this . "
I told her I hoped so , and then I said good - bye to Miss Scott in Spanish .
The rough - looking attendant twisted his arms around mine , and half - led , half - dragged me to an ambulance .
A crowd of the students had assembled , and they watched us curiously .
I put the shawl over my face , and sank thankfully into the wagon .
Miss Neville , Miss Mayard , Mrs. Fox , and Mrs. Schanz were all put in after me , one at a time .
A man got in with us , the doors were locked , and we were driven out of the gates in great style on toward the Insane Asylum and victory !
The patients made no move to escape .
The odor of the male attendant 's breath was enough to make one 's head swim .
When we reached the wharf such a mob of people crowded around the wagon that the police were called to put them away , so that we could reach the boat .
I was the last of the procession .
I was escorted down the plank , the fresh breeze blowing the attendants ' whisky breath into my face until I staggered .
I was taken into a dirty cabin , where I found my companions seated on a narrow bench .
The small windows were closed , and , with the smell of the filthy room , the air was stifling .
At one end of the cabin was a small bunk in such a condition that I had to hold my nose when I went near it .
A sick girl was put on it .
An old woman , with an enormous bonnet and a dirty basket filled with chunks of bread and bits of scrap meat , completed our company .
The door was guarded by two female attendants .
One was clad in a dress made of bed - ticking and the other was dressed with some attempt at style .
They were coarse , massive women , and expectorated tobacco juice about on the floor in a manner more skillful than charming .
One of these fearful creatures seemed to have much faith in the power of the glance on insane people , for , when any one of us would move or go to look out of the high window she would say " Sit down , " and would lower her brows and glare in a way that was simply terrifying .
While guarding the door they talked with some men on the outside .
They discussed the number of patients and then their own affairs in a manner neither edifying nor refined .
The boat stopped and the old woman and the sick girl were taken off .
The rest of us were told to sit still .
At the next stop my companions were taken off , one at a time .
I was last , and it seemed to require a man and a woman to lead me up the plank to reach the shore .
An ambulance was standing there , and in it were the four other patients .
" What is this place ? " I asked of the man , who had his fingers sunk into the flesh of my arm .
" Blackwell 's Island , an insane place , where you 'll never get out of . "
With this I was shoved into the ambulance , the springboard was put up , an officer and a mail - carrier jumped on behind , and I was swiftly driven to the Insane Asylum on Blackwell 's Island .
CHAPTER VIII .
INSIDE THE MADHOUSE .
A S the wagon was rapidly driven through the beautiful lawns up to the asylum my feelings of satisfaction at having attained the object of my work were greatly dampened by the look of distress on the faces of my companions .
Poor women , they had no hopes of a speedy delivery .
They were being driven to a prison , through no fault of their own , in all probability for life .
In comparison , how much easier it would be to walk to the gallows than to this tomb of living horrors !
On the wagon sped , and I , as well as my comrades , gave a despairing farewell glance at freedom as we came in sight of the long stone buildings .
We passed one low building , and the stench was so horrible that I was compelled to hold my breath , and I mentally decided that it was the kitchen .
I afterward found I was correct in my surmise , and smiled at the signboard at the end of the walk : " Visitors are not allowed on this road . "
I do n't think the sign would be necessary if they once tried the road , especially on a warm day .
The wagon stopped , and the nurse and officer in charge told us to get out .
The nurse added : " Thank God ! they came quietly . "
We obeyed orders to go ahead up a flight of narrow , stone steps , which had evidently been built for the accommodation of people who climb stairs three at a time .
I wondered if my companions knew where we were , so I said to Miss Tillie Mayard :
" Where are we ? "
" At the Blackwell 's Island Lunatic Asylum , " she answered , sadly .
" Are you crazy ? " I asked .
" No , " she replied ; " but as we have been sent here we will have to be quiet until we find some means of escape .
They will be few , though , if all the doctors , as Dr. Field , refuse to listen to me or give me a chance to prove my sanity . "
We were ushered into a narrow vestibule , and the door was locked behind us .
In spite of the knowledge of my sanity and the assurance that I would be released in a few days , my heart gave a sharp twinge .
Pronounced insane by four expert doctors and shut up behind the unmerciful bolts and bars of a madhouse !
Not to be confined alone , but to be a companion , day and night , of senseless , chattering lunatics ; to sleep with them , to eat with them , to be considered one of them , was an uncomfortable position .
Timidly we followed the nurse up the long uncarpeted hall to a room filled by so - called crazy women .
We were told to sit down , and some of the patients kindly made room for us .
They looked at us curiously , and one came up to me and asked :
" Who sent you here ? "
" The doctors , " I answered .
" What for ? " she persisted .
" Well , they say I am insane , " I admitted .
" Insane ! " she repeated , incredulously .
" It can not be seen in your face . "
This woman was too clever , I concluded , and was glad to answer the roughly given orders to follow the nurse to see the doctor .
This nurse , Miss Grupe , by the way , had a nice German face , and if I had not detected certain hard lines about the mouth I might have expected , as did my companions , to receive but kindness from her .
She left us in a small waiting - room at the end of the hall , and left us alone while she went into a small office opening into the sitting or receiving - room .
" I like to go down in the wagon , " she said to the invisible party on the inside .
" It helps to break up the day . "
He answered her that the open air improved her looks , and she again appeared before us all smiles and simpers .
" Come here , Tillie Mayard , " she said .
Miss Mayard obeyed , and , though I could not see into the office , I could hear her gently but firmly pleading her case .
All her remarks were as rational as any I ever heard , and I thought no good physician could help but be impressed with her story .
She told of her recent illness , that she was suffering from nervous debility .
She begged that they try all their tests for insanity , if they had any , and give her justice .
Poor girl , how my heart ached for her !
I determined then and there that I would try by every means to make my mission of benefit to my suffering sisters ; that I would show how they are committed without ample trial .
Without one word of sympathy or encouragement she was brought back to where we sat .
Mrs. Louise Schanz was taken into the presence of Dr. Kinier , the medical man .
" Your name ? " he asked , loudly .
She answered in German , saying she did not speak English nor could she understand it .
However , when he said Mrs. Louise Schanz , she said " Yah , yah . "
Then he tried other questions , and when he found she could not understand one world of English , he said to Miss Grupe :
" You are German ; speak to her for me . "
Miss Grupe proved to be one of those people who are ashamed of their nationality , and she refused , saying she could understand but few worlds of her mother tongue .
" You know you speak German .
Ask this woman what her husband does , " and they both laughed as if they were enjoying a joke .
" I can't speak but a few words , " she protested , but at last she managed to ascertain the occupation of Mr. Schanz .
" Now , what was the use of lying to me ? " asked the doctor , with a laugh which dispelled the rudeness .
" I can't speak any more , " she said , and she did not .
Thus was Mrs. Louise Schanz consigned to the asylum without a chance of making herself understood .
Can such carelessness be excused , I wonder , when it is so easy to get an interpreter ?
If the confinement was but for a few days one might question the necessity .
But here was a woman taken without her own consent from the free world to an asylum and there given no chance to prove her sanity .
Confined most probably for life behind asylum bars , without even being told in her language the why and wherefore .
Compare this with a criminal , who is given every chance to prove his innocence .
Who would not rather be a murderer and take the chance for life than be declared insane , without hope of escape ?
Mrs. Schanz begged in German to know where she was , and pleaded for liberty .
Her voice broken by sobs , she was led unheard out to us .
Mrs .
Fox was then put through this weak , trifling examination and brought from the office , convicted .
Miss Annie Neville took her turn , and I was again left to the last .
I had by this time determined to act as I do when free , except that I would refuse to tell who I was or where my home was .
CHAPTER IX .
AN EXPERT ( ? )
AT WORK .
" N ELLIE B ROWN , the doctor wants you , " said Miss Grupe .
I went in and was told to sit down opposite Dr. Kinier at the desk .
" What is your name ? " he asked , without looking up .
" Nellie Brown , " I replied easily .
" Where is your home ? " writing what I had said down in a large book .
" In Cuba . "
" Oh ! " he ejaculated , with sudden understanding –then , addressing the nurse :
" Did you see anything in the papers about her ? "
" Yes , " she replied , " I saw a long account of this girl in the Sun on Sunday . "
Then the doctor said :
" Keep her here until I go to the office and see the notice again . "
He left us , and I was relieved of my hat and shawl .
On his return , he said he had been unable to find the paper , but he related the story of my debut , as he had read it , to the nurse .
" What 's the color of her eyes ? "
Miss Grupe looked , and answered " gray , " although everybody had always said my eyes were brown or hazel .
" What 's your age ? " he asked ; and as I answered , " Nineteen last May , " he turned to the nurse , and said , " When do you get your next pass ? "
This I ascertained was a leave of absence , or " a day off . "
" Next Saturday , " she said , with a laugh .
" You will go to town ? " and they both laughed as she answered in the affirmative , and he said :
" Measure her . "
I was stood under a measure , and it was brought down tightly on my head .
" What is it ? " asked the doctor .
" Now you know I can't tell , " she said .
" Yes , you can ; go ahead .
What height ? "
" I do n't know ; there are some figures there , but I can't tell . "
" Yes , you can .
Now look and tell me . "
" I can't ; do it yourself , " and they laughed again as the doctor left his place at the desk and came forward to see for himself .
" Five feet five inches ; do n't you see ? " he said , taking her hand and touching the figures .
By her voice I knew she did not understand yet , but that was no concern of mine , as the doctor seemed to find a pleasure in aiding her .
Then I was put on the scales , and she worked around until she got them to balance .
" How much ? " asked the doctor , having resumed his position at the desk .
" I do n't know .
You will have to see for yourself , " she replied , calling him by his Christian name , which I have forgotten .
He turned and also addressing her by her baptismal name , he said :
" You are getting too fresh ! " and they both laughed .
I then told the weight –112 pounds –to the nurse , and she in turn told the doctor .
" What time are you going to supper ? " he asked , and she told him .
He gave the nurse more attention than he did me , and asked her six questions to every one of me .
Then he wrote my fate in the book before him .
I said , " I am not sick and I do not want to stay here .
No one has a right to shut me up in this manner . "
He took no notice of my remarks , and having completed his writings , as well as his talk with the nurse for the moment , he said that would do , and with my companions , I went back to the sitting - room .
" You play the piano ? " they asked .
" Oh , yes ; ever since I was a child , " I replied .
Then they insisted that I should play , and they seated me on a wooden chair before an old - fashioned square .
I struck a few notes , and the untuned response sent a grinding chill through me .
" How horrible , " I exclaimed , turning to a nurse , Miss McCarten , who stood at my side .
" I never touched a piano as much out of tune . "
" It 's a pity of you , " she said , spitefully ; " we 'll have to get one made to order for you . "
I began to play the variations of " Home Sweet Home . "
The talking ceased and every patient sat silent , while my cold fingers moved slowly and stiffly over the keyboard .
I finished in an aimless fashion and refused all requests to play more .
Not seeing an available place to sit , I still occupied the chair in the front of the piano while I " sized up " my surroundings .
It was a long , bare room , with bare yellow benches encircling it .
These benches , which were perfectly straight , and just as uncomfortable , would hold five people , although in almost every instance six were crowded on them .
Barred windows , built about five feet from the floor , faced the two double doors which led into the hall .
The bare white walls were somewhat relieved by three lithographs , one of Fritz Emmet and the others of negro minstrels .
In the center of the room was a large table covered with a white bed - spread , and around it sat the nurses .
Everything was spotlessly clean and I thought what good workers the nurses must be to keep such order .
In a few days after how I laughed at my own stupidity to think the nurses would work .
When they found I would not play any more , Miss McCarten came up to me saying , roughly :
" Get away from here , " and closed the piano with a bang .
" Brown , come here , " was the next order I got from a rough , red - faced woman at the table .
" What have you on ? "
" My clothing , " I replied .
She lifted my dress and skirts and wrote down one pair shoes , one pair stockings , one cloth dress , one straw sailor hat , and so on .
CHAPTER X .
MY FIRST SUPPER .
T HIS examination over , we heard some one yell , " Go out into the hall . "
One of the patients kindly explained that this was an invitation to supper .
We late comers tried to keep together , so we entered the hall and stood at the door where all the women had crowded .
How we shivered as we stood there !
The windows were open and the draught went whizzing through the hall .
The patients looked blue with cold , and the minutes stretched into a quarter of an hour .
At last one of the nurses went forward and unlocked a door , through which we all crowded to a landing of the stairway .
Here again came a long halt directly before an open window .
" How very imprudent for the attendants to keep these thinly clad women standing here in the cold , " said Miss Neville .
I looked at the poor crazy captives shivering , and added , emphatically , " It 's horribly brutal . "
While they stood there I thought I would not relish supper that night .
They looked so lost and hopeless .
Some were chattering nonsense to invisible persons , others were laughing or crying aimlessly , and one old , gray - haired woman was nudging me , and , with winks and sage noddings of the head and pitiful uplifting of the eyes and hands , was assuring me that I must not mind the poor creatures , as they were all mad .
" Stop at the heater , " was then ordered , " and get in line , two by two . "
" Mary , get a companion . "
" How many times must I tell you to keep in line ? "
" Stand still , " and , as the orders were issued , a shove and a push were administered , and often a slap on the ears .
After this third and final halt , we were marched into a long , narrow dining - room , where a rush was made for the table .
The table reached the length of the room and was uncovered and uninviting .
Long benches without backs were put for the patients to sit on , and over these they had to crawl in order to face the table .
Placed closed together all along the table were large dressing - bowls filled with a pinkish - looking stuff which the patients called tea .
By each bowl was laid a piece of bread , cut thick and buttered .
A small saucer containing five prunes accompanied the bread .
One fat woman made a rush , and jerking up several saucers from those around her emptied their contents into her own saucer .
Then while holding to her own bowl she lifted up another and drained its contents at one gulp .
This she did to a second bowl in shorter time than it takes to tell it .
Indeed , I was so amused at her successful grabbings that when I looked at my own share the woman opposite , without so much as by your leave , grabbed my bread and left me without any .
Another patient , seeing this , kindly offered me hers , but I declined with thanks and turned to the nurse and asked for more .
As she flung a thick piece down on the table she made some remark about the fact that if I forgot where my home was I had not forgotten how to eat .
I tried the bread , but the butter was so horrible that one could not eat it .
A blue - eyed German girl on the opposite side of the table told me I could have bread unbuttered if I wished , and that very few were able to eat the butter .
I turned my attention to the prunes and found that very few of them would be sufficient .
A patient near asked me to give them to her .
I did so .
My bowl of tea was all that was left .
I tasted , and one taste was enough .
It had no sugar , and it tasted as if it had been made in copper .
It was as weak as water .
This was also transferred to a hungrier patient , in spite of the protest of Miss Neville .
" You must force the food down , " she said , " else you will be sick , and who know but what , with these surroundings , you may go crazy .
To have a good brain the stomach must be cared for . "
" It is impossible for me to eat that stuff , " I replied , and , despite all her urging , I ate nothing that night .
It did not require much time for the patients to consume all that was eatable on the table , and then we got our orders to form in line in the hall .
When this was done the doors before us were unlocked and we were ordered to proceed back to the sitting - room .
Many of the patients crowded near us , and I was again urged to play , both by them and by the nurses .
To please the patients I promised to play and Miss Tillie Mayard was to sing .
The first thing she asked me to play was " Rock - a - bye Baby , " and I did so .
She sang it beautifully .
CHAPTER XI .
IN THE BATH .
A FEW more songs and we were told to go with Miss Grupe .
We were taken into a cold , wet bathroom , and I was ordered to undress .
Did I protest ?
Well , I never grew so earnest in my life as when I tried to beg off .
They said if I did not they would use force and that it would not be very gentle .
At this I noticed one of the craziest women in the ward standing by the filled bathtub with a large , discolored rag in her hands .
She was chattering away to herself and chuckling in a manner which seemed to me fiendish .
I knew now what was to be done with me .
I shivered .
They began to undress me , and one by one they pulled off my clothes .
At last everything was gone excepting one garment .
" I will not remove it , " I said vehemently , but they took it off .
I gave one glance at the group of patients gathered at the door watching the scene , and I jumped into the bathtub with more energy than grace .
The water was ice - cold , and I again began to protest .
How useless it all was !
I begged , at least , that the patients be made to go away , but was ordered to shut up .
The crazy woman began to scrub me .
I can find no other word that will express it but scrubbing .
From a small tin pan she took some soft soap and rubbed it all over me , even all over my face and my pretty hair .
I was at last past seeing or speaking , although I had begged that my hair be left untouched .
Rub , rub , rub , went the old woman , chattering to herself .
My teeth chattered and my limbs were goose - fleshed and blue with cold .
Suddenly I got , one after the other , three buckets of water over my head–ice - cold water , too –into my eyes , my ears , my nose and my mouth .
I think I experienced some of the sensations of a drowning person as they dragged me , gasping , shivering and quaking , from the tub .
For once I did look insane .
I caught a glance of the indescribable look on the faces of my companions , who had witnessed my fate and knew theirs was surely following .
Unable to control myself at the absurd picture I presented , I burst into roars of laughter .
They put me , dripping wet , into a short canton flannel slip , labeled across the extreme end in large black letters , " Lunatic Asylum , B. I. , H. 6 . " The letters meant Blackwell 's Island , Hall 6 .
By this time Miss Mayard had been undressed , and , much as I hated my recent bath , I would have taken another if by it I could have saved her the experience .
Imagine plunging that sick girl into a cold bath when it made me , who have never been ill , shake as if with ague .
I heard her explain to Miss Grupe that her head was still sore from her illness .
Her hair was short and had mostly come out , and she asked that the crazy woman be made to rub more gently , but Miss Grupe said :
" There is n't much fear of hurting you .
Shut up , or you 'll get it worse . "
Miss Mayard did shut up , and that was my last look at her for the night .
I was hurried into a room where there were six beds , and had been put into bed when some one came along and jerked me out again , saying :
" Nellie Brown has to be put in a room alone to - night , for I suppose she 's noisy . "
I was taken to room 28 and left to try and make an impression on the bed .
It was an impossible task .
The bed had been made high in the center and sloping on either side .
At the first touch my head flooded the pillow with water , and my wet slip transferred some of its dampness to the sheet .
When Miss Grupe came in I asked if I could not have a night - gown .
" We have not such things in this institution , " she said .
" I do not like to sleep without , " I replied .
" Well , I do n't care about that , " she said .
" You are in a public institution now , and you can't expect to get anything .
This is charity , and you should be thankful for what you get . "
" But the city pays to keep these places up , " I urged , " and pays people to be kind to the unfortunates brought here . "
" Well , you do n't need to expect any kindness here , for you wo n't get it , " she said , and she went out and closed the door .
A sheet and an oilcloth were under me , and a sheet and black wool blanket above .
I never felt anything so annoying as that wool blanket as I tried to keep it around my shoulders to stop the chills from getting underneath .
When I pulled it up I left my feet bare , and when I pulled it down my shoulders were exposed .
There was absolutely nothing in the room but the bed and myself .
As the door had been locked I imagined I should be left alone for the night , but I heard the sound of the heavy tread of two women down the hall .
They stopped at every door , unlocked it , and in a few moments I could hear them relock it .
This they did without the least attempt at quietness down the whole length of the opposite side of the hall and up to my room .
Here they paused .
The key was inserted in the lock and turned .
I watched those about to enter .
In they came , dressed in brown and white striped dresses , fastened by brass buttons , large , white aprons , a heavy green cord about the waist , from which dangled a bunch of large keys , and small , white caps on their heads .
Being dressed as were the attendants of the day , I knew they were nurses .
The first one carried a lantern , and she flashed its light into my face while she said to her assistant :
" This is Nellie Brown . "
Looking at her , I asked :
" Who are you ? "
" The night nurse , my dear , " she replied , and , wishing that I would sleep well , she went out and locked the door after her .
Several times during the night they came into my room , and even had I been able to sleep , the unlocking of the heavy door , their loud talking , and heavy tread , would have awakened me .
I could not sleep , so I lay in bed picturing to myself the horrors in case a fire should break out in the asylum .
Every door is locked separately and the windows are heavily barred , so that escape is impossible .
In the one building alone there are , I think Dr. Ingram told me , some three hundred women .
They are locked , one to ten to a room .
It is impossible to get out unless these doors are unlocked .
A fire is not improbable , but one of the most likely occurrences .
Should the building burn , the jailers or nurses would never think of releasing their crazy patients .
This I can prove to you later when I come to tell of their cruel treatment of the poor things intrusted to their care .
As I say , in case of fire , not a dozen women could escape .
All would be left to roast to death .
Even if the nurses were kind , which they are not , it would require more presence of mind than women of their class possess to risk the flames and their own lives while they unlocked the hundred doors for the insane prisoners .
Unless there is a change there will some day be a tale of horror never equaled .
In this connection is an amusing incident which happened just previous to my release .
I was talking with Dr. Ingram about many things , and at last told him what I thought would be the result of a fire .
" The nurses are expected to open the doors , " he said .
" But you know positively that they would not wait to do that , " I said , " and these women would burn to death . "
He sat silent , unable to contradict my assertion .
" Why do n't you have it changed ? " I asked .
" What can I do ? " he replied .
" I offer suggestions until my brain is tired , but what good does it do ?
What would you do ? " he asked , turning to me , the proclaimed insane girl .
" Well , I should insist on them having locks put in , as I have seen in some places , that by turning a crank at the end of the hall you can lock or unlock every door on the one side .
Then there would be some chance of escape .
Now , every door being locked separately , there is absolutely none . "
Dr. Ingram turned to me with an anxious look on his kind face as he asked , slowly :
" Nellie Brown , what institution have you been an inmate of before you came here ? "
" None .
I never was confined in any institution , except boarding - school , in my life . "
" Where then did you see the locks you have described ? "
I had seen them in the new Western Penitentiary at Pittsburg , Pa. , but I did not dare say so .
I merely answered :
" Oh , I have seen them in a place I was in –I mean as a visitor . "
" There is only one place I know of where they have those locks , " he said , sadly , " and that is at Sing Sing . "
The inference is conclusive .
I laughed very heartily over the implied accusation , and tried to assure him that I had never , up to date , been an inmate of Sing Sing or even ever visited it .
Just as the morning began to dawn I went to sleep .
It did not seem many moments until I was rudely awakened and told to get up , the window being opened and the clothing pulled off me .
My hair was still wet and I had pains all through me , as if I had the rheumatism .
Some clothing was flung on the floor and I was told to put it on .
I asked for my own , but was told to take what I got and keep quiet by the apparently head nurse , Miss Grady .
I looked at it .
One underskirt made of coarse dark cotton goods and a cheap white calico dress with a black spot in it .
I tied the strings of the skirt around me and put on the little dress .
It was made , as are all those worn by the patients , into a straight tight waist sewed on to a straight skirt .
As I buttoned the waist I noticed the underskirt was about six inches longer than the upper , and for a moment I sat down on the bed and laughed at my own appearance .
No woman ever longed for a mirror more than I did at that moment .
I saw the other patients hurrying past in the hall , so I decided not to lose anything that might be going on .
We numbered forty - five patients in Hall 6 , and were sent to the bathroom , where there were two coarse towels .
I watched crazy patients who had the most dangerous eruptions all over their faces dry on the towels and then saw women with clean skins turn to use them .
I went to the bathtub and washed my face at the running faucet and my underskirt did duty for a towel .
Before I had completed my ablutions a bench was brought into the bathroom .
Miss Grupe and Miss McCarten came in with combs in their hands .
We were told so sit down on the bench , and the hair of forty - five women was combed with one patient , two nurses , and six combs .
As I saw some of the sore heads combed I thought this was another dose I had not bargained for .
Miss Tillie Mayard had her own comb , but it was taken from her by Miss Grady .
Oh , that combing !
I never realized before what the expression " I 'll give you a combing " meant , but I knew then .
My hair , all matted and wet from the night previous , was pulled and jerked , and , after expostulating to no avail , I set my teeth and endured the pain .
They refused to give me my hairpins , and my hair was arranged in one plait and tied with a red cotton rag .
My curly bangs refused to stay back , so that at least was left of my former glory .
After this we went to the sitting - room and I looked for my companions .
At first I looked vainly , unable to distinguish them from the other patients , but after awhile I recognized Miss Mayard by her short hair .
" How did you sleep after your cold bath ? "
" I almost froze , and then the noise kept me awake .
It 's dreadful !
My nerves were so unstrung before I came here , and I fear I shall not be able to stand the strain . "
I did the best I could to cheer her .
I asked that we be given additional clothing , at least as much as custom says women shall wear , but they told me to shut up ; that we had as much as they intended to give us .
We were compelled to get up at 5.30 o'clock , and at 7.15 we were told to collect in the hall ,

“ There are very few true artists in computer programming , most are just house painters . ” – Tim Bryce ’s Law
Management consultant Tim Bryce does n’t like programmers .
Many programmers do n’t like him either ( here , here , here , here and probably in many other places ) .
Mr. Bryce ’s view of programmers :
programmers often bamboozle others and heighten their own self - importance
the average programmer has a lower IQ than any other worker with a college degree
programmers show signs of sloppiness and mental laziness
they appear disorganized to make it difficult to judge how they are progressing on their work effort and reveal inadequacies in workmanship .
the typical programmer often laments he / she is being overworked , underpaid , and unappreciated .
to the programmer ’s credit , they usually possess a curiosity about technological developments .
However , this must be carefully nurtured by management – too much information may distract programmers from their job .
Responses on Mr. Bryce ’s post ( referenced above ) provide many excellent points why Mr. Bryce is wrong .
However , I want to comment points where he is probably right .
Also I want to understand why some management consultants with more than 30 years of experience could have such view ?
Certainly , I reject Freudian view that an unknown programmer hurt feelings of Mr. Bryce in childhood ( the main reason is that at this time the world had only few programmers and all of them are known ) .
Mr. Bryce ’s target audience is not programmers ( whose low IQ would probably prevent understanding his Theory P anyway ) , but IT managers and business decision makers .
The underlying premise of Theory P is : “ The more effectively we manage the people who program the computer , the better we can utilize the systems to support the information needs of the business ” .
This theory is not about live people , but about pragmatic business and lets consider the theory from this perspective .
There are three points where Mr. Bryce could be partially right .
1. Programmers are not “ Software Engineers ” , but Translators .
I agree with this statement .
Programmers indeed translate .
However , I do n’t agree with what they translate .
Mr. Bryce writes that programmers translate “ human understandable specifications into machine understandable instructions ” .
In reality , programmers translate fuzzy human needs and ideas , which are often far from not well - defined specifications .
Sometimes the difference could be as between Picasso translating human feelings in art and house painter translating his customer orders into colored wall .
If the flow of ideas between customer and programmer is bad , translation will be bad , software will be bad and , therefore , programmers will look bad .
And Mr. Bryce will be right ( unless he starts using The System Thinking ) .
2 . Many programmers are not “ System Analysts ”
Unfortunately , in many cases , it is true .
Mr. Bryce writes : “ A true “ Systems Engineer / Analyst ” studies business requirements , defines and develops business processes to implement the requirements , and specifies software requirements for programmers to implement .
Regrettably , there are too few people performing this vital task and , consequently , the responsibility defaults to the programmer who is not necessarily equipped with the proper skills to perform the work ” .
I do know many programmers who are not very good in understanding business requirements or do n’t want to understand them at all .
However , unlike Mr. Bryce , I believe that programmers must learn speaking business language , communicate directly with customers and understand their needs .
I believe that true programmer ’s job is not limited to writing instructions for computers .
The professional programmers should become master translators of complex mental concepts into software .
Otherwise wrong interpretation of business concepts will make software bad and , therefore , programmers will look bad .
And Mr. Bryce will be right again .
3. Programmers tend to fashionable , but not practical solutions
Mr. Bryce writes : “ An elegant solution to the wrong problem solves nothing .
It is important for programmers to learn to justify their technical recommendations from a business perspective . ”
Indeed , many programmers are more interested in technical and even fashionable solutions without considering business perspective .
Can this happen , because often technology is the only area where they can apply their intellect and creativity ?
Can this happen , because management does n’t involved programmers in decisions related to business domain and understanding customer needs ?
Can this happen , because programmers are often disconnected from real business needs and goals of the projects ?
Over -engineered solutions , which are done with fashionable technology , but without practical necessity are bad .
However , if two prior points could become true – programmers work directly with customers , understand their needs and translate them into the software – programmers will not have time and desire for fancy technical solutions , but will strive for pragmatic , lean and focused on customer value solutions .
Theory P Corollaries
Mr. Bryce consider programmers as the herd of wild geeks who need strong management control .
These management shepherds should control programmer ’s lazy , pseudo - intellectual and capricious nature .
And also software projects need the army of business analysts who can chew over for programmers business needs ( as low IQ obviously does n’t help programmers to get it directly ) .
And certainly software projects badly need management consultants like Mr. Bryce who can tell how to properly treat programmers and create theories of their behavior .
There is another way .
Treat and trust programmers as responsible human beings , let them work directly with customers and let them make most project decisions .
It is not an easy shift in minds considering existing stereotypes from both management and programmers sides .
But it could be done in The Ideal Software Company .

Senator Brownback has highlighted the disconnect that I see so often when it comes to dealing with rape .
" Rape is terrible .
Rape is awful .
Is it made any better by killing an innocent child ?
Does it solve the problem for the woman that 's been raped ? " the Kansas Republican asked at the St. Joseph 's Covenant Keepers gathering .
" We need to protect innocent life .
Period , " Brownback said , bringing the crowd of about 500 to its feet .
Really ?
What is this group and others like it doing to stop boys and men from committing rape so girls and women wo n't have to make the choice these men want to make for them and so rape victims wo n't be killed by the most violent rapists or so they wo n't be so traumatized they take their own life ?
If Sen .
Brownback truly believes that rape is terrible , rape is awful , what is he doing to prevent potential rapists from crossing the line and what is he doing to help rape victims recover from the trauma of being raped and what is he doing to minimize the trauma of reporting and navigating through the criminal justice system ?
If Senator Brownback had said , " Rape is terrible .
Rape is awful .
We need to put a stop to it right now " would the members of this group have given him the same standing ovation ?

BAGHDAD , Iraq , Aug. 4 — Tens of thousands of followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr rallied in support of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah on Friday , denouncing Israel and the United States for igniting violence throughout the Middle East .
The protest , the largest of several demonstrations in Iraq since the Israeli - Lebanese conflict began three weeks ago , filled 20 blocks of a wide , squalid boulevard and dozens of side streets in the Shiite - dominated Sadr City section of the capital .
All but a handful of the demonstrators were men , mostly young , wearing white cloth to symbolize funeral shrouds .
Some carried guns .
Waving Lebanese flags and posters of Hezbollah ’s leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , they shook their fists and shouted in unison against what they described as the enemies of all Muslims .
“ Hezbollah , beloved , hit Tel Aviv , hit Tel Aviv , ” the protestors said .
“ No , no , no , Israel ; no , no , no , America , ” they chanted , and finally : “ if Americans are strong enough , they should come face us . ”

Today ’s Wall Street Journal has a great piece about Robert A. Heinlein ’s political legacy :
Heinlein ’s political beliefs were moving more and more toward the libertarian side of the spectrum .
He supported Barry Goldwater in 1964 , and in 1966 he published what many considered his greatest book , “ The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress , ” the tale of how penal colonists and their descendants on the Moon successfully revolt against their Earthly masters .
The core of this book , which keeps it near the top of the libertarians ’ reading lists , is the speech by an old professor , Bernardo de la Paz , to the rebels ’ constitutional convention : “. . . like fire and fusion , government is a dangerous servant and a terrible master .
You now have your freedom–if you can keep it .
But do remember that you can lose this freedom more quickly to yourselves than to any other tyrant .
” The professor explains : “ The power to tax , once conceded , has no limits ; it contains until it destroys .
I was not joking when I told them to dig into their own pouches .
It may not be possible to do away with government –sometimes I think that it is an inescapable disease of human beings .
But it may be possible to keep it small and starved and inoffensive–and can you think of a better way than by requiring the governors themselves to pay the costs of their antisocial hobby . ”
As they say on the Moon , “ TANSTAAFL ! ” : “ There Ain’t No Such Thing as a Free Lunch ! ”
(…)
In another hundred years , it will be interesting to see if the nuclear - powered spaceships and other technological marvels he predicted are with us .
But nothing in his legacy will be more important than the spirit of liberty he championed and his belief that “ this hairless embryo with the aching oversized brain case and the opposable thumb , this animal barely up from the apes will endure .
Will endure and spread out to the stars and beyond , carrying with him his honesty and his insatiable curiosity , his unlimited courage and his noble essential decency . ”
In How to Clean Up a Windows Spyware Infestation , I documented how spyware can do a drive - by infection of your machine through your web browser .
To be absolutely clear , I never clicked on any advertisements , or downloaded and executed any files .
All I did was open a GameCopyWorld web page in an unpatched , original circa -2001 version of Internet Explorer 6.0 .
Yes , I know this is a spectacularly stupid thing to do .
But I 'm glad I did it .
I got a small taste of the experience awaiting casual users when they browse the web without the latest patches and updates .
I think every technical computer user should have this experience , so they can see first hand , on their own machine , the profound evil that we 're up against .
Sure , we can recover , but we do this stuff for a living .
I 'm trying to imagine what my mother or father would do if this happened to them .
They 'd probably have to buy a new computer .
When the only viable solution to sickness is to kill the patient , you have a problem of epidemic proportions .
Adam McNeil , of Webroot Software , was kind enough to lend an investigative hand and duplicate the GameCopyWorld scenario .
His findings are exhaustive and eye - opening :
After researching the GameCopyWorld.com website I can confirm that the site is utilizing 3rd party exploits in order to deliver malware .
The exploits in question appear to be delivered through a series of advertisements within the gamecopyworld .com website .
GameCopyWorld displays a " Find Your Love at Bride .
Ru " advertisement .
That advertisement " refers " to linktarget.com in order to display an advertisement for the DVD software produced by Slysoft.com .
That advertisement " refers " to 39m .
net which in turn creates an < iframe > to buyhitscheap.com .
Buyhitscheap.com in turn calls fkdomain .
info who attempts to deliver a series of exploits to a users system in hopes of installing a trojan dropper .
The fkdomain .
info site attempts to exploit the following : ( there could be more but these were the exploits I picked out of the code ) Apple QuickTime with an RTSP Buffer Overflow error
WinZip FileView ActiveX CreateNewFolderFromName Method
Microsoft Windows Shell Code Execution Vulnerability
Byte Verify Exploit
The dropper creates files that in turn download additional files as well as create threads within the Internet Explorer browser .
Webroot SpySweeper detected the following spies after allowing the installer to run over night .
Virtumonde

In addition to the above listed spies , I have also recorded a large number of unclassified ( not for long ) files and registry entires that were added to the box as well .
Seeing as how these exploit files were delivered via 3rd party advertisements I 'm not sure it is entirely accurate to place all of the blame for this Drive - by with GameCopyWorld.com .
It 's possible that they allowed a third party to attempt exploits on a users machine , but then again it 's also entirely possible that one of these advertisers has slipped in these exploits without their knowledge or consent .
It 's impossible to know if this exploit was delivered intentionally or accidentally .
I 've never used any Webroot products , but when an employee takes his own personal time to investigate a public scenario so thoroughly , that speaks very highly of the company .
They 're clearly one of the good guys .
But the fact that I have to maintain a mental " safe list " of software companies -- these are OK , these are questionable -- is itself disturbing and unhealthy .
It 's symptomatic of just how sick the Windows software ecosystem has become .
It 's nearly impossible to tell the good guys from the bad guys .
Do a web search for " spyware " and you 'll get dozens of results , some of which are for companies that installed the spyware in the first place .
Can you tell them apart ?
Could your parents ?
Tracing this massive security epidemic all the way back to patient zero does n't take much detective work .
It originates with Windows NT 3.0 , when Microsoft chose to set up default users as Administrators .
This infection was only possible because I was logged in as an administrator .
Choosing not to run as an Administrator is easily the single most important security tip for a Windows machine , whether you 're running XP or Vista .
Worried about your parents getting infected ?

Set them up as regular users .
It 's not a panacea , but it goes an awful long way towards solving the problem .
As a test , I logged in as a normal user , and I was unable to duplicate the GameCopyWorld infection in any way -- even with a completely unpatched , circa 2001 version of Windows XP .
Running as a normal user really works .
Aaron Margosis ' blog is the best source of information on running as a non-administrator .
His list of reasons why you should n't run as an Administrator is hair - raising stuff :
If you 're running as admin , an exploit can : install kernel - mode rootkits and / or keyloggers ( which can be close to impossible to detect )
install and start services
install ActiveX controls , including IE and shell add-ins ( common with spyware and adware )
access data belonging to other users
cause code to run whenever anybody else logs on ( including capturing passwords entered into the Ctrl - Alt - Del logon dialog )
replace OS and other program files with trojan horses
access LSA
Secrets , including other sensitive account information , possibly including account info for domain accounts
disable / uninstall anti-virus
cover its tracks in the event log
render your machine unbootable
if your account is an administrator on other computers on the network , the malware gains admin control over those computers as well .. and lots more
I 'll admit I am not the best role model on this count .
Personally , I lost my enthusiasm for limited user accounts when Microsoft did n't have the guts to make standard users the default -- as they absolutely should have -- in Windows Vista .
I swore they would .
Instead , we got got hybrid administrator weirdness and " Cancel or Allow " oddities .
I guess that 's yet another thing we can sacrifice at the dark altar of backwards compatibility .
I understand the pressure to be backwards compatible .
There 's no end of Vista blowback based on minor driver compatibility issues .
The " if it does n't work , it 's automatically Microsoft 's fault , even if the software or hardware vendor is clearly to blame " mentality is sadly all too common .
But given the massive ongoing Windows security epidemic , was defaulting regular users to Administrator accounts -- exactly like Windows XP , Windows 2000 , and Windows NT before it -- really the right decision to make ?
I 'm not so sure .
Researchers from the University of Delaware and Washington University in St. Louis have figured out how to train synthetic polymer molecules to behave –to literally “ self - assemble ” –and form into long , multicompartment cylinders 1,000 times thinner than a human hair , with potential uses in radiology , signal communication and the delivery of therapeutic drugs in the human body .
The discovery , a fundamental new tool for nanotechnology , is reported in the Aug. 3 issue of the prestigious journal ‘ Science . ’

Darrin Pochan , associate professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Delaware , and Karen Wooley , the James S. McDonnell Distinguished Professor of Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis , led the research effort , which also involved co-authors Honggang Cui , a recent doctoral graduate , and doctoral student Sheng Zhong at UD , and Zhiyun Chen , a doctoral advisee of Wooley ’s .
The research was supported by a Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team ( NIRT ) grant from the National Science Foundation .
The focus of the research was block copolymers , which are synthetic molecules that contain two or more chemically different segments bonded together .
Block copolymers are used to make a variety of materials such as plastics , rubber soles for shoes , and more recently , portable memory sticks ( “ flash drives ” ) for computers .
“ A block copolymer is a long - chain molecule , a length of which , or block , that is chemically different than the other , ” Pochan said .
“ In our case , we took one block that loves water , and another part that does not .
So when you put them in solution , the water - hating blocks try to get away from the water , and that ’s how you get different shapes , called micelles , to form . ”
The system used by the scientists consisted of a tri-block copolymer composed of polyacrylic acid , polymethylacrylate , and polystyrene introduced into a solution of tetrahydrofuran and water , and organic diamines .
The technique relied on divalent organic counter ions and solvent mixtures to drive the organization of the block copolymers down specific pathways into snake - like , one - dimensional structures .
Much of the research was conducted using the high - powered microscopes in the UD College of Engineering ’s W. M. Keck Electron Microscopy Facility , which is under the direction of Chaoying Ni. Technician Frank Kriss assisted the research team .
Wooley , who is an expert in polymer chemistry , and Pochan , who is a material scientist , met at research conferences , where they discussed their respective projects .
She had been designing sphere - shaped micelles for use in drug delivery and radiology , but noticed under some solution conditions that her students could produce different shapes .
Although their labs are located some 900 miles apart , the scientists say their research has been a “ great and synergistic collaboration . ”
“ In the world of self - assembly for nanotechnology , it ’s challenging to make something other than the shape of a ball , ” Pochan noted .
“ If you put little balls full of a drug into the bloodstream , the body ’s organs and immune system will get rid of them in around a day .
But if you place the molecules into long , floppy cylinders , they may stay in the body for weeks , ” Pochan noted .
Changing the shape of the micelle could carry a drug in the human body for a long period of time , according to Pochan , potentially providing the sustained delivery of chemotherapy from a single injection .
“ Moving from a sphere to a cylinder , you could conceivably deliver two or three or four different drugs in one injection , one to one part of the body and others to other parts of the body all through the same self - assembly , ” he said .
Although the research is far from practical applications , the team ’s discovery has yielded a new , fundamental “ bottom - up ” technique for building nanostructures .
“ It ’s all about constructing materials and nanostructures in an easy way , ” Pochan said .
“ The goal is to design a molecule with all the rules–all the information it needs –to zip up into the desired shape and size that you want .
Then you throw them in the water and see what you get–hopefully the desired , complex nanostructure . ”
Ironically , Pochan thought he was done working with block copolymers when he was in graduate school years ago .
“ I ’m now building on stuff I did in grad school in the ’90s on rubber and plastics , ” he said .
“ However , if you look at block copolymers as a tool for self - assembly , there are many more potential applications than rubber for your boot or plastic coating for your floor , ” he noted .
“ We can use those same molecules , but train them to get something very useful as far as high technology goes , ” he said .
“ It ’s funny how research comes back in style , and we find new uses for ‘ old tools . ’ ”

The French DADVSI intellectual property law that stirred up such controversy when it was being drafted last year eventually passed in August 2006 .
One of the stipulations of the final version was that DRM schemes be made interoperable , and an independent body was to be set up by the French government to supervise the process .
That group , the Autorité de régulation des mesures techniques ( ARMT ) , was officially created ( French ) last week .
The ARMT was given six members ; pictures of them , along with an opening speech , are available from the French government .
The six will serve for six years each , and they are supposed to be fully independent .
That is , they cannot have ties to the companies or industries that they will be working with .
Nicolas Jondet , a French graduate student now at the University of Edinburgh , has just posted a lengthy English discussion of the group and their work .
The ARMT will be good for consumers , he argues , but it will not suddenly eliminate DRM .
It will require interoperability , but the necessary information can only be requested by a company that has a legitimate interoperability problem —
Microsoft , for instance , which cannot play iTunes files on the Zune .
Consumers will not be able to file interoperability requests , and they will not have access to the information that the DRM companies provide to the ARMT .
Thus , the group will not suddenly make it simple for consumers to remove DRM shackles from their media , but it should get easier to transfer tunes from one DRM format to another .
The ARMT is also supposed to ensure that DRM does not prevent consumers from making legitimate uses of their works , but this is unlikely to pave the way for legalization of DVD ripping , for instance .
That 's because the group will apply a test that takes into consideration the effects that any decision has on the marketplace and on the ability of the content owners to profit from their content .
Although the group 's power is limited , it does have teeth ; it can impose large fines on any company that does not comply .
Now that Apple is selling non-DRMed files from EMI and Steve Jobs has gone on record saying that he would prefer a DRM - free world , the company appears to be less concerned about measures such as France 's , especially as the technical information that companies like Apple provide will remain ( supposedly ) private .
How times change .
Last year , Apple was calling an early version of the bill " state - sponsored piracy " and there was talk of the company pulling out of France altogether .
No longer ; which means that iTunes Store media goodness may soon be available to all .
In the future , perhaps all too soon , time will slow down .
Certainly that is not what most of us experience now .
Time seems to be speeding up :
Our computers run faster , our clocks are more accurate ( diminishing the luxury of lateness ) , and our cell phones make communication immediate and ubiquitous .
Yet all these ingenious " labor - saving " devices have only made us labor more .
Time , said by poets to resemble a flowing stream , feels increasingly like an igloo : a hard , shrinking exoskeleton that simultaneously shapes our lives as it crushes them .
An entire time - management industry rushes to save us : best - selling books , software packages , and other " productivity solutions " designed to improve the conversion of our time units into dollar units and vice versa , plus tax and shipping .
But they 've got the equation all wrong .
Productivity is the amount of work done in a given amount of time : P = W/t .
Traditionally , time management has consisted of increasing productivity ( P ) by increasing the work ( W ) — squeezing more out in the same lump of time .
By this math , time ( t ) never decreases .
That 's not time management , that 's work management .
There is a better way :
What if we could increase productivity by leaving W alone and making t smaller ?
What if we could slow down time , make each moment seem to last longer so more work could be extracted from it ?
That future is inside us .
Neurobiologists are slowly coming to realize that " real time " is just a convention foisted upon us by our brains .
In any given millisecond , all kinds of information — sight , sound , touch — pours into our brains at different speeds and is reprocessed as hearing , speech , and action .
Our perception of time can be manipulated in ways that researchers have already begun to exploit .
To understand how fundamentally your brain bends time , try this trick : Tap your finger on the table once .
Because light outraces sound , the audio tap should register a few milliseconds after the sight of it ; yet your brain synchronizes the two to make them seem simultaneous .
A similar process occurs when you see someone speak to you from several feet away — thankfully so , or our days would unravel like a badly dubbed movie .
Your mind is messing with the time , editing out the parts that distract you .
Woody Allen once said , " Time is nature 's way of keeping everything from happening at once . "
He was right .
" The brain lives just a little bit in the past , " says David Eagleman , a neurobiologist at the University of Texas at Houston .
" The brain collects a lot of information , waits , then it stitches a story together .
' Now ' actually happened a little while ago . "
Or rather , our brains live in the now , and we live in the future , without even knowing it .
What we call causal reality is like one of those live TV shows with a built - in time delay for the censors .
To be intelligible , though , even the crummiest TV show requires an editor with keen timing .
The same goes for our brains .
Some medical disabilities are now thought to be the result of faulty timing mechanisms .
Certain brain lesions , like those in Parkinson 's sufferers , are known to disrupt timing patterns essential to clear speech .
Many neuroscientists suspect that dyslexia and aphasia are not language disorders but timing problems .
" Time is one of the many , many illusions that the brain bestows upon us , " says Dean Buonomano , a neuroscientist at UCLA .
How it does that is not yet clear , he says .
Researchers long believed the brain was ruled by a single clock that kept all its disparate activities in sync , like a pacemaker that sends out a regular pulse — a sort of cerebral Greenwich mean time .
But scientists are learning that there is no central clock .
Instead , the brain contains lots of little clocks all running at independent rates yet linked by a network .
At this point the future begins to take shape .
If scientists gained a better understanding of how neural timing works , we could employ that timing to better use .
In the productivity equation , we could effectively make t smaller by making the same amount of time last longer .
Weird as it seems , it can be done .
Not long ago , Eagleman became intrigued by the stories one hears of people who experience time slowing — during a car crash , say .
( Eagleman himself entered slo - mo briefly as a child , when he fell off a roof . )
He wondered :
What 's really going on ?
Does the experience gain added vividness only afterward , as it's being recalled ?
Or does a person 's perception of time truly slow down enough to absorb extra information ?
Eagleman designed a test .
He built a small LED screen that flashed a series of numbers too quickly to comprehend .
He attached the screen to his subjects ' wrists , clipped a bungee cord to their legs , and had them jump backward , one by one , off a 150 - foot tower — a fairly terrifying experience for the uninitiated .
To his surprise , his jumpers ( all two of them ; the experiment is ongoing and the results preliminary ) were able to read the flashing numbers on the way down — evidence that a brain under duress can warp time .
" It 's like the brain has a reserve capacity , " he says .
" But like everything , it works as slowly as it can get away with . "
Speed the mind , slow the time — sounds like productivity heaven .
But surely there 's an easier way to tap into the brain 's reserve .
So far , " smart " drugs , which go in and out of fashion every few years , are largely worthless .
Yet a number of researchers are already exploring the possibilities of a real pharmacological solution .
Warren Meck , a neuroscientist at Duke University , says that something like personalized time can already be achieved with drugs like cocaine and amphetamines .
These provide the , uh , patient with a powerful experience of speeded - up time .
Of course , they are addictive , not to mention illegal .
The question , Meck says , is whether it 's possible to administer a drug that speeds up time without making the experience euphoric .
It sounds like a koan :
Can we successfully satisfy our urge to control time without knowing if we 've succeeded ?
The basic issue is anatomical .
The brain perceives and shapes the pace of time ; it also makes decisions about how best to use that time , a process an economist might call optimization , except in the currency of time .
Are those two functions structurally distinct ?
Does the brain keep time with one set of neurons but spend it ( and reward us for doing so ) with another ?
Meck asks : " Can you separate a fast clock from a pleasurable feeling ?
Maybe in a computer , but maybe not in a biological system .
In the brain , maybe time and money are the same thing . "
Meck believes there are two separate brain areas for those functions , though most likely not separable .
Drugs taken orally , he says , cannot target brain regions with the specificity that a CEO might wish .
Buonomano is even more skeptical .
One should n't equate time perception with processing speed , he says .
" With cocaine , your perception of time is more acute , but that does n't necessarily mean you 're getting more done .
You can make decisions faster .
But are they the best decisions ? "
The choices one faces in an adrenaline rush are fairly binary : Run from the bear , or freeze .
In contrast , the choices one makes in an office often require discriminating thought : Paper clip or staple ?
Jelly doughnut or chocolate glazed ?
" You 're sacrificing the optimal decision for speed , " Buonomano says .
" If you think about it , most things are a trade - off between time and quality .
You can write your article faster , but will it be better ? "
For anyone keen to bring on the future of customized time sooner , Meck suggests an alternative .
In November His Holiness the Dalai Lama spoke before the Society for Neuroscience , where he encouraged researchers to study the brains of meditating monks .
Different states of meditation are thought to alter time perception , Meck says ; drugs are " the lazy way to achieve the same effects . "
Well , OK , maybe .
A future office worker is willing to consider that he might create more time for himself , maybe even get more done , through a regimen of mental calisthenics .
However , a future office manager can't help but notice that a monk in deep meditation looks distinctly . . . unproductive .

Emacs has several packages for dealing with parentheses .
Emacs comes with ways to highlight the matching parenthesis when you 're on one ; try show - paren - mode .
One of the newer add - on packages is Nikolaj Schumacher 's highlight - parentheses mode , which shows the parentheses that enclose the current cursor position .
I tried modifying it to highlight the containing expressions instead of only their parentheses :
( defun hl - paren - highlight () " Highlight the parentheses around point . " ( unless (= ( point ) hl - paren - last - point ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( pos ( point ) ) ( match - pos ( point ) ) ( level - 1 ) ( max ( 1- ( length hl - paren - overlays ) ) ) ) ( while ( and match - pos ( < level max ) ) ( setq match - pos ( when ( setq pos ( cadr ( syn t ax - ppss pos ) ) ) ( ignore - errors ( scan- sexps pos 1 ) ) ) ) ( when match - pos ( if ( eq ' expression hl - paren - type ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos match - pos ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos ( 1+ pos ) ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay ( 1- match - pos ) match - pos ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( while (< level max ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay nil nil ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hl - paren - last - point ( point ) ) ) )
Unfortunately , as you can see , it 's a mess .
I tried better colors ( white , gray , etc. ) but I just could n't make it usable .
So I gave up on highlighting the regions and went back to highlighting just the parentheses .
It 's a bit better :
( defun hl - paren - highlight () " Highlight the parentheses around point . " ( unless ( = ( point ) hl - paren - last - point ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( pos ( point ) ) ( match - pos ( point ) ) ( level - 1 ) ( max ( 1- ( length hl - paren - overlays ) ) ) ) ( while ( and match - pos ( < level max ) ) ( setq match - pos ( when ( setq pos ( cadr ( syn t ax - ppss pos ) ) ) ( ignore - errors ( scan- sexps pos 1 ) ) ) ) ( when match - pos ( if ( eq ' expression hl - paren - type ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos match - pos ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos ( 1+ pos ) ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay ( 1- match - pos ) match - pos ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( while (< level max ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay nil nil ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hl - paren - last - point ( point ) ) ) )
However it 's still a bit too … colorful .
So I changed it to simply make the enclosing parentheses bold :
( defun hl - paren - highlight () " Highlight the parentheses around point . " ( unless ( = ( point ) hl - paren - last - point ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( pos ( point ) ) ( match - pos ( point ) ) ( level - 1 ) ( max ( 1- ( length hl - paren - overlays ) ) ) ) ( while ( and match - pos ( < level max ) ) ( setq match - pos ( when ( setq pos ( cadr ( syn t ax - ppss pos ) ) ) ( ignore - errors ( scan- sexps pos 1 ) ) ) ) ( when match - pos ( if ( eq ' expression hl - paren - type ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos match - pos ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos ( 1+ pos ) ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay ( 1- match - pos ) match - pos ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( while (< level max ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay nil nil ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hl - paren - last - point ( point ) ) ) )
That 's nicer , although perhaps too subtle .
I added more bolding :
( defun hl - paren - highlight () " Highlight the parentheses around point . " ( unless (= ( point ) hl - paren - last - point ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( pos ( point ) ) ( match - pos ( point ) ) ( level - 1 ) ( max ( 1- ( length hl - paren - overlays ) ) ) ) ( while ( and match - pos ( < level max ) ) ( setq match - pos ( when ( setq pos ( cadr ( syn t ax - ppss pos ) ) ) ( ignore - errors ( scan- sexps pos 1 ) ) ) ) ( when match - pos ( if ( eq ' expression hl - paren - type ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos match - pos ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos ( 1+ pos ) ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay ( 1- match - pos ) match - pos ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( while (< level max ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay nil nil ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hl - paren - last - point ( point ) ) ) )
It bolds the parentheses and also the first s-expression inside the opening parenthesis .
It does n't understand when the parentheses begin a form ( instead of all the other uses of parentheses ) , so it sometimes highlights the first s-expression even when it 's not special in any way .
Despite this wart , I like this form of highlighting so far .
Update : [ 2007-05 - 29 ]
However , there is one more thing I wanted .
I de-emphasize parentheses by using a lighter color for them ; I want the enclosing parentheses to be bold and black .
However I want the enclosing first s-expressions to be bold , but not necessarily black .
Note in the above example the keywords are normally blue , but when enclosing the current point they are black .
I fixed this by adding separate highlighting for the enclosing parentheses and the first s-expression :
( defun hl - paren - highlight ( )
" Highlight the parentheses around point . " ( unless ( = ( point ) hl - paren - last - point ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( pos ( point ) ) ( match - pos ( point ) ) ( level - 1 ) ( max ( 1 - ( length hl - paren - overlays ) ) ) ) ( while ( and match - pos ( < level max ) ) ( setq match - pos ( when ( setq pos ( cadr ( syn t ax - ppss pos ) ) ) ( ignore - errors ( scan - sexps pos 1 ) ) ) ) ( when match - pos ( if ( eq ' expression hl - paren - type ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos match - pos ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay pos ( 1 + pos ) ( incf level ) ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay ( 1 - match - pos ) match - pos ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( while ( < level max ) ( hl - paren - put - overlay nil nil ( incf level ) ) ) ) ) ( setq hl - paren - last - point ( point ) ) ) )
I 'm pretty happy with this variant of highlight - parentheses.el .
Update : [ 2014-05 - 10 ]
Also check out the rainbow - blocks and rainbow - delimiters modes .
For Python or Ruby code , highlight - indentation - mode may be useful .

Introduction and summary
The Fermi Paradox which contrasts the 100 % probability of life and intelligence developing on Earth against the thunderous silence from the heavens so far ( no alien signals ) may be resolved by four things :
One , gamma ray bursters of all types , from faraway ' longs ' through nearby ' shorts ' , which may have effectively prohibited the development ( or devastated the longevity ) of sentient races throughout all galactic history ;
Two , the lengthy gestation period required for the emergence of intelligence ( which almost requires the entire useful lifespan of a given planet , based on our own biography ) ;
Three , the need for an unusually high measure of stability in terms of climate over hundreds of millions of years ( the ' Goldilocks ' scenario , enabled by a huge natural satellite like our Moon moderating the tilt of a planet 's axis , as well as gas giants parked in proper orbits to mop up excess comets and asteroids to reduce impact frequencies for a living world ) ; and Four , an extremely dangerous 600 year or so ' gauntlet ' of challenges and risks most any technological society must survive to become a viable long term resident of the galaxy ( i.e. getting a critical mass of population and technology off their home world , among other things ) .
That 600 year period may be equivalent to our own span between 1900 AD and 2500 AD , wherein we 'll have to somehow dodge the bullets of cosmic impacts , nuclear , biological , and nanotechnological war , terrorism , mistakes , and accidents , as well as food or energy starvation , economic collapse , and many other threats , both natural and unnatural .
So far it appears ( according to SETI results and other scientific discoveries ) extremely few races likely survive all these .
So why have n't we heard from those which have ?
What are they like ?
And how far away might they be ?
Details of all the above and more ( along with references ) may be found on this and succeeding pages .
What are the most probable elements involved in the emergence of an intelligent race capable of interstellar signals and / or mobility ?
These factors consist in part of stages of development virtually any race resembling us in our basic motives and behavior would likely go through ; they also include general ' logic gates ' which filter out those peoples and worlds which would be unlikely to qualify for relevance in our search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( for reasons explained later ) .
Assumptions and intentions :
A . We will focus here only on the likelihood of intelligent , interstellar capable civilizations within our own galaxy .
One , because the distances between galaxies represent an almost infinitely greater obstacle to star farers compared to interstellar travel .
Two , because each galaxy is essentially an island universe in its own right , with possibly hundreds of billions of stars in each -- it would be almost an unimaginable feat for one civilization ( or even several ) to explore a sufficiently large fraction of a single galaxy so that they would then feel compelled to turn their attention to a whole other island universe in the void , possibly thousands to hundreds of thousands of lifetimes of maximum speed travel distant .
B . The stages suggested below are by no means intended to be distinct phases of development with clear beginnings and endings , with no overlap between them .
Rather , they represent likely - to - be important trends or characteristics of a civilization along the developmental path .
For example , humanity itself could be argued to have ranged in development across several different stages as described on this site , circa 1996 - 2002 .
Specifically , we were clearly not entirely free of the conceptual competition among politico - economic and religious systems described in stage Seven ; obviously still at risk from our own wastes in stage Eight ; we had yet to fully realize our vulnerability as spoken of in stage Nine ; and the challenge of balancing opposing concerns of stage
Ten remains far from won .
Too , though we faced a real danger of the cataclysmic accidents or war suggested in stages Seven , Ten , and Eleven , we did n't yet possess any off - world colonies which could survive our doom to become orphan vestiges of our civilization .
C : The Fermi paradox essentially asks the question " where are all the aliens ? " , if life itself is as common throughout the galaxy as many think .
It would appear from much of what we know that we should find ourselves surrounded by alien folk .
However , ways to resolve the paradox are now becoming apparent .
For instance , in recent years a wholly new and unexpected discovery was made , which makes a good case for our own present generation being among the first and / or earliest of star farers in the Milky Way .
The discovery ?
Gamma ray bursters , both great and distant , and near and small .
The faraway worst ones being massive explosions of radiation rivaling the Big Bang itself in some ways , possibly serving to virtually sterilize significant swathes of entire galaxies on a fairly frequent basis , universe - wide .
But the narrow death beam of those large bursters , coupled with their typical distance , and especially their declining frequency of occurance in the last few hundred million years , may have effectively removed them as an important player in galactic evolution today -- if indeed they ever were in the first place .
However , the much more frequently occurring and closer ' short ' ( but much less powerful ) gamma ray bursters could well have played a bigger role in the intelligence lottery of our galaxy , than their more spectacular brethren .
And continue to do so today .
[ For more on this particular topic please refer to The gamma ray burster threat ]
Now that the Fermi Paradox may have been dealt a reasonably devastating first blow ( with more to follow ) , let us closely examine the numbers and types of alien star faring civilizations we are most likely to contact or encounter during the present or near future , and why -- in From the first spark of life to the first starships ...
Now that Paris Hilton is jailed forever and Nicole Ritchie is either pregnant or eating entire bowls of cereal in one sitting , it 's time we teach the young women of the world what cool really is .
Now we can sway any female who has been fooled into thinking that either getting a spray - on tan or dating a man with a spray - on tan is acceptable behavior .
Now is the time to say to the young women of the world : one day you will look at list of the greatest books ever and say , " I 'm a fucking idiot who ca n't be alone .
I 've wasted my life and my money on hair extensions .
" And , as Wittgenstien , my podiatrist , suggested , if you can get the attractive women to go , the men follow .
So let 's use Obama 's sexiness to bring young women into the political process .
And while I prefer Hillary in 08 , I definitely see Obama as our key to involving PYTs in a public conversation that matters .
Hence the " Crush on Obama " video with its early - 90s - Keenan - Ivory Wayans - film - vehiclesque vibe is our best hope for young women to see who is really bringing the sexy , so to speak , back .
By the time I found this impressive fellow , I 'd already paid $ 106 for a month 's supply of ProSolutions ( chosen because of its professional - sounding name ) and followed these instructions : " Type your name , the number of inches you want to gain , and the reason (s ) you want to gain those inches in the blanks below .
And read the completed statement out loud to reinforce the commitment that will lead to your ultimate success . "
And so my colleagues heard me pledge earnestly : " I , John Elder , have decided I want to gain two inches in length and one inch in girth ( I felt modest ambition would minimise disappointment ) .
My reasons are vanity .
And I 'm committed to a good penis - pill system until I reach my desired gains . "
If I had n't made this pledge , I could have abandoned the project — particularly after spotting Mr Baby Arm , whom I presume is also trying to improve himself .
And that 's the rub .
If you 're born with one of these ridiculous organs , there are times when just about every man feels short - changed .
The average size of an erect penis is about 15.24 centimetres — six inches in the old money .
( When talking about penis size , it 's traditional to use inches . )
The sad thing is it seems there are many men living fretfully with a ruler in one hand and a world of hope in the other .
To meet some of these people , return to enlargepenisguide.com — and log on to the " progress reports " forum .
You 'll find men apparently taking the pills , diligently jelqing ( stretching a flaccid penis ) and sharing how it 's hanging .
Like Nicky : " I 'm 21 , and , measured from the pelvic bone , the length of my penis is around 7.5 inches , but I 've always wanted to be large like a porn star .
I 've been doing the exercise a few days now … "
Occasionally , someone claims spectacular results .
The simple reason is that the pills — herbal aphrodisiacs , not muscle - building proteins — give little more than an illusion of growth by concentrating blood in the otherwise shrivelled underbelly .
But the real joke is that the more anxious one becomes about penis size , the more it is likely to shrink .
" The curious thing about our society , most of the time we pretend that the penis does n't shrink , " says David Mitchell , a doctor and a medical anthropologist .
" In fact , the penis does n't have a set flaccid size .
It 's actually meaningless to measure the size of the penis because it varies from minute to minute according to the temperature and one 's state of mind .
The trouble is , if you get anxious , it only makes it smaller , to the point where it can disappear … in cases where anxiety spirals into a panic attack . "
Dr Mitchell has researched a recent outbreak of these attacks — known as " shrinking penis disease " — on the Indonesian island of Flores , where black magic is widely practised .
In these instances , the sufferer believes he will die if his penis disappears .
The last outbreak in a modern society occurred in Singapore in 1962 , following a rumour that eating pork vaccinated against swine fever would cause shrinking penis disease .
" There were people rushing through the streets holding their penises … some of them using chopsticks , " Dr Mitchell says .
" As soon as they hit the hospital and started to relax , they came back to normal . "
Dr Mitchell says the disease could re-emerge in the Western world .
" It could come back again in our society if someone spread the right stories around , " he says .
Chris Fox , of La Trobe University , is doing a PhD on penis size and its role in body image .
So far , he has interviewed 15 men aged 20 to 75 .
" The short answer is that every man at some point in his life worries about the size of his penis , " Mr Fox says .
" If we do n't like our penis we wo n't enjoy sex .
For people with a pathological issue with penis size , it will affect their sex life .
" In some cases it will affect how they behave around other men .
And one has to remember that most people make their comparison with a flaccid penis — at the urinal or in a change room .
The only erections we tend to see are the very big penises on porn stars … and my interview subjects did n't feel threatened by these giant penises because they felt they were n't real .
It 's in the real world that anxiety takes root . "
Mr Fox 's research is still in its early days , but one of the intriguing findings is that " a good penis size can compensate for other character flaws " .
" So you may not be the nicest person around , but if you have a big ( penis ) you 'll tend to feel good about yourself … " he says .
In fact , the bigger penis may have no other useful role beyond being a comfort to its owner .
" We do n't have any real evidence that there is anything gained from a large penis , " says Dr Stephen Juan , Sydney University academic and author of The Odd Sex .
" The ancient Greeks fought in the nude … in combat you reached for anything you could , so having a large penis would have been disadvantageous . "
Contrary to Mr Fox 's position , Dr Juan says the object of envy is the super - sized male porn star .
" Just as men will see a ( Hollywood ) movie and look at the attractive , suave , charming , athletic male character and want to be like him … he will now look at the porno performer and want to be like him .
Probably if we did n't have the porno industry , we would n't have the extent of this envy . "
Meanwhile , my pills are in the mail .
But the important thing is not to worry .

That 's about the size of it ■
Most men are — roughly — created equal .
According to the Institute for Research in Sex , Gender and Reproduction , the erect penis ranges from 12.7 to 17.78 centimetres — an average of 15.24 centimetres .
Yet within that 5 - centimetre variable lies a great deal of anxiety .
Even men with penises larger than the average are falling prey to self - doubt .
Says Dr Michael Flood , researcher in gender studies at La Trobe University : " The men who are trying to make their penises bigger are playing out the key messages we give men : sex is about your penis .
So it 's not surprising that some men go to great lengths to fulfil that ideal .
The tragedy is these efforts wo n't improve their sexual lives … and they only risk damaging themselves . " ■

A medical marijuana advocacy group in California has sued the Federal Government over statements by two federal agencies denying the medical benefits of smoking marijuana :
SAN FRANCISCO , Feb . 21 – Frustrated by government policy and inaction , a group of advocates for medical marijuana sued two federal health agencies on Wednesday over the assertion that smoking it has no medical benefit .
The group , Americans for Safe Access , a nonprofit organization based in Oakland , filed the lawsuit in Federal District Court , challenging the government ’s position that marijuana , “ has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States . ”
In its lawsuit , the group contends that federal regulators have publicly issued “ false and misleading statements ” about the medical benefits of marijuana and marijuana products , including many of the private label CBD options on the market .
The lawsuit , which named the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration , seeks a court order to retract and correct statements that the group called , “ incorrect , dishonest and a flagrant violation of laws . ”
In other words , standard operating procedure in the War On ( Some ) Drugs .
There are many things about the War On ( Some ) Drugs that are despicable , but chief among them is the fact that the government continues deny people who are sick medication that could actually alleviate their pain .
If you do n’t believe in medical marijuana and its medicinal properties , you could read this CBDfx review here along with any other CBD product .

As the " Bubble Boy , " David Vetter was famous across the U.S. Newspapers , TV shows and magazines portrayed him as a happy , well - adjusted child who struggled cheerfully against the immune deficiency that condemned him to a life inside a plastic bubble .
But according to a person David called his best friend , the boy was n't struggling cheerfully .
In 1978 , although he was not quite eight years old , David had realized his life would be lonely , dull and short .
His helplessness enraged him .
Before he was born , his body had been donated to science .
" Why am I so angry all the time ? " he asked psychologist Mary Ada Murphy one summer evening .
As he sat in his plastic isolation chamber on the third floor of Texas Children 's Hospital , he could see Fannin Street from the room 's window .
But he could n't touch that outside world , or participate in it .
" Whatever I do depends on what somebody else decides I do , " he said .
" Why school ?
Why did you make me learn to read ?
What good will it do ?
I wo n't ever be able to do anything anyway .
So why ?
You tell me why . "
" I can't say why , " replied Murphy .
Since David was three , she 'd spent countless hours of her personal time with him .
David was angry , and he worried that he was going crazy .
Murphy explained to him that anger was a natural reaction to his situation .
As usual , she tried to help him cope with an unbearable situation -- a life much different than the one portrayed in the media .
Years later , Murphy said , David asked her to set the record straight , to write a realistic account of his life .
In 1995 , she planned to publish just such a book : Was It Worth It ?
The True Story of David the Bubble Boy .
But shortly before her book was to be released , David 's parents and Baylor College of Medicine officials sent strongly worded letters to the publishing company -- WRS , a small outfit in Waco -- withdrawing the written permission they 'd given Murphy to write about David , questioning her facts and hinting at a lawsuit .
WRS backed down , and the book never appeared .
As told by Murphy , David 's story is not of triumph over adversity , but of the human cost of medicine 's headlong rush toward the new .
Even 13 years after his death -- when the ethical debate has moved on to cloning and genetic screening -- his story still serves as a cautionary tale .
And it continues to divide the opinions of people who cared for him .
One member of the group that treated David asked not to be quoted by name for fear that Mary Murphy 's enemies would retaliate .
" It is important for you to understand that there is a powerful hierarchy at Texas Children 's Hospital , " said the former hospital employee .
" And they are very angry at Mary .
And they do not want to be reminded in any way , shape or form that this may have been a bad decision . "
In 1970 , Carol Ann and David Vetter Jr. had their first son -- also named David Joseph Vetter .
Six months later , the baby died of Severe Combined Immune Deficiency Syndrome .
He 'd been born with a defect in his thymus , a ductless glandlike structure crucial to developing disease resistance .
He was at the mercy of any passing germ .
A trio of doctors from Baylor College of Medicine told the Vetters that the defect might have been caused by a mutant gene .
If so , the probability that another of their children would bear the disease was 10,000 to 1 .
But the doctors also explained that the defect might be carried on one of the mother 's X chromosomes .
If that was the case , and the Vetters had another son , the odds were 50 - 50 that he , too , would be afflicted by SCIDS .
The doctors -- John Montgomery , Mary Ann South and Raphael Wilson -- told the Vetters that should they choose to have another child , and should that child also have SCIDS , the newborn could be placed in an almost completely sterile isolator that would protect him from disease until a cure was found -- which , the doctors thought , was only a matter of time .
The project would be financed with federal research grants .
The Vetters were predisposed to the doctors ' plan :
They were anxious to have another child , especially a son to carry on the family name .
As Catholics , they may have been especially swayed by Dr. Wilson , a scientist who studied germ - free environments and was also a brother in the Order of the Holy Cross .
In Europe , Wilson had been involved in a similar project :
Two retarded twins had been successfully treated in sterile isolation .
Remarkably , the twins ' immune systems developed to the point that they could be removed from their isolators before they turned three .
There was little discussion -- and certainly no public discussion -- of what would happen if no cure for SCIDS appeared soon , or of how long a child could or should be kept in such isolation .
The medical technology existed .
The ethical questions would come later .
As was later reported in People magazine , the Vetters ' second David Joseph -- the one who would become famous -- was delivered by a cesarean section on September 21 , 1971 .
The room at St. Luke 's Episcopal Hospital had been cleaned five times in an attempt to make it as germ - free as possible .
No more than ten seconds after David was removed from Carol Ann 's womb , he was placed inside the sterile plastic isolator that would be his home .
Prior to the delivery , the Vetters had arranged for a priest to be on hand to baptize their son after he'd been placed inside the bubble .
Like almost everything else David would touch during the next 12 years , the holy water was sterilized .
David was transferred to a room at Texas Children 's Hospital , which was then a part of St. Luke's .
His bubble , made of transparent polyvinyl chloride film , sat on a plain wooden table next to a window .
Attached to the " crib bubble " was a small " supply bubble , " which contained items such as diapers , clothes , vitamins , food , washcloths , medicine and water .
Sterilizing such supplies was no simple task .
First , labels and glue were removed from bottles and jars containing pre-sterilized food .
Then those and other necessities were loaded into perforated cylinders , which were placed in chambers filled with ethylene oxide gas , at a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit , for four hours .
Afterward , the containers had to be aerated for one to seven days before they could enter the bubble .
The walls of the bubble were fitted with heavy - duty rubber gloves so that his parents and medical personnel could handle David .
Using those gloves , they diapered and fed the baby , and hugged him as best they could .
Mary Murphy 's office was only two doors away from David 's room .
She was working as a psychological associate at Baylor College of Medicine 's Center for Developmental Pediatrics , and she watched as a constant parade of visitors -- princes and royalty , even Beverly Sills -- trooped past her door , intent on seeing David ; he served as a kind of tourist attraction for VIPs .
It was said that Hermann Hospital had a helicopter , and Texas Children 's had the Bubble Boy .
Murphy passed by David 's room many times each day , but she never looked in .
The project appalled her , and she wanted nothing to do with it .
Murphy had come to psychology late in life .
As a college student during World War II , she 'd studied to be a mechanical engineer .
But instead of pursuing that career , she married and moved to Texas .
After her husband left her , she and her infant son found themselves alone in Houston .
" I had a baby , a penny and a potato , " laughs Murphy , a matronly but attractive woman with short white hair .
To support her son and herself , she went to work as a waitress .
Murphy remarried , and in the late 1950s , she enrolled part - time at the University of Houston .
She graduated in 1967 , and earned her master 's degree two years later .
While an instructor at Baylor , she began her doctoral work .
In her office at Texas Children 's , she struggled to complete her dissertation , examining the stresses that beset families of children with birth defects .
By the fall of 1974 , David was no longer a constant presence outside Murphy 's door .
A plastic bubble had been set up in the Vetters ' home in Conroe , and the child could spend two to three weeks at a time there .
Ironically , Murphy met David not at the hospital , but in his home .
Her mentor , Dr. Barry Molish , was working on an article about David 's psychosocial development , and asked Murphy to assist him by giving the child psychological and intelligence tests .
She agreed reluctantly , and on the day after David 's third birthday , she and Molish drove to Conroe in the pouring rain .
To Murphy 's surprise , she was smitten with David , a handsome , dark - complected boy with a thick mop of black hair and dark , wide - spaced eyes .
She wondered how the boy could survive in such a confined space .
The isolator bubbles were periodically replaced with larger models as David grew , but even the largest was tiny : six feet by two feet by four and a half feet .
( Later , a sterile " playroom " would be attached . )
Murphy could barely hear the boy speak over the roar of the bubble 's blower motors , and she asked to turn them off .
David laughed .
" He said I was dumb , " she remembers , " and did n't I know that the bubble would deflate if the motors were turned off ? "
In spite of the noise , Murphy administered tests .
Asked to define a tree , David responded that it was a brown rectangle with a green oval on top .
She was stunned , amazed that a three - year - old would know so much about geometry but so little about the stuff of daily life .
No , she told David , the green part was made of leaves .
He replied that she was totally wrong .
To prove her point , she fetched her umbrella and went outside .
As David watched through a window , she broke a small limb off a tree and brought it inside for him to examine through the plastic .
" You never saw so much astonishment in your life , " she remembered .
She left the Vetter home that night feeling that there was much she could teach David -- but she had no intention of doing so .
A few days later , Murphy 's boss informed her that David was back at Texas Children's , and that his mother and the hospital staff were having trouble with him .
Specifically , a photographer from United Press International was standing by to snap the first pictures of David as he entered his newly constructed playroom .
Roughly 11 feet long , six and a half feet wide and eight feet tall , the sterile space marked a huge addition to David 's world .
But to the embarrassment of the medical team , he refused to crawl through the stainless steel tubing that connected his bubble to its new addition .
Since Murphy and David had gotten along so well , David 's mother suggested that Murphy might help coax David into the play area .
Murphy agreed to try -- but only after she finished her other duties for that afternoon .
Around 4:30 , she walked the short distance from her offie to David 's quarters , confident that she could remedy the situation in no time flat .
David seemed glad to see Murphy , whom he remembered as " the lady with the leaf . "
Even so , he rebuffed her attempts to get him into the playroom .
After a couple of hours , she gave up for the day .
As she left , David looked in her eyes .
" Lady , " he said , " you will be back . "
He was right .
By the following day , Murphy had decided that trying to talk David into the playroom was useless .
Instead , she borrowed a bowl of goldfish from the desk of a third - floor secretary , and placed the bowl on the far side of the playroom .
David was excited by the fish , and tried to convince Murphy to bring them next to his crib .
She refused .
The strategy worked .
Anxious to examine the fish more closely , David crawled through the tube , down the three - stepped ladder and into the playroom .
UPI got its photographs , the medical team got its good publicity and Murphy was invited to help in David 's day - to - day care .
Privately , nurses complained to her that the playroom incident was minor compared to other problems they were beginning to have with the child .
" They wanted him to behave and be compliant , " said Murphy .
Eventually , she became known as " the fire extinguisher " : the person to call when David was in emotional crisis .
Three and a half years after David 's birth , Texas Children 's Hospital finally discussed the ethics of keeping a child isolated indefinitely .
Now many hospitals have ethics committees that routinely consider complicated decisions .
But in the ' 70s , such groups were rare .
On February 26 , 1975 , about 30 doctors , theologians and other concerned parties -- including Mary Murphy -- gathered in the hospital 's conference room .
All the chairs were filled , and people stood in the back of the room .
Dr. Wilson , the project 's scientific director , gave a synopsis of David 's history , then opened the session for questions .
The most pointed of those questions came from Dr. Robert Main , another chaplain .
" You 're in the honeymoon stage of treating him now , " said Main , who had examined David .
" One day he will take a look at himself and decide he does n't want to be in there till he gets to be 15 years of age . "
Nonetheless , Dr. Montgomery , another of David 's original doctors , brought the meeting to an upbeat close .
Under similar circumstances , he said , he would start this project again with another child .
" How many more ? " someone asked .
" Until I determined that there was no more information to be gained by such a thing , " Montgomery replied , " or if the outcome was certain . "
The Reverend Raymond J. Lawrence , the chaplain of Texas Children's , had convened the meeting , but he was disappointed by its results .
The real ethical issues , he says , were never discussed .
" The great scandal of the Bubble Boy was that he was conceived for the bubble , " says Lawrence , now director of the department of pastoral care at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City .
" The team that did this did n't think through this very well .
They did n't consider what would happen if they did n't find an immediate cure .
They operated on the assumption that you could live to be 80 years old in a bubble , and that would be unfortunate but okay . "
In the years since , Lawrence 's outrage has not abated .
He continues to maintain that the three original doctors convinced David 's parents to conceive him because they wanted a test subject for their studies of immunology .
The doctors flatly deny the charge .
No other ethical conferences on the subject were ever convened .
And when contacted recently , Dr. Montgomery stood firmly by the decision to place David in the bubble .
" At the time , we were encouraged by everything we knew , " he says .
" If people did n't take chances , none of us would be here .
Columbus would have stayed in Spain and would have been selling tortillas , because he was warned he would sail off the edge of the earth . "
Mary Murphy did n't have a lot of free time to spend with David .
During the day , her job required her to evaluate other kids at the hospital 's developmental center ; at night , she needed to work on her doctoral thesis .
She says David offered a bargain :
If she would work on her dissertation in his room at the hospital every other evening , including Saturdays , he would promise not to talk .
As Murphy worked on her dissertation , David spent his time watching television and , later , doing his homework .
( He had tutors , and attended an elementary school class in Conroe by telephone hookup . )
He showed a flair for math , but rarely read for pleasure , a fact that disappointed Murphy .
She 'd hoped that books would provide him an escape from the bubble .
Instead , over the years , his sense of hopelessness increased .
" Even though David was only five , " wrote Murphy , " he recognized his difference and dreaded what the future held -- limited choices , feelings of alienation and an increased need to be polite and compliant so as not to reveal his anger . "
Most of the time , David lived deep within himself .
" He was always used to being very polite , " she remembered .
It took her a long time to tell when he was saying what he meant , and when he was saying what she wanted him to say .
" That is , I guess , one of the things that kept me uncomfortable , " she admitted .
" I sensed he was being excruciatingly polite sometimes when he did n't really want to be .
Most kids that age do n't have that kind of façade .
They do n't bother . "
Sometimes , though , David revealed his inner turmoil -- though at great cost to himself and the people who cared for him .
Given the news that Dr. Wilson had a heart attack and was in intensive care , he smeared excrement all over the inside of the bubble ; hospital workers spent three days cleaning the mess .
Murphy theorized that David 's reaction betrayed his deep fear of abandonment : Wilson 's heart attack was one more piece of evidence that people would leave him , and that he was powerless to follow .
Other fears manifested themselves in recurring dreams .
In one , David was attacked by thousands of spiders .
In another -- which disturbed him even more -- the King of Germs dispatched thousands of his wives to invade the bubble .
David was able to kill the wives , but the king simply married more to send after him .
" I do n't know if it 's a bad dream or if they 're really pouncing on me , " he told Murphy .
" Maybe I 'm crazy .
Maybe I 'm losing my mind . "
Murphy tried to turn the dreams into games and think of ways he could kill his dream world enemies .
Though he learned to cope with the nightmares , she says the fear of insanity plagued him from then on .
In 1977 , NASA developed for David what was known as the Mobile Biologistical Isolation System .
Basically , it was a $ 50,000 space suit that would allow David to venture outside the bubble .
That July , Murphy joined the crowd in David 's room : David 's parents , NASA engineers and hospital staff , all gathered to see his first adventure in the suit .
A camera crew was on hand to record the event .
To get into the suit , David had to crawl through an eight - foot tunnel that connected the suit to the bubble .
Every movement was scheduled , but as the countdown began , Murphy says David asked her to hold him with the gloves that extended into the bubble .
He wanted to be as far from the space suit as possible .
" I do n't believe this , " he said .
" Mary , can you believe this ?
Look at that thing at the end of the tunnel .
Now that 's what I 'm afraid of .
Germs could be in there . "
When the time came for David to crawl into the tunnel , he balked , and said he needed a few more minutes .
After those minutes passed , he repeated his request -- and after those minutes , asked yet again for a few more .
Finally , after the camera crew left the room , David entered the tunnel , pathetic and trembling .
At one point , he got his head stuck in the suit and let out a bloodcurdling scream .
But once in the suit , he discovered it was n't so bad .
He held his gloved hands in front of his faceplate , grinned from ear to ear and said , " I like it . "
Never before had he taken more than six steps in any direction .
But with his mobile support system , he was able that day to travel about 30 feet down the hallway , where he got a cup of ice and handed it to a nurse .
It was the first time he'd ever given something to another person .
Though David seemed excited by the excursion , he voiced reservations about the suit before each of his six subsequent outings .
When he outgrew the suit , it was replaced -- but he never wore the replacement .
Years later , when David saw a videotape of the made - for - TV movie loosely based on his life , he was most amused by the movie 's treatment of the space suit .
In The Boy in the Plastic Bubble , John Travolta played a 17 - year - old boy who'd lived his entire life in sterile isolation .
David laughed at the idea that his character could simply wear the space suit back into the isolator without contaminating the bubble .
In the grand tradition of made - for - TV movies , The Boy in the Plastic Bubble ended on an upbeat note : Travolta , without consulting anyone , simply decided to walk out of the bubble , join his buxom girlfriend on horseback and ride off into the sunset -- presumably to a good time and a certain death .
Certainly , the movie was a long way from realism .
But unlike the press , Hollywood at least recognized that David 's situation could not and should not go on indefinitely .
Newspapers and TV revealed no such shreds of grimness .
In September 1977 , the Houston Post reported cheerfully that " a sixth birthday is extra special for most boys and David 's will be no exception . "
The article maintained that David " continues to thrive and develop at above - average rates . "
To the outside world , David was just a happy , healthy child , miraculously unscathed by the sterility of his life .
Reality was less pleasant .
" The summer before David 's eighth birthday marked the beginning of the end , " Murphy wrote .
" Painfully aware of being different and not belonging to a peer group , he inevitably concluded , ' Let 's face it -- what do I have in common with kids my own age ?
Nothing . ' "
His explosive rages grew more frequent .
After exhausting himself , he'd be aghast at his behavior , afraid that people would leave him and not return .
Murphy was disturbed by David 's preoccupation with death and fascination with fire .
He drew giant flames to burn down the hospital or his home .
He'd then pretend to extinguish the flames by urinating on his drawing .
He developed facial tics , and would nervously rub the bridge of his nose until it was raw .
He was frightened of change .
And as he began to enter puberty , Murphy says , he 'd occasionally engage in open masturbation , embarrassing his nurses and teachers .
By then , she was seeing less of David , who lived almost full - time with his family in Conroe .
She occasionally visited him there , but most times , they talked by phone .
Though David grew to enjoy being at home in Conroe , he was at first reluctant to leave the hospital for an extended period of time .
" How can I tell my mother that I do n't want to live at home ? " he asked Murphy a few months before his tenth birthday .
" I love my parents very much , but I can't tolerate the thought of six months . "
As if to prove he meant what he said , he paced , threw himself on the floor of his bubble , pounded his fists and screamed and cursed -- all so violently that Murphy was frightened for him .
She tried to comfort him .
" You should be with your parents and your school friends , " she told him .
" A hospital is no place for a boy to grow up . "
Still , David was inconsolable .
" Why did n't they do something to me before I was old enough to care ? " he asked .
" When I was three , I would n't have cared .
When all this mess started , did n't they ever think about or realize that they were dealing with my life ?
They made decisions without ever thinking about anything except what they wanted to do , not about all this crap that I 'm in .
" I am a mouse surrounded by ten cats , and there are no dogs to chase the cats away ....
Where do you suppose I could get some legal advice ? "
Over the years , the composition of David 's medical team changed .
One by one , the three original doctors moved to new jobs in different cities ; eventually Baylor 's Dr. Ralph Feigin and Dr. William Shearer headed the team .
( Both declined to be interviewed by the Press . )
It was Feigin , Murphy said , who encouraged her to take the meticulous notes from which she constructed her book .
By the time David was nine -- three years into Feigin 's stay at Baylor -- Feigin pushed to resolve the boy 's situation , which he described as " intolerable for everyone . "
Since David 's birth , his doctors had hoped that his immune deficiency could be corrected with a bone marrow transplant .
But an exhaustive search failed to turn up a perfectly matched donor , and research had not progressed to the point that a less - than - perfect match might work .
Murphy recounted a meeting in June 1980 , when Feigin conceded that a cure for David was still years away .
Nevertheless , the doctor was concerned about " a deterioration in the boy 's mental status , " as well as the possibility that federal funding for the project would eventually dry up .
( Conservatively estimated , the cost of keeping David alive eventually came to somewhere around $ 1.3 million . )
According to Murphy , Feigin and Shearer attempted to convince the Vetters to remove David from the bubble and place him on a regime of gamma globulin and antibiotics .
Basically , the doctors were hoping that David 's body -- like those of the twins in Europe -- had miraculously begun to develop an immune system .
Murphy believed the plan was a way to bring David out of the bubble and let him die .
Despite her affection for the boy , she thought it was the right thing to do .
The Vetters , though , rejected the idea after consulting with the original trio of doctors .
Four years later , even those doctors agreed that something had to be done .
Researchers in Boston had made advances in transplanting unmatched bone marrow .
Montgomery and the other two original doctors convinced the Vetters that an unmatched bone marrow transplant was a risk worth taking .
The transplant was set for October 21 , 1983 , precisely a month after David 's 12th birthday .
The boy told Murphy that he did n't believe the transplant would work , and he seemed ambivalent about his prospects .
But he seemed less frightened of death than of the alternative : life outside the bubble .
" He was actually afraid that it might work , " said Murphy , " and that he would n't be able to adjust when he came out . "
Against David 's wishes , Baylor hired a camera crew to record the procedure .
David wanted Murphy to be at his side , and even advised her on what to wear to the transplant , so that she 'd look good in the newspaper .
His first choice was turquoise , but he settled for a red blouse , a red velvet vest and a red print skirt .
David 's older sister , Katherine , donated the marrow , which was treated by doctors in Boston and flown to Houston to be introduced into David 's system .
In the wee hours of that Friday morning , Texas Children 's Hospital was informed that the plane had arrived at the airport .
Less than an hour later , Dr. Shearer walked into David 's room with a white Styrofoam ice chest .
Murphy thought that the precious fluid sloshing inside a plastic bag looked like pink lemonade .
The procedure was more like a blood transfusion than an operation .
Through the intravenous lines that ran into the bubble , Katherine 's bone marrow slowly dripped into David 's system .
The transplant seemed to go well , and for a few months , doctors dared to hope that David might leave the bubble .
But by December , it was clear that something was very wrong .
In early February , David was plagued with diarrhea , fever and vomiting so severe that he had to be removed from the bubble to be given intensive treatment .
He died 15 days later , on February 22 .
It turned out that the screens of Katherine 's bone marrow had missed the presence of Epstein - Barr , the virus that produces mononucleosis .
An autopsy revealed that David 's body was riddled with tumors ; he died of Burkitt 's lymphoma .
According to Dr. Shearer , the information gleaned from David 's autopsy led to the discovery that viruses can cause cancer .
Besides specific medical advances , David 's case also changed the way that doctors approach genetic problems .
" What David 's story best illustrates is medicine 's hopelessness in dealing with symptoms of disease , " says Terry Sharrer , the curator of health sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. David 's space suit and one of his isolators are now part of the Smithsonian 's collection .
According to Sharrer , the Bubble Boy 's life coincided with the birth of molecular medicine , which is aimed at fixing a genetic fault rather than combating its results .
" David 's case , " he says , " ended a line of medical thinking that went back a thousand years . "
During the last 15 days of David 's life -- his first days outside a sterile field -- he spent many of his conscious hours watching TV .
He was amazed by the inaccuracies in the saturation coverage of his life and imminent death .
And he was especially irritated by a reporter who said his space suit had given him mobility .
" Mobility ? " David asked Murphy rhetorically .
" What mobility ? "
One last time , he made her promise that she 'd write a factual account of his life and death .
She began the book about eight months later .
She wrote in her spare time , snatched from the moments when she was n't at work or caring for her ailing mother .
Along the way , she obtained the written permission of both the Vetters and officials at Texas Children 's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine .
In 1995 , Mary Murphy 's book seemed on the verge of publication .
In its spring catalog , WRS Publishing called it a " captivating inside story " and " provocative question - raiser . "
But as it turned out , some people close to David would rather not see the questions raised .
In February , Dr. Feigin wrote WRS that he'd been told that portions of the book were drawn from conversations between hospital employees and David or his parents .
He warned that such usage might violate Texas laws providing for patients ' privacy , and suggested that the publisher review the manuscript carefully .
Roughly a month later , WRS received another letter , this one from David 's parents , who had divorced .
His father , David Vetter Jr. , is now the mayor of Splendora .
His mother , Carol Ann Demaret , is married to Kent Demaret , who as a reporter covered the Bubble Boy story for People magazine .
After reading a draft of Murphy 's book , Demaret drafted a letter blasting it .
Over the course of 28 pages , he complained that the work was " not defensible on any grounds " and amounted " to an assault on a dead child . "
The letter suggests that Murphy manipulated David and that he would never have asked her to write such a book .
It also complains that the words she attributes to David are much different from his way of speaking .
" The supposed ' quotes ' are not in the true ' voice ' or spirit of David , " the letter states .
" They do , however , sound exactly like Murphy . "
It is true that much of what Murphy says and writes about in her book cannot be corroborated , since the people who could confirm or refute her claims refuse to be interviewed .
But many of the letter 's objections simply do not pass muster .
For instance , the family ridicules as a " hallucination " Murphy 's contention that David was manipulative -- an observation previously published in a 1977 academic paper in Pediatric Research .
Additionally , during his short life it was often reported that David had both an above - average intellect and vocabulary .
David 's parents declined to be interviewed for this story .
Contacted by phone , David Vetter Jr. said , " I do n't have time to talk to you .
I do n't want to talk with you .
Thank you for calling . "
Carol Ann Demaret 's phone was answered by her husband , who said in a friendly fashion that he doubted that she'd be interviewed .
By mail , he later confirmed that .
During his phone conversation with the Press , Demaret described the book as " bad news . "
Asked about the relationship between Mary Murphy and David , he replied , " She visited him occasionally . "
Of all the charges leveled against Murphy , the most unlikely one is that she exaggerated her relationship with the boy .
Even Team David members who disagree with her conclusions confirm that she and David were close .
" In order for David 's life to be most meaningful , his parents and we all tried to be upbeat about it even though we knew that things were wrong , " said Mary Ann South , one of the original three doctors .
" As I recall , [ Murphy ] picked up on a lot of developmental things about him that nobody wanted to face . "
Facing unpleasant truths -- especially about well - meaning people -- is never easy .
University of Houston history professor James H. Jones is the author of Bad Blood : The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment , which documents a 40 - year study in which more than 400 black men with syphilis were deliberately left untreated .
In the foreword to Murphy 's book , Jones stated that she shows how " good people err for the best of reasons . "
" If David 's life proved anything , " wrote Jones , " it was that love , kindness and good intentions do not necessarily translate into sound decisions or produce the desired results . "
Last fall , Mary Murphy began having nightmares .
In the recurring dreams , she somehow disappointed her mother and could never reach a desired destination .
She awoke with an overwhelming sense of sadness .
Her psychiatrist told her the dreams were related to the book .
" I made a promise , " Murphy explained , " and I need to keep it . "
Now 70 , she is reshaping the manuscript and hopes to find another publisher .
But she wo n't water down her thesis ; she promised to tell David 's story , no matter how sad .
In February 1984 , she visited David the day he'd been removed from his bubble .
He was conscious and calm , and seemed to realize he was dying .
Wearing surgical gloves , she touched him for the first time outside the bubble , helping him to sit up and adjust his surgical mask .
They held hands .
From his hospital bed , he asked that the miniblinds be raised ; he wanted to see the view from his new room .
But instead of the expected sunset , the window revealed only a brick wall .
Murphy began to cry .
For once , their roles were reversed : David tried to comfort Murphy , reminding her of the wall in a children 's book she used to read him .
David had spent his whole life with barriers .
This last one was hardly the worst .
According to the article his mother and Demaret wrote for People , Mary also held David 's hand the night that he died .
The story described Mary as David 's " close friend . "
" When she was leaving , " Carol Ann recalled , " David said , ' Remember , I love you , Mary .
Good - bye . '
He had never said good - bye to Mary .
It was always , ' I 'll see you later . '

An unidentified sea creature , termed an " octosquid , " was found last week off Keahole Point on the Big Island .
CLICK FOR LARGE COURTESY PHOTOAn unidentified sea creature , termed an " octosquid , " was found last week off Keahole Point on the Big Island .
Curious creature caught off Keahole Point
The animal , dubbed an " octosquid , " is found off the Big Isle
It 's a squid , it 's an octopus , it 's ... a mystery from the deep .
What appears to be a half - squid , half - octopus specimen found off Keahole Point on the Big Island remains unidentified today and could possibly be a new species , said local biologists .
The specimen was found caught in a filter in one of Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority 's deep - sea water pipelines last week .
The pipeline , which runs 3,000 feet deep , sucks up cold , deep - sea water for the tenants of the natural energy lab .
" When we first saw it , I was really delighted because it was new and alive , " said Jan War , operations manager at NELHA .
" I 've never seen anything like that . "
The natural energy lab is a state agency that operates Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology Park in Kailua - Kona , adjacent to one of the steepest offshore slopes in the Hawaiian Islands .
According to Richard Young , an oceanography professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa , the specimen tentatively belongs to the genus Mastigoteuthis , but the species is undetermined .
War , who termed the specimen " octosquid " for the way it looked , said it was about a foot long , with white suction cups , eight tentacles and an octopus head with a squidlike mantle .
The octosquid was pulled to the surface , along with three rattail fish and half a dozen satellite jellyfish , and stayed alive for three days .
According to War , the lab usually checks its filters once a month , but this time , it put a plankton net in one of the filters and checked it two weeks later .
The pitch - black conditions at 3,000 feet below sea level are unfamiliar to most but riveting to scientists who have had the opportunity to submerge .
The sea floor is full of loose sediment , big boulders and rocks , and a lot of mucuslike things floating in the water , which are usually specimens that died at the surface and drifted to the bottom .
" It 's quite fascinating , " War said .
" When you get below 700 feet , it 's a totally different world .
Lots of fish have heads like a fish and a body like an eel .
There are fish floating in a vertical position , with the head up , and do n't move unless they 're disturbed . "
Christopher Kelley , program biologist for the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory , went to the natural energy lab Tuesday to pick up the preserved octosquid , rattail fish and jellyfish , which had been stored in a freezer , and brought them back to UH - Manoa 's oceanography department .
" It 's a beautiful squid .
It 's a gorgeous ruby red color , " Kelley said .
" We really enjoy these little mysteries that come up . "
Also during Kelley 's visit to NELHA yesterday , he and War talked about a more formal sampling program to search for other deep - sea critters .
War said their goal is to sample the intake screen more often and capture animals alive and study them in captivity .
" This opens up a whole new area of research that UH can be involved with , " War said .
In October , NELHA will be checking its deep - sea pipelines , something that usually happens every eight to 10 years , because it is worried that something might have happened to them during the earthquakes in October .
" If it 's a new species , ( NELHA ) would like to name it , " War said .
" But that is sort of the honor of whoever classifies it . "
The rate of aging may be evolutionarily determined as a balancing act between maintenance of regenerative capacity and prevention of cancer ( see our earlier article , Devil ’s bargain : Tradeoffs between stem cell maintenance and tumor suppression ) .
The idea is that the same mechanisms that stop our cells from proliferating out of control might also prevent them from dividing in order to repair damage .
Like all theories of aging , this one has its advocates ( of which I am one ) and its detractors ( whom I ’m certainly willing to hear out ) .
Today I wanted to share two recent review - type articles ( one of them is a book chapter ) that address the issue .
On the “ pro ” side is an article by Christian Beauséjour , who ’s worked in the field of cellular senescence for quite some time .
He reviews evidence that senescence , which evolved as a tumor suppressor function , may contribute to age - related decline in the hematopoetic stem cell ( HSC ) compartment .
From a recent volume of the Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology :
Bone marrow - derived cells : the influence of aging and cellular senescence .
During the course of an entire lifespan , tissue repair and regeneration is made possible by the presence of adult stem cells .
Stem cell expansion , maintenance , and differentiation must be tightly controlled to assure longevity .
Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) are greatly solicited given the daily high blood cell turnover .
Moreover , several bone marrow - derived cells including HSC , mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC ) , and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPC ) also significantly contribute to peripheral tissue repair and regeneration , including tumor formation .
Therefore , factors influencing bone marrow - derived cell proliferation and functions are likely to have a broad impact .
Aging has been identified as one of these factors .
One hypothesis is that aging directly affects stem cells as a consequence of exhaustive proliferation .
Alternatively , it is also possible that aging indirectly affects stem cells by acting on their microenvironment .
Cellular senescence is believed to have evolved as a tumor suppressor mechanism capable of arresting growth to reduce risk of malignancy .
In opposition to apoptosis , senescent cells accumulate in tissues .
Recent evidence suggests their accumulation contributes to the phenotype of aging .
Senescence can be activated by both telomere - dependent and telomere - independent pathways .
Genetic alteration , genome - wide DNA damage , and oxidative stress are inducers of senescence and have recently been identified as occurring in bone marrow - derived cells .
Below is a review of the link between cellular senescence , aging , and bone marrow - derived cells , and the possible consequences aging may have on bone marrow transplantation procedures and emerging marrow - derived cell - based therapies .
In the other corner we have a review from Aranda - Anzaldo and Dent , who propose that the evolutionary history of p53 makes it unlikely that it ’s even an important tumor suppressor gene in short - lived species like the mouse , much less an antagonistically pleiotropic gerontogene ( for definition and discussion of those concepts , see our earlier article Conditioned for aging ) :
Reassessing the role of p53 in cancer and ageing from an evolutionary perspective
The gene p53 has been fashioned as the guardian of the genome and as prototype of the tumour suppressor gene ( TSG ) whose function must be inactivated in order for tumours to develop .
The ubiquitous expression of truncated p53 protein isoforms , results in “ premature ageing ” of laboratory mouse strains engineered for expressing such isoforms .
These facts have been construed in the argument that p53 evolved in order to protect organisms with renewable tissues from developing cancer yet , because p53 is also an inducer of cellular senescence or apoptosis after extensive DNA damage , it becomes a limiting factor for tissue renewal by depleting tissues from stem / precursor cells thus leading to whole - organism ageing .
From that point of view p53 displays antagonist pleiotropy contributing to the establishment of degenerative diseases and ageing .
Therefore , tumour suppression becomes a balancing act between cancer prevention and ageing .
Nevertheless , here we present current evidence showing that the aforementioned argument is rather inconsistent and unwarranted on evolutionary grounds .
The evolutionary perspective indicates that p53 evolved so as to play a subtle but very important role during development while its role as a TSG is only important in animals that are protected from most sources of extrinsic mortality , thus suggesting that p53 was primarily selected for its developmental role and not as a TSG .
Therefore no real antagonist pleiotropy can be attached to p53 functions and their relationship with whole - organism ageing might be a laboratory artefact .
Strong words indeed , especially at the end .
The paper itself is quite dense , and I admit that I have n’t had a chance to sift through it carefully , so for now I ’m just going to present the paper and invite others to read it with me .
Beauséjour ’s position is much more in the “ mainstream ” of recent conference discussions , and it happens to be more or less how I think about these issues , but I ’m looking forward to carefully evaluating the other side of the debate .
I ’d be especially interested to know how other biogerontologists weigh the arguments on both sides .
I 'm sure everyone knows where that line comes from .
( As if the entry title did n't give it away . ) I picked up the DVD of The Godfather a few months back , to replace my 2 - cassette VHS edition .
Of course I 've been a big fan of the novel , having picked it up when I was doing my first degree at UBC .
Now that I 'm older , I find myself in admiration of the character who says that line , Peter Clemenza .
Mario Puzo describes him as " a jolly dancer , " and as played by Richard Castellano , you can see he 's got a lot of joie de vivre .
He enjoys wine straight from the pitcher , he likes to kid around with superiors and subordinates alike -- and make no mistake , he 's a tough one .
( " Leave the gun .
Take the cannolli . " )
But note his attitude in the kitchen , before James Caan interrupts him .
It 's the post - war 1940s , as portrayed in the women 's lib 1970s , and this fella 's right at home over a stove .
This is the attitude of a man who 's comfortable in his own skin .
Men could do worse than emulate this .
About the recipe , now .
The scene with Clemenza appears in the novel , but not the actual recipe .
According to the DVD commentary , the recipe came from Francis Ford Coppola , who directed the film .
He says he put the recipe in the script because , if the film flopped , at least whoever saw it would learn how to make spaghetti sauce .
In other words , this is meant to be an Important Scene .
There are some clues as to proportions that are n't mentioned .
Clemenza is talking to Mikey just as he 's emptying two cans of tomatoes into the sauce .
That tells us the proportions he 's using .
When he adds the sausages and meatballs , you realize from their color that they 've already been cooked .
He splashes in wine straight from the jug , and it's a deep red wine .
The sugar is dumped in from a measuring cup , and it looks to be about a quarter - cup .
So .
Here 's how the recipe looks , to serve 8 to 10 people : Tip :
If you have normally have problems with gas after eating a sauce like this , you can reduce them by skimming the surface of acid ( reddish - orange pools of foam will form on the surface ) .
Tip 2 : If you 're using canned whole tomatoes , draining them and then crushing them by hand will result in a chunky sauce .
Canned crushed tomatoes will create a slightly thinner sauce , while canned chopped tomatoes will result in a thicker sauce .

In NetNews parlance , " Posting " refers to posting a new article to a group , or responding to a post someone else has posted .
" Cross - Posting " refers to posting a message to more than one group .
If you introduce Cross - Posting to a group , or if you direct " Followup - To : " in the header of your posting , warn readers !
Readers will usually assume that the message was posted to a specific group and that followups will go to that group .
Headers change this behavior .
- Read all of a discussion in progress ( we call this a thread ) before posting replies .
Avoid posting " Me Too " messages , where content is limited to agreement with previous posts .
Content of a follow - up post should exceed quoted content .
- Send mail when an answer to a question is for one person only .
Remember that News has global distribution and the whole world probably is NOT interested in a personal response .
However , do n't hesitate to post when something will be of general interest to the Newsgroup participants .
- Check the " Distribution " section of the header , but do n't depend on it .
Due to the complex method by which News is delivered , Distribution headers are unreliable .
But , if you are posting something which will be of interest to a limited number or readers , use a distribution line that attempts to limit the distribution of your article to those people .
For example , set the Distribution to be " nj " if you are posting an article that will be of interest only to New Jersey readers .

6.0 Security Considerations 7.0 Author 's Address
Those who ca n’t do , learn .
In this installment of our series in which the clueless apprentice with the experts , we pick up a long - sought skill from Brooklyn tattoo artist Duke Riley — who also plays canvas .
I am by no means a tattooed lady .
I have a tire swing on my left arm and a black ink outline of a little girl with a big head on my lower back .
At 19 , when I got the tattoo on my back , my first , I was surprised by my willingness to trust a stranger with such a gruesome , heavy task .
I was a sulky college dropout too deep inside her own head — an impulsive decision with forever consequences was the last thing I thought I could handle .
It felt massively important ; but in the end , it was no big deal .
Now , six years and one big arm piece later , I wanted to find out if the same buoyancy and optimism could occur on the other side of the needle .
Duke Riley did my tire swing last March at his studio in Greenpoint , Brooklyn .
Duke ’s a frank , laid - back , scattered guy who spends a good portion of his time sailing and swimming the East River .
( In fact , he recently made headlines for taking a homemade submersible too close to the Queen Mary 2 . )
His back is a world of anchors , sea life , and sailor code .
When I went in for a touch - up in July , I asked if he ’d teach me how to tattoo .
“ Aw , you know , it ’s going to be a hard thing , teaching someone to tattoo in an hour . ”
He laughed and shook his head .
“ What were you thinking , you ’d tattoo me ? ”
I never imagined another human being would let me tattoo them .
First lesson joyfully learned :
While tattoos are a big deal , a tattoo is no big deal .
Openness to being tattooed is crucial .
“ Yes .
Please .
I want to give you a tattoo . ”
And he was open to the idea .
We meet at his shop a few weeks later , and play out the typical first - time tattoo banter .
Duke teases : “ So , is this gonna hurt ? ”
I tell him that depends on where he wants the tattoo , and that he seems like a tough guy who can probably handle the pain .
“ But what if I get sick of it ? ”
“ Well — ” I feed him my favorite line about tattoos “ — it will be a reminder of this moment in your life .
It ’ll help you laugh at yourself later on . ”
“ All right , all right , ” Duke says , and nods .
“ You ’ve got the bullshit talk down , at least . ”
He starts frantically browsing art books as he barks set - up instructions .
The shop is sweltering .
I wipe the sweat from my forehead with the edge of my tank top .
Step 1 : Prepare the Work Area
“ Spray down the counter with disinfectant , and then green soap .
OK , lay out a piece of tinfoil and put a glob of Vaseline on it .
Get some Vaseline on the caps and stick them to the tinfoil .
Now spray down the stand .
We wo n’t wrap it in Saran Wrap — we ’ll do the tattoo ghetto - style . ”
I ’m starting to trip over things in the shop , and I ’m worried that my anxiety will change his mind .
But the situation appears to be speeding along with or without me .
Duke is trying to choose between a picture of a scared donkey and a small bumblebee .
I splash water on my face and loudly exhale .
Step 2 : Draw the Tattoo
“ OK .
We ’re going with the bee on the knee .
Cause it ’s gonna be the bee ’s knees . ”
Duke points to a tiny bee — the design has shading and color , despite its small size .
Better than a donkey on the ass , I think .
I attach the prongs of the cord to the back of the machine , and push down on the pedal .
The needle begins to hum , and I feel it vibrate in my gut .
To make the stencil , we blow up the image a bit on a copier and grab a piece of tracing paper .
“ How good of a drawer are you ? ” Duke asks .
Decidedly not a drawer , I nervously start tracing the bee .
“ Ha .
That ’s really bad . ”
My stomach is in my throat .
I ’m sitting three feet from the door .
If I dash right now , I could eventually live down the shame .
Instead , I lean in close to the paper and draw with the determination of a second - grader learning cursive .
After I ’m done , Duke approves my work , and after wrestling with a broken carbon copier for a while , he decides we should trace the bee in ink and transfer the design onto his leg from the tracing paper .
Duke opens a couple of beers with his teeth , and we get ready to put the bee ’s outline above his knee in washable ink .
Step 3 : Transfer the Image
In order to get the picture onto the knee I first have to shave the area , then put KY Jelly on the spot , pressing on the KY until it becomes tacky .
I pull on a pair of latex gloves , then start shaving .
Once I ’m done , I begin applying the KY , but getting the right consistency proves problematic because of the heat .
We spend what seems like an hour trying to get the image transferred , pressing it into the knee and trying to make the outline darker with a Sharpie .
There is groaning on both our parts , and fussing ( me ) , and knocking over of the tool tray ( also me ) , before we achieve a faint trace of the most pitiful bee I ’ve ever seen .
“ Can you see those lines ? ” he asks .
Technically , I can see them , but can I follow them with a tattoo machine ?
“ Yeah , sure , ” I gulp .
Step 4 : Prepare the Needle
As the wimpy bee blinks back at me , it ’s time to set up the machine .
Duke shows me how to thread the needle through the tube and hook the back end of the needle onto a prong on the machine .
Since I ’m going to do the outline of the tattoo first , we ’re using a skinny needle .
The four - inch - long tube is about as wide as a cigar — yet deceptively heavy .
When hooked to the machine , its balance and weight take a minute to adjust to .
I attach the prongs of the cord to the back of the machine , and push down on the pedal .
The needle begins to hum , and I feel it vibrate in my gut .
There are three caps of ink : black , yellow , and gray ( for the shading ) .
I dip the needle into the black ink and position the machine over the spot where I ’m about to draw the first line .
Duke explains what to do : “ So , what you want to do is follow the line , and then bring the needle up before the line ’s going to end . ”
Step 5 : Outline the Image
The first line does not get drawn , as much as grazed .
Duke : “ You ’ve got to be sure to stretch the skin tight when you do it . ”
I try stretching the skin , but the outcome of the second swipe is not much better .
Duke : “ You ’re not going to be able to see the needle when it vibrates .
You want to tilt it so the corner of the tube is against the skin . ”
This gets results — but not many .
I hover close to try one more time .
Duke : “ WAIT ! Fuck ! ”
I bolt upright , wide - eyed .
“ This is n’t going to work .
Let ’s just do an anchor or a star or something simple like that .
The bee is too complicated for a first tattoo .
It ’s going to take too long . ”
He quickly wipes away the bee and draws an anchor in its place .
All I can do is nod : Uh -huh .
OK .
Whatever you want .
I ’m actually relieved that my stare - down with the bee is over .
The anchor ’s drawn and there ’s ink on the needle .
I wipe the sweat from my forehead and start in on the new design — but I still ca n’t tell when the needle is going into the skin .
Suddenly , Duke has another change of heart .
“ You know what ?
We ’re doing the bee . ”
“ It ’s going to feel like you ’re going in a lot deeper , but do n’t worry .
The skin is n’t going to let you go in too deep . ”
“ Seriously ? ”
“ Yeah .
You gotta put the bee on the knee . ”
He re-transfers the image , this time slightly lower — to avoid the skin I ’ve already mangled .
I roll the chair up beside him , take a deep breath , and put on my serious face : “ Dude , you ’ve got to let me try this for at least 10 minutes without getting frustrated .
Just bear with me . ”
He shrugs .
“ I ’m not frustrated .
Go ahead . ”
And he ’s not — and now I ’m not either .
I press the pedal , hunch over his leg , and outline a wing .
Duke lets out an exaggerated but greatly appreciated cheer .
( “ That ’s great !
Great job ! ” )
The wing is crooked , not at all solid , but the line is there .
He gives me a quick overview of what to outline and reminds me not to go backward if I miss a part .
And I ’m off .
There ’s a good amount of talking , sighing , wiping away excess ink with a paper towel , and admiring , but the bee is finally taking form .
I start to relax into the tattoo and enjoy concentrating as the design emerges .
I get used to the rhythm of the machine , and find I ’m even stepping on the pedal instinctively , taking its vibration for granted .
I complete the outline and go over all the spots I missed .
Then we change machines , switching to a bigger needle to fill in the bee ’s body .
Step 6 : Fill in the Image
“ When you fill in the body , you ’ve got to make tiny circles . ”
I worry that this will be harder than the outline .
“ No way — so much easier .
It ’s going to feel like you ’re going in a lot deeper , but do n’t worry .
The skin is n’t going to let you go in too deep . ”
After we add yellow to the bee ’s body , we begin shading the wings .
Making horizontal lines with the needle , I press heavy at the edge of the wing and then lift the needle up as I draw the line .
I fill in the darker part of the shaded wing at the end .
Duke assures me the gray will fade over time .
Adrenaline and zeal have replaced my fear , and the bee is there , every line of it mine .
Duke is affirming , though likely embellishing : “ I ’ve seen people apprentice for a year before giving a first tattoo that is n’t as good as this . ”
I ’m beaming through my sweat .
Duke Riley , the Bee's Knees
At Duke ’s suggestion , I add some white to the eyes , then lean back to look at my work .
The wings are lopsided .
The body ’s distorted .
But after an hour of set - up and a little more than an hour of tattooing , it ’s finished .
“ I gotta go call my mom and tell her I got a tattoo , ” Duke says with a smile .
I ’m euphoric , but starting to crash the same way I did after getting the tire swing on my bicep .
I look down , expecting to see the bee on my own knee .
Duke wants to get home , and his voice cuts through my daze .
“ Now you gotta clean . ”
Step 7 : Clean - Up & Finish
Gloves still on , I hurry to spray down the counters and throw away our garbage .
We close up the shop and I stumble into the street , where it ’s at least 15 degrees cooler .
I ask Duke if he ’s ever given a crappy tattoo .
“ Sure .
Everybody gives crappy tattoos .
But before I gave other people crappy tattoos , I gave myself crappy tattoos . ”
I fall into the passenger seat of Duke ’s pickup , and spend the ride home thinking about what unfortunate tattoo I want to give myself .
Symantec Programming Development Virus JavaScript and Uncategorized Shaun McCarthy 5:32 pm
The Skinny :
Anyone who has ever had to develop on a machine with a virus scanner than has “ real time protection ” knows the pain that it can cause .
Have you ever had issues in Visual Studio where files are locked and do n’t become unlocked till you restart your environment / iis / your machine ?
Well , in the majority of cases , it ’s thanks to Symantec getting it ’s grubby hands all over it .
Now Symantec are making things awkward from the other side – as a valentines day gift , Symantec have decided that they will now try to scan the content of javascript in an html document , with a badly implemented heuristic .
This means that if anyone vists your website with Symantec installed , if you have a large chunk of javsacript it will pause for up to a minute while it tries to work out what the javascript is doing !
This means a large portion of your client base could be seeing minute long delays as they are using your site .
Slightly more details :
It seems the key is the new statement .
If your code has a lot ( thousands ) of new statements in a single block ( e.g. pre loading rollover images / using your own custom objects to preload an array / drop down – typically done when you query a database in programming to populate some items for use by javascript ) then Symantec will get it ’s knickers in a twist .
e.g .
< script >
imgArr[ 0 ] = new Image ( “ Aniceimage.jpg ” ) ;
imgArr[ 1 ] = new Image ( “ anotherimage.jpg ” ) ;
…
imgArr[ 2000 ] = new Image ( “ TheLastImage.gif ” ) ;
</script >
To show how ignorant they are , if you break it up into script blocks it works fine .
e.g .
< script>imgArr[ 0 ] = new Image ( “ Aniceimage.jpg ” ) ;</ script >
< script>imgArr[ 1 ] = new Image ( “ anotherimage.jpg ” ) ;</ script >
…
< script>imgArr[2000 ] = new Image ( “ TheLastImage.gif ” ) ;</ script >
I ’ve filed a complaint with Symantec – lets hope they take it seriously !
If good pornography is a you - know - it - when - you - see - it kind of thing , good parody is exactly the opposite : A parody succeeds when largenumbers of people do n’t recognize the thing as a parody .
Bythat standard , Ward Sutton ’s “ Kelly ” cartoons for The Onionare 24 - carat fool ’s gold .
Their wheels - within - wheels - within - wheelslayers of lampoon and self - reference make it nearly impossible totell the dancer from the dance .
If you ’re even slightly familiar with the conventions of editorialcartoons , the Kelly one - panels will present few challenges .
In onerecentdrawing , an editor at the Washington Post exults overhis front - page headline : “ Walter Reed army hospital is a ’disgrace . ’ ”
Giving a thumbs - up with one hand and setting a matchto the American flag with the other , the editor announces , “ Goodwork !
That oughta do wonders for troop morale ! ”
Beside hisdesk , a filing cabinet bears the labels “ lies , ” “ lies , ” and “ morelies ; ” and from the window the Statue of Liberty looks in , aghast , a tear rolling down her cheek .
In the bottom right corner , in oneof those post - punchline kickers familiar from the work of TomToles , Pat Oliphant and about a zillion other cartoonists , we see" Kelly ” himself , a cranky , world - weary artist at his draftingtable , bitterly noting , “ Now they hate our doctors , too . ”
The archness of the details in that one may tip off readers thatthere ’s something more going on here than simple Mallard Fillmore - esque right - wing cartooning .
But it ’s not always soeasy to tell .
This takedown of Gitmo hunger - strike hysteria could easily be conveying astraightforward message by a politically engaged cartoonist .
Thisswipe at the Iraq Study Group contains eerie similarities to a HenryPayne cartoon on the same topic , except that the Payne panel ismeant to be taken at face value .
A two - framesatire of Al Gore ’s Oscar nomination is just too weird to beexplained as a simple satire of cartoon hackwork .
But then there ’sthissearing indictment of the infotainment culture , with its lazylist of recent terrible news items ( “ e. coli deaths , schoolshootings , violent riots over Danish cartoons , Russian slayings ” ) ?
It ’s more of a description than a critique , an exact catalog ofed - cartoon banalities .
The deadpan discipline of the Kelly cartoons is so tight that evenin The Onion , which has spent more than a decade lampooning the banalities of the American newspaper , the parody isn’tinstantly recognizable .
I had to read these cartoons for severalweeks before I figured out the joke .
( The Post paneldescribed above was my tip - off . )
Other readers have experiencedsimilar confusion .
“ People have written in with really thoughtfulcritiques about why The Onion needs to fire this guy , ” saysSutton , who also draws the popular Sutton Impact editorialcartoons and neither promotes nor conceals his identity as thecreator of “ Kelly ” and his unhinged panels .
“ People ask why a paperas good as The Onion would bother to print some rabidright - wing cartoonist . ”
A more apt question might be whether it ’s possible to parodyeditorial cartoons at all .
Parody is interesting because it ’s bothan encyclopedia of and a comment on whatever genre it treats .
Withthe movie Galaxy Quest you get everything you ’d want out ofa Star Trek episode plus a critique of Star Trek .
The Sopranos was conceived as a goof on mafia pictures , a " live - action version of The Simpsons , ” in its creator ’sdescription ; but it was immediately accepted by audiences as just anewer and better mafia show .
Don Quixote , the most famoussatire of all , outlived the genre of chivalrous romances it wasmaking fun of and now appears to modern readers as a specimen ofthe very books it parodied .
But with editorial cartoons , the rules of the medium long agopassed the point of unintentional burlesque .
If some famous persondies in the morning , the cartoonists will have him or her characteristicallyentering into heaven by noon .
If there ’s war or pestilence inthe news section , skulls and grimreapers will be found in the Opinion pages .
At times ofnational shame , you can bet Uncle Sam or Lady Liberty or GeorgeWashington will be shedding a tear .
And just as a reminder thatthe limits of the human imagination can be pretty limited indeed , do n’t forget the call - outs explaining that this or that element ofthe panel is supposed to represent “ higher taxes ” or “ Senateinvestigation ” or “ predatorylenders ” done in by “ subprime mortgages . ”
“ I ’ve always been a fan of good cartoons , ” says Sutton , “ but I ’vealso been a fan of bad cartoons .
When we were thinking of doing acartoon for The Onion , we did n’t just want it to be a simpleparody of right - wing cartoonists .
I knew lots of ways to make a badpolitical cartoon , but I decided the linchpin would be the personaof the cartoonist , that it would jump off from his point ofview . ”
Which is another way of saying that the fictional cartoonist Kellyis not only a political extremist full of receivedideas but a maniac whose ideas frequently make no sense at all .
Why is Kelly , an apparent cultural conservative , cheering on the OJbook or drawing the most bizarre possible conclusion from thepope ’s visitto Turkey ?
Why does he reverse genre conventions by puttingdeceased Republican James Brown in hell ?
Sutton is n’t explaining , so apparently only Kelly himself knows thetruth .
Interview For years the Adobe Photoshop team has been trying to get away from the traditional death march to a more agile development style .
For its CS3 release , it made the jump , with the help of VP Dave Story .
The result ?
More weekends off , and a third fewer bugs to fix .
Mary Branscombe quizzed co-architect Russell Williams on how they did it .
If it 's such a good idea , why did it take so long – and how did you manage to change this time ?
We had been trying to make the change for a couple of versions but had n't really been able to make it stick .
Nobody on the team had experience using an incremental development process , and we kept sliding back into our old ways because of our own habits and pressures from other groups at Adobe who wanted to see an early " feature complete " milestone .
We 'd always successfully delivered using the old method , so when things got difficult , we 'd revert to things we knew would work .
The difference Dave Story [ Adobe 's vice president of Digital Imaging Product Development – Ed ] made was he had successfully managed incremental development before at SGI and Intuit , and he had the commitment and experience to work through objections - from within or without .
And what actually changed about the way you 're developing CS3 ?
The change we made was going from a traditional waterfall method to an incremental development model .
Before , we would specify features up front , work on features until a " feature complete " date , and then ( supposedly ) revise the features based on alpha and beta testing and fix bugs .
But we were scrambling so hard to get all the committed features in by the feature complete date - working nights and weekends up to the deadline - that the program was always very buggy at that point .
We'd be desperately finding and fixing bugs , with little time to revise features based on tester feedback .
At the end of every cycle , we faced a huge " bugalanch " that required us to work many nights and weekends again .
Of the three variables : features , schedule , and quality , the company sets the schedule and it's only slightly negotiable .
Until feature complete , we could adjust the feature knob .
But when we hit that milestone , quality sucked and we had only a fixed amount of time until the end .
From there to the end , cutting features was not an option and all we could do was trade off our quality of life to get the quality of the product to the level we wanted by the ship date .
We 've never sacrificed product quality to get the product out the door , but we 've sacrificed our home lives .
We could n't cut features to meet the schedule because by the time we realize we 're in trouble , the features have been integrated and now have interactions with other features , and trying to pull them out would introduce more bugs .
Probably the most effective thing we did was institute per-engineer bug limits : if any engineer 's bug count passes 20 , they have to stop working on features and fix bugs instead .
The basic idea is that we keep the bug count low as we go so that we can send out usable versions to alpha testers earlier in the cycle and we do n't have the bugalanch at the end .
The goal is to always have the product in a state where we could say " pencils down .
You have x weeks to fix the remaining bugs and ship it " .
The milestones are primarily measurement points , with the acceptance metric being quality instead of something like " all features in " or " UI Frozen " .
We can keep adding or refining features until later in the cycle , and we can cut features if things are running behind ( OK , when things are running behind ) .
Features are developed in separate , private copies of the source , and only merged into the main product when QE [ Quality Engineering - Ed ] has signed off on the quality level .
Since each of those " sandboxes " has only one major feature under development at a time that differs from the main copy of the source , it 's practical to send copies of the sandbox version out to testers to test that specific feature -- the rest of the program is n't too buggy to use .
So the new feature gets reasonably tested and refined before being put into the main copy of the source .
That keeps the main code base from becoming a mess of buggy and incomplete new features .
Making life easier for the developers matters – but has it been good for the code too ?
The quality of the program was higher throughout the development cycle , and there have been fewer total bugs .
Instead of the bug count climbing towards a ( frighteningly high ) peak at " feature complete " , it stayed at a much lower plateau throughout development .
And we were able to incorporate more feedback from outside testers because we did n't switch into " frantic bug fix mode " so early .
Did it change the way you put out betas ?
An automatic process builds the program every night and runs a set of tests before posting the build on our internal servers for QE to test .
We could take almost any of those daily builds and use them for demos .
The public beta was basically just " whatever build is ready on date X " .
There were only a couple of " we really gotta fix this before we send out the public beta " bugs .
With past versions , we could n't have done a public beta at all that far ahead of release - there would have been far too many bugs .
We were n't swamped with a pile of bugs from the hundreds of thousands of people who downloaded - it really was in the good shape we thought it was .
With several hundred thousand downloads , there were fewer than 25 new bugs found .
Overall , did you end up with fewer bugs , more bugs , the same number of bugs fixed faster ?
Did you have to sacrifice features to work this way ?
Some people feared this would mean fewer features .
That has n't been the case .
We certainly had far fewer bugs overall and fewer during mid-cycle ( about a third less in total last time I checked ) .
Better quality , plenty of features , fewer nights and weekends : what 's not to like ? ®
A Palo Alto company will announce today that it will spend about $ 100 million to build the world 's largest solar cell factory and that it will locate its new plant in the Bay Area .
Martin Roscheisen , chief executive of Nanosolar Inc. , said Tuesday that his firm is considering sites in San Jose and San Francisco that would be close to its current pilot plant in Palo Alto , where it uses an unconventional material as the basis for its solar cells .
Assuming that it stays on track , by 2007 , Nanosolar 's new factory will produce 200 million solar cells a year that will generate more electricity than the output of a plant in Japan run by Sharp , considered today 's world leader in solar power .
Solar cells absorb photons from sunlight and convert these into electrons to generate electricity .
More than 90 percent of all solar cells use silicon to transform light into electricity .
Ed Beardsworth , an independent energy technology consultant in Palo Alto , said shortages of silicon -- the prime ingredient in solar cells and computer chips -- are opening the market for alternative materials .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Nanosolar is one of several companies that use a blend of metals that includes copper and gallium .
" The question is whether these new companies like Nanosolar can live up to their own expectations , " Beardsworth said .
Joel Makower , a consultant with Clean Edge , a research firm that follows renewable energy , said firms such as Miasolé in San Jose and DayStar Technologies in New York state are also racing to mass - produce solar cells that use materials other than silicon .
" It 's a wide - open field , " he said .
Roscheisen said Nanosolar will make its new solar cells through a process much like printing .
The base of the solar cell will be a metal foil bathed in a solution containing tiny particles of the light - capturing metals .
The liquid will evaporate and leave behind this photovoltaic material .
A thin , transparent film will be baked over the cell .
Currently , the process prints onto a metal foil 4 inches wide , but Roscheisen said this could be extended up to 72 inches .
To build its new plant , Nanosolar raised $ 75 million from European and U.S. investors including Jeff Skoll , the former eBay executive who also backed " An Inconvenient Truth , " former Vice President Al Gore 's movie on global warming .
Roscheisen said $ 15 million in government subsidies would be part of the factory financing package , but he declined to identify those subsidies .
He said a final decision on the factory site would be made soon .
Dave Pearce , chief executive of Miasolé , said his firm uses a slightly different approach at a plant in Santa Clara that is supposed to expand from making pilot batches " to reasonably high - volume production " later this year .
“ We stand on the threshold of a new era , ” he said .
“ We wish to take both sides into consideration in a new general framework that will accept environmental concerns as being as important as other concerns . ”

Credit ... Dean C. K. Cox for The New York Times
Sigurdur Arnalds , a spokesman for Landsvirkjun , the national power company , which is developing the Karahnjukar project , said : “ Democracy will have the final say .
Naturally , we will not build up every possibility we have ; we have to stop someplace . ”
Iceland is a prosperous country , but its prosperity is concentrated in Reykjavik .
The government has long sought ways to bolster the economy by exploiting the country ’s second - biggest natural resource , after fish : electric power , derived from a vast network of rivers and from underground geothermal fields .
But since the power cannot feasibly be exported , the idea has been to import demand .
Aluminum seems a perfect fit .
It is a power - intensive industry that needs easy access to ports for importing raw materials and exporting the finished product .
Iceland has clean , available power , abundant coasts and proximity to the lucrative European market .
Iceland ’s first aluminum plant was built in the 1960s ; there are now two , both near Reykjavik .
“ The government has done everything in its power to make way for these plants , ” Kolbrun Halldorsdottir , a member of Parliament from the Left - Green Movement , said .
“ They have been fixed to this scheme like Saudi Arabia is fixed to oil .
They do n’t believe in entrepreneurship , job opportunities in our culture , tourism .
They only believe in aluminum . ”
The Karahnjukar project , years in planning , had the support of the center - right coalition government , which has been in power for 12 years .
In opinion polls , the majority of Icelanders have consistently supported it , too , saying it would bring jobs and money to the eastern fjords .
But environmentalists say the project will devastate some 3 percent of Iceland ’s land mass , destroying or affecting 60 waterfalls ; causing widespread soil erosion that will send sand and dust blowing across the highlands and onto farms ; and flooding an area covered in unusual moss and used by reindeer , nesting pink - footed geese and myriad birds , like the gyrfalcon and the ptarmigan .
Peter Schrank
AS EVERY actor knows , it is easy to be typecast .
The role assigned to Europe for the past decade has been that of sclerotic under - achiever : a slow - growing , work - shy and ageing continent that is destined to be left behind by the United States , China and India .
Unnoticed by the audience , Europe , under new political leadership first in Germany and Italy and now in France and Britain , has changed the plot .
Since the end of 2006 euro - area GDP has outpaced America's : in 2007 , it should grow by 2.7 % , ahead of both America and Japan .
The euro is at new highs against the dollar and the yen .
Unemployment has fallen to 7 % , the lowest since the euro started life in 1999 .
The transformation has been most remarkable in Germany , the biggest European economy , once tarred as “ the sick man of Europe ” .
From 1995 to 2005 German GDP grew at an average of only 1.4 % a year .
But in the first quarter of 2007 it expanded more than twice as fast , despite a large rise in value - added tax .
The 2004 reforms in labour markets and welfare made by the previous government under Gerhard Schröder are bearing fruit .
On international definitions , unemployment is down to 6.4 % , not much above the level in Britain .
German business is doing spectacularly well : the country is again the world 's biggest exporter , profits are at a record , competitiveness has improved sharply ( see article ) .
Where Germany leads , the rest of Europe follows .
In truth the picture of an entire continent in a slump was always distorted .
Several countries in Europe have been doing well for some years .
Britain and Spain have grown consistently .
Ireland has produced the nearest thing to an economic miracle outside Asia ; smaller east European economies are seeking to emulate it .
Scandinavia boasts three countries that top most league tables for competitiveness .
The truly troubled economies of Europe were always the core euro - area ones : Germany , France and Italy .
Now that Germany has picked up speed , the other two are improving too .
The new French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , is promising to boost growth .
Some Europeans may be tempted to conclude that their economic problems are behind them , their structural faults have been put right — and there is no need for more painful reforms .
The turn of the cycle
Such a conclusion would be wrong on pretty much every count .
Yes , there have been structural improvements in the core euro area , especially Germany .
But much of the recovery is really cyclical .
When the global economy is registering a fourth successive year of near - 5 % growth , it would be surprising if the world 's biggest exporter did not benefit ; indeed , growth of 3 % seems rather modest .
Moreover , much of Germany 's renewed vigour reflects stringent control of real wages , which has secured a fall in unit labour costs when they have been rising elsewhere .
Yet merely squeezing pay to gain competitiveness is not a long - term solution .
The gain also comes at the expense of other euro - area countries , such as France , Italy and Spain .
This creates tensions of its own , much on display this week when the hyperactive Mr Sarkozy dropped in to a meeting of euro - area finance ministers in Brussels .
He announced that France might again flout the euro - area stability pact 's restrictions on budget deficits , and repeated his previous complaints about the strength of the euro and the tight monetary policy of the European Central Bank .
He ran into a stony hostility , notably from the Dutch but also from the Germans ( see article ) .
The French president has similarly been to the fore in attacking European Union competition rules and talking up the causes of industrial policy and economic patriotism .
A myth , Mr Sarkozy , and you know it
The charitable explanation for this nonsense is that laying into Brussels is a way of diverting French voters from the genuine ( and long overdue ) reforms Mr Sarkozy is planning for the labour market , welfare and taxation .
But his agenda seems also to be driven by a common belief in France ( and in other parts of Europe ) that the euro 's macroeconomic management and the obsession in Brussels with pursuing pro-competitive reforms are to blame for the region 's economic ills .
This is to get things entirely backwards .
As is obvious from the divergent performance of individual countries , the euro area 's troubles are not macroeconomic in nature .
Rather they are microeconomic , reflecting the failure of several countries to reform rigid labour markets and overly regulated product markets .
These countries have been suffering not from too much competition , but from too little : for too long , too many of their workers and producers have been sheltered from competition , fostering high costs and inefficiency .
Nor will partial reforms of the kind so far carried out be sufficient .
This can best be seen in the labour market in Germany , which ( like Italy 's ) has been only partly freed up .
The result has been not just a welcome explosion of temporary and part - time jobs , but , more insidiously , the entrenchment of a two - tier labour market .
Insiders have permanent , protected contracts ; outsiders have short - term , unprotected ones .
This will fuel resentment among outsiders ( often the young or immigrants ) .
It also threatens to introduce new rigidities into the wage - bargaining process , because insiders may feel sufficiently insulated to demand higher pay in the knowledge that any resultant job losses will fall on outsiders .
The unpalatable truth remains that Europe 's economies need substantial further reform if they are to prosper in an ever more competitive , globalised environment .
And the recent upturn may make it harder for political leaders to get their voters to understand this .
European countries that have introduced radical reforms have usually done so in times of serious economic crisis : Britain in 1979 , the Netherlands in 1982 , Ireland in 1987 , Denmark , Finland and Sweden in the early 1990s .
Yet as all these countries found , it is easier to change when times are good , not when they are bad .
That is a lesson that Germans , French , Italians and other Europeans should ponder as they bask in today 's sunshine .
We 're not sure what 's worse ; the Zune guy getting three Zune tattoos , or this painful - as - hell Microsoft blue screen of death ( BSOD ) tattoo up this guy 's entire right arm .
We 're guessing this guy is a Windows fan , because nobody hates Windows THAT MUCH to endure hours of pain just for the constant reminder that Windows occasionally crashes when you install the wrong driver .

I 'm currently re-reading the book About Face .
I had n't revisited this book since I bought the original version way back in 1995 .
The update , which was published in 2003 , is a significant overhaul – and frankly much better than the original .
Adding the second author , Robert Reimann , was a smart move .
Alan Cooper is a usability legend , but he can be bombastic and overbearing at times .
Having another viewpoint in the book helps moderate and refine the message .
( Since this was written , About Face 3.0 was released , with yet another author added to the mix . )
One part of About Face that I found particularly compelling was the section on considerate software :
Considerate software takes an interest
To the programmer writing the program , it 's a just - in - time information world , so when the program needs some tidbit of information , it demands that the user provide it .
The program then discards that tidbit , assuming it can merely ask for it again if necessary .
Not only is the program better suited to remembering than the human , the program is also inconsiderate when , acting as a supposedly helpful tool , it forgets .
Considerate software is deferential Inconsiderate software supervises and passes judgment on human actions .
Software is within its rights to express its opinion that we are making a mistake , but it is being presumptuous when it judges our actions .
Software can suggest that we not not Submit our entry until we 've typed in our telephone number .
It should also explain the consequences , but if we wish to Submit without the number , we expect the software to do as it is told .
Considerate software is forthcoming
Most software does n't attempt to provide related information .
Instead , it narrowly answers the precise question we ask it , and it is not forthcoming about other information even if it is clearly related to our goals .
When we tell our word processor to print a document , it does n't tell us when the paper is low , or when forty other documents are queued up in front of us , or when another nearby printer is free .
A helpful human would .
Considerate software uses common sense
You can easily find menus offering simple , harmless functions adjacent to irreversible ejector - seat - lever expert functions .
It 's like seating you at a dining table right next to an open grill .
Horror stories abound of customers offended by computer systems that repeatedly sent them checks for $ 0.00 or bills for $ 957,142,039.58 .
One would think that the system might alert a human in the accounts receivable or payable departments when an event like this happens .
Considerate software anticipates needs A web browser spends most of its time idling while we peruse web pages .
It could easily anticipate needs and prepare for them while we are reading .
It could use that idle time to preload all the visible links .
Chances are good that we will soon ask the browser to examine one or more of those links .
It is easy to abort an unwanted request , but it is always time - consuming to wait for a request to be filled .
Considerate software is conscientious
If we rely on a word processor to draft a new MicroBlitz Contract and then try to [ save it in the same folder as an existing , but older , MicroBlitz Contract ] , the program offers the choice of either overwriting and destroying the old contract or not saving it at all .
The program not only is n't as capable as [ a human assistant who saw the name conflict and appropriately renamed the contracts ] , it is n't even as capable as [ a human assistant who put the two contracts in the same folder ] .
It is stupider than a complete idiot .
The software is dumb enough to make an assumption that because they have the same name , I meant to throw the old one away .
Considerate software does n't burden you with its personal problems Software whines at us with error messages , interrupts us with confirmation dialog boxes , and brags to us with unnecessary notifications .
We are n't interested in the program 's crisis of confidence about whether or not to purge its recycle bin .
We do n't want to hear its whining about not being sure where to put a file on disk .
We do n't need to see information about the computer 's data transfer rates and its loading sequence , any more than we need information about the customer service agent 's unhappy love affair .
Considerate software keeps you informed
We do n't want our local bartender to grouse about his recent divorce , but we appreciate it when he posts his prices in plain sight and when he writes what time the pregame party begins on his chalkboard , along with who 's playing and the current Vegas spread .
Nobody is interrupting us to tell us this information : it 's there in plain sight whenever we need it .
Considerate software is perceptive Software should watch our preferences and remember them without being explicitly asked to do so .
If we always maximize an application to use the entire screen , the application should get the idea after a few sessions and always launch in that configuration .
The same goes for placement of palettes , default tools , frequently used templates , and other useful settings .
Considerate software is self - confident
Are you sure ?
Are you really sure ?
Are you really , really sure ?
Considerate software does n't ask a lot of questions Choices can be offered in different ways .
They can be offered in the way that we window shop .
We peer in the window at our leisure , considering , choosing , or ignoring the goods offered to us -- no questions asked .
Alternatively , questions can be forced on us like an interrogation by a customs official at a border crossing : " Do you have anything to declare ? "
Software should never put users through this kind of intimidation .
Considerate software takes responsibility Most programs are filled with data and settings .
When they crash , that information is normally discarded ; the user is left holding the bag .
Let 's say you are downloading your email from a server , when your email program runs out of memory at some procedure buried deep in the internals of the program .
The program , like most desktop software , issues a message that says , in effect , " You are completely hosed , " and terminates immediately after you click OK .
You restart the program , or sometimes the whole computer , only to find that the program lost your email and , when you interrogate the server , you find that it has also erased your mail because the mail was already handed over to your program .
This is not what we should expect of good software .
The academy aims to be a Kinsey - type institute in Europe
Visitors to Amora - The Academy of Sex and Relationships at the Trocadero in Piccadilly , will pass through seven zones including Pleasure and Orgasm .
The 10,500sq - ft exhibit is designed to " separate fact from myth and educate everyone into being better lovers " .
You have to be aged 18 and over to get in and tickets will cost £ 15 for the attraction which opens on 7 September .
Organisers expect to attract more than 600,000 visitors within the first year .
The more sex we have the more we want and the less sex we have the more we want
Academy director Dr Sarah Brewer
The theme park will include life - sized silicone - made models which visitors can touch to discover erogenous zones .
People will also be able to build their ideal partner from a series of body parts and there will be instructions on how best to kiss and how to talk more sexily .
The seven zones will start with attraction , love and relationships and include a sexual well - being zone which looks at the dangers of unsafe sex .
The academy 's director of exhibits Dr Sarah Brewer said : " The more sex we have the more we want and the less sex we have the more we want .
" This academy does push boundaries back and whatever your prowess when you come in we will give you all the information you need to become a fantastic lover . "
The gene that likely makes people left - handed mayslightly raise the risk of developing psychotic mental illnesses , according to an internationalstudy .
Led by the Wellcome Trust for Human Geneticsat the Universityof Oxford , the studyinvolves a team of 40 scientists from 20 research centres across the world , and was published online Tuesday in the scientific journal Molecular Psychiatry .
" This is the first potential genetic influence on human handedness to be identified , and the first putative genetic effect on variability in human brain asymmetry , " said an abstract onthe study .
The scientists said that little is known about the geneLRRTM1 , but they suspect that it modifies symmetry in the human brain .
Asymmetry is important , since the left side of the brain usually controls speech and language and the right side controls emotion .
With left - handers this pattern is often reversed .
The researchers suspect that the same gene might slightly increase the risk of developing schizophrenia — a disorder of the brainthat often results in impaired perception and thought that affects roughly one per cent of adults worldwide .
Like left - handers , people with schizophrenia also often have unusual patterns of brain asymmetry .
Thestudy leader , Dr. Clyde Francks , said in a statement , " People really should not be concerned by this result .
There are many factors which make individuals more likely to develop schizophrenia and the vast majority of left - handers will never develop a problem .
We do n’t yet know the precise role of this gene . "
Some of the study 's researchers plan to further investigate the roles of LRRTM1 in the developing brain , and to find other genes with whichit interacts .
" We hope this study ’s findings will help us to understand the development of asymmetry in the brain .
Asymmetry is a fundamental feature of the human brain that is disrupted in many psychiatric conditions , " added Dr. Francks .
Roughly10 per cent of peopleare left - handed .
Last year , Australian researchers suggested that left - handers can thinkmore quicklywhen it comes to tasks such as playing computer games or playing sports .
The Codex Gigas , also known as the Devil 's Bible , is the biggest book in the world .
Made at the start of the 13th century in a Bohemian monastery , it was one of the country 's most prized works of art .
In medieval times , its uniqueness was even put on a par with the wonders of the world .
But at the end of the Thirty Years '
War , it was taken by the Swedes and has been Swedish property since then .
The National Library in Prague has now been allowed to borrow it for an exhibition that opens later this year .
Devil 's Bible , photo : CTK
Historians believe that the gigantic book , which has to be carried by two people , was most probably made in 1229 in a small Benedictine monastery in the town of Podlazice .
Although the first mention of the book dates to 1295 , the writing is thought to be about 65 years older .
Its format - font and script - are uniform and it is believed to be the life work of one person , for whom it must have taken some 20 years to write .
Zdenek Uhlir is from the National Library in Prague :

Why , how and by whom the Devil 's Bible was made has remained a mystery until this day .
But legend has it that the book was written by a monk , who faced being walled up alive for breaching a monastic code , and promised to create the biggest manuscript in the world in just one night in return for being spared from punishment .
But when he realised that he would not be able to deliver on his promise , he asked the devil for help and his prayer was answered .
The devil , to which the monk sold his soul , is depicted in the Penitential - a chapter that takes the form of a handbook for priests , listing various sins and the corresponding forms of repentance .
Devil 's Bible
It is estimated that skin from some 160 donkeys had to be used to provide sufficient writing material for the book .
Written in Latin , it also includes mystical medical formulae to treat epilepsy and fever but also solve unusual problems like finding a thief , for example .
One of the most valuable chapters is the Chronica Bohemorum - a copy of the Bohemian Chronicle , drawn up from 1045 to 1125 , that is considered one of the oldest and best transcripts of the Chronicle .
The very end of the codex includes a list of the days on which Easter falls in the coming years .
The Devil 's Bible will be exhibited at Prague 's Klementinum Gallery from September 20th to January 6th next year .
Besides the book , the exhibition will also have detailed descriptions of some of its chapters and a travelogue of the bible 's journey from the little monastery in east Bohemia to Sweden 's National Library .
Is The U.S. Education System Flawed ?
June 21 , 2007
Posted by Bryan Povlinski in Education
I ’m still in the middle of reading Thomas Friedman ’s excellent book The World is Flat , and one of the chapters poses an interesting question :
How does America ’s education system compare with the rest of the world ?
First of all , the US has a drastically different system than most other countries .
Most developed nations have a national education system in which all schools follow the same curriculum , and it is tweaked to meet national ambitions .
The US has a system in which each district can essentially choose its own unique course , and it may or may not be consistent with the majority of the country .
This system has its benefits because it allows for some flexibility and creativity , but in the end , it is essentially set up as if the US is not competing with the rest of the world .
Most other countries define their education system based on what they ’d like to accomplish as a nation which gives them a sense of purpose and ambition .
This structured system has led , in large part , to the growth many countries are currently experiencing and will undeniably lead to continued growth in the future .
Now in theory , the US system should work just fine and would not leave the US at a disadvantage in terms of competitive analysis , however , the key ingredients that have led to a higher level school system in foreign countries are ambition and expectations .
In his book , Friedman recounts the experience of a 5th grade teacher who had parents of an Indian child come in and ask that their child receive more homework and more challenging assignments .
An Eastern European couple demanded that their son be given a science textbook , and that the small science binder he was given was not sufficient for his educational development .
On the other hand , many American parents came in to complain that the workload was just too much on their children , and there was no way they could complete it with the other activities they participated in .
This is what separates the educational system in the US with those of other countries .
The other kids simply care more and have a passion for learning .
American kids would much rather play video games and watch TV .
Foreign students face steep expectations where straight A’s are often the norm , whereas in America many kids are rewarded for bringing home C’s .
I do n’t think the blame lies in any one of the teachers , parents , or students , but society as a whole is the primary cause for our lacking education .
Maybe someday school in the US will become “ cool ” again , but until then we are just opening the door for any other country to surpass our standard of living .

Boy did this bitch get out on the wrong side of the bed this morning .
This photo is so intense , so aggressive and fierce looking you can almost hear the snarling from the charging dog .
Does this photo even need a caption ?
No it does n't .
Clearly a fun day out for the whole family !
An amazing shot with amazing colors .
It feels like I ’m being sucked right into the tide , yet at the same time you get a great sense of calm looking at the photo .
This is the kind of ride that could end up on Pimp My Ride – I can see it clearly : spinning chrome rims , custom flame paint job , velour interior , Momo racing seats , and to top it off – low rider hydraulic suspension ... ( as if it is n’t close enough to the ground already ) I amtempted to Photoshop a speech bubble saying " ooooh shit man !
" This photo of a sixteenth century mosque really captures the beauty of time , architecture and nature .
As one of the comments said , with another shot metered for the birds it could 've made an amazing HDR composition .
This black and white shot is so vivid with its rough and crude style you can almost taste the mud and hear the engine roar .
Awesome and interesting shot of a water balloon being popped .
I ’ve never seen a planet blow up , but this is how I imagine it would look .
With that “ booming ” light coming out between the clouds , you almost get a feeling these camels are stampeding to get away from the Armageddon which has just opened for business in the distance .
Owning a 15 foot speedboat with 90hp , I am such a sucker for anything that ’s fast and floats .
There ’sthat feels faster than racing at 60 knots with your head just a few feet above the water surface .
I have no idea about the story behind this image , but it definitely conveys speed , intensity and action at a very basic level .
Studying the facial expression of the kids reveals emotions ranging from pure joy to extreme focus .
With a goofy smile and a hairdo like that , you ’re bound to attract a lot of attention !
Immensely powerful and thoroughly beautiful , you do n’t have to be a horse - crazed teenage girl to fall in love with this fantabulous photo !
This photo perfectly freezes the moment between the breaking of the bulb and the tungsten filaments ( thereby breaking the source of light ) , it ’s a sort of limbo captured .
The splashing mud , the arching back of the man about to fall , and their intense ( and quite similar ) facial expressions makes for an intense photo with a good feeling of action .
Cookwashed motorbike ?
It must be Gulliver going for a ride on a borrowed bike in Lilliput .
Did I hear someone say " size matters " ?
When you get past saying “ Wow … ” you may start thinking about how in the world the photographer managed to make this photo .
What do you have to do to get the combination of that looong arch of water coupled with the glass standing at an almost perfect 45 degree angle ?
I could imagine that the photographer just had someone throw heaps of water - filled drinking glasses across a table and hoping for one of them to hit just the right spot in the right way , but I suspect the truth is much more complex .
Yikes , you startled me !
Zorro the Delivery Guy ??
I ’m not quite sure what the idea behind this photo is as it looks like a cross between Superman , Zorro and Einstein rushing to serve a pie .
Or maybe he ’s charging someone with the fork ?
Perhapsis what the eminent Albert Einstein meant when he coined the phrase " Imagination is more important than knowledge ” .
Racing is a damn hard sport , and the drivers will no doubt face stiff competition from this driver ...

There is no right to healthcare
The United States was founded with the declaration that all men have the right to “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
The Founders recognized that all men have a moral right to be free from the coercion of others , as long as they allow others the same freedom .
They believed that rights do not impose a positive obligation on others , but only the negative obligation to restrain from the initiation of force .
The claim that there is a “ right to healthcare ” violates the principle of individual rights because it requires that the liberty of doctors and the property of taxpayers be violated to provide for others .
The myth of “ free ” healthcare
It is a common belief that when government provides something , it is free or cheap .
But politicians cannot create wealth – they can only redistribute it .
Money for all government spending comes from business – whether by entrepreneurial investment , the wages of patients , or taxes .
Whether by price controls of outright nationalization , when governments make prices artificially low , demand skyrockets , and shortages result .
Politicians respond by passing ever more regulations to control costs .
These regulations stifle innovation , drive up costs , and force healthcare providers out of business .
The end result is to replace capitalism , the greatest wealth - generating system known to man , with an onerous system of central planning .
Capitalism cannot guarantee that all our medical needs will be provided for – no system can do that .
But it does give entrepreneurs the incentive to compete to provide the best possible service they can .
Centralized socialized systems have no incentive to improve service or to try bold new techniques .
Politicians can force prices to be artificially low , but they cannot lower costs – they can only drive doctors , hospitals , and drug companies out of business .
The victims of “ universal ” healthcare
The waiting time for treatment in Canada varies from 14 to 30 weeks .
Waiting lists for diagnostic procedures range from two to 24 weeks .
Some patients die while waiting for treatment .
To stop sick people from circumventing the “ free ” system , the government of British Columbia enacted Bill 82 in 2003 , which makes it illegal to pay for private surgery .
Patients waiting for critical procedures are now forced to seek procedures in the U.S. and doctors are abandoning Canada in droves .
Cleveland , Ohio is now Canada ’s hip - replacement center .
Ontario is turning nurses into doctors to replace some of the 10,000 doctors who left Canada in the 1990’s .
1 2
What will patients do when it is illegal to seek private medical treatment in the U.S. ?
Politicians are already working towards that goal .
State and federal regulation impose onerous regulations which forbid insurance companies from offering services such as basic coverage for emergencies by requiring coverage of many types of procedures .
Medicare forces doctors to follow 130,000 pages of regulations .
Critics often attack the “ capitalist ” nature of American health care system .
The reality is that the government now pays for 50 % of health care , and closely regulates the rest .
Healthcare is only affordable under capitalism
If a society is not wealthy enough to afford healthcare , health socialism will not make it richer .
Cuba , a poster child of socialist healthcare schemes , spends $ 229 on healthcare per person each year , while the U.S. spends $ 6,096.3
Premium services are available only to paying foreigners , while natives must bribe doctors for timely treatment and bring their own towels , bed sheets , soap , food , and even sutures .
4
A government can decide to replace individual choice with state - mandated decisions of what goods and services are more important for the “ common good . ”
But it can only spend on one area at the expense of another .
If Cubans are not totally deprived of medical treatment , it can only be at the expense of all other goods .
A doctor ’s salary in Cuba is 1.5 times the median at $ 15 - 20 per month .
5
A telling sign of their deprivation is the Cuban suicide rate , which is the highest in Latin America and among the highest in world .
Cubans in Miami on the other hand , kill themselves less often than other Miamians .
6
When they risk their lives in leaky boats to escape to the U.S. , the right to make their own decisions regarding their health is among the freedoms they hope to gain .

Mr Fernandez said failure in Iraq would be a regional disaster
Alberto Fernandez made the remarks during an interview with Arabic television station al - Jazeera .
The state department says Mr Fernandez was quoted incorrectly - but BBC Arabic language experts say Mr Fernandez did indeed use the words .
It comes after President George W Bush discussed changing tactics with top US commanders to try to combat the unrest .
Mr Fernandez , an Arabic speaker who is director of public diplomacy in the state department 's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs , told Qatar - based al - Jazeera that the world was " witnessing failure in Iraq " .
" That 's not the failure of the United States alone , but it is a disaster for the region , " he said .
I think there is great room for strong criticism , because without doubt , there was arrogance and stupidity by the United States in Iraq
Alberto Fernandez
" I think there is great room for strong criticism , because without doubt , there was arrogance and stupidity by the United States in Iraq . "
He also said that the US was now willing to speak to any insurgent group except al - Qaeda in an effort to reduce sectarian bloodshed in Iraq .
" We are open to dialogue because we all know that , at the end of the day , the solution to the hell and the killings in Iraq is linked to an effective Iraqi national reconciliation . "
Winds of change ?
However , state department spokesman Sean McCormack said : " What he [ Alberto Fernandez ] says is that it is not an accurate quote . "
Mr McCormack also denied that the US had been guilty of arrogance or stupidity saying that history would be the judge of US actions in Iraq .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The coalition should stay in Iraq .

Mr Fernandez 's comments came after Mr Bush said that US troops were changing tactics to deal with the insurgency in Iraq .
Mr Bush held a video conference on the new measures with top US military commanders in Iraq on Saturday against the backdrop of more US losses in Iraq - 78 so far this month .
Mr Bush held talks on the violence with his military commanders
A new poll suggests two - thirds of Americans believe the US is losing the war in Iraq , a proportion which analysts says could translate into a drubbing at the polls for Mr Bush 's Republican Party in next month 's mid-term elections .
The BBC's James Westhead in Washington says that while there is no official change in US strategy , change is on everyone 's lips .
But a report in the New York Times that officials are drawing up a timetable for Iraq 's government to improve security has been denied by both White House and state department officials .
In an interview with the BBC , British Foreign Office Minister Kim Howells has suggested that the Iraqi security forces could take over much of the work of US - led forces within a year .
On Sunday funerals were taking place for 17 people killed in a mortar attack on a market near the capital , Baghdad .
Journey For Humanity and Accountability - Day 5
Today our Journey took us to Ft. Benning , Ga , where the cancer of the School of Americas ( WINSEC ) is housed .
I have written on torture before and I believe that BushCo's policy of imprisoning people without their basic due process and torturing them is one of the grossest breeches of international and American law and one of the overriding reasons that they should be impeached .
The School of Torture has graduated many egregious violators of human rights like Panamanian drug lord , U.S. CIA employee , and Bush family friend ( until he became an enemy ) , Manuel Noriega .
If there is one issue that should unite Americans it should be against torture .
Incredibly , we still have neighbors in our communities who believe that torture is correct , humane and valuable .
However to say torture is " wrong " is like saying the sky is blue .
Torture is inherently wrong .
Torture is pure evil .
Torture is an abomination .
Torture is disordered and demented .
Torture is sick , sick , sick !
Most significantly the people who are being tortured in such prison camps as Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib were mostly sold to the US Army by bounty hunters and the Northern Aliance .
Criminal charges against the prisoners are as rare as the truth in the Bush Regime .
Most reasonable people would agree that information gleaned from such awfully brutal means ( water - boarding , stress positions , extreme noise and temperatures , sodomy and other sexual humiliation , electrodes on genitalia , etc ) is never reliable .
I can't even fathom the sick , sadistic minds of the Bush Regime who not only have authorized and institutionalized this behavior but also refuse to end it and close the camps that have undermined any moral authority the US may have had .
Torture not only dehumanizes the tortured , but the torturer .
It hurts my heart deeply to think of our young soldiers carrying out such ruthless acts on other humans who for the most part were in the wrong place at the wrong time and do not know where Osama bin Laden is hiding .
Torture only compromises our soldiers ' lives in the field as the US cannot credibly claim any kind of moral high ground if one of our soldiers is tragically captured .
The abomination of Abu Ghraib is one of the reasons that the insurgency began on the day Casey was killed in Sadr City , Baghdad .
I personally know three men who were illegally and wrongly imprisoned in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib who can testify to the fact that , yes , America does torture and does so with extreme , callous and cold - hearted cruelty .
The Geneva Conventions are clear on prohibiting the use of torture and the 8th Amendment to our own Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment .
When torture is official policy , where will it end ?
When George can pick and choose who receives the centuries old right to habeas corpus and who does n't , where will it end ?
Will it end with the " terrorists " in Guantanamo or will it be used here in the USA against those who stand up against tyranny and struggle for our Constitution , freedoms , peace and human rights ?
Torture has tarnished the soul of our nation and Congress has done little to restrain BushCo's Torquemadas and even when a bill is passed restricting the use of torture , George adds a signing statement saying that he is above the law .
BushCo is no better than a crime cabal and they must be Consitutionally controlled .
Apparently impeachment is the only remedy for torture and will go a long way to elevating our country 's standing in the international community and to healing our broken nation .
Impeachment is not an optional menu item that can be set on a table but a Constitutionally mandated requirement ( See section II , Article IV ) .
Put it back on the table , Ms. Pelosi .
We have over a million signatures on petitions demanding that Congress end the misery of our nation and world by impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney .
Action items : Go to : www.impeachbush.org to sign the petition to impeach Bush .
Go to : www.thecampcaseyinstitute.org for more info on our Journey for Humanity and Accountability or to donate to defray our expenses .
Call Nancy Pelosi's office ( 202-225-4965 ) to tell her to green light impeachment .
Join us in our walk from Arlington Cemetery to Congressman John Conyer 's office for a sit-in for impeachment on July 23rd or organize sit-ins in your Congress Rep 's local office .

New Orleans two years after
[ Thurs August 30 ]
“ They wanted them poor niggers out of there and they ain't had no intention to allow it to be reopened to no poor niggers , you know ?
And that 's just the bottom line . ”
It was n't a pretty statement .
But I was n't looking for pretty .
I 'd taken my investigative team to New Orleans to meet with Malik Rahim .
Pretty is n't Malik 's concern .
We needed an answer to a weird , puzzling and horrific discovery .
Among the miles and miles of devastated houses , rubble still there today in New Orleans , we found dry , beautiful homes .
But their residents were told by guys dressed like Ninjas wearing “ Blackwater ” badges : “ Try to go into your home and we 'll arrest you . ”
These are n't just any homes .
They are the public housing projects of the city ; the
Lafitte Houses and others .
But unlike the cinder block monsters in the Bronx , these public units are beautiful townhouses , with wrought - iron porches and gardens right next to the tony French Quarter .
Raised up on high ground , with floors and walls of concrete , they were some of the only houses left salvageable after the Katrina flood .
Yet , two years later , there 's still bars on the windows , the doors are welded shut and the residents banned from returning .
On the first anniversary of the flood , we were filming this odd scene when I saw a woman on the sidewalk , sobbing .
Night was falling .
What was wrong ?
“ They just messing all over us .
Putting me out our own house .
We come to go back to our own home and when we get there they got the police there putting us out .
Oh , no , this is not right .
I 'm coming here from Texas seeing if I can get my house back .
But they said they ain't letting nobody in .
But where we gonna go at ? ”
Idiot me , I asked , “ Where are you going to go tonight ? ”
“ That 's what I want to know , Mister .
Where I 'm going to go – me and my kids ? ”
With the help of Patricia Thomas , a Lafitte resident , we broke into an apartment .
The place was gorgeous .
The cereal boxes still dry .
This was Patricia 's home .
But we decided to get out before we got busted .
I was n't naive .
I had a good idea what this scam was all about : 89,000 poor and working class families stuck in Homeland Security 's trailer park gulag while their good homes were guarded against their return by mercenaries .
Two decades ago , I worked for the Housing Authority of New Orleans .
Even then , the plan was to evict poor folk out of this very valuable real estate .
But it took the cover of a hurricane to do it .
Malik 's organization , Common Ground , would n't wait for permission from the federal and local commissars to help folks return .
They organized takeovers of public housing by the residents .
And , in the face of threats and official displeasure , restored 350 apartments in a destroyed private development on the high ground across the Mississippi in the ward called , “ Algiers . ”
The tenants rebuilt their own homes with their own sweat and their own scraps of cash based on a promise of the landlords to sell Common Ground the property in return for restoring it .
Why , I asked Malik , was there this strange lock - out from public housing ?
Malik shook his dreds .
“ They did n't want to open it up .
They wanted them closed .
They wanted them poor niggers out of there . ”
For Malik , the emphasis is on “ poor . ”
The racial politics of the Deep South is as ugly as it is in Philadelphia , Pa .
But the New Orleans city establishment has no problem with Black folk per se .
After all , Mayor Ray Nagin 's parents are African - American .
It 's the Black survivors without the cash that are a problem .
So where New Orleans once stood , Mayor Nagin , in connivance with a Bush regime more than happy to keep a quarter million poor folk ( i.e. Democrats ) out of this swing state , is creating a new city : a tourist town with a French Quarter , loose - spending drunks , hot - sheets hotels and a few Black people to perform the modern version of minstrel shows .
Malik explained , “ It 's two cities .
You know ?
There 's the city for the white and the rich .
And there 's another city for the poor and Blacks .
You know , the city that 's for the white and rich has recovered .
They had a Jazz Fest .
They had a Mardi Gras .
They 're going to have the Saints playing for those who have recovered .
But for those who have n't recovered , there 's nothing . ”
So where are they now ?
The sobbing woman and her kids are gone : back to Texas , or wherever .
But they will not be allowed back into Lafitte .
Ever .
And Patricia Thomas ?
Patricia found work sweeping up tourists vomit and beer each morning at a French Quarter karioke joint .
Not much pay , no health insurance , of course .
A few months ago , Patricia died – in a city bereft of health care .
New Orleans has closed all its public hospitals but for one “ charity ” make - shift emergency ward in an abandoned department store .
And the one bright star , Malik 's housing project ?
The tenants work was done this past December .
By Christmastime , they received their eviction notices – and all were carried out of their rebuilt homes by marshals right after the New Year , including a paraplegic resident who'd lived in the Algiers building for decades .
Hurricane recovery is class war by other means .
And in this war of the powerful against the powerless , Mr. Bush can rightly land his fighter plane in Louisiana and declare that , unlike the war in Iraq , it is , indeed , “ Mission Accomplished . ”

1993 AFFIDAVIT OF WALTER HAUT
(1) My name is Walter Haut
(2) My address is : XXXXXXXXXX
(3) I am retired .
(4) In July 1947 , I was stationed at the Roswell Army Air base serving as the base Public Information Officer .
At approximately 9:30 AM on July 8 , I received a call from Col. William Blanchard , the base commander , who said he had in his possession a flying saucer or parts thereof .
He said it came from a ranch northwest of Roswell , and that the base Intelligence Officer , Major Jesse Marcel , was going to fly the material to Fort Worth .
(5) Col .
Blanchard told me to write a news release about the operation and to deliver it to both newspapers and the two radio stations in Roswell .
He felt that he wanted the local media to have the first opportunity at the story .
I went first to KGFL , then to KSWS , then to the Daily Record and finally to the Morning Dispatch .
(6) The next day , I read in the newspaper that General Roger Ramey in Fort Worth had said the object was a weather balloon .
(7) I believe Col .
Blanchard saw the material , because he sounded positive about what the material was .
There is no chance that he would have mistaken it for a weather balloon .
Neither is their any chance that Major Marcel would have been mistaken .
(8) In 1980 , Jesse Marcel told me that the material photographed in Gen .
Ramey 's office was not the material he had recovered .
(9 ) I am convinced that the material recovered was some type of craft from outer space .
( 10 ) I have not been paid nor given anything of value to make this statement , and it is the truth to the best of my recollection .

2002 SEALED AFFIDAVIT OF WALTER G. HAUT
DATE : December 26 , 2002
WITNESS : Chris Xxxxxx
NOTARY : Beverlee Morgan
(1) My name is Walter G. Haut
(2) I was born on June 2 , 1922
(3) My address is 1405 W. 7th Street , Roswell , NM 88203
(4) I am retired .
(5) In July , 1947 , I was stationed at the Roswell Army Air Base in Roswell , New Mexico , serving as the base Public Information Officer .
I had spent the 4th of July weekend ( Saturday , the 5th , and Sunday , the 6th ) at my private residence about 10 miles north of the base , which was located south of town .
(6) I was aware that someone had reported the remains of a downed vehicle by midmorning after my return to duty at the base on Monday , July 7 .
I was aware that Major Jesse A. Marcel , head of intelligence , was sent by the base commander , Col. William Blanchard , to investigate .
(7) By late in the afternoon that same day , I would learn that additional civilian reports came in regarding a second site just north of Roswell .
I would spend the better part of the day attending to my regular duties hearing little if anything more .
(8) On Tuesday morning , July 8 , I would attend the regularly scheduled staff meeting at 7:30 a.m. Besides Blanchard , Marcel ; CIC [ Counterintelligence Corp ] Capt .
Sheridan Cavitt ; Col. James I. Hopkins , the operations officer ; Lt. Col. Ulysses S. Nero , the supply officer ; and from Carswell AAF in Fort Worth , Texas , Blanchard 's boss , Brig .
Gen. Roger Ramey and his chief of staff , Col. Thomas J. Dubose were also in attendance .
The main topic of discussion was reported by Marcel and Cavitt regarding an extensive debris field in Lincoln County approx .
75 miles NW of Roswell .
A preliminary briefing was provided by Blanchard about the second site approx .
40 miles north of town .
Samples of wreckage were passed around the table .
It was unlike any material I had or have ever seen in my life .
Pieces which resembled metal foil , paper thin yet extremely strong , and pieces with unusual markings along their length were handled from man to man , each voicing their opinion .
No one was able to identify the crash debris .
(9) One of the main concerns discussed at the meeting was whether we should go public or not with the discovery .
Gen .
Ramey proposed a plan , which I believe originated from his bosses at the Pentagon .
Attention needed to be diverted from the more important site north of town by acknowledging the other location .
Too many civilians were already involved and the press already was informed .
I was not completely informed how this would be accomplished .
( 10 ) At approximately 9:30 a.m. Col .
Blanchard phoned my office and dictated the press release of having in our possession a flying disc , coming from a ranch northwest of Roswell , and Marcel flying the material to higher headquarters .
I was to deliver the news release to radio stations KGFL and KSWS , and newspapers the Daily Record and the Morning Dispatch .
( 11 ) By the time the news release hit the wire services , my office was inundated with phone calls from around the world .
Messages stacked up on my desk , and rather than deal with the media concern , Col Blanchard suggested that I go home and " hide out . "
( 12 ) Before leaving the base , Col. Blanchard took me personally to Building 84 [ AKA Hangar P - 3 ] , a B - 29 hangar located on the east side of the tarmac .
Upon first approaching the building , I observed that it was under heavy guard both outside and inside .
Once inside , I was permitted from a safe distance to first observe the object just recovered north of town .
It was approx .
12 to 15 feet in length , not quite as wide , about 6 feet high , and more of an egg shape .
Lighting was poor , but its surface did appear metallic .
No windows , portholes , wings , tail section , or landing gear were visible .
( 13 ) Also from a distance , I was able to see a couple of bodies under a canvas tarpaulin .
Only the heads extended beyond the covering , and I was not able to make out any features .
The heads did appear larger than normal and the contour of the canvas suggested the size of a 10 year old child .
At a later date in Blanchard 's office , he would extend his arm about 4 feet above the floor to indicate the height .
( 14 ) I was informed of a temporary morgue set up to accommodate the recovered bodies .
( 15 ) I was informed that the wreckage was not " hot " ( radioactive ) .
( 16 ) Upon his return from Fort Worth , Major Marcel described to me taking pieces of the wreckage to Gen .
Ramey 's office and after returning from a map room , finding the remains of a weather balloon and radar kite substituted while he was out of the room .
Marcel was very upset over this situation .
We would not discuss it again .
( 17 ) I would be allowed to make at least one visit to one of the recovery sites during the military cleanup .
I would return to the base with some of the wreckage which I would display in my office .
( 18 ) I was aware two separate teams would return to each site months later for periodic searches for any remaining evidence .
( 19 ) I am convinced that what I personally observed was some type of craft and its crew from outer space .
( 20 ) I have not been paid nor given anything of value to make this statement , and it is the truth to the best of my recollection .

Lt. Walter G. Haut
Roswell base public information officer
" deathbed " affidavit to seeing spacecraft & bodies
On UFO Updates on November 17 , 2007 , Kevin Randle also wrote that a man he interviewed in the mid-1990s , 1st Lt. Richard C. Harris , Jr. , said that he met Haut near a base hangar and Haut told him at that time about seeing a dead alien body .
Harris said
Haut suggested he take a quick look , but Harris decided against this .
( Harris , the base asst .
financial officer , also said he helped cover up the paper trail of expenses involved in the recovery . )
Tom Carey and Donald Schmitt also remark how Haut commonly dropped hints that he knew more than he was letting on to .
Haut 's common closing remarks in public appearances or in interviews was , " It was n't any type of weather balloon .
I believe it was a UFO !
Just do n't ask me why ! "
Haut started to become more publicly forthcoming in 2000 .
He gave a lengthy recorded oral history with researchers Wendy Connors and Dennis Balthauser , people he knew well and trusted .
Haut stipulated the interview was not to be released until after his death .
( Haut died in December 2005 ) .
In the interview ( transcript )
Haut first disclosed he saw the craft and small bodies in one of the hangars .
He also disclosed that Gen. Roger Ramey , one of the architects of the weather balloon cover - up , had flown in for the staff morning meeting on July 8 , and helped decide on how to deal with the situation .
( Wendy Connors in private email , told me that Haut was already telling her privately about Ramey and knowing something about the bodies even before this interview . )
In December 2002 , Haut filled out a notarized affidavit ( immediately below ) , that was sealed and again not to be publicly disclosed until after his death .
A copy first appeared in the June 2007 book Witness to Roswell by Tom Carey and Don Schmitt , released with permission of Haut 's surviving family .
New Nov. 2008 !
Schmitt and Haut 's daughter Julie Shuster afterwards revealed that the affidavit was drafted by Schmitt , with Haut 's approval , after years of conversations with Haut .
Haut then carefully reviewed Schmitt 's emailed draft for accuracy , both privately and with Shuster present .
He made no changes before signing in front of Shuster , a notary , and an outside witness .
According to Schmitt , a doctor had just reviewed the status of Haut 's health and judged him to be of sound mind .
For Shuster 's detailed comments in the September MUFON Journal about the process behind the affidavit , click here .
In the affidavit , Haut again said that he had seen the crash object and bodies in a hangar ( Hangar 84 or P - 3 ) .
Col .
Blanchard , a close friend his entire life , made a point of taking him out there .
Haut also disclosed new information , such as personally handling the debris during the morning meeting , which he said was unlike anything he or anyone else there had ever seen before , going out to one of the crash sites ( probably the large Foster Ranch debris field ) and bringing debris back to his office .
He also revealed that the second main crash site with the object and bodies was about 40 miles north of Roswell and had been found by civilians on July 7 .
He first became aware of both crash sites by the afternoon of Monday , July 7 , after returning to duty from the 4th of July weekend .
A key topic of discussion at the morning meeting was how to deal with the situation , since members of the press and public already knew something was going on .
Haut gave insight into the reasoning behind Blanchard 's perplexing flying disc press release which Haut delivered to the local Roswell media .
Gen .
Ramey wished to divert attention away from the more important craft / body site by acknowledging the remoter , less accessible debris site , but providing few details .
Haut believed Ramey was acting under direction of his superiors at the Pentagon .
It was discussed whether to tell the public the full truth , but this was decided against , and thus began a cover - up that continues to this day .
Haut also mentioned being aware of teams sent out to both sites for months afterwards to search for any remaining evidence .
This provided some corroboration for Bill Brazel 's story ( son of rancher Mack Brazel ) of having debris samples confiscated from him by such a team a few months later .
Haut is far from alone in his claims to seeing alien bodies , a spacecraft or strange debris .
Click on the links at the top for other such accounts about non-human bodies or strange debris , such as Frederick Benthal and Eli Benjamin , two other military alien body eyewitnesses .
The writeup on mortician Glenn Dennis has numerous other mostly second - hand accounts .
A number of these center around base Hangar 84 or P - 3 mentioned by Haut , where crash debris , craft , and bodies were taken for processing and shipment .
The heavily guarded B - 29 crate flight to Fort Worth on July 9 , the day after Haut 's viewing of the bodies / craft in the hangar , is strongly suspected of carrying bodies .
See also my review of the Carey / Schmitt book for an overview of the accounts .
According to Carey & Schmitt ,
Haut waited until the end of his life to reveal this information because he had promised Col .
Blanchard to not disclose it while he was alive .
Haut may have had another personal reason .
He was well - aware how other major Roswell witnesses had been savaged by debunkers , a prime example being Jesse Marcel , the intelligence officer .
By initially denying direct knowledge of the more controversial aspects about Roswell , Haut would be denying critics a convenient target .
However , with Haut 's now - public interview and affidavit confessing to being an eyewitness to the debris , spacecraft , and bodies , he will no doubt be attacked as a liar who changed his story , a senile old man , or even worse .
Haut 's " deathbed " affidavit is sure to stir up a huge heated controversy .
Once a public figure like
Haut states that there really was a flying saucer crash and alien bodies and he saw it with his own eyes , there is never any returning to the quiet life .
Walter Haut was the public information officer at Roswell base during the Roswell incident of July 1947 .
In interviews dating back to the 1980s , he said he was mostly out - of - the - loop .
His basic story was that on the morning of July 8 , base commander Col.
William Blanchard had dictated to him a press release that they had obtained a flying disc from a nearby ranch and were flying it on to " higher headquarters . "
He said he thought the original press release was the truth and he was convinced " the material recovered was some type of craft from outer space . " ( 1993 affidavit )
He was pretty sure Blanchard must have seen the debris before issuing the press release and said Blanchard would never make a mistake of confusing the recovered material with a weather balloon ..
Haut , who lived in Roswell , became one of the most interviewed and public Roswell witnesses and key advocate of a saucer crash , yet continued to publicly disclaim personal knowledge of the debris or of the actual craft and recovered bodies as reported by other witnesses .
However , Haut 's on - the - record public statements differed from some of his private ones .
E.g. , Robert Shirkey Jr. , son of Robert Shirkey , base assistant operations officer , disclosed on a recent Art Bell show that Haut told his father , a good friend , about seeing the bodies clear back in 1989 .
Shirkey Jr. , said his father also told him this in 1989 .
( Art Bell show , June 30 , 2007 , 3rd hour )
Shirkey Sr. in his 1991 affidavit also hinted at this when he stated " I learned later that ... the bodies were laid out in Hanger 84 . "
An excerpt of Shirkey Jr.'s comments about being told of the bodies are below , including statements about the character of the men involved , whom he knew personally , having grown up in Roswell .
( See 2 minutes into clip for body comments . )
Rockstar Games ' Manhunt 2 has achieved the dubious honour of being only one of two games to be banned in the UK .
The highly anticipated upcoming title , which casts gamers in the role of doctor Daniel Lam - - who offers himself as a guinea pig for a neurological weapons project -- was due to go on sale in the country on the Wii , PlayStation Portable , and PlayStation 2 on July 13 .
However , both the PS2 and Wii versions have been refused a rating by the British Board of Film Classification , meaning they cannot be legally sold in the UK .
The PSP version has not yet been submitted to the BBFC for a rating .
The reasoning behind the decision is that , according to BBFC director David Cooke , " Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high - end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing .
There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game . "
Cooke says that the decision is not one that the board has taken lightly , and that where possible , it considers cuts or modifications to the game to remove offensive material .
However , in the case of Manhunt 2 " this has not been possible . "
The first game in the series , Manhunt , was given an 18 rating by the BBFC when it was released back in 2003 .
However , Cooke stated that , " Although the difference should not be exaggerated , the fact of the game 's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer , together with the different overall narrative context , contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game . "
He added that the first title was already " at the very top end " of what it considered acceptable for an 18 certificate , and that it came before the results of recent BBFC research were released .
The game has been refused a certificate on both the Wii and PlayStation 2 platforms , as to release it would " involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks , to both adults and minors . "
The board adds that even if the game was confined to an adult release , it would " still be unacceptable to the public . "
The game is the first to be refused a classification since Carmageddon in 1997 .
The car combat game developed by SCi and published by Interplay allowed racers to destroy opponents and murder pedestrians .
However , the decision to refuse classification of Carmageddon was overturned on appeal by the Video Appeals Committee .
UK games industry body ELSPA released a statement from director Paul Jackson , which said , " A decision from the BBFC such as this demonstrates that we have a games ratings system in the UK that is effective .
It shows it works and works well .
Any decision the BBFC takes , it takes on the basis of its remit to rate onscreen entertainment . "
The BBFC statement concluded that the game 's distributors would also have the right to appeal the decision .
Rockstar Games had not returned calls to comment as of press time .
[ UPDATE ]
The Irish Film Censor 's Office has also announced that the game has been banned in the Republic of Ireland .
In a statement , the board gave its reasoning as follows , " IFCO recognizes that in certain films , DVDs and video games , strong graphic violence may be a justifiable element within the overall context of the work .
However , in the case of Manhunt 2 , IFCO believes that there is no such context , and the level of gross , unrelenting and gratuitous violence is unacceptable . "

HELP WANTED : Chief executive of the Smithsonian who wo n’t use its funds to clean his chandelier , heat his pool , install French doors or pay his chauffeur ; who will take fewer than 70 vacation days a year ; who wo n’t keep crucial information from the general counsel , inspector general and chief financial officer ; and who wo n’t decorate his office with a stuffed Bengal tiger from the Natural History Museum .
If the Smithsonian Institution knows what it does not want in its next secretary , it seems less sure of the kind of leader it should be seeking , particularly now that the job description is changing .
Should it be an experienced arts manager , comfortable balancing the interests of museum directors , donors and boards ?
A business executive steeped in management ?
Or perhaps a university president adept at dealing with influential alumni , educators and government officials ?
The opening at the Smithsonian is a result of the rocky tenure of Larry M. Small , former president and chief operating officer of Fannie Mae , who resigned in March after disclosures about lavish spending .
Two lacerating reports — one internal , another from an outside review committee — describe a chief executive run amok , devoting much of his time to corporate boards .
Ten Tips for Website Localization
This post has some general tips that I ’d recommend to anyone wanting to write a multilingual web application .
The majority of my code these days is PHP , but I think these tips are applicable to most web programming languages .
In no particular order :
UTF - 8 is your friend .
Use it .
The big step from ASCII to Unicode was the potential to use multiple bytes to represent a single character .
With ASCII , each character was given a number between 0 and 255 and that ’s all the programmer could use .
If another character needed to be shown , the numbers were reused and a different font was loaded .
If people did n’t have the same fonts , they got errors or undefined results .
Enter Unicode and UTF - 8 .
With the creation of UTF - 8 , characters from all over the world are assigned numbers between 0 and 1,114,111 .
This is fantastic news , because you can store text in many different languages without having to worry about specific encodings .
This also means you can support language fall back for sections of your web page .
If you have 80 % of your page translated for a specific language , you can fall back to an alternative , all while using the same encoding .
( an aside : Be sure to use lang= ” ” attributes in your HTML tags if you ’re changing the language mid-stream ) .
Do n’t concatenate strings
Code like this makes me sad , and will make your localizers cry ( or quit ) :
<? $ item = " toast " ; //
Example one -
This is bad echo _ ( " Sometimes I eat " ) . " { $ item } " . _ ( " and sometimes I do n't . " ) ; //
Example two -
This is better echo sprintf ( _ ( " Sometimes I eat %s and sometimes I do n't . " ) , $ item ) ; ?>
In the first example , chances are good the localizer will get the list of strings to translate and the two separate calls to _( ) will look like two different sentences with no context around them .
Firstly , the phrases by themselves make no sense , and secondly , a localizer needs to be able to look at an entire sentence ( and sometimes more ) to understand how to translate it most effectively .
The second example uses the printf ( ) standard %s to let the localizer know you ’ll be substituting a string into the middle of the sentence .
This is the current best practice for creating sentences with variables .
Depending on what the string is , they may still be upset , but that ’s out of scope for this tip ( here ’s a hint though ) .
Do n’t use machine translation
In recent years great progress has been made towards programmatically translating documents from language to language .
That said , it is far from being an acceptable replacement for a fluent translator .
The edge cases and “ what ifs ” on the technical / logical side of the translation are enough for me to say that , but when you start talking about potentially offensive translations ( that ’s the next tip ) this is a definite requirement .
Just look at an example of an automated German to English translation .
It ’s readable but it ’s far from polished - not something you want as a first impression to your site .
Be culturally sensitive
If you ’re not very familiar with your target culture ask for an opinion from someone who is ( or hire a localizer who is ) .
Seemingly innocent words , phrases , and images could be misunderstood by another culture .
If you use terminology that is only understood in your region or culture , the best case you can hope for is that a visitor to your site just wo n’t understand and will ignore it , but it really reduces your credibility and the overall enjoyment of visiting your site .
Use multi - byte functions
This may be a little PHP specific , but it ’s good to be aware of it in any language .
PHP has string functions and multibyte string functions .
The latter functions support characters that fill up more than one byte ( ie. UTF - 8 characters ) .
This is essential when manipulating strings with letters outside of the Latin alphabet .
If you ’re not using PHP , at the least , verify your programming language will manipulate multi- byte strings correctly .
Separate your views from your logic
I ’m a fan of MVC separation , but there are plenty of other architectural patterns .
Depending on what process and software you use for localization you may be giving template files to localizers .
If that ’s the case , the simpler the better - you do n’t need a bunch of complex code around the strings waiting to be translated .
Even if you ’re using a method that does n’t require giving template files to localizers , updating strings is easier , and whoever does maintenance on your software in the future will thank you .
Use ( meaningful ) placeholder text
This one might be a little controversial and is gettext specific .
The documented and recommended way to use gettext is to pass an English string to the gettext ( ) function .
This serves two purposes :
It lets the localizer see the complete English string when they are translating , and it let ’s gettext fall back to English if a translation is n’t available .
I ’m suggesting using a substitute string in place of the English string .
For example , instead of _ ( " Error : Your cart is full ! " )
I would use _( " error_cart_full " ) .
English translations are done in the .po file , just like every other locale .
By following this rule , it ’s possible to change the English text , without affecting the other translations .
Using the documented method means that even adding a comma means changing every locale ’s . po file and then recompiling them all .
If you ’ve got localizers watching for changes on their files ( through a shared repository ) this means they have to check and verify any changes - it ’s a hassle and it ’s time consuming for everyone involved .
The first purpose I mentioned , seeing English strings , can be duplicated by running msgattrib -- set - fuzzy $ file1 | msgmerge - NUs $ file2 where $ file1 is the updated en-US . po file , and $ file2 is the outdated . po file from another locale .
This will merge the English strings into the other locale , but will mark them as fuzzy , so gettext will ignore them until they are translated .
The second purpose can be addressed just by making sure the strings you ’re trying to use are available .
If you need to use a new English string on the site , and the localizer is unavailable , you can temporarily move the fall back logic into your code :
<? //
This is a temporary fix ! if ( _ ( " string_to_translate " ) == " string_to_translate " ) { //
Print the English string } else { //
Print the translated string } ?>
While we ’re on the subject of . po files , useful comments should be added to the file wherever appropriate to help provide context and hints for localizers .
Be aware of word length
Words in different languages have different lengths - words in Asian languages generally have fewer characters than English , and German words , more .
When designing the layout for your site , bear this in mind .
Do n’t hard code widths to elements holding text - the words should be able to flow and expand as necessary .
This can be tough with today ’s complex sites , but CSS will go a long way to help .
Also , when accepting user input , do n’t put unneeded arbitrary length restrictions on the input .
Do n’t use graphics as text
This is just a good idea in general , but it makes even more sense when localizing pages .
Creating images is time consuming and has more potential for error .
Using an appropriate encoding and employing CSS should get close to the same effect ( with an extra point for accessibility ) .
If you need to use an image , be prepared to accept localized strings and make the image yourself - localizers may not have the time , skills , or software they need to create the images .
Be aware of how changing the locale can affect strings
Setting the LC_ALL variable does n’t just change the formatting of strings - it also changes currency formatting , time / date formatting , how things are sorted , and what symbols represent numbers / lettters / etc. Some Examples :
<? setlocale ( LC_ALL , ' fr_FR ' ) ; $ num = 1.5 ; var_dump ( $ num ) ; // Prints 1.5 echo $ num ; // Prints 1,5 ?>
Internally , the decimal is represented by a period , and all the php functions will recognize that ( eg. /[ 0 - 9 . ] +/ matches , whereas / [ 0 - 9 , ] +/ does not ) .
However , if you need to print the string to pass it to another library or page ( into a mysql query , passing to javascript , etc. ) it ’s going to become a comma .
Another example :
<? preg_match ( '/ \w/ ' , ' ホーム ' ) ; //
Will never match , regardless of LC_ALL ?>
Using regular expressions on UTF - 8 data can be risky .
The \w and [ [ : alpha : ] ] character escapes only ever match single byte values ( ie. characters with values up to 256 ) with the preg functions .
The PCRE Documentation says :
“ This remains true even when PCRE includes Unicode property support , because to do otherwise would slow down PCRE in many common cases .
If you really want to test for a wider sense of , say , “ digit ” , you must use Unicode property tests such as \p {Nd} . ”
If we need to match UTF - 8 strings with regular expressions in PHP , we can use :
<? mb_regex_encoding ( ' UTF - 8 ' ) ; mb_ereg ( ' \w + ' , ' ホーム ' , $ match ) ; print_r ( $ match ) ; // Prints : Array ( [ 0 ] => ホーム ) ?>
By setting the internal regular expression encoding to UTF - 8 , and using the mb_ereg ( ) function , we can match multibyte characters with regular expressions .
Realize though , that this has the performance issues the PCRE documentation mentioned .

Here 's a small Haskell program for computing factorial .
It even runs , produces 3628800 .
Let 's compare that to the C program doing the same thing .
They look rather similar , do n't they ?
( BTW , I decided to use the heavily underused C keyword .
If you do n't know C , do n't worry , does n't mean anything .
A local declarationis the same asin C. )
I often hear people complain that C - like programming in Haskell is ugly and verbose , but I do n't think that has to be the case .
What people complain about is when they write code like this :
And I agree , it 's ugly , it 's verbose , but it 's not necessary .
One of the reasons it 's verbose are the uses ofand .
In C you just refer to the variable and you 'll get an r-value when you need it , and you 'll get an l-value when you need it .
And you can do the same in Haskell .
Let 's look at a tiny version of the problem .
We want the following operations :
Here 's a tiny sample :
How can we make this happen ?
We wantto be able to be the left hand side of an assignment as well as an expression on the right hand side .
But the assignment operator has different types on the left and right .
So we could possibly makethe same as .
But this would be bad , because we want the left hand side to be a variable and now we'd have no way of knowing , which means that it would no longer be a type error to assign to a non-variable .
So , we need a little bit of type trickery .
First , we 'll makeand " subtypes " of the same type , so they have something in common .
The typehas an additional type argument that determines if the value is an l-value or an r-value .
So what about , what type should it have ?
It needs to return something that is both an l-value and an r-value .
So we 'll make it polymorphic !
First attempt : But this wo n't work .
Saying " " is the same as " " .
And when a variable is lambda bound it is not polymorphic .
What does this mean ?
It means that we can useas either an l-value or as an r-value inside , but not both ; thetype variable can only have a single type .
Are we stuck ?
Well , we would have been without higher ranked polymorphism .
But here 's a type that works :
So nowwill have typewhich is indeed polymorphic injust as we wanted .
OK , so now we have some type signatures that work ( using stub implementations it 's easy to check that the types work out ) .
So now we need to implement the types and the operations .
Let 's start with r-values .
To make a constructor that only can construct r-values we 'll use a GADT .
Thetype will simply embed anvalue .
So when we see the typeit 's really isomorphic to .
To extract thevalue we have the functionSo now we can doand ; they are totally straightforward except that we need to unwrap and wrap theconstructor .
And then the hard part , variables .
To represent a variable we 'll use two fields , one that reads the variable and one that assigns the variable .
We need to extend thefunction to use the variable read field to get the value .
Thefunction allocates a new variable and then packages up the two fields .
We 're about done , just assignment left .
It 's easy , just use the assignment field from theconstructor .
Hmmm , but there 's a missing case in that definition .
What about the constructor ?
Ca n't we get a runtime failure ?
No .
Look at the type of the first argument , it's , i.e. , .
Theconstructor can only construct values of type , so we just can't get a match failure .
Now our little example above compiles , and trying the bad expressiongives this error :
Once we 've made thedata type it's totally routine to make the factorial function I first showed work .
We just need to create an instance forand a few more functions .
Is this the end of the story ?
Is everything rosy ?
Is C programming in Haskell as smooth as that ?
Well , there are some flies in the ointment .
While it 's true that programming with thetype is easy , it 's a little cumbersome if we want to use pure functions .
Pute functions will not have thetype and will have to be lifted into this new brave world .
Likewise , IO types will have to be lifted .
So while we have reduced some verbosity , it has popped up again in a different place .
Which is better ?
I do n't know , but I thought I 'd share the l - value / r- value trick .
Oh , and ( of course ) , there 's nothing special about the IO monad .
I just used it as an example ; any monad with references will work .
You can parametrizeover the underlying monad .

Other scenes would be more amusing to witness — like a rather famous one that transpired at the Four Seasons late one afternoon many years ago .
At the end of a long lunch three well - dressed , then undressed , women in their mid-20s decided that the marble pool in the center of the main dining room looked like a nifty spot for a dip , said Julian Niccolini , one of the restaurant ’s owners .
So they took one , wearing nothing more than their panties , he said .
Asked about their motivation , Mr. Niccolini answered : “ I ’m not going to say the word drunk .
They were very happy .
They were very excited . ”
As well they should have been .
A wealthy gentleman nearby had been buying them their drinks , which included bottles of Montrachet , Cristal and Cheval Blanc .
The total bill came to more than $ 7,000 , Mr. Niccolini said .
He said the incident , which ended when a maître d’hôtel rushed over with tablecloths to cover the women up , was one of about a dozen times over the years when happy , excited customers at the Four Seasons took happy , excited splashes in the pool .
The spectacles seldom elicit protest , he said .
Neither do the annual bacchanals of one of Le Bernardin ’s most loyal patrons .
Eric Ripert , Le Bernardin ’s chef , said that this regular celebrated his birthday there every year , renting out a private room with an adjoining kitchen upstairs and donning chef ’s whites to cook alongside Mr. Ripert .
He has his first glass of his beloved Montrachet sometime between 4 and 5 p.m .
It ’s never his last .
“ During the course of the night he drinks maybe five or six bottles , ” Mr. Ripert said , explaining that the man nonetheless manages to remain vertical because he is “ probably 6 - foot - 5 , and he ’s probably 400 pounds .
I mean , he ’s a monster .
He ’s huge . ”
And on his most recent birthday , after many of those bottles had been drained , he teetered downstairs in his chef ’s whites , commenced a showy promenade through the main dining room and accepted compliments from the people there , who understandably took him for one of the kitchen staff .
To Génica Athansiou
November 24 , 1940
My very dear Génica ,
You must find heroin at all costs and you must risk death to get it to me here .
This is where matters stand .
The Initiates have real instruments of torture , as I have already told you , and they use them from a distance to mutilate me while I sleep , each night a little more .
If it is difficult to procure heroin or opium , it is solely because of me and because they know that it is the one thing that would restore my strength and make me fit to struggle against Evil .
But the most serious aspect of the affair is that all my friends , including you , have rebelled , have taken up arms in Paris , have used force to get heroin for me , and that they extracted it from all of you by magic , and that they then caused you to lose consciousness of your rebellion and that they have weighed down your shoulders
your heads
and the backs of your necks with leaden spells in order to enslave you , for it is thus that the common people are avenged and it is the common people who are now in power and who feed on my suffering here .
Search your memory and you will see that some part of the use you have made of your time eludes you .
Génica , we must leave this world , but first the Kingdom of the Other World must come , and we need armed troops in great numbers .
So that the Bohemians can enter this world in number as one disembarks from a ship I must have heroin so that I can open all the hidden doors and destroy the spells of Satan which are keeping them out and keeping me prisoner here .
I count on you and I embrace you .
Antonin Artaud
Two nights ago you thought you had a dream that brought you to Marseilles , boulevard Perrier , but in reality you were having a vision from Paris of a real scene which was taking place in Marseilles , in which one of the gods of Evil went forth with his armies .
These armies were cut to pieces by the Bohemians who reappear at night but some of their soldiers were loitering in Saumur , in Toulon , and in Paris in the vicinity of the Vieux - Colombier .
A newly discovered small molecule called IQ - 1 plays a key role in preventing embryonic stem cells from differentiating into one or more specific cell types , allowing them to instead continue growing and dividing indefinitely , according to research performed by a team of scientists who have recently joined the stem - cell research efforts at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California .
Their findings are being published today in an early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
This discovery takes scientists another step closer to being able to grow embryonic stem cells without the “ feeder layer ” of mouse fibroblast cells that is essential for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells , says the study ’s primary investigator , Michael Kahn , Ph.D. , who was recently named the first Provost ’s Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy at USC .
Such a layer is needed because it is currently the only proven method to provide the stem cells with the necessary chemical signals that prompt them to stay undifferentiated and to continue dividing over and over .
Still , growing human embryonic stem cells on a layer of mouse fibroblasts has never made much sense to the scientists forced to do just that .
“ Stem cells that grow on feeders are contaminated with mouse glycoproteins markers , ” Kahn says .
“ If you use them into humans , you ’d potentially have a horrible immune response . ”
And so , in order to take any eventual stem cell - based treatments from the laboratory to the clinic , there needs to be a way to keep the cells growing and dividing without the use of mouse fibroblasts .
The discovery of IQ - 1 , says Kahn , is a significant step in that direction .
What IQ - 1 does , Kahn explains , is to block one arm of a cell - signaling pathway called the Wnt pathway , while enhancing the signal coming from the other arm of the Wnt pathway .
The Wnt pathway is known to have dichotomous effects on stem cells i.e. both proliferative and differentiative .
More specifically , IQ - 1 blocks the coactivator p300 from interacting with the protein ß-catenin ; this prevents the stem cells from being ‘ told ’ to differentiate into a more specific cell type .
At the same time , IQ - 1 enhances the interaction between the coactivator CBP and ß-catenin , which signals the cells to keep dividing and to remain as fully potent stem cells .
“ This way , you can essentially maintain the stem cell ’s growth and potency for as long as you want , ” Kahn says .
The studies of IQ - 1 and its effects reported in the newly published PNAS paper were performed at the University of Washington in Seattle by Kahn and his colleagues ( along with collaborators from the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Shizuoka , Japan ) using mouse embryonic stem cells , but Kahn notes that subsequent pilot studies using human embryonic stem cells , in collaboration with Dr. Qilong Ying at the Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine , have confirmed that IQ - 1 plays a similar role in that system as well .

Massage Therapy
Rubbing can bind a joint that is loose and loosen a joint that is too rigid
- Hippocrates ( 469-370 BC )
Massage what is it ?
Massage is defined as the systematic manipulation of the soft tissues of the body for a curative effect .
Soft tissues are made more pliable through massage to promote circulation and blood flow and bring about healing effects : physical and psychological changes for general wellbeing .
What does it involve ?
The system of massage treatment involves the therapist using their hands to apply pressure on your body .
Therapists use various techniques to work on the body : stroking and gliding ( effleurage ) , kneading the soft tissues ( petrissage ) , or what is termed percussion ( tapotement ) .
What are the real benefits ?
Massage therapy is extremely beneficial to people leading busy lifestyles suffering from what is now commonly encountered work related stress .
Massage will not only aid with mental relaxation but will work on physical symptoms of back and neck pain that comes from sitting for an extended period of time at a desk or from physical labour .
The importance of taking regular massage has heightened in recent times as more people recognise how beneficial it is as a way to counteract the effects of sitting in front of a computer screen daily .
Corporations are beginning to realise these benefits for staff wellbeing and as a way to increase productivity .
By offering mobile massage therapy as a part of employee benefits ( see mobile massage ) in the workplace it could go a long way to help reduce staff stress levels , which in turn will make for a more cooperative relaxed work environment , and then aid productivity .
More obviously if employers spend on massage for their staff they might reduce the cost of lost labour through sick days .
Work related stress is a serious problem in society leading to poor health , disease , and death .
This situation might be helped if employers take the opportunity to enlist the services of a professional Massage Therapist who will educate about the benefits of relaxation and massage .
Many people wait until they are already in pain or suffering spinal injuries before turning to massage , but why let it get that bad ?
It is a good idea to take regular massage as a preventative measure so that such injuries do not occur .
Regular massage maintenance will increase your overall sense of wellbeing for optimum physical and mental health , helping you to achieve your goals .
Massage is used to treat a wide range of disorders , such as :
Insomnia
Muscular tension
Headaches and migraines
Work related stress
Repetitive strain injury
Depression
Arthritis
Eating disorders and digestive dysfunction
Pre-natal pregnancy conditions
Fibrositis
Spondylitis
Frozen shoulder
Whiplash
Sports and dancing injuries
The power of healing in massage is the energy that flows through the therapists hands in touch to refresh , regenerate and revitalise .
Who does it ?
Massage is performed through the hands of a Massage Therapist .
The Massage Therapist will work out a treatment plan ( if desired ) by muscle testing .
Massage Therapy is available in shopping malls , healing centres , at home ( via mobile massage ) , hospitals , in the workplace , leisure centres , beauty salons , spas and health retreats .
Try using the Natural Therapy Pages postcode search to locate a massage therapist working in your area .
Types of Massage what type of massage is best for me ?
There are several forms of massage on offer , and it can be confusing to know what will work best for a particular ailment or condition .
Some massage concentrates more on relaxing the client whilst others will work more deeply at repairing damaged muscle tissue .
It may be that you need to try several forms of massage to find what works best for you .
You can find more information regarding specific types of massage on the Natural Therapies Pages directory .
Here is a brief summary of some commonly found massage therapies :
Chinese Massage is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
This massage therapy is closely related to Herbal Medicine , Acupuncture and Acupressure .
Chinese Massage treatment creates movement and is therefore seen as a treatment for pain relief .
It is almost always given on a couch or a stool .
Connective Tissue Massage this technique is connected to the Myofascial release technique , and does not involve the use of oil or lotion .
It can relieve chronic tension , improve posture and relieve painful symptoms of chronic diseases such as Arthritis , Tendonitis , TMJ and Sciatica .
Hot Stone Massage aids the client to experience deep relaxation .
The therapist places heated basalt stones on the bodys acupressure points .
A series of Swedish Massage style techniques is used with the therapist holding smooth stones and applying essential oils to work away muscle tension .
Deep Tissue Massage focuses on the deeper layers of muscle tissue .
It is designed to reach the deep sections of thick muscles , specifically the individual muscle fibres .
Remedial Massage works to heat muscles and tendons that are damaged , impaired or knotted .
It holistically treats the whole body and traces the discomfort back to the original cause .
It uses specialised techniques to support and speed up the body 's own repair mechanisms .
The massage is applied directly to the skin usually with an oil lubricant .
Passive stretching moves are also employed .
Shiatsu is a traditional hands - on Japanese healing therapy originating from the Japanese amma therapeutic massage .
It is quite an intense form of massage whereby the therapist uses thumbs , elbows , forearms , feet and knees to apply pressure on the body .
This is combined with stretches , joint rotations and joint manipulation to give an all - over treatment .
Swedish Massage is a system of long strokes , kneading , friction , tapping , percussion , vibration and shaking motions that apply pressure between muscles and bones , rubbing in the same direction as the flow of blood returning to the heart .
Swedish Massage feels good , is relaxing and invigorating .
Thai Massage
This is a more physical manipulation of the body using passive stretching and gentle pressure with the hands and feet .
Allied with yoga stretching movements , this massage will help to adjust the skeletal structure , increase flexibility , relieve muscular and joint tension , stimulate internal organs and balance the body 's energy system .
The effect is both relaxing as well as energising .
This type of massage is performed on a floor mat .
What should I expect from a massage session ?
Massage normally takes place in a private room or space .
Clients are expected to partially undress and are given a towel or robe to place over themselves .
The exception to this is with Mobile Massage whereby the client may remain clothed and is not always in a private space .
Most massage will take place on a massage table lying down , but in some cases the massage takes place whilst you are seated on a massage chair ( see Chinese Massage ) , or on a floor mat ( see Thai Massage ) .
Massage therapy can last for 10 mins to 1 hour depending what is requested .

The rise of fast processors and cheap storage means that remembering , once incredibly difficult for humans , has become simple .
Viktor Mayer - Schönberger , a professor in Harvard 's JFK School of Government , argues that this shift has been bad for society , and he calls instead for a new era of " forgetfulness . "
Mayer - Schönberger lays out his idea in a faculty research working paper called " Useful Void : The Art of Forgetting in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing , " where he describes his plan as reinstating " the default of forgetting our societies have experienced for millennia . "
Why would we want our machines to " forget " ?
Mayer - Schönberger suggests that we are creating a Benthamist panopticon by archiving so many bits of knowledge for so long .
The accumulated weight of stored Google searches , thousands of family photographs , millions of books , credit bureau information , air travel reservations , massive government databases , archived e-mail , etc. , can actually be a detriment to speech and action , he argues .
" If whatever we do can be held against us years later , if all our impulsive comments are preserved , they can easily be combined into a composite picture of ourselves , " he writes in the paper .
" Afraid how our words and actions may be perceived years later and taken out of context , the lack of forgetting may prompt us to speak less freely and openly . "
In other words , it threatens to make us all politicians .
In contrast to omnibus data protection legislation , Mayer - Schönberger proposes a combination of law and software to ensure that most data is " forgotten " by default .
A law would decree that " those who create software that collects and stores data build into their code not only the ability to forget with time , but make such forgetting the default . "
Essentially , this means that all collected data is tagged with a new piece of metadata that defines when the information should expire .
In practice , this would mean that iTunes could only store buying data for a limited time , a time defined by law .
Should customers explicitly want this time extended , that would be fine , but people must be given a choice .
Even data created by users — digital pictures , for example — would be tagged by the cameras that create them to expire in a year or two ; pictures that people want to keep could simply be given a date 10,000 years in the future .
Mayer - Schönberger wants to help us avoid becoming digital pack rats , and he wants to curtail the amount of time that companies and governments can collate data about users and citizens " just because they can . "
Whenever there 's a real need to do so , data can be retained , but setting the default expiration date forces organizations to decide if they truly do need to retain that much data forever .
It 's a " modest " proposal , according to Mayer - Schönberger , but he recognizes that others may see it as " simplistic " or " radical . "
To those who feel like they are living in a panopticon , it might feel more like a chink in the wall through which fresh air blows .

This animal might be on the verge of extinction ...
( though you can not say the same about the Firefox )
This is the " other panda " , not the easily recognizable black - and - white kind .
Red Panda is cuter than a cat , has a luxurious tail , resembles both a fox and a racoon , and is considered by many to be a living fossil .
Only 2,500 individual animals can be found around the world , most in Asia ( in Tibet ) , in well - known zoos , and a " select " few as fashionable Japanese pets .
In China the Red Panda is also sometimes known as " Fire Fox " , a familiar name to everyone who uses the internet .

The image shows a bow shock around the very young star , LL Ori .
It is located in the intense star - forming region known as the Great Nebula in the constellation Orion .
A bow shock can be created in space when two streams of gas collide .
LL
Ori emits a vigorous stellar wind , a stream of charged particles moving rapidly outward from the star .
This stellar wind collides with slow - moving gas evaporating away from the center of the Orion Nebula , which is located to the lower left in this image .
The surface where the two winds collide is the crescent - shaped bow shock seen in the image .
A second , fainter bow shock can also be seen around a star near the upper left - hand corner of the image .

ESA 's Cluster was in the right place and time to make a shocking discovery .
The four spacecraft encountered a shock wave that kept breaking and reforming – predicted only in theory .
On 24 January 2001 , Cluster ’s spacecraft observed shock reformation in the Earth ’s magnetosphere , predicted only in theory , over 20 years ago .
Cluster provided the first opportunity ever to observe such an event , the details of which have been published in a paper on March , 9 this year .
The shock wave that sits above the Earth ’s surface is a natural phenomenon .
It is located on the side facing the Sun , at approximately one quarter of the distance to the Moon , and is caused by the flow of electrically charged particles from the Sun .
This flow of electrically charged particles known as solar wind is emitted in a gusty manner by the Sun .
When it collides with the Earth ’s magnetic field , it is abruptly slowed down and this causes a barrier of electrified gas , called the bow shock , to build up .
It behaves in the same way as water being pushed out of the way by the front of a ship .
On 24 January 2001 , the four Cluster spacecraft were flying at an approximate altitude of 105 000 kilometres , in tetrahedron formation .
Each spacecraft was separated from the others by a distance of about 600 kilometres .
With such a distance between them , as they approached the bow shock , scientists expected that every spacecraft would record a similar signature of the passage through this region .
Instead , the readings they got were highly contradictory .
They showed large fluctuations in the magnetic and electric field surrounding each spacecraft .
They also revealed marked variations in the number of solar wind protons that were reflected by the shock and streaming back to Sun .
" The features derived from three different scientific experiments on the Cluster satellites provide the first convincing evidence in favour of the shock reformation model , " says Vasili Lobzin of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Orléans , France , who headed this study .
Vladimir Krasnoselskikh , also of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Orléans , France , who is a collaborator on this new research , had predicted the shock reformation model theoretically in 1985 .
It is a little similar to the way waves in the ocean build up and then break onto the shore , only to reform again , some way out to sea .
The detection has implications for the way astronomers investigate larger bow shocks around distant celestial objects .
Bow shocks are related to some of the most energetic events in the Universe .
Exploding stars and strong stellar winds from young stars cause them .
Reforming bow shocks can also accelerate particles to extremely high energies and throw them across space .
Although the conditions that cause the reformation of a shock wave are rare around the Earth , they are common around these other celestial objects .
" In astrophysical situations , the conditions needed for the bow shock to overturn and reform is almost always met , " says Krasnoselskikh .
The fact that Cluster has given scientists their first concrete data from such a bow shock reformation event is a valuable gift to space physicists .
" This is a unique opportunity to study distant astrophysical objects in the kind of detail not available in any laboratory , " says Krasnoselskikh .
" Understanding the physics of shocks is essential for comprehending both complex astrophysical phenomena and accurately forecasts of the nearby space environment , " says Philippe Escoubet , Cluster and Double Star project scientist at ESA .
" Once again Cluster has demonstrated the need for formation flying with multiple spacecraft to augment our knowledge of shocks . "
The findings presented above appear in the paper , ‘ Nonstationarity and reformation of high - Mach - number quasiperpendicular shocks : Cluster observations ’ , by V.V. Lobzin et al. published on 9 March 2007 in the Geophysical Research Letters .

Background on Futurist Programming Paul Haeberli and Bruce Karsh Feb 3 , 1994 Futurism is an Italian fine arts movement that was founded in 1909 by the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti .
The Futurist 's goal was to celebrate modern technology and to free Italian art from the psychology of the past .
In 1910 Umberto Boccioni published the Manifesto of the Futurist Painters .
Futurist movements related to sculpture , theater , architecture , fashion , and music followed .
The Futurists can be credited with the development of performance art and concrete poetry .
They also created music based on the sounds of machines called " The Art of Noises " .
The popular music group " The Art of Noise " is modern Futurist development .
Futurism has had a tremendous influence on 20th century art and design .
It is easy to see the influence of the early Futurists on the work of the Bauhaus , De Stijl , Russian Constructivists , and French Cubists .
The Italian Futurists sought to free all artistic expression from the heavy religious atmosphere that controlled most art produced in Italy .
They promoted art that related to the modern developments of their day - the automobile , the airplane , and mass communication .
They rejected paintings of all subjects that had already been exploited .
We believe there is a great opportunity for these Futurist principles to be applied to the science of computer programming .
We react against the heavy religious atmosphere that surrounds every aspect of computer programming .
We believe it is time to be free from the constraints of the past , and celebrate a renaissance in the art of computer programming .
We find that many of today 's computer systems are hopelessly wasteful and inefficient .
Computer hardware has realized performance increases of a factor of more than 200 in the last 20 years , while in program design very little progress has been made at all since the invention of the subroutine .
We would like to see the science of programming advance as quickly as other fields of technology .
We believe that undergraduate education spends too much time conveying dogma , instead of teaching a sound theory of program design that helps programmers create good programs .
Universities should provide students with less religion , and much more practical experience in making and analyzing small , fast , useful and efficient programs .
We believe the result of the common academic approach is computer science graduates who make programs that are fat , slow , and incorrect .
The present state of the art in programming discourages experimentation and formal analysis .
This seems contrary to what we would expect from a " science " .
Why does computer science reject self modifying programs ?
Why have some departments stopped teaching assembly language programming ?
On what scientific basis has this been done ?
Where is the experimental evidence to support these actions ?
In 1991 , after meeting and discussion we developed our Manifesto of Futurist Programming .
Please join us in to celebrating and publicizing the works of Futurist Programmers throughout the world .

Rupert Murdoch reportedly senses an investment opportunity
The News Corp - owned newspaper said its parent firm was mulling offering some of its internet assets to Yahoo as part of a broader deal .
The Times said that News Corp would want a 25 % stake in Yahoo in return for MySpace , which it bought for $ 580m .
Yahoo's direction is in question after chief executive Terry Semel quit .
MySpace could be a valuable tool in Yahoo's battle against internet search rival and market leader Google , analysts said .
' Tentative '
New chief executive Jerry Yang , who co-founded Yahoo , has pledged to revive the business but some analysts believe the firm is now a bid target .
The Times said discussions over MySpace and News Corp investing in Yahoo were tentative and may lead to nothing .
Yahoo is currently worth $ 37bn , meaning that News Corp would need to pay in the region of $ 12bn for a 25 % stake .
News Corp has invested heavily in its own internet presence in recent years but a stake in Yahoo would give it influence over one of the world 's leading internet businesses .
Despite seeing profits fall and losing market share to Google , Yahoo still has more than 500 million users around the world .
WiiToMidi allows you to convert signals from a Nintendo Wii controller to MIDI signals .
It is a Cocoa application for Mac OS X and uses the DarwiinRemote WiiRemote framework to decode Wii controller signals .
It also supports the Nunchuk controller .

FAQ
When I start WiiToMidi the Wii remote connects , but it does n't send any MIDI signals .
What gives ?
If there are no lights lit on the Wii Remote you 've probably been caught by a strange WiiRemote framework bug .
Hold On / Off on the Wii Remote for a few seconds and then try to connect with 1 and 2 again .
You may have to restart WiiToMidi to get it fixed .
Why is the accelerometer output so twitchy ?
Because that 's the way the Wii Remote is .
The accelerometer sensors in the device are very sensitive and , unfortunately , very noisy and jittery .
Some applications implement signal smoothing to iron out the noise .
Unfortunately this can also make the control feel laggy and less responsive .
Signal smoothing can be controlled using the up and down D - Pad buttons .
Up makes the output smoother and down makes it more direct .
How can I play a melody with this thing ?
Using the A , B , C , and Z buttons you can send four different notes : C , D , F , and A . Letting you change which notes you send will come eventually .
" Drumming " and Ocarina melody mode are on the TODO list .

These are my notes from the talk Scaling Google for Every User by Marissa Mayer .
Google search has lots of different users who vary in age , sex , location , education , expertise and a lot of other factors .
After lots of research , it seems the only factor that really influences how different users view search relevance is their location .
One thing that does distinguish users is the difference between a novice search user and an expert user of search .
Novice users typically type queries in natural language while expert users use keyword searches .
NOVICE QUERY :
Why does n't anyone carry an umbrella in Seattle ?
EXPERT QUERY : weather seattle washington
NOVICE QUERY : can I hike in the seattle area ?
EXPERT QUERY : hike seattle area
On average , it takes a new Google user 1 month to go from typing novice queries to being a search expert .
This means that there is little payoff in optimizing the site to help novices since they become search experts in such a short time frame .
In general , when it comes to the PC user experience , the more features available the better the user experience .
However when it comes to handheld devices the graph is a bell curve and there reaches a point where adding extra features makes the user experience worse .
At Google , they believe their experience is more like the latter and tend to hide features on the main page and only show them when necessary ( e.g. after the user has performed a search ) .
This is in contrast to the portal strategy from the 1990s when sites would list their entire product line on the front page .
When tasked with taking over the user interface for Google search , Marissa Mayer fell back on her AI background and focused on applying mathematical reasoning to the problem .
Like Amazon , they decided to use split A/ B testing to test different changes they planned to make to the user interface to see which got the best reaction from their users .
One example of the kind of experiments they 've run is when the founders asked whether they should switch from displaying 10 search results by default because Yahoo ! was displaying 20 results .
They 'd only picked 10 results arbitrarily because that 's what Alta Vista did .
They had some focus groups and the majority of users said they 'd like to see more than 10 results per page .
So they ran an experiment with 20 , 25 and 30 results and were surprised at the outcome .
After 6 weeks , 25 % of the people who were getting 30 results used Google search less while 20 % of the people getting 20 results used the site less .
The initial suspicion was that people were n't having to click the " next " button as much because they were getting more results but further investigation showed that people rarely click that link anyway .
Then the Google researchers realized that while it took 0.4 seconds on average to render 10 results it took 0.9 seconds on average to render 25 results .
This seemingly imperciptible lag was still enough to sour the experience of users enough that they 'd reduce their usage of the service .
Improving Google Search
There are a number of factors that determine whether a user will find a set of search results to be relevant which include the query , the actual user 's individual tastes , the task at hand and the user 's locale .
Locale is especially important because a query such as " GM " is likely be a search for General Motors but a query such as " GM foods " is most likely seeking information about genetically modified foods .
Given a large enough corpus of data , statistical inference can seem almost like artificial intelligence .
Another example is that a search like b&b ab looks for bed and breakfasts in Alberta while ramstein ab locates the Ramstein Airforce Base .
This is because in general b&b typically means bed and breakfast so a search like " b&b ab " it is assumed that the term after " b&b " is a place name based on statistical inference over millions of such queries .
At Google they want to get even better at knowing what you mean instead of just looking at what you say .
Here are some examples of user queries which Google will transform to other queries based on statistical inference [ in future versions of the search engine ]
User Query Google Will Also Try
This Query unchanged lyrics van halen lyrics to unchained by van halen how much does it cost for an exhaust system cost exhaust system overhead view of bellagio pool bellagio pool pictures distance from zurich switzerland to lake como italy train milan italy zurich switzerland
Performing query inference in this manner is a very large scale , ill - defined problem .
Other efforts Google is pursuing is cross language information retrieval .
Specifically , if I perform a query in one language it will be translated to a foreign language and the results would then be translated to my language .
This may not be particularly interesting for English speakers since most of the Web is in English but it will be valuable for other languages ( e.g. an Arabic speaker interested in restaurant reviews from New York City restaurants ) .
Google Universal Search was a revamp of the core engine to show results other than text - based URLs and website summaries in the search results ( e.g. search for nosferatu ) .
There were a number of challenges in building this functionality such as
Google 's search verticals such as books , blog , news , video , and image search got a lot less traffic than the main search engine and originally could n't handle receiving the same level of traffic as the main page .
How do you rank results across different media to figure out the most relevant ?
How do you decide a video result is more relevant than an image or a webpage ?
This problem was tackled by Udi Manber 's team .
How do you integrate results from other media into the existing search result page ?
Should results be segregated by type or should it be a list ordered by relevance independent of media type ?
The current design was finally decided upon by Marissa Mayer 's team but they will continue to incrementally improve it and measure the user reactions .
At Google , the belief is that the next big revolution is a search engine that understands what you want because it knows you .
This means personalization is the next big frontier .
A couple of years ago , the tech media was full of reports that a bunch of Stanford students had figured out how to make Google five times faster .
This was actually incorrect .
The students had figured out how to make PageRank calculations faster which does n't really affect the speed of obtaining search results since PageRank is calculated offline .
However this was still interesting to Google and the students ' company was purchased .
It turns out that making PageRank faster means that they can now calculate multiple PageRanks in the time it used to take to calculate a single PageRank ( e.g. country specific PageRank , personal PageRank for a given user , etc ) .
The aforementioned Stanford students now work on Google 's personalized search efforts .
Speaking of personalization , iGoogle has become their fastest growing product of all time .
Allowing users create a personalized page then opening up the platform to developers such Caleb to build gadgets lets them learn more about their users .
Caleb 's collection of gadgets garner about 30 million daily page views on various personalized homepage .
Q&A
Q : Does the focus on expert searchers mean that they de-emphasis natural language processing ?
A : Yes , in the main search engine .
However they do focus on it for their voice search product and they do believe that it is unfortunate that users have to adapt to Google 's keyword based search style .
Q : How do the observations that are data mined about users search habits get back into the core engine ?
A : Most of it happens offline not automatically .
Personalized search is an exception and this data is uploaded periodically into the main engine to improve the results specific to that user .
Q : How well is the new Universal Search interface doing ?
A : As well as Google Search is since it is now the Google search interface .
Q : What is the primary metric they look at during A/B testing ?
A : It depends on what aspect of the service is being tested .
Q : Has there been user resistance to new features ?
A : Not really .
Google employees are actually more resistant to changes in the search interface than their average user .
Q : Why did they switch to showing Google Finance before Yahoo !
Finance when showing search results for a stock ticker ?
A : Links used to be ordered by ComScore metrics but ince Google Finance shipped they decided to show their service first .
This is now a standard policy for Google search results that contain links to other services .
Q : How do they tell if they have bad results ?
A : They have a bunch of watchdog services that track uptime for various servers to make sure a bad one is n't causing problems .
In addition , they have 10,000 human evaluators who are always manually checking teh relevance of various results .
Q : How do they deal with spam ?
A : Lots of definitions for spam ; bad queries , bad results and email spam .
For keeping out bad results they do automated link analysis ( e.g. examine excessive number of links to a URL from a single domain or set of domains ) and they use multiple user agents to detect cloaking .
Q : What percent of the Web is crawled ?
A : They try to crawl most of it except that which is behind signins and product databases .
And for product databases they now have Google Base and encourage people to upload their data there so it is accessible to Google .
Q : When will I be able to search using input other than search ( e.g. find this tune or find the face in this photograph ) ?
A : We are still a long way from this .
In academia , we now have experiments that show 50 % - 60 % accuracy but that 's a far cry from being a viable end user product .
Customers do n't want a search engine that gives relevant results half the time .

This week the travel editor will be comin ’ at ya like Cleopatra as your shepherd into the Land of Sheep .
Thanks to our good friends over at Shoutmouth for cluing us into this layup of a story .
First , the background .
There ’s a new social video service , a la YouTube out there on the block named GodTube : Broadcast Him .
To date , we ’re unsure of the specific financiers of the station although the initial media buzz surrounding this story has reportedly been sponsored by conservative powerhouse , FOXNews .
As soon as we have a few minutes , you can guarantee we will be conducting a full expose into the real backers , but until then , we ’ll just let you wonder ( Ted Haggard ’s meth sponsored penance ? )
Each day we ’ll be bringing you a sampling of some of the great stuff we find there .
Do n’t be scared that you wo n’t enjoy it if you are n’t a devout Christian .
But DO be scared that it ’ll start forcing you to think about the goddamn issues and pick up a bible .
Whether you like it or not .
Here ’s our first clip , a derivative on one of my favorite tracks of all time .
We ’ll call this one : Baby Got Bible .
Choice lines include : “ So ladies … Ladies …
Do you wanna save people from hades ? ”
And after watching this , DEFINITELY .
Fabled BitTorrent site SuprNova.org will soon be back online .
The one - time darling of the BitTorrent scene will be resurrected by none other than ...
The Pirate Bay .
Yet while file - sharing fans cheer everywhere , we wonder if this game of cat and mouse is n't about more than just resurrecting an icon of days passed .
If reports are to be believed , The Pirate Bay is raking in millions of dollars each year , and SuprNova 's rebirth could mean even more booty for them .
SuprNova was launched in 2000 by Andrej Preston , a Slovenian teenager .
The popular BitTorrent tracker was shuttered in 2004 after a legal net began to close around the site , and its founder decided to play it safe .
The domain has been in limbo for some time but has now been transferred to The Pirate Bay ownership , who have plans to relaunch it but have not set a date .
News of the impending relaunch first surfaced at TorrentFreak and Slyck.com , and Slyck talked to Preston about why he was giving up the site .
As it turns out , Preston is heading to film school in the US and does n't want to be associated with the site .
Despite this , he 's concerned that the site retain its community focus , and The Pirate Bay has apparently pledged to do just that .
Given that The Pirate Bay already operates a tremendously busy site , why the interest in bringing back SuprNova ?
Given the fame of the old site , it is still a popular " brand " that resonates with P2P users .
It 's a chance to draw even more traffic to Pirate Bay properties , pillaging even more gold from advertisers who are paying up to get their slogans in front of millions of eyeballs , even if they are in the virtual bay of " pirates . "
Nevertheless , talking with News.com , Pirate Bay cofounder Peter Sunde said that the resurrection of SuprNova is all about making a point : you can't keep a good file - sharing site down .
" We want to send a finger to the ones who try to stop sites like ( SuprNova and The Pirate Bay ) , " he said .
" It 's not right to close them down and this is proof that you can't .
I think this is the first time in history that any closed file - sharing site has returned , and that 's just awesome for us to be part of . "
The money wo n't hurt , either .
A series of articles in Swedish newspapers last year revealed connections between The Pirate Bay and Swiss and Israeli firms ( English translation ) , and suggested that the company was pulling in a significant amount of cash from lucrative ad deals , in excess of $ 100,000 per month in Sweden alone .
Of course , those financial details stem from an ad sales rep and may not reflect anything but what a sales guy claims ( although The Pirate Bay does have both advertising and an astounding amount of traffic ) .
That may not matter to the MPAA and its allies , though , who have only to point to point in the direction of the thriving Pirate Bay when they 're looking to make arguments about the commercial aspects of the dark underbelly of file sharing .
Unlike its early days , though , the new SuprNova will likely have deep pockets to fund a defense or evasive action , should it need to .
If not , the there will be that much more booty to share among the crew , or perhaps to make another run at buying something Sealand - esque .
The Pirate Bay managed to survive a broadside attack on its operations last year , despite US involvement .
But the US has also seen recent successes in its whack - a- mole war with AllOfMP3 , and the Bush administration is n't particularly shy about tossing its weight around under the auspices of trade policy and negotiation .
Do n't be too surprised when the US renews its attempts to thwart the organization .
Then we 'll see if Sunde is ultimately right when he says that you can't stop The Pirate Bay .

I 'm putting this into / testing first so that any problems with OpenPGP can
be reported before it goes into the main tree .
Here 's the current status
from the release notes and Thunderbird : OpenPGP wiki page :
Add - on support :
As of version 78.0 , Thunderbird only supports MailExtensions .
Your favorite add - ons may not have been updated for compatibility .
At this
time , users of the Enigmail Add - on should not update to Thunderbird 78 .
OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78.2.0 has reached feature complete state , but it's
still disabled by default , to allow more time for testing , correctness , and
localization .
See the wiki for how to enable and help with testing .
If you
use OpenPGP for non-critical purposes , then you are welcome to enable it
manually and help with testing .
To enable it in Thunderbird 78.0 , use the
config editor and change the value of preference mail .
openpgp.enable to true ,
then restart Thunderbird .
If you are running 78.x and have the previous
Enigmail Add - on installed , then Enigmail will update to version 2.2.x , which
is a minimal release that helps you to migrate the keys and settings to
Thunderbird 78 .
If you have n't used Enigmail previously , you can enable
OpenPGP for an email account in account settings .
See the release notes for more complete information about testing and
reporting bugs .

This update fixes five security issues :
" update - policy " rules of type " subdomain " were incorrectly treated as
" zonesub " rules , which allowed keys used in " subdomain " rules to update
names outside of the specified subdomains .
The problem was fixed by making
sure " subdomain " rules are again processed as described in the ARM .
When BIND 9 was compiled with native PKCS # 11 support , it was possible to
trigger an assertion failure in code determining the number of bits in the
PKCS #11 RSA public key with a specially crafted packet .
named could crash in certain query resolution scenarios where QNAME
minimization and forwarding were both enabled .
It was possible to trigger an assertion failure by sending a specially
crafted large TCP DNS message .
It was possible to trigger an assertion failure when verifying the response
to a TSIG - signed request .

It would appear that there 's no chance of upstream bringing back support for
bitmapped fonts , so it 's time to stop dragging our feet and just accept this
upgrade .
At least they 've fixed it to provide readable ( though badly spaced )
text for unsupported fonts .
If you 're using Terminus , I 'd suggest switching
to the Hack font as a good replacement .

Shared library . so-version bump .
Looks like the previous bump was a mistake :
This release fixes the SONAME of libguile - 3.0. so , which was erroneously
bumped in 3.0.3 compared to 3.0.2 .
Distributions are strongly
encouraged to use 3.0.4 instead of 3.0.3 .

l/libjpeg-turbo-2.0.5-i586-1.txz : Upgraded .
This update fixes bugs and a security issue :
Fixed an issue in the PPM reader that caused a buffer overrun in cjpeg ,
TJBench , or the `tjLoadImage ( ) ` function if one of the values in a binary
PPM / PGM input file exceeded the maximum value defined in the file 's header
and that maximum value was less than 255 .

As a matter of policy and since the rule already exists in
/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/ , we should not install a rules file in /etc .
Note that since the file was installed as a .new , upgrading the package
will not remove it and it will need to be removed manually .
It 's harmless
if it remains , though .

This update fixes a security issue :
A malicious actor who intentionally exploits the lack of effective
limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals
can , through the use of specially crafted referrals , cause a recursing
server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process
the referral .
This has at least two potential effects :
The performance of
the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work
required to perform these fetches , and the attacker can exploit this
behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack
with a high amplification factor .

Greetings !
After three months in / testing , the PAM merge into the main tree
is now complete .
When updating , be sure to install the new pam , cracklib , and
libpwquality packages or you may find yourself locked out of your machine .
Otherwise , these changes should be completely transparent and you should n't
notice any obvious operational differences .
Be careful if you make any changes
in /etc / pam.d/ - leaving an extra console logged in while testing PAM config
changes is a recommended standard procedure .
Thanks again to Robby Workman ,
Vincent Batts , Phantom X , and ivandi for help implementing this .
It 's not
done yet and there will be more fine - tuning of the config files , but now we
can move on to build some other updates .
Enjoy !

Hey folks , just a heads - up that PAM is about to be merged into the main tree .
We can't have it blocking other upgrades any longer .
The config files could be
improved ( adding support for pam_krb5 and pam_ldap , for example ) , but they 'll
do for now .
Have a good weekend , and enjoy these updates ! :-)

Time to quarantine these python2 modules and pin the versions where they
are ( or in the case of setuptools , downgrade to the last version that does n't

This will keep most of the standard python2 add - ons in one package
so that we can upgrade modules for python3 without having to worry about
python2 support getting dropped upstream .

The Adobe Photoshop tutorial will show you how to create icon that resemble the new icons included with Adobe Photoshop CS3 .
This tutorial is quick and easy .
With the old icons it was hard to tell which program each one represented .
The new icons are simple and easier to recognize .
The funny thing is that this tutorial is done using Adobe Photoshop CS2 .
I have n’t upgraded to the CS3 version yet .
Start with a new document 120×120 pixels with a white ( # FFFFFF ) background .
Create a new layer .
Using the Rectangular Marquee Tool create a selection slightly smaller than the canvas .
Fill the select with any black .
Now open the Blending Options Window by right clicking the layer and selecting Blending Options .
Now Apply the following settings .
Gradient Overlay .
Double click the gradient and adjust like below .
Drop Shadow :
Select OK to apply the changes .
Your image should look like the one below .
Now select the text tool .
Open the text options and apply the following options :
Now type your text on the layer .
Now open the Blending Options for the layer and apply the following options .
Gradient Overlay :
Here is the gradient I used :
Apply the settings and you are finished .
You now have a Adobe Photoshop CS3 styled icon .
You can also apply different colors to the gradient to create icons like the other icons in Adobe Creative Suite CS3 .
Moths are able to hover serenely because their antennae act like tiny gyroscopes , report researchers who let the insects fly after cutting off their antennae and supergluing them back on .
In a second study , another team built a small robocopter to test a theory of insect flight .
The robot reproduced insect behaviors such as angling down in a headwind and crashing over featureless terrain , which may explain reports that bees have drowned while skimming mirror - still water .
To hover without crashing , an insect must be able to compensate for drift caused by , say , a cross breeze or a mistimed wing flap .
Under daylight , researchers believe that sharp - eyed insects such as dragonflies maintain a steady flight position by watching their surroundings for cues .
But vision can be unreliable in the shade or at night , leading other insects such as flies to rely more on tiny forces felt during flight .
Now add moths to that list .
Using three high - speed video cameras , researcher Sanjay Sane of the University of Washington and colleagues observed tiny , repetitive forces shaking the antennae of a hawk moth as it hovered over a flower .
The timing of the forces — twice every wing beat — indicated they were equivalent to the force that holds up a gyroscope or causes a swinging pendulum to twist under Earth 's rotation .
The moth 's wing beats rattled its antennae , which in turn resisted any motion of the insect 's head .
The researchers found that motion - sensitive cells in the base of the moth 's antennae were picking up these forces and likely forwarding them to its brain 's flight control circuitry , using the gryoforces to filter its own motion from its surroundings and make midair course corrections .
To confirm the idea , they clipped the moth 's antennae just above the base .
Suddenly the insect began smacking into walls [ see video here ] .
But when the researchers reattached the antennae with superglue , much of its lost stability was restored [ compare flight after reattachment to normal flight ] .
" We did n't realize how dramatic it would be .
We thought it'd be more subtle , " Sane says .
The result , reported online February 8 by Science , suggests that flies , moths and probably other insects have all converged on the same solution for drift , says insect physiologist Mark Frye of the University of California , Los Angeles .
Another principle of insect flight holds that forward - moving honeybees and other fliers get their orientation from the motion of the ground below them .
From an insect 's point of view , a spot on the ground would seem to zoom past ( because it is the bug that is moving ) at an angular speed set by the ratio between the insect 's ground speed and its height .
( It is like the view from a plane : the closer it is to the ground , the faster the ground appears to zip by . )
To study the idea , researchers at France 's CNRS ( National Center for Scientific Research ) and the University of the Mediterranean , in Marseille , built a small , 100 - gram helicopter with a 30 - centimeter - wide rotor and tethered it to a pole [ see image above ] .
A downward - pointing camera recorded the craft 's angular speed and adjusted its height to keep that speed constant .
So if the helicopter approached the ground , for example , it would register a faster angular speed and ascend to throttle back .
In a Current Biology paper appearing online February 8 , the scientists report they reproduced several features of insect flight :
The helicopter ascended from the ground after an initial thrust pitched it forward ; descended in a strong wind and followed a diagonal line while landing ; and it crashed when the researchers removed any sign of contrast from the ground .
Although reports conflict , bees may sometimes crash when flying over still water for the same reason : with no ground as a cue , their apparent speed is zero so they descend to gain speed .
( Sane notes that moths also " crash " to take drinks . )
" I have never heard of bees descending and crashing into water that is mirror - smooth , but I would n't be surprised , " Frye says , because experiments have shown that bees do seem to fly by monitoring apparent motion .
He says the authors have taken a proposed rule of insect flight " and then incorporated it into a control scheme for a stable flying robot — and it works .
That is very cool indeed . "

If you think the problems facing the world 's exploding cities are insurmountable then you need to spend a few hours on a bike alongside the former mayor of Bogota .
That 's how I spent Thursday afternoon , and it left me with new hope for the global south , not to mention the bloated ' burbs of Greater Vancouver .
Enrique Peñalosa presided over the transition of a city that the world -- and many residents -- had given up on .
Bogota had lost itself in slums , chaos , violence , and traffic .
During his three - year term , Penalosa brought in initiatives that would seem impossible in most cities , even here in the wealthy north .
He built more than a hundred nurseries for children .
He built 50 new public schools and increased enrolment by 34 percent .
He built a network of libraries .
He created a highly - efficient , " bus highway " transit system .
He built or reconstructed hundreds of kilometers of sidewalks , more than 300 kilometres of bicycle paths , pedestrian streets , and more than 1,200 parks .
He did it all , in part , by declaring a war on private cars .
What makes us happy ?
Peñalosa explained the philosophy behind this war -- and Bogota 's transformation -- earlier Thursday during a plenary lecture at the World Urban Forum .
He began with a sobering reminder to the mayors of developing world cities :
" If you base progress on per capita income , then the developing world will not catch up with rich countries for the next three or four hundred years .
The difference between our incomes is growing all the time .
So we can't define our progress in terms of income , because that will guarantee our failure .
We need to find another measure of success . "
The measure he came up with was shockingly simple .
Happiness .
" And what are our needs for happiness ? " he asked .
" We need to walk , just as birds need to fly .
We need to be around other people .
We need beauty .
We need contact with nature .
And most of all , we need not to be excluded .
We need to feel some sort of equality . "
Before you dismiss Peñalosa as some hemp - hatted revolutionary , remember that this is a guy who titled his first book Capitalism : The Best Option .
The problem in Bogota was that most people did n't have access to the public space that is supposed to make such happy things happen .
The wealthy had turned city sidewalks into parking lots for cars .
Public parks had been fenced off , essentially privatized by neighbours .
And for years , the government had been blowing its budgets on highways and road improvements , with the encouragement of Japan 's international development agency , which was apparently in the business of creating new markets for Japan 's carmakers .
So while the wealthy in Bogota could spend their weekends in country clubs or private gardens , the poor had little but jammed streets and televisions to occupy their leisure time .
Peñalosa resolved to establish a balance .
Peñalosa 's official War on Cars began when he ordered the sidewalks cleared of cars .
That triggered a movement to impeach him -- unsuccessful , since it was in fact illegal for people to park on the sidewalks .
He then launched a system which banned 40 percent of vehicles from the roads during rush hour .
Peñalosa convinced his city council to raise the tax on gasoline , and used half the revenues to fund a rapid bus system that now serves more than 500,000 citizens .
After Bogota 's first wildly popular " Car - Free Day " in 2000 , residents voted in a referendum to make the event an annual affair .
Most powerfully , the city was transformed from a place of hopelessness to one of civic pride .
Pedaling with the rock star of WUF
I 've never seen a crowd of planners , politicians and sustainability wonks go wild like they did after Peñalosa 's address .
The guy got a standing ovation .
Stuart Ramsey , a B.C. transportation engineer , explained why .
" Bogota has demonstrated that it is possible to make dramatic change to how we move around our cities in a very short timeframe , " he said .
" It 's simply a matter of choosing to do so .
We could improve our air quality and dramatically reduce our emissions anytime we want .
It 's easy to do .
For example , we can improve the capacity of our existing bus system without adding a single bus .
All it would take is a can of paint , and you 'd have dedicated bus lanes .
It does n't require huge amounts of money .
It simply requires a choice . "
Peñalosa now advises cities around the world on how to make sense of their own transportation systems .
I tagged along with the former mayor and his entourage of Colombian politicians and activists as they hit Robson on a fleet of rented bikes .
I observed the first rule of Colombian cycling : never break a sweat .
The second rule : establish a critical mass of riders , and you do n't really need to pay attention to traffic lights .
Peñalosa explained that he is actually a fan of traffic .
" First of all , it 's a sign that you have enough density to support transit .
Second , it is one of the best ways to get people out of their cars .
Anywhere you look in the world , when people use public transport , it 's not because of some high level of consciousness .
It 's because private driving is restricted .
What is the easiest way to restrict private cars ?
Traffic .
Just look at New York . "
It occurred to me that traffic is experienced differently in Bogota and Vancouver .
In Bogota , it 's the rich who sit alone behind the wheel in their rush hour frustration , dreaming of more lanes .
Here , I think it is generally the middle class and working poor : they own cars , but have to commute from the ' burbs because they can't afford to live in our jewel - box downtown .
Some might consider it only fair for the province to build the Gateway Program 's new bridge and highway lanes .
" Well , sometimes the solutions to our problems are not obvious , " responded Peñalosa between licks of his ice cream cone .
" We think that traffic jams are going to be solved by building more roads .
But that has never worked , anywhere in the world .
Building more roads will just lead to more traffic jams . "
A Vancouver connection
It would be nice if cities did n't have to wait until they were staring into the abyss before changing course .
But Peñalosa 's Bogota proves that change is not so much a matter of spending big money as it is a matter of choice .
" Transport is the only urban problem that actually gets worse as you get richer , " he said .
" It 's only solved by changes in our behaviour .
And this is always a political issue . "
What seems to have surprised Peñalosa is that his policies have been lauded by international environmental groups as green activism for their salubrious effects on local air , public health and greenhouse gas emissions .
But for him the idea of giving all citizens equal rights to transportation , education and public spaces have always been matters of social equity .
What pleases him most is the notion that , at least on Bogota 's greenways , children are no longer terrified of being hit by cars .
One more thing .
Where did Peñalosa find the inspiration to transform his city ?
Why , at Jericho Beach in 1976 , where his father was the secretary general of Habitat ' 76 .

The symbolism went a bit too far at a local wedding reception during the weekend .
Douglas County sheriff ’s officers responded Sunday evening to a call for help at a reception on 1900 Road north of Lawrence .
A guest who was a law enforcement officer had handcuffed the bride and groom together as a joke but did n’t have a handcuff key , sheriff ’s spokeswoman Lt. Kari Wempe said .
“ We came and unhandcuffed the bride and groom , ” Wempe said .
Wempe said she did n’t know who the officer was , but said it was someone from “ outside this jurisdiction . ”
“ We did n’t take a report because there was no criminal act , ” she said .
But the drugs have run into an obstacle that so far has been impassable .
Because they are radioactive , they are almost always administered in hospitals , not doctors ’ offices .
As a result , doctors are not paid by Medicare and private insurers for prescribing them , as they are when they give patients a more common treatment , chemotherapy .
In addition , most oncologists outside academic hospitals treat many different cancers and may be only vaguely familiar with the drugs , said Dr. Andrew D. Zelenetz , chief of the lymphoma service at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
“ There are a number of barriers , ” Dr. Zelenetz said .
Dr. Press and Dr. Zelenetz acknowledge that they have their own financial incentives to support the drugs .
Dr. Press has been paid to speak at medical education seminars sponsored by the makers of the drugs .
Dr. Zelenetz has been paid when the companies sponsor clinical trials at Memorial Sloan - Kettering .
But both said the money was a small part of their total income and had not colored their views .
Some patients say they would not have received Bexxar and Zevalin if they had not demanded them .
Mr. Wheeler of Kalamazoo , Mich. , said he received Bexxar in April 2004 only after insisting on it when his lymphoma recurred .
“ I told my local oncologist , I want Bexxar , you give me a referral , ” Mr. Wheeler said .
“ I ’ve been a real pain . ”
Mr. Wheeler , whose lymphoma was diagnosed in 2000 and recurred in 2003 , has been cancer - free since receiving Bexxar .
His cancer was growing when he received the infusion .
He thinks he would be dead by now if he had not received the drug .
Ms. Stephens feels similarly .
She was diagnosed with lymphoma in December 1998 , and chemotherapy proved both difficult and ineffective .
By August 1999 , her disease was spreading .
“ Every lymph node in my body was involved , ” she said .
She received Bexxar as part of a clinical trial in January 2000 and quickly began gaining strength .
She has remained in remission since , she said .
Zevalin and Bexxar are the first in a new class of drugs called radioimmunotherapies .
Essentially , they deliver radioactive particles directly to cancerous cells to kill them .
Idec , now part of Biogen Idec , invented Zevalin .
Corixa , a Seattle company bought by GlaxoSmithKline , developed Bexxar .
Both drugs are very expensive , costing about $ 25,000 per treatment .
But one dose is usually enough .
The cost of the drugs is similar to a full four - month regimen of chemotherapy and Rituxan , another lymphoma treatment .
The Helsinki District Court has dealt another blow to CSS , the copy - protection scheme used in commercial DVDs .
In a ruling issued today , the court found that CSS is " ineffective " as a form of DRM and that the two defendants cited for violating Finnish copyright law were not guilty .
After Finland 's copyright laws were changed in late 2005 to harmonize with a 2001 EU copyright directive , a group of Finnish copyright activists put up a web site that echoed information that has been easily available on the Internet ( and T - shirts ) for years : how to crack and circumvent CSS .
They then turned themselves into the police for violating Finland 's new copyright laws .
Two of the activists were charged with illegally manufacturing and distributing a circumventing product along with providing a service to " circumvent an effective technological measure . "
During the court proceedings , expert witnesses testified as to the ineffectiveness of CSS as a DRM system , an argument the court found compelling .
" [ S ] ince a Norwegian hacker succeeded in circumventing CSS protection used in DVDs in 1999 , end - users have been able to get with easy tens of similar circumventing software from the Internet even free of charge , " wrote the court .
" Some operating systems come with this kind of software pre-installed ....
CSS protection can no longer be held ' effective ' as defined in law . "
The decision may be appealed by the government , which apparently brought the case independent of the copyright holders or the DVD Copy Control Association , which administers CSS .
Given the fact that the Helsinki District Court is at the bottom of Finland 's legal system , this case is by no means precedent setting .
That said , the implications could be far - reaching .
All EU member nations were required to implement the EU 's copyright directive , which defines a technological measure as being effective if " where the use of a protected work or other subject - matter is controlled by the rights - holders through application of an access control or protection process , such as
encryption , scrambling or other transformation of the work or other subject - matter or a copy control mechanism , which achieves the protection objective . "
CSS no longer achieves the protection objective , according to the Helsinki court , and if other European courts interpret the directive in a similar manner , CSS could be declared " officially " ineffective .
There is no reason why it would stop with CSS , either .
Cracks such as DVD Jon 's reverse - engineering of FairPlay could fall into that category .
It could even open the door to AACS being found ineffective , should the war between hackers and the AACS Licensing Authority tilt decisively in the direction of anti-DRM forces .
All of that is in the mysterious future at this point .
If Big Content gets the idea that EU member states will follow the lead of the Helsinki District Court on DRM measures , it will certainly lobby for a looser definition of what constitutes effective DRM while ratching up the level of DRM it employs .
A mother and her three daughters who forced two toddlers to take part in a " dog fight " and filmed it walked free from court yesterday .
The women , including the children 's mother , goaded the tearful brother and sister to punch each other and even use a magazine and hairbrush as weapons .
When the boy , who was in a nappy , stopped fighting they called him a " wimp " and " bloody faggot " .
Passing sentence at Plymouth crown court , Judge Francis Gilbert said the video taken of the fight was " shocking " .
He said : " You laughed at them , you mocked them , you swore at them .
You compelled them to hit each other even though they clearly did not want to .
You were cruel , callous , clearly causing the children to hurt each other for your own pleasure . "
He singled out the children 's grandmother , who had told police that she saw nothing wrong with what they had done as it would " toughen them up " .
But the judge was persuaded not to jail them immediately , instead giving the four a one - year suspended sentence and ordering them to do 100 hours of community work .
The court was told how the mother of the children , Zara Care , 21 , and her sisters , Serenza Olver , 29 , and Danielle Olver , 19 , had met at the home of their mother , Carole Olver , 48 .
They formed a circle in the living room around the children , a three - year - old girl and a boy of two , and urged them to fight while Zara Care capturing the whole episode on video .
In the film up to six adults , including a man , are seen chatting and smoking .
As the two children run around the room , one of the women can be heard to say to them , " Do you want to play ? ' before pushing the boy towards the girl .
The children start circling and slapping each other - goaded by four women , who can be seen and heard laughing .
The boy , who is wearing just a nappy and a T - shirt , is then floored by a blow from his sister and lies on the floor crying .
After clambering on to an armchair to escape , he buries his head under a cushion but a woman in the room tells him : " Get up - do n't be a wimp all your life . "
He staggers to his feet and punches his sister in the mouth , and , as she falls to the ground , is encouraged to kick her .
A female voice says : " And again , whilst she 's down , boot her . "
He then tries to leave the room but an older child blocks his path and the girl again runs over and pummels his back with her fists .
The boy is then told by a female voice : " Get up and punch her , you bloody faggot . "
He tries to refuse , but then grabs a large black hairbrush and begins to beat his sister , while a woman is heard to say : " He needs weapons , she just has a fist . "
The girl is caught in the mouth by the brush and begins to scream and lifts her arm in the air , appealing for help from an unseen adult - but is turned away .
At this point , an older child in the room can be heard to say : " Is it our turn yet ? "
The film ends with the two toddlers screaming and crying , and an adult saying : " That 's enough . "
During the video the women hurl a stream of orders , such as " jump on him " , " kick her " and " hit his face " .
The word " punch " is heard more than 20 times .
The video came to light after the children 's father , a serving soldier , returned from Iraq and decided to show his parents footage from the video camera the women used .
He had expected it to feature the children playing but he was horrified to come upon the eight - minute film of them fighting .
David Gittins , prosecuting , said that the father compared what he saw to a " dog fight " and was reduced to tears .
He subsequently went to social services , who called in police .
The children 's grandmother , a mother of eight , showed no remorse when she was interviewed , insisting it would " harden " them up , it was stated .
The judge criticised her for still seeming defiant .
The three other defendants wept as the offence was described .
Defending the women , who admitted child cruelty offences , Rupert Taylor said they were not wicked .
The three daughters had never been in trouble with the police before .
But they were ill - educated , had few advantages in life , and did not realise what they were doing was abhorrent .
Mr Taylor said that although they had treated the infants so badly , family was important for them and they were all very close .
" They are ashamed and frightened , " he said .
The judge said the " horror " of what they did meant it was tempting to jail them .
But the judge added that he took into account the fact that two of the women , Serenza and Danielle , had children of their own to look after - and also said that Zara 's biggest punishment was that her children had been taken out of her care and were now being looked after by other relatives .
Backstory

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
When senators from opposing parties call each other " friend " and pat each other as they talk , there 's a fighting chance they 're angling to wring each other 's neck .
So it appeared on NBC's " Meet the Press " on Sunday when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia and Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina testily exchanged views on President Bush 's Iraq policy and troop welfare .
An impromptu troop surge debate turned into a temper surge .
" Just wash your hands of Iraq , " an animated Graham said to the war critics , including the Democrat seated to his immediate right .
" History will judge us , my friend . "
" It 's been a hard month , Lindsey , " Webb commiserated , wearing a tight smile .
" You need to calm down , my friend . "
" Lindsey 's had a hard month , " Webb repeated .
" It ai n't about Lindsey having a hard month , " Graham snapped .
The Democrat , a Vietnam veteran , lost an effort in the Senate last week to require specified periods of home time for troops deployed in the war , his bill winning majority support but falling short of the 60 votes needed to proceed .
He took sharp objection when Graham asserted that high re-enlistment numbers are a vote of confidence in the Iraq policy by the troops .
MORE : Bill to lock in troops ' time off falls short " This is one thing I really take objection to — may I speak ? — is politicians who try to put their political views into the mouths of soldiers , " Webb said over his opponent 's interruptions .
He placed his hand briefly on Graham 's back , then jerked his thumb in the Republican 's direction .
" Have you been to Iraq ? " Graham demanded .
" I 've covered two wars as a correspondent , " Webb said .
" I have been to Afghanistan as a journalist . "
Graham : " Have you been to Iraq and talked to the soldiers ? "
Webb : " You know , you 've never been to Iraq , Lindsey . "
The Republican pointed out he 's been there seven times .
" You know , " Webb said dismissively , " you can see the dog and pony shows .
That 's what congressman do .
" Why do n't you go look at the polls , Lindsey , instead of the seven or eight people that are put in front of you when you make your congressional visit ? "
Graham tried to ease the tension .
It did n't work .
" Let 's — something we can agree on , " he said , placing his hand on Webb 's arm .
" We both admire the men and the women in uniform . " " Do n't put political words in their mouth , " Webb interrupted .
The exchange ended with Graham praising the troops : " God bless them and let 's make sure they can win because they can . "
And Webb getting the final , combative word : " I 'll let them judge what you said . "

Powerful Python One - Liners
This page is devoted to short programs that can perform powerful operations called Python One - Liners .
You may ask : why should I care ?
The answer is profound : if you cannot read and write one - liner code snippets , how can you ever hope to read and write more complicated codebases ?
Python one - liners can be just as powerful as a long and tedious program written in another language designed to do the same thing .
In other languages ( think : Java ) this would be nearly impossible , but in Python , it 's a lot easier to do .
The trick is to think of something that will " do a lot with a little . "
Most importantly , reading and writing about Python one - liners ( e.g. , in this post ) is a lot of fun !
There 's even a whole subculture around who can write the shortest code for a given problem .
It would be awesome if this page expanded to the point where it needs some sort of organization system .
( Edit :
The one - liners are now sorted more or less by ease - of - understanding -- from simple to hard .
Please use a " sorted insert " for your new one - liner . )
The source code is contributed from different Python coders ---
Thanks to all of them !
Special thanks to the early contributor JAM .
Of course , there is debate on whether one - liners are even Pythonic .
As a rule of thumb : if you use one - liners that are confusing , difficult to understand , or to show off your skills , they tend to be Unpythonic .
However , if you use well - established one - liner tricks such as list comprehension or the ternary operator , they tend to be Pythonic .
So , use your one - liner superpower wisely !

Overview : 10 one - liners that fit into a tweet
I visited this page oftentimes and I loved studying the one - liners presented above .
Thanks for creating this awesome resource , JAM , and RJW !
Because I learned a lot from studying the one - liners , I thought why not revive the page ( after almost ten years since the last change happened ) ?
After putting a lot of effort into searching the web for inspiration , I created the following ten one - liners .
Some of them are more algorithmic ( e.g. Quicksort ) .
Some day , I will add a detailed explanation here - but for now , you can read this blog article to find explanations .

Find All Indices of an Element in a List
Say , you want to do the same as the list .
index ( element ) method but return all indices of the element in the list rather than only a single one .
In this one - liner , you ’re looking for element ' Alice ' in the list lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , ' Alice ' , ' Alice ' ] so it even works if the element is not in the list ( unlike the list . index ( ) method ) .

Editing a list of files in place
I came up with this one - liner in response to an article that said it could n't be done as a one - liner in Python .
What this does is replace the substring " at " by " op " on all lines of all files ( in place ) under the path specified ( here , the current path ) .
Caution :
Do n't run this on your home directory or you 're going to get all your text files edited .

( ) ) 12 13 sys .

stdout .
write ( wh_spc_len / 4 * ' \\ t ' + line .

stdout .
write ( ' \\ n \\
' ) 16 print ' \t \\ " ` " ' 17 18 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : == 19 main ( ) ()
This script generates a " one- liner " from make 's point of view .
Sony 's Open Source command - line tool for performing python one - liners using unix - like pipes
They call it " The Pyed Piper " or pyp .
It 's pretty similar to the -c way of executing python , but it imports common modules and has its own preset variable that help with splitting / joining , line counter , etc .
You use pipes to pass information forward instead of nested parentheses , and then use your normal python string and list methods .
Here is an example from the homepage :
Here , we take a Linux long listing , capture every other of the 5th through the 10th lines , keep the username and filename fields , replace " hello " with " goodbye " , capitalize the first letter of every word , and then add the text " is splendid " to the end :
ls - l | pyp " pp [ 5:11:2 ] | whitespace [ 2 ] , w [ - 1 ] | p.replace ( ' hello ' , ' goodbye ' ) | p.title ( ) , ' is splendid ' "
and the explanation :
This uses pyp's built - in string and list variables ( p and pp ) , as well as the variable whitespace and its shortcut w , which both represent a list based on splitting each line on whitespace ( whitespace = w = p.split ( ) ) .
The other functions and selection techniques are all standard Python .
Notice the pipes ( " | " ) are inside the pyp command .

They are the most remarkable pictures of one of the most hellish places on earth .
Never seen before , these astonishing photographs , lovingly hand - touched in colour to bring to life the nightmare of Passchendaele , were released this week to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the battle that , between July and November 1917 , claimed a staggering 2,121 lives a day and in total some quarter of a million Allied soldiers .
What was once pretty countryside around the Belgian village that gave the battlefield its name was reduced to an infernal swamp where the ground oozed with foul - smelling slime , and mustard gas that blistered the skin and made the lungs bleed .
Today , the Queen will attend a Last Post ceremony in Passchendaele at the Menin Gate , where a memorial arch is engraved with the names of the 54,896 Commonwealth soldiers who died with no known graves .
Scroll down for more
She will also visit the Tyne Cot cemetery , where 11,952 graves are laid out in neat concentric circles , their tombstones white against the green grass , in peaceful defiance of the brutal battle that took their lives .
One of the major conflicts of World War I , it was conceived by British Commander - in - Chief Sir Douglas Haig as a " big push " that would , finally , bring a breakthrough in the stalemate in Flanders .
Scroll down for more
Officially named the Third Battle of Ypres , the hope was that by breaking through German lines at this point on the Western Front , the Allies could reach the Belgian coast and capture the German submarine bases there .
The Allies prepared the way with a massive two - week bombardment in which 3,000 heavy guns sent more than four million shells pouring into the German lines .
Scroll down for more
Then , on July 31 , the troops poured into a No Man 's Land that within days and under torrential rain had become a sodden bog .
It became so deep that men , horses and pack mules drowned in it .
What was supposed to be a breakthrough became a battle of attrition .
By November , the British and Empire forces had advanced just five miles at terrible cost , to take the village of Passchendaele - which at least provided an excuse for them to call a halt .
Their one consolation was that the Germans had also suffered grievously .

Laborious task of culling 13 years of " johns ' " phone records continues
The time - consuming task of culling hundreds of pages of Pamela Martin & Associates ( PMA ) phone records from 1993 to 2006 continues , with the trend emerging that many of the phone numbers listed are disconnected , unlisted , cell phones , and hotels .
WMR has assembled a technical team that is working on reverse telephone number look - ups and other specialized searches for particular noteworthy individuals who reportedly used PMA services .
WMR has discovered that a brisk business occurred involving a number of hotels in the Washington , DC area , including the Washington Court Hotel , close to the U.S. Capitol and House and Senate office buildings .
Other hotels featured prominently include the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City , the same hotel that gained notoriety in the sexual assault case brought by Vanessa Perhach against NBC sportscaster Marv Albert in 1997 .
The hotel again became part of a major news story when Monica Lewinsky was interviewed by FBI agents in Room 1012 on January 16 , 1998 , as part of Kenneth Starr 's probe of President Clinton 's alleged " criminal activity related to the Paula Jones civil lawsuit . "
Other area hotels discovered as rendezvous points for PMA escorts and their clients include the Hyatt in Rosslyn , Virginia ; the Marriott on 22nd Street in Washington ; the Marriott in Vienna , Virginia ; and the Hilton in Crystal City , Virginia .
July 8 , 2007 -- Noteworthy numbers on Pamela Martin & Associates phone list beginning to emerge
A cursory examination of Pamela Martin & Associates ( PMA ) phone lists from 1994 , 1995 , and 2000 is beginning to show that so - called " Washington Madam " Deborah Jeane Palfrey 's contention , in her defense , that a number of influential public and private officials were clients of her escort agency is being borne out by matching phone records with Haines Crosscross Directories from the years 1994 , 1995 , and 2000 .
Perhaps explaining why the major media decided to ignore the escort story after ABC News spiked it , the phone number for a senior executive for CNN 's parent company , AOL Time Warner , appears on PMA records from 1995 .
In addition , Palfrey has maintained that she could not get a fair hearing in the District of Columbia because a number of federal law enforcement agents and officers were clients of PMA .
In fact , that is true .
A comparison of the PMA records with the Haines Crisscross Directory from 1995 shows that phone calls were made to the escort agency from the headquarters of the Federal Protective Service , which in 1995 was under the control of the General Services Administration and is now part of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Homeland Security Department .
Other calls were placed from extensions at the headquarters of the National Park Police .
In addition to the federal law enforcement agencies , other phone calls originated in 1995 from the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , the agency from which PMA client Randall Tobias resigned as administrator on April 27 , 2007 .
Other calls came from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , the independent government agency on K Street that claims to protect " the pensions of nearly 44 million American workers and retirees in 30,330 private single - employer and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans . "
Other calls identified from the 1995 records were from the United Services Organization ( USO ) World Headquarters Travel Office in Washington , DC .
The USO provides services for American military members around the world .
Other calls came from the District of Columbia Recreational and Playground Center on Kansas Street in Northeast Washington .
THE INSIDE STORY OF THE MIT BLACKJACK TEAM’S CONQUEST OF THE CASINOS .

The Back - Spotter
The Back - Spotter can count cards without even being seated at the blackjack table .
When the count gets hot — meaning the house is at a statistical disadvantage — this player will signal for the team ’s bettors to swoop in .
The Spotter
The Spotter counts cards while playing at the table .
Casinos screen for counters by watching for dramatic rises or drops in bets — a sure sign that a deck has gone hot or cold .
A Spotter avoids detection by resolutely sticking to the minimum bet on each hand .
When it ’s time to start betting big to take advantage of a favorable deck , he tips off his teammates .
The Gorilla
The Gorilla does n’t count at all :
He just bets big , all the time .
Typically , he adopts the pose of a drunken millionaire who has green to burn .
The Spotters ensure the Gorilla ’s ‘ luck ’ by steering him to tables where he ’s got greater than even odds of winning against the house .
The Big Player
The Big Player appears to be a type well known to the casinos : the high - rolling recreational gambler who ’s content to slowly bleed his money away through hours of competent play .
In reality , he ’s a Spotter with a Gorilla ’s bankroll .
He ’s not only counting cards , he ’s tracking the shuffle for the high cards that rob the house of its advantage .
A BP always plays a good deck , so he never has to lower his bets by much .
Fifty thousand dollars strapped to each thigh .
A hundred thousand dollars , in 10 bricks of hundreds , taped across my upper back .
Fifty thousand more Velcroed to my chest .

I try to control my breathing as I stroll through Logan International Airport .
Terminal C is buzzing and chaotic , an over - air - conditioned hive of college students escaping Boston for a long weekend .
I am dressed like everyone else : baggy jeans , baseball hat , scuffed sneakers .
But in my mind , I have as much chance of blending in as a radioactive circus clown .
There 's enough money hidden under my clothes to buy a two - bedroom condo .
And to top it off , there 's $ 100,000 worth of yellow plastic casino chips jammed into the backpack slung over my right shoulder .
My anxiety increases as I reach the security checkpoint .
I want to turn and run , but the security guard is staring at me , and I have no choice : I show him my ticket .
America West , flight 69 , Boston to Vegas .
The Friday night Neon Express .
He gestures with his head , and I drop my backpack onto the conveyor belt .
I know the chips will show up on the X - ray machine , but even if the guard makes me open the backpack , he wo n't realize how much money the yellow hunks of plastic represent .
The $ 100 bills are another matter .
This is an airport ; they can drag me to a windowless room in the basement and handcuff me to a chair .
They can confiscate my stash , call in the DEA , FBI , and IRS .
It will be up to me to prove that I 'm not a drug dealer .
To customs agents , $ 100 bills smell like cocaine .
In reality , I 'm a writer , with six pulpy thrillers under my belt , but today I 'm on the scent of a real life story even more high - octane than any of my fictional jaunts .
I 'm ferrying money for Kevin Lewis , one of the best card counters alive .
He 's taking me back to his glory days when he ran a card team that hit Vegas for millions .
The guard does n't seem to be bothered by the bulges under my clothes .
He waves me through the metal detector , and I stumble toward my gate .
My heart rate has almost returned to normal when I spot Lewis standing near the back of the line of college kids waiting to board flight 69 .
He does n't look up , waiting until I am right next to him to show me the edges of a mischievous grin .
" Pretty intense , " he says .
I nod .
His voice is full of bravado , a stark contrast to his appearance .
Dressed in a gray sweatshirt and khaki shorts , Lewis looks like a stereotypical college student .
His features are ethnic , but beyond that , indeterminate .
He could be Asian , Latino , even Italian or Russian .
He is a carbon copy of thousands of other kids who call Boston home .
" There 's got to be an easier way to carry your stake , " I finally say , adjusting the bricks of $ 100 bills that are sliding down my legs .
" Sure , " Lewis responds .
" We went through a gadget phase .
You know , James Bond kind of stuff .
But hollow crutches are a lot harder to explain to the FBI than Velcro .
" He is n't joking .
The truth is , Kevin Lewis is n't his real name .
This amiable kid lived a double life for more than four years .
In Boston , he was a straight - A engineering major at MIT .
In Las Vegas , he was something more akin to a rock star .
He partied with Michael Jordan and Howard Stern .
He dated a cheerleader from the Los Angeles Rams and got drunk with Playboy centerfolds .
He was chased off a riverboat in Louisiana and narrowly avoided being thrown into a Bahamian jail .
He was audited by the IRS , tailed by private investigators , and had his picture faxed around the globe .
Along the way , he amassed a small fortune , which he keeps in neat stacks of Benjamins in a closet by his bed .
It 's rumored he made somewhere between $ 1 million and $ 5 million .
THE BABY - FACED CARD COUNTERS TURNED " 21 " INTO A HIGH - ROLLING ARBITRAGE GAME .
For six years in the 1990s , Lewis was a principal member of the MIT Blackjack Team , an infamous cabal of hyper - geniuses and anarchistic whiz kids who devised a method of card counting that took the gaming world completely by surprise .
Funded , in part , by shadowy investors and trained in mock casinos set up in classrooms , dingy apartments , and underground warehouses across Boston , Lewis and his gang used their smarts to give themselves an incredible advantage at the only truly beatable game in the pit .
A baby - faced card - counting team possessed with impressive mathematical skills — here was a novelty that turned blackjack into an arbitrage opportunity .
Their system was so successful , it took nearly two years before the casinos began to catch on — engaging in a cat - and - mouse war with the well - trained MIT conspirators .
To the casinos , there 's no difference between legal card counters like Lewis , who use their brains to beat the game , and the brash , increasingly high tech cheaters who steal tens of millions of dollars from the resorts every year .
In response , the casinos have developed equally sophisticated means of identifying , tracking , and eliminating their enemies : i.e. , anyone who does n't consistently lose .
" It 's Robin Hood against the Sheriff , " Lewis says , summing it up as we wait with the Vegas - bound crowd .
It 's an interesting analogy , yet it falls severely short .
In this story Robin Hood is stealing from the rich to give to himself .
And the sheriff has a thousand eyes , covering every inch of the sky .
The Team
" It started the summer after my junior year , " Lewis recalls .
" I had these two friends who were always disappearing for long weekends .
Both had dropped out of MIT , and neither one seemed to be interested in getting a job .
And yet they always seemed to have tons of money .
Hundred - dollar bills , all over the apartment . "
Andre Martinez and Steve Fisher ( their names , like those of the other members of the MIT Blackjack Team , have been changed ) were brilliant kids with a shared anarchistic streak : Martinez had mysteriously left MIT his senior year ;
Fisher had likewise quit with a semester to go before graduation .
Lewis was surprised when they asked to meet him late at night in a classroom on the Infinite Corridor , the long hallway that runs down the center of the MIT campus .
There , he was presented to a roomful of students he recognized from his math and science courses — the core of the MIT Blackjack Team .
At the helm was a man in his mid-thirties with frighteningly bad teeth and equally poor hygiene , a former assistant professor who went by the name Micky Rosa .
As Rosa explained it , the team had been around for nearly two decades .
In the beginning , it was more of an after - school club , a place for mathematical geniuses to play cards and pontificate on card - counting theory .
MIT being MIT — the world 's premier stable of brilliant young math and science prodigies ( many of whom had always been a little too smart for their own good ) — it was n't long before the blackjack club had reached an elite level of play .
In recent years , their after - school hobby had become a business .
Rosa had gathered more than $ 1 million in seed money and was organizing regular assaults on Vegas and other casino centers around the country : riverboats in Louisiana , Chicago , and Mississippi , and Indian reservations in Connecticut and Michigan .
He was recruiting a select group of students , and Lewis fit the profile .
At first , Lewis was skeptical .
" I 'd read a bit about blackjack , and I always thought of card counters the same way the casinos thought of them .
Bald white men with glasses , hunched over the cards , scrapping out their tiny advantage .
But Micky was talking about something much bigger . "

The Game
Blackjack is beatable .
Walk into any bookstore and head to the section on gambling .
An entire industry has been spawned by the belief that a mix of mathematics and practice can unlock the casinos ' coffers .
Beginning with the publication of Edward Thorp 's Beat the Dealer , back in 1962 , an arsenal of card - counting systems has bolstered the popular notion that blackjack is the one game in the casino where the player can have an edge over the house .
Unlike roulette and craps , blackjack has a memory ; past play can affect future outcomes .
By keeping track of the past , goes the theory , it 's possible to predict , and thus take advantage of , the future .
On paper , the theory looks pretty good .
Blackjack itself is a simple game .
The player gets cards , the dealer gets cards , and whoever gets closer to 21 wins .
Though most novices believe the object is to get the best hand possible , the real point of blackjack is merely to beat the dealer 's hand .
If the dealer busts ( goes over 21 ) , the player automatically wins .
Since the dealer has to keep hitting until he reaches 17 , a deck with more high cards than low is dangerous to the dealer .
Likewise , since a natural blackjack ( 21 ) pays 1.5 to 1 , a deck rich in high cards offers more chances to the player for a bigger payout .
Based on these two facts , Thorp , a mathematics professor at UC Berkeley , developed a system to keep track of the ratio of high to low cards left in the deck .
With his " hi - lo " method of counting , Thorp could beat the dealer .
Adjusting both betting and play to take advantage of a high ratio , Thorp and his protégés found that it 's possible to maintain an advantage over the house of approximately 2 percent .
Playing against a single deck dealt down to the bottom , in a controlled environment without supervision , Thorp discovered card counting to be a sure thing .
" WE RETURNED 154 PERCENT TO OUR INVESTORS .
TRY DOING THAT ON WALL STREET . "
Of course , if these conditions ever existed , they certainly do n't anymore .
To combat the card counters , the majority of casinos use six decks , deal no more than two - thirds of the way through , and utilize thousands of video cameras to watch everyone they perceive as a potential threat .
A player armed with Thorp 's book , hundreds of hours of practice , and a good head for numbers can still eke out a small profit from a six - deck shoe — but since card - counting strategy relies on the player 's ability to raise and lower his bet to take advantage of the count , it does n't take long for the casino to catch on .
In Las Vegas , the casino has the right to bar anyone it wants .
( Atlantic City has more " civilized " rules :
The casinos can't bar card counters , however they can annoy and harass them with constant shuffles , dealer changes , and other countermeasures . )
Individual card counters who follow Thorp 's system and succeed quickly find themselves first unwelcome and then extinct :
In gaming parlance , they 're dinosaurs .
By the early ' 70s , the casinos had overcome their initial panic .
They had learned to identify and contain the enemy .
So the enemy did what every good enemy does :
It got smarter .
The Scheme
The team was built around card counting 's major innovation since Thorp 's book : a division of labor .
While it 's easy to spot a lone card counter raising and lowering his bet to take advantage of its highs and lows , it 's much harder to catch a team of counters working together — dividing the roles of counting and betting between seemingly unrelated players .
The MIT team took this division of labor even further , refining the system by cycling in fresh young faces from the deep pool of mathematical talent back in Boston .
Furthermore , every member was given a faux persona , to be better able to pass unnoticed among those one might naturally find in a casino setting .
But beneath the trappings of disguise there were only three basic positions : Spotters , Gorillas , and Big Players ( BPs ) .
The Spotters tended to be inconspicuous and would sit at the table , playing the minimum bet while counting the shoe .
( Back - Spotters were deployed during overly crowded casino conditions and would maintain a count while standing behind the seated players . )
When a count went positive — when there were a lot of high cards still to be played — a Spotter signaled either a Gorilla or a BP .
Gorillas did n't count at all :
They simply bet big until they were signaled that the count had gone back down .
BPs were Gorillas who had graduated to a more refined style , counting along with the Spotters after being called to the table .
BPs were able to maneuver along with the deal , taking advantage of shifts in the count by playing multiple hands and finding other ways to vary bets without raising the casino 's attention .
In either case , the player with the large action ( bets of $ 1,000 a hand or more ) did n't act like a counter .
He entered big and hardly varied his bet .
Likewise , the Spotters always bet the minimum , never raising or lowering no matter what the count .
Neither type of player fit the mold the casino pit bosses had been trained to look for .
And since the Spotters called the BP into the game only when the deck was hot , the big money was played only in highly advantageous circumstances .
The team worked at the mathematics — the expected advantages , the proper Spotter payouts , the appropriate BP betting scheme — in rigorous detail , with the aid of computers and countless hours of simulated play .
Average profit percentages ranged from between 10 and 20 percent per gambling foray , but could go much higher depending on the number of open tables and the number of possible player hours .
" The first year I played , we returned 154 percent to our investors , " brags Lewis .
" That 's after paying off expenses .
You try and do that on Wall Street . "
The real genius of the MIT scheme was how it turned the casinos ' own profiling techniques against them , using stereotypes to camouflage the big money bets .
F. Scott Schafer
The baby - faced card counters turned " 21 " into a high - rolling arbitrage game .
The MIT team thrived by choosing BPs who fit the casino mold of the young , foolish , and wealthy .
Primarily nonwhite , either Asian or Middle Eastern , these were the kids the casinos were accustomed to seeing bet a thousand bucks a hand .
Like many on the team , Kevin Lewis was part Asian , and could pass as the child of a rich Chinese or Japanese executive .
" When you 're recruiting , you do n't recruit white kids .
They look conspicuous .
Asian kids , Greek kids , dark skin fits in better with lots of money in the casinos .
White 20 - year - olds with $ 2 million bankrolls stand out , " explains Andrew Tay , one of Lewis ' teammates .
" A geeky Asian kid with $ 100,000 in his wallet did n't raise any eyebrows . "
Playing against type was also part of the formula .
Jill Thomas is red -haired , blue - eyed , and partial to miniskirts — a high - powered consultant who graduated at the top of her class from Harvard Business School .
Nobody would ever guess that she had spent hundreds of hours training in mock casinos set up by the MIT team .
" During the day , I 'd dress like I was going to the pool .
At night , I 'd wear tons of makeup and a low - cut top .
I 'd play the dumb chick , and nobody ever suspected I was spotting .
The pit bosses helped me play my hands . "
To further confuse the casinos and to push profits even higher , Lewis and his buddies mastered practical techniques that expanded on card - counting theory , with almost magical results .
Two of the tricks that became a staple of the MIT system , shuffle tracking and ace tracking , exploit a concept called the nonrandom shuffle .
Because of time constraints , blackjack dealers cannot achieve completely random redistributions during the shuffle .
This means that certain packets of cards remain close enough together to be " tracked " through the deck .
By watching a group of low cards , for example , it 's possible to cut the deck ( players assist the dealer by placing the cut card into the shuffled stack ) in such a way that some low cards never have to be played .
Likewise , a good shuffle tracker can " predict " a string of high cards and raise his bet even before the count goes positive .
Along with tracking groups of high or low cards , a trained counter can spot individual aces or even series of aces .
Since drawing an ace adds roughly a 37 percent advantage to the player 's expected take , tracking a series of aces through the shuffle can be extremely profitable .
And again , ace tracking helps in camouflaging counting play :
The BP raises his bet to " predict " the ace , not based on the count .
It did n't take long for Kevin Lewis to realize that the MIT team had taken card counting to an entirely new level .
Before heading to Vegas , he had to pass a variety of tests , all held in mock casinos spread throughout Boston .
His first task was mastering the art of spotting .
Martinez and Rosa dealt him hand after hand , asking for the count at various intervals .
" Martinez would try and distract me , asking all sorts of questions , making me fill out comp tickets — harassing me just like a real casino pit boss , " Lewis recalls .
" One time , they even had some girls dress up like cocktail waitresses to try and make me lose my count . "
After passing the Spotter test , Lewis moved on to the BP exam .
Called to a table midplay , a BP has to take the running count and convert it into the more accurate " true count , " by estimating how many cards are still left in the shoe .
That 's because a count of plus 10 — a ratio of 10 extra high cards to low left to be played — has a much higher value when there is only one deck left in the shoe , as opposed to six .
Once the true count is established , a BP has to determine the proper bet .
On the test , Lewis was asked to make highly complex decisions — such as when to split pairs against certain counts — while Martinez and Rosa graded his play from across the room .
" One mistake can cost a team a large amount of their expected advantage , " Lewis says .
" We had these charts calculated out that could tell you what a single error in play costs in terms of profit . "
After passing the BP exam , Lewis moved to real world application .
During Lewis ' first weekend in Vegas , the team made $ 100,000 .
He was hooked and soon became one of the team 's premier players .
Personally , he did n't have problems with the ethics of the venture .
" It is n't really even gambling .
It 's no different than the stock market .
We use our brains to earn a profit .
It is n't illegal .
And it is n't cheating . "
But it was something Lewis decided to keep secret from his family and friends , separating his Vegas lifestyle from his world in Boston .
He knew that others would n't understand .
A Lewis classmate who decided against joining the team put voice to Lewis ' concerns .
" They approached me my junior year , " says Matt Devonshire , summing it up over a friendly game of poker .
" I wanted no part of it .
I did n't care that it was n't technically illegal .
It just felt wrong .
There was so much about it that seemed so shady . "
The Life
Fake names .
Fake IDs .
Individual bankrolls in the hundreds of thousands .
VIP suites .
Limousines with fully stocked minibars .
Casino hosts offering carte blanche in a city that had built its reputation on easy access to a thousand different forms of sin .
For a group of young math and engineering geeks , this was heaven on earth .
In the beginning , Rosa ran the team like a business , enforcing stringent rules against alcohol , fraternizing with the local fauna , any extracurriculars that did n't involve blackjack felt and hi-lo ratios .
But as the real money began to pour in , Lewis and his teammates broke out , starting their own squads with their own capital .
" I was Donkey Boy my first trip out , " reminisces Andrew Tay , speaking of the spring of 1994 .
" We were at one of the clubs ; I think it was at the Hard Rock .
Lewis hands me a Ziploc bag .
' Put this in your pants , ' he tells me .
' What is it ? , ' I say .
' Do n't ask . '
It slipped down my leg as I walked across the dance floor .
I went to the bathroom and pulled it out .
It was $ 200,000 in chips . "
Over the next year , the profits continued to multiply at a staggering rate .
Although there were losing weekends —
Lewis described how one night he blew $ 100,000 in just two hands — over time , the team was mathematically destined to win .
The more hands played , the more certain the profits .
" Around July 4 , 1995 , " Lewis recalls , " we had this phenomenal weekend .
All told , we won about $ 400,000 .
A bunch of us were sitting around the pool at the Mirage , and I had a duffel bag under my lounge chair .
The duffel had $ 950,000 in cash inside .
I was 22 years old .
What the hell was I going to do with that kind of money ? "
At the time , the casinos made it easy to stay liquid .
This was before the era of the CTR — the cash transaction report — which obligates the casinos to report any transaction greater than $ 10,000 .
" In the old days , " Tay explains , " you 'd win a quarter - million dollars , and they 'd give it to you in cash .
On New Year 's 1996 , I walked from the Mirage to the MGM Grand with a paper New Year 's hat filled with $ 180,000 . "
Back in Boston , Lewis and his friends kept the money in cash , declaring the winnings in the " other " category on their IRS forms .
" You 'd find $ 100 bills all over my apartment .
Dig in my laundry , there would be $ 100,000 under my socks . "
Although the money was a testament to the brilliance of the MIT system , the overwhelming success began to breed a sense of paranoia .
Things were getting too easy :
With each mega-casino that opened on the Vegas landscape , the pot of potential riches seemed to grow bigger .
Other card - counting teams were cropping up at an alarming rate , some reportedly having as many as 100 members .
At major casino openings , it was n't unusual to see dozens of Spotters working the same pit .
Sooner or later , Lewis felt , someone was going to notice what they were doing .
The paranoia , it turns out , was justified .
With the mega - resorts came a new influx of corporate money — and a corporate sense of cautiousness .
The new casinos had billion - dollar price tags ; Vegas had more to lose than ever before .
The Heat
My first few days in Las Vegas , I get a small taste of the new paranoia .
I awake one morning to discover that my laptop has been stolen out of my locked hotel room while I slept .
The next afternoon , I meet with Beverly Griffin , head of the Griffin Detective Agency , the leading " intelligence provider " to the gaming community worldwide .
She agrees to see me — but wants to meet in a crowded outdoor café adjacent to the Paris hotel — a chaotic public setting .
It 's impossible to use a tape recorder , or otherwise get her words on permanent record .
" For 34 years , we 've been out here on the Strip collecting information for clients all over the world , " she begins , her kindly features muted by the shadow of a faux Eiffel Tower .
" Almost every casino in the world uses us .
We 've got agents working 24 hours a day , covering every shift at every hotel .
If someone wins a bunch of money , leaves one casino , and walks down the street to another , you can be sure we 'll have someone watching him when he gets there . "
The most important weapon in the war against counters and cheaters is information .
The Griffin Agency has spent more than three decades developing new methods of gathering and relaying that information , acting as the eyes , ears , and arms of nearly every casino on earth .
In the beginning , it was all about the human element : agents following suspects across the casino floor , identifying them from grainy stills taken by security cameras hidden above the gambling pit — the familiar Eyes in the Sky .
Using these photos — and thousands of hours of investigative legwork — Griffin was able to compile a legendary facebook , providing photos , names , aliases , known accomplices , even home addresses and phone numbers of people who win too much too often .
Anyone who ended up in the Griffin Book was in danger of being barred from any casino that employed the agency — that is , if someone on the casino floor was lucky enough to notice the offender and make a facebook match .
In the beginning , it was just this sort of luck — or old - fashioned detective work — that broke the biggest card counters .
" The team play confused us at first , " Griffin explains .
" I remember when Ken Uston — perhaps the father of card counting — hit us hard for a year , maybe more .
We 'd been watching him at Caesars , and we could n't figure out how he was winning .
Then one afternoon , my husband went to a tennis match and saw Uston sitting in the stands .
Next to him were a few other people my husband recognized from the tables at Caesars — people Uston had pretended not to know .
We realized they had been spotting , and figured the whole thing out . "
In recent years , Griffin has taken her facebook high tech , combining advances in facial recognition technology with sophisticated data - mining software .
Do two seemingly unrelated players always appear in the same casinos at the same time ?
Did a consistent winner and a pit boss once share a phone number ?
" If someone is winning a lot , you can bet we 're going to be called in .
Because in a casino , these things can go bad very , very fast , " explains Griffin .
" A lot of money can be lost in a short amount of time , and with the high tech cheaters , it 's even worse . "
While card counters use math to ensure a modest but steady winning streak over a long period of play , high tech cheaters opt for the quick hit - and - run .
Jeff Jonas , chief scientist and founder of Systems Research & Development , the company that created much of the software used by Griffin , invites me to his office on the outskirts of Vegas for a tour of the more effective tech tricks of the cheating trade .
" Smile for the camera , " he exclaims , brandishing a tiny plastic lens the size and shape of a jacket button .
" This is the smallest fully operational TV station in the commercial industry .
It literally broadcasts TV - quality visuals .
Some guy will sit down at a card table with this camera attached to his sleeve , an antenna on his back , and a lithium battery in his belt , and broadcast the image to a van outside with a satellite dish .
A guy in the van will slow down the video so you can actually see the cards that flash by during a shuffle . "
Another cheater Jonas once caught was wearing gloves in the middle of summer :
It turned out he had a computer attached to his hand , keeping track of cards by tapping his fingers .
Members of the MIT team tell me about a group that tags the high cards in a deck with minute traces of radioactive isotopes .
Team members wear Geiger counters attached to their knees , getting positive readings when the high cards come out of the shoe .
There 's another tale about a scammer who marks cards with ink that can only be seen with special red-filtered contact lenses .
Getting caught is no small affair .
Cheating at cards in Nevada can carry a sentence of up to 10 years .
Card counting , on the other hand , will merely get you kicked out of the casino for good .
But to Griffin and the surveillance establishment , the distinction between cheaters and counters is irrelevant .
" Our job is to provide the casinos with information to explain why someone is winning , " Griffin says .
" It 's up to the casinos as to what they want to do with the information . "
Jeff Jonas makes no attempt to hide his contempt for the professionals who use math instead of miniature cameras to beat the system .
" These teams of card counters are a new definition of organized crime .
They use the Internet to recruit each other , to share vulnerabilities of casinos and even specific dealers , and they are always searching for ways to gain an unfair advantage over the house . "
WHEN THEY FOUND HIM , HE WAS LYING IN THE TUB , THE DUFFEL CLENCHED TO HIS CHEST .
The irony is that a bad counter often will play a more negative game than a solid player who is simply using basic strategy .
One mistake per hour obliterates a counter 's advantage , and two an hour is more costly than not counting at all .
According to Andrew Tay , casinos know this and so rather than automatically ejecting a known counter , they 'll " watch his play , track his wins and losses , and if he 's identified as a bad counter , they 'll comp him a room , make him feel like a king , and laugh as his ' positive ' game slowly bleeds him dry . "
In the end , the MIT team was brought down by its own success .
They were too good at what they did , too smart to remain unnoticed forever .
By the end of the decade , Griffin was onto them .
As we exit the caf ’ , she says , " There 's always a way to get inside these teams .
Sooner or later , someone gets cold feet .
Or someone gets greedy . "
Then , without prompting , she adds a seeming non sequitur .
" What would your mother think if she spent all that money to send you to MIT and you turned into a professional card counter ? "
I had never mentioned to her the real focus of my article .
Perhaps my paranoia was n't misplaced .
The Fall
" I still remember the first time I got barred , " Kevin Lewis says .
" It was at the Rio . I had just sat down to play .
I had $ 500 in the betting circle .
Then these two guys in suits came up behind me .
One of them pushed my money out of the circle .
' We can't let you play here anymore , ' he told me .
Then he tried to get me to go downstairs to the basement of the casino with him .
I ran right out of there . "
Lewis and I are sitting in a 2,000 - square - foot suite at the top of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino .
There 's a widescreen TV , a fully stocked bar , leather couches , and a picture window overlooking the twinkling neon strip .
This is one of four " celebrity suites " spread out across Las Vegas that Lewis has access to this evening , all complimentary , arranged by various casino hosts who know nothing about his past .
All they see are the dollar signs on his bankroll , and the action he 's willing to put down at the tables .
It 's not enough to be rich .
You 've also got to be willing to play .
" Pretty soon , " he continues , " we started to get heat every second or third trip . "
In Boston a week earlier , Martinez had described a frightening encounter at another casino in town .
He had been playing all night at the high - stakes tables and had returned to his room sometime after 2 in the morning .
There was a loud knock on the door , someone identifying himself as hotel security .
Martinez grabbed his duffel bag full of chips and tried to find someplace to hide .
When they found him , he was lying in the bathtub , the duffel clenched to his chest .
They took him to the basement .
" They asked me to stand against the wall so they could take a picture .
I refused .
Then they asked me to sign something that said I would never return to the hotel . "
" It 's called back - rooming , " Jill Thomas explains .
" It 's an intimidation technique .
They can't legally do anything to you , so they try and scare you .
They read you the trespass act — if you return to the casino in the future , you 'll be trespassing , and then they can arrest you . "
The troubles came to a head for Lewis ' MIT team on a weekend excursion to Shreveport , Louisiana .
The group had traveled to play the riverboat casinos — replicas of 19th - century paddle wheelers — located on the Red River .
The first stop was a place called the Horseshoe , a 25 - story hotel attached to a garish floating casino .
About halfway through the evening , Lewis was walking by one of the blackjack pits when he saw something that caught his eye .
" There was this group of floor people — pit bosses and a shift manager — standing around a fax machine .
There were pages coming off the fax , dark with ink .
I got a little closer and saw one of the guys pull off a page full of pictures .
I knew we were in deep trouble . "
Lewis signaled his team and headed for the parking lot .
The suits followed , chasing him all the way outside .
Running for the car , Lewis had a moment of pure terror .
" Here I am in the middle of nowhere .
Is anyone going to notice if some Asian kid disappears in Shreveport , Louisiana ? "
Back in Boston , Lewis ' people discovered that their problems were just beginning .
It turned out someone associated with the MIT team had sold a list of member names to the enemy , reportedly for $ 25,000 .
In Griffin 's words , someone had gotten greedy .
Still in their mid-twenties , Lewis and his friends were fast becoming dinosaurs .
" Even Robin Hood has to know when it 's time to quit , " Lewis says , looking over the Strip from his celebrity suite .
" It was getting to the point where we could n't walk into a blackjack pit without some suit coming up behind us .
They were even coming after our Spotters . "
By mid 1997 , the state of tension caused a rift in the team , eventually splitting the group in half .
After Shreveport , Martinez and Fisher formed their own group and continue today to hit the casinos on a monthly basis .
Lewis decided to go it on his own , forming an alliance with Jill Thomas and Andrew Tay .
Then a few months later , someone broke into Thomas ' apartment , stealing more than $ 50,000 in blackjack winnings from a safe in her bedroom .
Although he has no proof , Lewis suspects that the robbery had something to do with the MIT team .
Maybe someone on the inside sold out — or perhaps one of the cats was trying to send the mice a little message .
Either way , Lewis decided he had had enough .
When , just two months after the robbery , he was audited by the IRS , he made the decision to stop playing professionally .
" We could have kept playing , like Martinez and the others .
But it just was n't worth it anymore .
The double life had gotten too difficult . "
" So that was it ? " I ask .
" You just took yourself out of the game ? "
Lewis does n’t answer , but I see a hint of mischief in his eyes .
The Player
Rock music blares in my ears as I trail Lewis through the Hard Rock casino .
The Hard Rock is n’t like any other gambling den in Nevada :
It ’s cool , it ’s hip , it ’s more LA than Vegas , all done up in wood tones and plush velvet .
Loud and young and in - your - face , from the Harley - Davidson in the lobby to the Playboy - style grotto out back , it ’s the ultimate Friday night scene .
Lorded over by beautiful blond waitresses in black miniskirts and dark stockings , the crowd tends toward models , actresses , and A - list celebrities , all vying for one another ’s attention .
I wade through — and in truth , at the moment I fit right in .
My hair is slicked back .
My shirt is open two buttons at the neck .
A borrowed charcoal - colored Armani jacket drapes over my shoulders like a cape .
Inside , I am Jell - O , but I do n’t let it show .
I try to mimic the way Lewis moves through the casino .
I copy his swagger , walking in long strides as if my cock runs halfway down my leg .
Like the casino itself , I am cool , I am hip .
I pretend I am rich enough to be strolling toward the high - stakes blackjack pit , rich enough to smile at the dealers and wink at the cocktail waitresses .
Tonight , I ’m a player .
‘ This looks good , ’ Lewis says , stopping at a table in a corner of the pit .
He drops onto one of the stools , gesturing for me to sit next to him .
I look at the little plastic card on the felt , and see that the minimum bet is $ 300 .
I cough , breaking character , and Lewis smiles .
‘ Maybe I ’ll spot you the first few hands . ’
He pulls out a roll of $ 100 bills — cash that I had smuggled through airport security a week earlier — and drops it onto the felt in front of me .
I ’m no Rain Man , but I can count along with the dealer .
Twenty thousand dollars .
‘ Kevin ”
He waves me silent , as the dealer finishes shuffling the deck and stacks the cards in the plastic shoe .
A cocktail waitress brings us drinks — matching glasses of Jack Daniel ’s , easy on the ice — and we each exchange a few thousand dollars for chips , leaving $ 300 in our respective betting circles .
The cards start to come out , and I settle into the game , playing basic strategy like Lewis has taught me .
Ten minutes pass in near silence .
I keep to the minimum bet , and I notice that Lewis ’ pile of chips changes shape as we move deeper into the deck .
I try to see if he ’s counting , but it seems he is n’t even paying attention .
His head is cocked to the side , his face relaxed , his eyes barely moving .
It takes me a moment to realize that , indeed , he is watching the cards — through the reflection in my whiskey glass .
I start to follow him more carefully , raising my own bet with his .
After a few hands , he notices what I ’m doing and laughs .
OK , he seems to tell me .
Let ’s play a little .
Over the next hour , I am treated to a display of pure talent .
By midway through the shoe , Lewis has spread out to cover three betting circles , all with minimum bets of more than $ 1,000 .
He ’s splitting tens and cutting to aces ; he ’s playing all the tricks I ’ve researched and read about , and he ’s letting me tag along .
Pretty soon we ’re up $ 12,000 .
I am about to double my bet for what looks to be the last hand of the shoe , when I notice that Lewis ’ hand is suddenly in his hair .
I know from my research that the movement is n’t natural ; it ’s a signal from Lewis ’ gaming days , an alarm — get up , get out , now .
I look up and see two men approaching from the other side of the high - stakes pit .
Both are wearing dark suits with stiff lapels , and the taller of the two is talking into a cell phone .
I see Lewis gathering up his chips , and I start to do the same .
The dealer asks if we want to cash out , but before either of us can answer , one of the suited men steps forward .
‘ Mr. Lewis , can we speak to you for a moment ? ’
Lewis shoves his remaining chips into his pockets and pushes back from his stool .
‘ We were just leaving . ’
I scoop up my own chips , nearly upending my stool as I step away from the table .
I can see the other gamblers in the crowded pit looking over at us , whispers rising above the rock ‘ n ’ roll .
I feel a mixture of fear and pride as the two men in suits begin to escort us out of the blackjack area .
When we reach the edge of the pit , the taller of the two puts his hand on Lewis ’ shoulder .
‘ Mr. Lewis , we ca n’t have you playing blackjack here anymore . ’
Lewis ’ eyebrows rise , indignant and surprised .
I know it ’s an act .
He has heard this before .
‘ Why not ? ’
Lewis asks , more for me than for appearances .
The suit spreads his hands , palms out .
‘ You ’re too good for us . ’
He ’s smiling , but I can tell from his voice that he ’s dead serious .
He does n’t want us anywhere near the blackjack tables , because he watched us play from some security roost above the casino floor , analyzing our moves through the Eyes in the Sky .
He sees Kevin Lewis as a threat to his casino , a danger to his bottom line .
And the truth is , he ’s right .

To explain why this is so fucking crazy , let me back up .
70 % of CIFA 's staffers ( the ones keeping the database on the quakers ) .
One of the companies that got a chunk of that business is MZM .
You remember : the company for which Mitch Wade was bribing Duke Cunningham to give big contracts ?
Well , here are the three conclusions of a DOD IG report just released on the program :
It was designed to gather intelligence on threats to defense installments in the United States -- to try to collect information ( in the TALON database ) on threatening people scoping out domestic bases .
But it ended up focusing on peace activists and the lefty blogosphere 's own Jesus ' General .
Well , I 'm still reading the report ( I wanted to get this out there to see what others found ) .
But these conclusions appear to say :
DOD says the domestic spying program was legal because -- in spite of the fact that the organization is a spying / law enforcement hybrid -- they consider it law enforcement activity and not spying ( even though the Quakers on whom it collected data had not broken any laws ) .
DOD admits that CIFA -- run by all those contractors who got their work through bribes -- did not destroy the information they collected when they were supposed to .
The database they were using did not have the capabilities it needed to cross-check the data - collection .
And this is a doozy :
USNCO deleted the whole database in June 2006 .
For an idea of why that is so fuckedinthehead , here 's a little chronology I put together a while back :
September 2002 , then Deputy Secretary of Defense for Counter - Intelligence Burtt ( the guy who resigned yesterday ) establishes CIFA to oversee counterintelligence units of the armed services ; consulting on the new agency was James King , recently retired director of National Imagery and Mapping Agency and MZM vice president
Late 2002 , Cunningham got Mitchell
Wade a data storage contract worth $ 6 million , of which $ 5.4 was profit
January 2004 , Cunningham added $ 16.5 million to defense authorization for a " collaboration center " that appears to include business for Wade 's company
December 2005 , Pincus reveals a CIFA database contains raw intelligence data on peace activists ( and , presumably , Jesus ' General )
March 2006 , prosecutors in the Cunningham case announce they 're reviewing CIFA contracts to MZM
March 2006 , Stephen Cambone announces an investigation of CIFA 's contracting -- the investigation is ( like the investigation into Dougie Feith ) " ongoing "
May 2006 , Porter Goss resigns under allegations of ties to the Wilkes / Wade bribery ring
May 2006 , House Intelligence Committee ( Peter Hoekstra 's Committee ) first moves to exercise oversight on CIFA
August 2006 , CIFA director and deputy director resign
Let 's look at the key time frame , with this new datapoint inserted , shall we :
March 2006 , prosecutors in the Cunningham case announce they 're reviewing CIFA contracts to MZM
March 2006 , Stephen Cambone announces an investigation of CIFA 's contracting -- the investigation is ( like the investigation into Dougie Feith ) " ongoing "
May 2006 , Porter Goss resigns under allegations of ties to the Wilkes / Wade bribery ring
May 2006 , House Intelligence Committee ( Peter Hoekstra 's Committee ) first moves to exercise oversight on CIFA
June 2006 , USNCO destroys all the TALON reports
August 2006 , CIFA director and deputy director resign
Get it ?
Carol Lam is closing in on MZM and its contracting .
Two very compromised Republicans announce they 're going to review this stuff .
And then one month later ... POOF !!!
All the records of this domestic spying program disappear , like magic !!
And then two months later the guys running the program resign , suddenly .
Now , honestly , I need to review the whole report -- I 'll either update this or do a new post .
But I wanted to put this up here to get people reading the report .
Update :
Here 's the sole explanation they offer for the incredible disappearing USNCO database :
We could not determine whether USNORTHCOM complied with the DoD 90 - day retention review policy because all TALON reports were deleted from JPEN on November 30 , 2005 , without being archived , and the system was turned off in June 2006 .
Notice how they change the date , November 2005 for June 2006 ?
Know what happened just two days before these reports were deleted , on November 28 , 2005 ?
Duke Cunningham made his plea deal .
There .
That makes you feel better , does n't it ?
Though it appears that some of the records remained on the CIFA database .
And here 's their explanation for why CIFA was n't deleting info on Americans :
Only CIFA information technology personnel had the ability to delete TALON reports .
As a result , CIFA maintained TALON reports without determining whether information on organizations and individuals should be retained for law enforcement and force protection purposes .
Want to bet these IT folks are contractors ?
Contractors who owe their jobs to earmarks and occasionally bribes ?

U.N. : Israeli airstrike hits U.N. observer post Sources : Condoleezza
Rice floats plan to end conflict Smoke billows from a southern Beirut neighborhood after an Israeli air raid Tuesday .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon Hezbollah or or Create Your Own BEIRUT , Lebanon ( CNN ) --
An Israeli airstrike hit a United Nations post in southern Lebanon late Tuesday , killing at least two of the agency 's observers , according to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon .
The U.N. initially reported that four peacekeepers were dead , but later said there were two dead and two missing .
The observers were Austrian , Finnish , Canadian and Chinese , Lebanese security sources said .
Xinhua , the state - run Chinese news agency , reported that a Chinese observer was one of the dead .
The security sources also said that the two missing observers are feared buried in the rubble of the building .
Daniel Ayalon , Israel 's ambassador to the United States , said that " UNIFIL obviously got caught in the middle " of a gunfight between Hezbollah guerillas and Israeli troops .
" We do not have yet confirmation what caused these deaths .
It could be ( Israel Defense Forces ) .
It could be Hezbollah , " he said .
UNIFIL sent a rescue - and - medical team to the city of Khiyam , and the team was trying to clear rubble early Wednesday .
Attacks in the vicinity continued as rescuers tried to reach those killed or injured , UNIFIL said .
UNIFIL said there had been at least 14 incidents of fire close to the post since Tuesday afternoon .
U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan said he was " deeply distressed " by the " apparently deliberate " strike .
" This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long - established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire , " he said in a statement .
" Furthermore , General Alain Pelligrini , the U.N. force commander in south Lebanon , had been in repeated contact with Israeli officers throughout the day on Tuesday , stressing the need to protect that particular U.N. position from attack . "
Ayalon called Annan 's statement " outrageous , " while Israel 's U.N. ambassador , Dan Gillerman , said he , too , was " deeply distressed " that Annan alleged that the strike was deliberate .
" I am surprised at these premature and erroneous assertions made by the secretary - general , who while demanding an investigation , has already issued its conclusions , " Gillerman said in a statement .
The IDF said it was looking into the report , which came as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice proposed an ambitious plan in which international military forces would help the Lebanese government stabilize southern Lebanon , Lebanese political sources said .
Rice pitched the plan Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem , then traveled to the West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Rice 's diplomatic moves came on the 14th day of the conflict sparked by Hezbollah 's capture of two Israeli soldiers .
Meanwhile , Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Lebanese cities , while Hezbollah rockets rained down on northern Israel .
( Watch cockpit view of bombing in Lebanon -- :45 ) The Israel Defense Forces also said it killed senior Hezbollah commander Abu Jaafar , who Israel says was in charge of the central area of Lebanon 's border with Israel .
CNN was not able to confirm the report and there has been no confirmation from Hezbollah .
Since July 12 , at least 392 people , mostly civilians , have been killed and as many as 1,383 wounded in Lebanon , Lebanese security officials said Tuesday .
At least 41 Israelis have died , including 19 civilians , and at least 388 have been wounded , Israeli officials said .
The plan proposed by Rice initially would involve putting an international force of up to 10,000 Turkish and Egyptian troops under a NATO or U.N. commander into southern Lebanon following a cease - fire , the Lebanese political sources said .
Another international force of up to 30,000 troops then would help the Lebanese government regain control over the region , the sources said .
( Full story ) Rice presented the plan Monday to Lebanese officials , the sources said , and will show it to European foreign ministers Wednesday in Rome , Italy .
U.S. and diplomatic sources said Lebanese officials are leaking details of the proposal because they are opposed to many of them .
The sources describe the plan as an outline or working proposal and said no one has agreed to it .
They also said there are many hurdles to overcome before it could be implemented .
No letup in the fighting An overnight Israeli airstrike hit a house in the village of Nabatiye , killing seven people , Lebanese security sources said .
The IDF said its military operations have hit dozens of militants during ongoing fighting in Bint Jbeil , a town it dubbed Hezbollah 's " terror capital . "
Israel gained complete control of Bint Jbeil , according to IDF Gen. Gal Hirsch .
The IDF said it had killed between 20 and 30 Hezbollah fighters in the area in the past 24 hours .
The IDF hopes to create a " security zone " in southern Lebanon until an international force arrives , said Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz .
" If there is not a multinational force that will get in to control the fences , we will continue to control with our fire towards anyone that gets close to the defined security zone and they will know that they can be hurt , " he said .
In Israel , a Katyusha rocket killed a 15 - year - old girl Tuesday in the village of Meghar , Israeli police and medical service officials said .
At least 18 people were injured in the port city of Haifa and one man died of a heart attack after a rocket struck near his home , officials said .
About 100 Hezbollah rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday , striking the cities of Haifa , Carmiel , Kyrat Shmona and Nahiriya , according to the IDF .
Huge explosions reverberated Tuesday afternoon through the southern suburbs of Beirut -- a Hezbollah stronghold -- sending smoke billowing through high - rise buildings .
( Watch airstrikes pound Beirut -- 2:53 ) Several Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre .
There was no official word yet on casualties .
Israel opens aid corridors Israeli officials agreed during talks with Rice to make it easier to get humanitarian aid into Lebanon , a U.S. State Department official said .
Lebanese officials have pleaded with the United States to pressure Israel for an immediate cease - fire , but U.S. officials said conditions are not yet ripe for such a move , and they expect Israeli military operations to continue for another week or even longer .
U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman delivered $ 30 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon , which will meet the basic medical needs of 20,000 people , according to an embassy statement .
The shipment was handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut on Tuesday afternoon .
The U.S. announcement followed a U.N. appeal for nearly $ 150 million in humanitarian aid earlier this week .

Burma is among countries accused of repressing net freedoms
The warning comes ahead of a conference organised by Amnesty , where victims of repression will outline their plights .
The " virus of internet repression " has spread from a handful of countries to dozens of governments , said the group .
Amnesty accused companies such as Google , Microsoft and Yahoo of being complicit in the problem .
Website closures
When challenged on their presence in countries such as China in the past , the companies accused have always maintained that they were simply abiding by local laws .
Amnesty is concerned that censorship is on the increase .
" The Chinese model of an internet that allows economic growth but not free speech or privacy is growing in popularity , from a handful of countries five years ago to dozens of governments today who block sites and arrest bloggers , " said Tim Hancock , Amnesty 's campaign director .
" Unless we act on this issue , the internet could change beyond all recognition in the years to come .
More and more governments are realising the utility of controlling what people see online and major internet companies , in an attempt to expand their markets , are colluding in these attempts , " he said .
Amnesty has criticised Google 's presence in China
According to the latest Open Net Initiative report on internet filtering , at least 25 countries now apply state - mandated net filtering including Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Burma , Ethiopia , India , Iran , Morocco and Saudi Arabia .
Egyptian blogger
Filtering was only one aspect of internet repression , the group said .
It added that increasingly it was seeing " politically motivated " closures of websites and net cafes , as well as threats and imprisonments .
Twenty - two - year - old Egyptian blogger Abdul Kareem Nabeel Suleiman was imprisoned for four years in February for insulting Islam and defaming the President of Egypt .
Fellow Egyptian blogger Amr Gharbeia told the BBC that the internet was allowing people to express themselves : " The web is creating a more open society , it is allowing more people to speak out .
It 's only natural that upsets some people . "
The Amnesty conference - Some People
Think the Internet is a Bad Thing : The Struggle for Freedom of Expression in Cyberspace - will have some well - known speakers including Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales .
It marks the first anniversary of Amnesty 's website irrepressible .

Democrat Waxman threatens subpoenas , suggests White House lied about Cheney security inquiries Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This A top House Democrat contradicted Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino 's claim that the White House follows its own security safeguards adequately .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) also threatened to issue subpoenas on Thursday if the White House did not comply with House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requests for voluntary interviews with officials involved in White House security decision - making .
" Contrary to the recent claims of White House spokesperson Dana Perino , there is evidence that the White House has repeatedly failed to investigate security violations , take corrective action following breaches , and appropriately protect classified information , " said Rep. Waxman , in a statement released Tuesday morning .
The Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was responding to Perino 's recent remark that , " The president and the vice president are complying with all the rules and regulations regarding the handling of classified material and making sure that it is safeguarded and protected . "
Waxman expanded on his statement in a letter to President George W. Bush 's Counsel , Fred Fielding .
" There is evidence that both the White House and the Office of the Vice President have flaunted multiple requirements for protecting classified information , not just the section related to the responsibilities of the Information Security Oversight Office , " the California Democrat wrote .
" According to current and former White House security personnel who have contacted my staff , White House practices have been dangerously inadequate with respect to investigating security violations , taking corrective action following breaches , and physically securing classified information . "
Waxman took special note of the President 's inconsistency in claiming that he had followed security procedures , while at the same time renewing a security clearance for his top adviser and Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove .
" Under guidelines issued by President Bush , security clearances should not be renewed for individuals who deny their role in the release of classified information , regardless of whether the disclosure was intentional or negligent , " the Oversight Committee chairman noted .
" Contrary to this guidance , the White House Security Office renewed the security clearance for Karl Rove in late 2006 . "
The congressman went on to renew his request for interviews with three current and former White House officials : Andrew Card , former chief of staff ; Alan Swendiman , the Director of the Office of Administration ; Mark Frownfelter , a former White House security officer ; and Jeff Thompson , the former Director of the White House Security Office .
If Fielding was unwilling to comply with these requests , he added , " I will recommend to the Committee the issuance of subpoenas at our next business meeting , which is currently scheduled for June 28 . "
Waxman 's full letter and statement can be read at this link .
I have been about ten days at the front when it happened .
The whole experience of being hit by a bullet is very interesting and I think it is worth describing in detail .
It was at the corner of the parapet , at five o'clock in the morning .
This was always a dangerous time , because we had the dawn at our backs , and if you stuck your head above the parapet it was clearly outlined against the sky .
I was talking to the sentries preparatory to changing the guard .
Suddenly , in the very middle of saying something , I felt -- it is very hard to describe what I felt , though I remember it with the utmost vividness .
Roughly speaking it was the sensation of being at the center of an explosion .
There seemed to be a loud bang and a blinding flash of light all around me , and I felt a tremendous shock - no pain , only a violent shock , such as you get from an electric terminal ; with it a sense of utter weakness , a feeling of being stricken and shriveled up to nothing .
The sandbags in front of me receded into immense distance .
I fancy you would feel much the same if you were struck by lightning .
I knew immediately that I was hit , but because of the seeming bang and flash I thought it was a rifle nearby that had gone off accidentally and shot me .
All this happened in a space of time much less than a second .
The next moment my knees crumpled up and I was falling , my head hitting the ground with a violent bang which , to my relief , did not hurt .
I had a numb , dazed feeling , a consciousness of being very badly hurt , but no pain in the ordinary sense .
The American sentry I had been talking to had started forward .
' Gosh !
Are you hit !'
People gathered round .
There was the usual fuss - ' Lift him up !
Where 's he hit ?
Get his shirt open !' etc. , etc .
The American called for a knife to cut my shirt open .
I knew that there was one in my pocket and tried to get it open , but discovered that my right arm was paralyzed .
Not being in pain , I felt a vague satisfaction .
This ought to please my wife , I thought ; she had always wanted me to be wounded , which would save me from being killed when the great battle came .
It was only now that it occurred to me to wonder where I was hit , and how badly ; I could feel nothing , but I was conscious that the bullet had struck me somewhere in the front of my body .
When I tried to speak I found that I had no voice , only a faint squeak , but at the second attempt I managed to ask where I was hit .
In the throat , they said , Harry Webb , our stretcher - bearer , had brought a bandage and one of the little bottles they gave us for field - dressings .
As they lifted me up a lot of blood poured out of my mouth , and I heard a Spaniard behind me say that the bullet had gone clear through my neck .
I felt the alcohol , which at ordinary times would sting like the devil , splash on the wound as a pleasant coolness .
They laid me down again while somebody fetched a stretcher .
As soon as I knew that the bullet had gone clean through my neck I took it for granted I was done for .
I had never heard of a man an animal getting a bullet through the middle of the neck and surviving it .
The blood was dribbling out of the corner of my mouth .
" The artery 's gone , " I thought .
I wondered how long you last when your carotid artery is cut ; not many minutes , presumably .
Everything was very blurry .
There must have been about two minutes during which I assumed I was killed .
And that too was interesting -- I mean it is interesting to know what your thoughts would be at such a time .
My first thought , conventionally enough , was for my wife .
My second was violent resentment at having to leave this world which , when all is said and done , s me so well .
I had time to feel this very vividly .
The stupid mischance infuriated me .
The meaninglessness of it !
To be bumped off , not even in battle , but in this stale corner of the trenches , thanks to a moment 's carelessness !
I thought , too , of the man who had shot me -- wondered what he was like , whether he was a Spaniard or foreigner , whether he knew he had got me , and so forth .
I could not feel any resentment against him .
I reflected that as he was a Fascist I would have killed him if I could , but that if he had been taken prisioner and brought before me at this moment I would merely have congratulated him on his good shooting .
It may be , though , that if you were really dying your thoughts would be quite different .
They had just got me on to the stretcher when my paralyzed right arm came to life and began hurting damnably .
At the time I imagined that I must have broken it in falling ; but the pain reassured me , for I knew that your sensations do not become more acute when you are dying .
I began to feel more normal and to be sorry for the four poor devils who were sweating and slithering with the stretcher on their shoulders .
It was a mile and a half to the ambulance , and vile going , over lumpy , slippery tracks .
I knew what a sweat it was , having helped to carry a wounded man down a day or two earlier .
The leaves of the silver poplars which , in places , finger our trenches brushed against my face ; I thought what a good thing it was to be alive in a world where silver poplars grow .
But all the while the pain in my arm was diabolical , making me swear and then try not to swear , because every time I breathed too hard the blood bubbled out of my mouth .
Back then , doctors extracted women ’s eggs surgically under general anesthesia .
The risks of infection , organ damage and even death from the procedure may have been justifiable for an infertile woman going through I.V.F. , but not for a donor .
So early researchers borrowed a trick from animal husbandry : when the donor ovulated , she was inseminated with the recipient ’s husband ’s sperm , the embryo formed in her body and , four to six days later , was flushed out of the uterus and transferred to the intended mother .
This adapted procedure “ was problematic in many ways , ” said Dr. Richard Paulson , chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Southern California ’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles and a pioneer in the development of egg donation .
For one thing , if the doctors missed the embryo , the donor could wind up pregnant .
By the late ’ 80s , though , European researchers perfected a new method of retrieving eggs by using a thin needle , guided by ultrasound and inserted through the vaginal wall .
The procedure took 10 minutes and required only light anesthesia .
As Liza Mundy writes in her book “ Everything Conceivable , ” this technique would revolutionize — or , you could even argue , create — the fertility industry by unhooking clinics from their dependence on hospital operating rooms .
Suddenly , any doc with a lab and the right equipment could set up his own shop .
Using that advance , Paulson and his team made a breakthrough of their own : some of their patients had aged past 40 , which was considered the outer limit for medical intervention , while waiting for donors .
Would it be possible , Paulson wondered , to push that threshold ?
He tried transferring multiple embryos created from a young woman ’s eggs into the body of a 40 - year - old . . . and she became pregnant .
In 1990 , Paulson published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine announcing that as long as the eggs were young , the age of the recipient appeared immaterial .
And just like that , the market for donor eggs was born .
One day this spring , Becky , who is 38 , met me at the airy loft in a sketchy neighborhood of Oakland , Calif. , where she works in the music industry .
She is a tiny woman — just over five feet tall — with dark blond ringlets pulled back in a ponytail and three earrings ascending one ear .
A wedding photo on her desk , taken last summer , showed her tucked beneath the arm of her husband , Russell , a public - school teacher who is a more than a foot taller than she and who asked that I use only his middle name .
Next to the photo was a clutch of supplements and prenatal vitamins that she was downing to prepare her body for pregnancy .
Behind those sat a small statue of Ganesha , the pachyderm - faced Hindu deity , lord of both obstacles and beginnings .
Becky , who asked me to use a nickname , sat down and began scrolling through pictures on the Web site of Ova the Rainbow , one of the ( regrettably named ) agency sites she browsed last fall during her search for an egg donor .
“ When I first started doing this it was really emotional for me , ” she said .
“ I kept thinking about that kids ’ book , ‘ Are You My Mother ? ’
I ’m looking through these pictures of young women and feeling like : ‘ Oh , my God !
Is this the mother of my future child ?
Is this the mother of my future child ? ’ ”
I stood behind her , watching the young women go by .
Each was accompanied by an assortment of photos : girls in caps and gowns graduating from high school , sunburned and smiling on family vacations , as preschoolers in princess frocks , sporting supermodel pouts in shopping - mall glamour portraits .
Sperm banks rarely provide such visuals , which is just one disparity in the packaging and treatment of male and female donors , according to a study published last month in The American Sociological Review .
Egg donors are often thanked with presents and notes by recipients for their generous “ gift . ”
Sperm donors are reminded that they ’re doing a “ job , ” providing a “ sample , ” and performing an act they ’d presumably do anyway — which may be why many men in the study were rattled when told a pregnancy had actually occurred .
And although the men could admit they were in it for the cash , ovum donors were expected to express at least a smidge of altruism .
It was weird to look at these pictures with Becky .
I inevitably objectified the young women in them , evaluating their component parts ; it made me feel strangely like a guy .
Becky clicked on a photo of a 22 - year - old brunette with a toothy grin .
Each profile listed the donor ’s age ( many agencies consider donors to be over the hill by 30 ) , hair color ( there seemed to be a preponderance of blondes ) , eye color , weight , ethnicity , marital status , education level , high school or college G.P.A. ’s , college major , evidence of “ proved ” fertility ( having children of their own or previous successful cycles ) .
Some agencies include blood type for recipients who do n’t plan to tell their child about his conception .
Others include bust size and favorite movies , foods and TV shows .
One newly pregnant woman told me she picked her donor because the woman liked “ The Princess Bride . ”
“ Some donors chose ‘ Pulp Fiction , ’ and their favorite color was black , ” she said .
“ That ’s just not me .
If I have the choice between someone who likes ‘ The Princess Bride ’ or someone who likes ‘ Pulp Fiction , ’ everything else being equal , I ’m going for ‘ Princess Bride . ’ ”
Obviously , a penchant for romantic comedy is not an inherited trait .
Nor , for that matter , will appearance or intelligence necessarily be passed along , though they are the first things most prospective parents look for in a donor .
It ’s a curious paradox : couples who conceive a baby this way believe that relationships , not genes , make a family , yet in their search for a donor , they romanticize the potential of DNA .
And why not ?
The culture itself is in conflict over how much genes shape us , even as science and the media claim they determine , or predetermine , more than ever .
Consider the schmaltzy news stories of reunions between adopted children and their “ real ” mothers , or tales of identical twins reared apart who are eerily alike .
The notion that blood is thicker than water , that we can pass on our best — or someone else ’s best — characteristics ( but somehow not our worst ) is a powerful one , even though anyone who has biogenetic children will tell you that they can be as different from one another , and from their parents , as strangers .
Filed Under Politics Terrorists Cannot Decide on 2008 Presidential Candidate Posted February 26 , 2007 Send
It is a frigid night in this mountainous region .
In the training camp , men with ski masks and Kalashnikov rifles smoke cigarettes , take turns stoking the inadequate fire , or log in to Jihadi.com to see if their newest photos have been chosen for the homepage photo contest .
Although the night sky is cloudless , nobody here can see clearly into what kind of President they 'd like to see take over from George W. Bush in 2008 .
For some here , it 's just too early to tell .
The primary season has just begun , but none of the candidates have distinguished themselves as the type to ignite worldwide jihad .
The group hopes for a strong leader , one against whom the entire Islamic world can rally .
At least one terrorist complains that 2008 is hopeless .
" Unless somebody comes out from nowhere , I might have to stop blowing things up for a while . "
" Obviously we 'd like to see George W. Bush stay on for another four years , " says Shaka Khan .
" But there is some kind of term limit that prevents this , " he explains to the others .
" Curse American democracy !
I hate freedom , " he spits into the flame .
" John McCain was my early favorite .
He 's bat - shit crazy , and might invade three or four other countries .
But I do n't like where he is on universal health care , " argues Abdul Ghafoor .
" Plus he might use nukes , " says another .
They discuss Mitt Romney , but cannot decide whether Mormonism would be more of an apostate affront to Islam than an Evangelical .
" Does anyone know the difference ? " asks one .
The group cannot answer .
The terrorists are disappointed that the primary season has come so early .
" This time last election , I was still harvesting opium , " says Akbar .
" Now I 'm stuck here watching CNN .
It leaves me very little time for actual terrorism . "
" How do you feel about Barack Hussein Obama ? " asks Ali .
" Do n't let the name fool you .
He 's as Christian as the rest of them . "
" They said on Fox News he was educated in a madrasah . "
" Really ?
That would be terrible for us . "
" Democrats and Republicans are the same , " laments Mullah Khalid .
The comment causes a flurry of discussion about the limits of the two - party system .
The terrorists would like to see an Independent candidate , preferably one who would set out to create an American Wahhabist theocracy .
" But the first lady could n't wear a burqa , " argues another .
" It would n't look right . "
The arguments go on through the night .
The cadre of seasoned killers agrees to wait for the Iowa caucuses before an endorsement .

A local authority and care services minister Ivan Lewis have failed to stop a 103 - year - old woman from being evicted from her Nottinghamshire care home .
Nottinghamshire county council offered extra cash and Mr Lewis intervened when great - grandmother Esme Collins was told to leave after 10 years at Abbeymoor nursing home in Worksop , because its owners refused to back down in a dispute over funding her care .
The council said today that Abbeymoor 's owners had declined to lift the eviction notice , forcing Mrs Collins 's transfer yesterday to a home in Retford .
Last month , Mr Lewis said : " Under normal circumstances I would not and cannot intervene in individual cases .
However , this is so shocking I feel obliged to act .
Neither Mrs Collins nor her family should be expected to cope with this anxiety for a minute longer .
I am deeply concerned at the attempt by the home owner to use Mrs Collins as a pawn in a funding dispute .
" Whatever the difficulties , such treatment of a 103 - year - old cannot be tolerated in a modern care system which has dignity and respect for older people at its heart . "
Esme Simpson , Mrs Collins 's daughter , said that although her mother had coped well with the move , she was unhappy about her treatment .
" It has been a diabolical situation and we hope we can now put it behind us , " she said .
The council and the home 's owners have been arguing over the level of care Mrs Collins needs .
The home received the " very dependent needs " residential rate of £ 334 a week .
Mrs Collins paid £ 162 of the sum , and the council contributed the remainder .
However , the council said Abbeymoor 's owners wanted an extra £ 100 , saying she needed more expensive nursing care .
Despite a string of assessments which found Mrs Collins did not require the additional service , the council offered to meet the extra cost to lift the threat of eviction .
The offer was not accepted , the authority said .
David Pearson , the county council 's strategic director for adult social care , said : " We , and the family , are extremely disappointed to have to make this move after the council made the financial offer that Abbeymoor 's owners sought in order to resolve this matter . "
Abbeymoor 's owner , Mark Sutters , was not available for comment today , but he previously told the Nottingham Evening Post that the home could not continue to " subsidise " Mrs Collins 's care .
Age Concern has campaigned for the closing of a legal loophole that left the pensioner without the protection of human rights legislation .
Gordon Lishman , the charity 's director general , said today : " Forcing an older person to leave their care home can have a devastating impact on their physical and emotional health .
" We urge the government to act quickly to give the protection of the Human Rights
Act to people living in private care homes to help prevent such situations . "
This is a joyous ride , and I ’m still on it !
I ’ve been rediscovering my “ roots ” , and moving forward .
It ’s ironic that technologies that are now decades old hold keys to the future .
As I ’ve written about previously , I rediscovered Lisp earlier this year .
I ’ve put that on the shelf for a while , but I intend to get back to it .
Back in August , I dug out some old Smalltalk code I had written for a couple assignments while I was getting my Bachelor ’s in computer science , back in the early 1990s .
I have fond memories of working with this language .
Up to this point I have n’t had a chance to use it in my work , unfortunately .
While I was finding videos for my “ Great moments in modern computer history ” post , I happened upon some videos of Alan Kay dispensing his wisdom , and demonstrating what he had been working on since about the late 90s : Squeak and Croquet .
I talked about this a bit in my post , and gave a link to where you could watch one of his presentations .
Here are most of the others .
Squeak / EToys , from Lisa Rein ’s tour of Alan Kay ’s ETech 2003 presentation
What first interested me in Squeak was its multimedia features .
In the online videos of his presentations , Kay used Squeak to create his presentation slides .
They look like they might ’ve be done in Powerpoint , but they were not .
They had integrated video and EToys demonstrations .
I liked his demonstrations of what children could do with EToys , where they could draw their own graphical objects , and manipulate them with a little bit of script , or just using their “ halos . ”
Halos are a Squeak concept .
Since everything in Squeak is an object , even fundamental graphical elements like menus and windows , they can all be manipulated by the user in standard ways .
They can be rotated and moved , made to disappear , etc. , just by using the mouse .
The same can be done with graphics that a user draws .
As I said before , Kay is worth listening to , even without the cool graphics .
One speech to note is the one he gave for his Turing Award , which he received in 2003 .
I like the title of it : Alan Kay gave a speech when he won his Turing Award in 2003 entitled “ The Computer Revolution Has n’t Happened Yet . ”
Amen !
The Turing Award is like a “ lifetime achievement ” award in the computer science community .
Only people who have made significant contributions to the discipline are awarded it .
There ’s a list of previous Turing Award winners here .
If you ’ve gotten an education in computer science you will have seen at least a few of these names .
Croquet , from Lisa Rein ’s tour of Alan Kay ’s presentation at ETech 2003
Croquet is the more recent project he ’s worked on .
It ’s like something I imagined would come along one day : a 3D user interface .
Croquet is an expansion of the idea of Smalltalk .
The intent is to create a collaborative environment .
It uses elements that are already part of MMPGs ( Massively Multi- player Games ) .
Each user has an “ avatar ” in the environment , though you typically have a first - person POV .
The team behind Croquet purposely made networking and collaborative computing easy .
Like Smalltalk , Croquet is designed to encourage experimentation , and appears to be ideally suited for creating 3D simulations .
It ’s in beta at this point .
While it looks neat , it ’s not something I ’m particularly interested in , but perhaps one day I ’ll get into it .
It could n’t have come at a better time , since people have just been introduced to collaborative computing over the last several years , though as with everything else , what people usually see is a web interface .
Croquet is more along the lines of the classical GUI , but upgraded .
Squeak is something I can relate to .
It ’s a free , open source implementation of the Smalltalk system .
It ’s the canonical object - oriented programming environment .
Every object - oriented language shares many of its features , though the more popular ones lack some of them .
From what I can surmise , Squeak is a lot like the original Smalltalk system developed at Xerox PARC more than 30 years ago , though it ’s gotten some updates .
It has color , for one thing . 😉
It ’s practically its own operating system , though it runs in Windows , Mac , Linux , etc. as an application .
The interface is like the desktop - style UI we ’re all used to by now ( though I ’ve heard it ’s possible to run it in a “ headless ” mode , where you can just start it from a command line with no GUI ) .
All code and data are stored as objects in an image file , not unlike the virtualization images used with bona fide operating systems in Virtual PC or VMWare .
In reality , it ’s probably more like Common Lisp , which also can create image files .
Squeak allows users and developers to do unlimited undos to changes to its system .
You can in effect “ go back in time ” to an earlier system state .
Conceivably users could even use this feature to go back to an earlier version of Squeak than the one they have ( not recommended –it ’s better to just download an earlier release of Squeak if that ’s what you ’re after ) .
It ’s a bit like System Restore in Windows XP , and I ’m sure Mac OS X has a similar system - wide feature .
Developmer Tools
Edit 10/12/06 :
This slipped my mind when I first wrote this post .
Squeak comes with its own developer tools that you can select from a sidebar - type menu within the Squeak interface .
There ’s a lot to get used to with Squeak .
Even though it has a desktop - style interface , it does n’t operate like Windows or the Mac .
A difference I noticed right off the bat is you do not double - click on icons to get a GUI program started .
Rather you click and drag .
Doing this starts the tool right up .
Things are not where a newbie Squeaker expects them to be , so you have to have some patience and search for them .
After a while you ’ll get used to it .
It has an IDE , called a “ Browser , ” that allows you to see all the classes in the system , plus any that you create .
It has its own code editor and debugger .
Developers can create GUI projects ( analogous to an application ) that run inside Squeak , using a GUI framework called Morphic .
Squeak has its own components for creating presentations as well .
They ’re fairly easy to set up and get going .
Squeak in education
Alan Kay has long focused on education .
His Squeak / EToys demos are targeted at those interested in using technology in education .
Squeak used to contain many working multimedia features , and that ’s what they were targeted at .
I talk about this more below .
The educational site for Squeak is here .
Smalltalk
Smalltalk was designed to be a fundamental technology upon which greater technologies could be constructed .
For example Croquet is written in Squeak ( Smalltalk ) .
The Smalltalk programming language is powerful .
Programmers can get things done in fewer lines of code than they could in most other languages .
Some of the reasons are it ’s a dynamically typed language , it implements method calls as parameterized messages that are passed to objects , it implements closures , and has support for continuations .
Lisp shares all of these features except for the object - oriented message passing ( though CLOS may have them .
I do n’t know ) .
Closures are chunks of code that can be passed around between objects , but which maintain enough of the context from where they were created to execute them successfully when the referencing objects choose to run them .
An analogy to closures would be anonymous methods in .
Net and Java .
Below are a couple of examples .
|x |
x := 0 .
# ( 5 4 3 ) do : [ :a | x := x + a ] .
Transcript show : x .
‘ x ’ is a temporary variable .
The array # ( 5 4 3 ) , in this case an array literal , has a method called “ do : ” that takes a closure .
The code in between the [ ] ’s is the closure .
The part you see inside , between the ‘ [ ‘ and the ‘ | ’ is where parameters for the closure go .
The part after the ‘ | ’ is the logic of the closure .
The array ’s “ do : ” method iterates over itself , passing each element into the given closure , using the ‘: a ’ parameter .
The logic inside the closure adds each element to x , which functions as an accumulator .
Transcript outputs the result , which is 12 .
Note that even though the closure is passed to an object , the local variable ‘ x ’ functions as though the code in the closure was running in the local scope .
To show the power of Smalltalk , I can shorten this into one line by using another method of the array class :
Transcript show : ( # ( 5 4 3 ) inject : 0 into : [ :a :c | a + c ] ) .
Before I go further I should explain that it ’s possible to combine messages for a single method .
The above code is an example of this .
There is an inherited method available to the array class , called inject : into : .
It ’s two messages for one method , each message carrying a parameter
It ’s a method that takes two parameters .
What this does is “ inject ” 0 into the ‘ : a ’ parameter when the closure is executed the first time by the array .
Thereafter the ‘: a ’ parameter functions as a persistent variable inside the closure .
The method iterates over the array , passing each element into the closure .
The ‘ : c ’ parameter receives each element of the array .
The logic is subtle .
Each time the closure is called , what happens in effect is : a := a + c , and the end result of ‘ a ’ is the result of the method call .
This gets passed into Transcript , which outputs the result .
Seaside – the Squeak Enterprise Aubergines Server and IDE
What made me pay more attention to Squeak is a web framework written for it called Seaside .
One of the goals of Seaside was to make web programming simple .
Avi Bryant , one of the creators of Seaside , has said that he tried to make it as simple as programming a thick client application .
To do that , he used continuations .
Seaside saves the stack state of the web application for each client session between round trips to the server , automatically .
There is no session state to deal with !
Secondly , you can have it detect backtracks by the user .
An example Avi has used is an airline reservation system , where the user may want to try out a bunch of different itineraries .
After going part way through Itinerary A , the user may backtrack either part way or all the way to the beginning of the reservation process , using the Back button on the browser , and pursue alternate itineraries .
In the end , the user may want to go back to Itinerary A , and then want to check out .
With some web application systems , if the reservation system is written badly , it might try to bill the customer for the last itinerary they tried , like Itinerary C .
The developer can configure Seaside to detect these backtracks , and respond accordingly , so that the customer is always getting what they would expect from the application .
Further , there are some powerful packages written for Seaside .
There ’s Mewa , and Magritte , two meta - language packages .
There ’s also Scriptaculous , an increasingly popular AJAX package that ’s being ported to multiple languages .
Meta - languages allow the developer to define forms and reports without getting into the nitty - gritty of HTML markup , and you can use them to automate form validation .
Seaside has good support for AJAX .
You can put asynchronous controls in your application without writing a line of Javascript .
Web developers will notice that something is missing from Seaside : support for page templates .
Other web frameworks allow a developer to mix special tags in with a static HTML page , which gets processed by the framework on the server side and is converted into standard HTML when it ’s sent to the client .
All dynamic pages must be written in Smalltalk .
It ’s possible to inject Javascript and CSS into a dynamic page , using Seaside ’s functions , but it ca n’t be laid out by a designer onto a template page .
They must be set up as strings within your Smalltalk code , as part of the whole Seaside application .
Of course , static pages can be set up as such without the need to use the Seaside framework .
This was disconcerting to me at first .
As I read about packages like Mewa and Magritte , though , I realized that they do the job that I used to do in page templates .
Where this way of doing things could conflict with project operations is if you normally have a page designer set up this sort of stuff .
Edit : I had just barely gotten this posted when Ramon Leon of On Smalltalk pointed out that I was not entirely clear in explaining myself !
It is possible to do CSS programatically in Seaside , as he explains here .
Development Tools
Edit 10/12/06 :
Forgot to mention , you can use Squeak ’s class browser and debugger to write your Seaside code .
Seaside is written in the spirit of Squeak .
It implements “ halos ” like the Squeak UI does .
You can turn them on inside your web browser while running your Seaside project , and do some manipulations of things onscreen .
You can take a visual element in the browser window and have it bring up a web version of the Squeak class browser in another instance of your web browser , so that you can examine and change the code , without having to stop the application .
Class browser , web browser … I know !
The terms can get confusing !
Smalltalk had the term “ browser ” first .
It was n’t meant to confuse people .
The point is you do n’t have to have access to the Squeak GUI to make minor changes to the application .
From what I understand these development features can be turned off when you deploy your app .
Logistical considerations
Hosting : Hardly any ISPs offer hosting for Seaside .
I found one solitary Seaside host on the web at http://www.seasidehosting.st/.
To boot they do not host commercial sites , or databases .
So if you ’re wanting to set up a business app. , or one that requires quick lookup of lots of data , your only option may be to either work with a hosting company that ’s flexible , that will allow you administrative latitude , since they probably do n’t know about Seaside , or host the site yourself .
What about using a database ?
Squeak can interface with external resources , and this goes for databases as well .
There are MySQL and PostgreSQL drivers that run in Squeak and interface with those database systems .
There are several drivers for object oriented database systems , though the databases run outside of Squeak .
There ’s even an object - oriented database written entirely in Smalltalk , called MinneStore , so you can run it inside of Squeak .
( Update 9/23/08 : Ramon Leon has written his own persistence framework in Squeak called SandstoneDB .
He wrote it as a way of advancing the state of the art in web site development .
He found some things about object databases wanting . )
How does a web server interface with Seaside ?
I ’ll put up a separate post about this later .
After doing some searching on the web I found one guy who was trying to get IIS to work with it .
I think he managed to do it .
There are some hurdles to overcome , but from what I hear , the rewards are worth it .
I ’ve only read about it at this point .
Made here , used in Europe
This is going to sound like trivia , but it was striking to me .
Squeak was written in the U.S. , perhaps with contributions from abroad , and Seaside was written by a Canadian ( apparently – Avi ’s site is in Canada ) .
Just about everyone I ’ve seen who ’s using these technologies are European , though I have found some American Squeak / Smalltalk bloggers .
Most of the major sites are hosted in Europe ( I ’ll explain more about them below ) :
Squeak.org , the official site for Squeak , is hosted in Germany
Squeakland.org , an educational site for Squeak , is hosted in Germany
Seaside.st , the official site for Seaside , is hosted in Switzerland
lists.squeakfoundation.org , the Squeak / Seaside mailing lists , are hosted in Germany
smalltalk.org , a Smalltalk evangelism site , is hosted in Canada
The SqueakMap site is hosted in Germany
SeasideHosting.st , the one public hosting service for Seaside , is based in Switzerland
I ’m not saying there should be no participation in Europe .
I just think it ’s striking that there does n’t seem to be that much use of this technology in the U.S .
In contrast , all the major Ruby on Rails sites are U.S. - based .
Flies in the ointment
I can’t give you an honest assessment of Squeak and Seaside without also talking about its weaknesses .
A glaring weakness , IMO , is how disorganized the Squeak / Seaside community is , in terms of web presence .
There are a few Squeak / Smalltalk / Seaside “ central ” sites that seem to be the “ places to go ” to start finding out about it , but they ’ve got broken links all over the place .
Just the other day I checked THE central site for Squeak , http://www.squeak.org, and it was down .
The main Squeak sites were down just a week ago , before they were brought back up again .
There are also Squeak developers and users who are up in arms over how its continued development is being handled .
I talked to the author of a book on Squeak ’s architecture and multimedia features recently , and he said he had given up on it .
Apparently the multimedia features have been getting broken by the modifications the Squeak development team has been making to it .
He recommended if people are going to use EToys or Squeak ’s other multimedia features that they get Squeak Version 3.2 and stick with that .
That ’s the last version where all of these features worked .
Seaside apparently works fine with Version 3.8 , the latest release marked “ stable ” as of this writing .
Apparently what the development team is trying to do is modularize Squeak , so that developers can downsize it if there are features they do n’t need .
I understand the impulse to do this , but I wonder if it was designed the way it is on purpose , and that perhaps something is getting lost by trying to split it up .
You know , techies complain about how everything is integrated in Microsoft Windows , and they wish it was more modular , but integration creates certain advantages and disadvantages .
People should do a cost / benefit analysis on it before dismissing this model .
It may have been better to start from scratch than to try to make Squeak something it ’s not .
Resources
The Squeak system itself has pretty good documentary support .
There were a few books written on Squeak specifically several years ago .
You can find them at Amazon.com .
There ’s only one that ’s been written recently , targeted at programming for children , called “ Squeak : Learn Programming With Robots ” .
It ’s not about using Squeak to program real robots , just virtual , graphical “ robots ” inside the Squeak environment .
It ’s more akin to turtle graphics in the Logo language .
In addition , there are several free online books on the Smalltalk language .
There ’s some introductory material on Seaside here , and here .
I was kind of amazed to find this , but apparently there ’s a Squeak - .
Net Bridge package you can get .
Some words of advice :
Do n’t get discouraged by broken external links .
You ’re going to run into a lot of them on Squeak - related sites .
Even if they appear broken now , they may come back to life later .
The same goes for the links on this blog post ( though I ca n’t vouche for the links on the pages I refer to ) .
Last I checked , all of my links worked .
Some features you may see demonstrated in the videos may no longer exist .
One screencast on Google Video featured page templates in Seaside .
Yes , they once existed , but they were taken out later .
Sometimes the main Squeak sites , like squeak.org , go down .
It ’s been happening some lately .
If they are down , do n’t worry .
They will be back up again eventually .
Online resources for Squeak and Seaside , in no particular order :
Squeak.org – This is the official Squeak site .
You can read a little about it here , and download official releases .
Squeakland.org – This is the educational site for Squeak .
There are some online Squeak demos you can try out .
You ’ll need to install an ActiveX control , or perhaps a plug - in for your browser , since they run inside of a web page .
I have n’t found this add - on yet , but I hear it ’s available for download on this site .
Seaside – This is the official Seaside site .
If you click on the “ Download ” navigation link there , you ’ll get access to Squeak image files that have everything you need to get started with Seaside ( so you do n’t have to put together the needed components yourself ) , plus a little instruction on how to get the Comanche web server ( a component called WAKom , written in Smalltalk ) started .
On Smalltalk – A blog written by Ramon Leon , a former ASP .
Net developer who has switched to using Seaside .
His post , “ Seaside for the .
Net Developer ” is worth reading .
Learning Seaside – A blog written by Ian Prince on his experiences in learning Seaside , among other things .
The terse guide to Squeak – This is similar to Quick Reference for Squeak , except it ’s an HTML page .
It briefly documents the standard Smalltalk types and how to use them .
The Seaside mailing list – Hang out where the knowledgeable people are .
Discuss / ask questions about Seaside .
You ’ll need to subscribe first .
Posted messages are sent to your e-mail address .
The Squeak Beginners mailing list – New to Squeak ?
Ask your questions here .
It was pointed out by gcorriga of The Weekly Squeak that you can subscribe to this list and receive messages posted by others in your e-mail , or you can just e-mail your questions to the list , without subscribing , but your messages will be run through a moderator ( to get their approval ) before they are posted for everyone else to see .
Smalltalk.org : the learning page – This is an evangelism site .
It talks about all things Smalltalk .
I ’m directing you to the learning page here .
It has a bunch of links to some good resources .
Check out some of the navigation links to other parts of the site .
I found the “ Articles ” page particularly interesting .
SqueakMap –
Once you get familiar with the Squeak environment , check out this site .
It ’s a comprehensive database of Squeak packages and projects .
Some of them are the ones I ’ve mentioned in this article .
Apparently SqueakMap is similar to the Gems utility / service in Ruby .
I ’ve used the site , but you ’re supposed to be able to use it inside of Squeak as well , to easily download and install packages , and updates to ones you already have .
Other Smalltalk Implementations
One last note .
Just today I found Cincom Smalltalk .
It ’s a commercial development environment , but they have a free developer ’s license .
Like Squeak , it ’s cross - platform compatible .
It works on Windows , Mac OS , Unix , etc .
It has .
Net , COM , and C integration packages .
You can use it to develop GUI and web applications , and web services .
Pretty neat !
You may see sites or people refer to VisualWorks .
They were bought by Cincom , and the VisualWorks product has been integrated into Cincom Smalltalk .
There are many other Smalltalk implementations out there , amazingly enough .
It seems to be a relatively small community .
I think there are about 8 different implementations .
Geek cakes seem to fall into four main categories : 1 . cakes that resemble computers , game consoles , and other gadgets , 2 . cakes that illustrate one 's geeky obsession , 3 . cakes that are made by strange technological methods , and 4 . cakes that incorporate technology into the finished product .
1. Cakes that look like gadgets .
When Miles turned 15 , he received a Mac Mini cake , and a Mac Mini , too !
Check out this iPhone cake Flickr user icruise received for his birthday .
There are more cakes made to resemble game consoles , computers , and iPods at YesButNoButYes .
This gallery is a little heavy on Apple , but that 's OK , I like apple cakes .
Other categories of geek cakes , after the jump .
2. Cakes that reflect a geek 's favorite pastime include this Star Wars cake recently featured on Boing Boing .
It depicts Max Rebo , the keyboardist in Jabba 's palace band .
With illustrated steps .
Also see the Death Star cake and the Mustafar cake .
Dr. Who fans might prefer this chocolate Dalek cake , created by Flickr user Brainless Angel .
Flickr has a collection of Dr. Who cakes .
Kassy made this awesome Super Mario cake .
It was featured at Game Cakes , where you 'll find many more imaginative gaming - themed cakes .
Pimp That Snack ! has step - by - step instructions for creating your own Rubik 's Cube Cake !
Or you could have one made by a professional .
3 . Highly intelligent , technologically - minded people ( geeks ) cook , too , but sometimes by specialized methods .
Colin at Instructables made this cake with intricately - designed edges by using a laser cutter .
4 . Then there are cakes that do things .
Dave Spencer at Instructables made a volcano cake for his son's birthday .
This cake had vibration , smoke , sound effects , and a lava flow ( strawberry flavored ) !
It required seven boxes of cake mix .
Then he posted the process of building the cake , hardware and all , and a video of the cake in action at the birthday party .
Believe it or not , I 'm hungry now .
Vous êtes une future maman , un futur papa ou bien vous l’êtes déjà et vous vous êtes rendus compte lors de votre dernière sortie que vous aviez oublié un petit ...
Mac’s is a convenience store chain here in the province of Ontario , Canada .
They are actually selling Frosters ( ie big Slushies like at 7/11 ) in three crazy named sizes : WTF , OMGWTF , AUNTSMGWTF .
I think it is an awesome add campaign , but it ’s really pushed some buttons with parents etc …
Mind you viral marketing can be nasty on the turnaround .
To be honest I ’m pretty sure the names of the sizes have been changed now .
More viral videos have been released by Macâ€™s Convenience Stores for their slush based summer drink called â€ œWTFâ€ .
A single webpage has also been created to house the videos .
The Advertising Agency , Bos , has not only produced a series of clips which will be released in bursts , but they have taken full advantage of YouTubeâ€™s sophisticated video player to present the work .

Rove calls
Fox host ' agent of Congress ' for asking about US Attorney firings David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Fox News host Chris Wallace encountered unswerving resistance from Karl Rove when he attempted to ask him on Fox News Sunday about his refusal to respond to the subpoena issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of its investigation into the fired US Attorneys .
" Why not appear under oath or at least allow a transcript ? " asked Wallace .
" Because of the Constitution of the United States , " replied Rove , citing the separation of powers and suggesting there would be a public outcry if either Congressional aides or Supreme Court clerks were called to testify by one of the other branches .
" The Constitution does not prevent you from speaking to me , so in fact I 'll ask you some questions , " responded Wallace .
" Why did you push to fire some US Attorneys in the president 's second term ? "
" Nice try , " Rove came back .
" The president has prerogatives that stand up not only to Congress but also to you .
...
What I advised the president is protected by that prerogative .
Nice try , Chris . "
Rove then spelled out the doctrine of executive privilege , saying , " You do n't understand you 're being an agent of Congress when you ask me that question , but you are . "
" So you say that the Constitution protects -- in fact , prevents you from talking to the press , talking to the public ? " said Wallace , adding " I think I 'm an agent of the public , not of the Congress . "
" In this instance , you 're an agent of Senator Leahy and Congressman Waxman , " Rove concluded .
The following video is from Fox 's Fox News Sunday , broadcast on August 19 .
For a man paid less than £ 3,000 a month , the 16 acres of mansion , designer golf course and sprawling gardens speckled with fountains in Malibu was quite a buy .
The views of the ocean alone - never mind the 15,000 sq ft mansion with eight bathrooms , a pool and tennis courts - probably accounted for a good chunk of the $ 35 m ( £ 18 m ) asking price .
But then Teodoro Nguema Obiang 's modest salary as a minister in his father 's government in Equatorial Guinea is largely symbolic , just like the elections in which his father is returned to power with 97 % of the vote and the distribution of oil revenues in a country with one of the highest per capita incomes on Earth but some of the poorest people .
Little Teodoro , as President Teodoro Obiang Nguema 's son is known at home , appears to spend as little time as possible fulfilling his duties as the minister of agriculture and forestry in the west African state .
Instead he flits between South Africa , France and the US , pursuing business ventures such as a failed rap label while acquiring property and a fleet of Ferraris , Lamborghinis and Bentleys - all made possible by the discovery of oil in Equatorial Guinea 's waters a decade ago .
At the time , there was a promise that the country would become the " Kuwait of Africa " , but it has increasingly come to look like Nigeria as a few kleptocrats get rich while the masses eke out a living .
Mr Obiang probably thought his acquisition of the Malibu house through a front company of which he is the owner would slip by largely unnoticed , particularly after there was so little comment about earlier purchases of two houses in Cape Town and a $ 2 m penthouse flat in California .
But the British anti-corruption group Global Witness spotted the sale and is publicising it as evidence that the Obiang family has followed in a long tradition of African rulers who plunder their country 's wealth while their people live in poverty .
Seen from the Pacific Coast Highway , Mr Obiang 's house does n't look like much , at least not in the context of the exclusive millionaires ' mansions looking out from the cliffs over the Pacific Ocean .
" Oh , that 's a lovely house , " explained Malibu Carl yesterday , watching the surfers next to Malibu pier .
" That 's a hell of a piece of property right there .
It 's huge . "
The house is hidden from prying eyes by a sheer bluff and guardhouse .
But while $ 35 m may buy a lot of house , it can not guarantee you privacy .
A stroll along Malibu pier reveals arched windows , plain , cream plaster walls and a tiled roof .
Royal palm trees line the drive , and the bright red of bougainvillea stands out against the sandy hillside .
Described as a " playboy " , Mr Obiang may be quite interested in meeting his neighbours .
Whether they would return the interest seems unlikely .
Mel Gibson lives on Serra Road , as does Britney Spears .
Olivia Newton John is up there too , and so are Larry Hagman and Titanic director James Cameron .
Across the road is the equally exclusive Malibu Colony , the gated community that housed most of Hollywood during the 1970s and 1980s .
" That 's one of the premier estates in Malibu , " says a local estate agent .
He notes that Cher 's house in Malibu recently went on the market at $ 29 m .
The property belonged to a Canadian developer named Bill Connor .
Rumour has it that he sold two years ago for $ 28 m to a Disney executive ( some say it was someone from Fox ) before its current owner paid $ 35 m at the beginning of this year .
" Most of these sales happen very quietly , " says the estate agent .
" The properties do n't usually hit the market . "
President Obiang , who has ruled since seizing power in 1979 , has decreed that the management of his country 's $ 3bn a year in oil revenues is a state secret .
That is why it is difficult to say for sure exactly how he comes to have about $ 700 m in US bank accounts .
But the president 's son gave an insight into his salary in an affidavit filed with the Cape high court in South Africa in August , as part of a lawsuit against him over a commercial debt .
" Cabinet ministers and public servants in Equatorial Guinea are by law allowed to own companies that , in consortium with a foreign company , can bid for government contracts ...
A cabinet minister ends up with a sizeable part of the contract price in his bank account , " he testified .
Global Witness wants the US government to invoke a proclamation by President Bush nearly three years ago that bars corrupt foreign officials from entering the US and allows their assets to be seized .
But Washington is unlikely to move against Mr Obiang when it was so welcoming of his father only last April .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , called President Obiang a " good friend " even though her own department 's annual human rights report said officials in Equatorial Guinea use torture .
Among those on the receiving end have been a group of mercenaries arrested two years ago for attempting to overthrow the regime with the backing of Mark Thatcher .
Before the oil , relations were not always so friendly .
In the mid-1990s the US ambassador to Malabo was withdrawn after the state radio station said he had been spotted conjuring up his ancestors ' spirits in a graveyard to put spells on President Obiang .
In fact , the ambassador was the son of a Canadian airman and was tending the graves of an RAF bomber crew killed during the second world war .
But once the oil started flowing , American drillers such as ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco began pouring billions of dollars into the country .
The US diplomats were soon back in a very different frame of mind .
Today , the $ 3bn annual oil revenues gives Equatorial Guinea 's 520,000 citizens the second highest income in the world at about £ 26,000 per head .
But ordinary people see little of it .
Most of the population live on less than a pound a day .
Equatorial Guinea comes bottom in the United Nations ' Human Development Index , which measures quality of life .
Three years ago , state radio declared that the president is a god who is " in permanent contact with the Almighty " and can " kill anyone without being called to account " .
But President Obiang is mortal after all : he is suffering from terminal prostate cancer .
He has made it known he favours Little Teodoro as his successor .
Backstory
The tiny state of Equatorial Guinea , five inhabited islands and a mainland portion of jungle , is one of the smallest in Africa , with 520,000 citizens .
In 1979 , nine years after independence from Spain , President Teodoro Obiang Nguema seized power , and has been absolute ruler ever since .
In the past decade , Equatorial Guinea has become Africa 's third largest oil producer .
On paper , oil has made its citizens the second wealthiest on the planet .
In practice , much of the £ 370 m revenue is grabbed by the president , while most people live on less than a dollar a day .
A coup plot was staged in 2004 , led by Simon Mann , a friend of Sir Mark Thatcher ; the former prime minister 's son escaped a claim for millions of pounds in damages when the UK appeal court blocked an attempt by the dictator to sue him .
BEIJING , June 29 ( Reuters ) -
The red dragon is back in China , but now carry an endangered warning and a walloping $ 8,000 price tag .
Many Chinese are willing to pay the price of a small family car to own their own dragonfish , or arrowana , which they believe has the power to bring luck and prosperity .
Some Chinese believe they are descendants of a mythical dragon and place high value on dragon symbolism .
The fish ’s red and gold colorings are traditionally lucky colors in China which , combined with its name , make it the latest must - have luxury for an increasingly affluent middle class .
“ As China ’s economy develops the middle class is maturing and the middle class population is getting larger , ” said Tom Chiu , who opened a shop selling the fish in Beijing recently .
“ As a symbol of upper class life , keeping fish is becoming a trend amongst these people .
We think that it ’s a good time for us to enter the market , ” he told Reuters .
The wild red dragon , which has been fished almost to extinction , is believed to be only found in the upper reaches of the Kapuas River in western Borneo in Indonesia .
In some countries , including the United States , owners require a permit to keep one .
Many dragonfish now spend their lives as the prize exhibit in a wealthy Chinese home .
Enthusiasts argue that this is necessary to ensure the survival of the species , albeit in captivity .
Like a good wine , red dragonfish become more valuable with age .
They live to up to 25 years and can grow up to one meter ( 3.3 feet ) long .
Silver dragonfish are sometimes used as a substitute , but they just do n’t carry the same significance .
Wen Jun is one of China ’s new breed of fish enthusiasts , and like many arrowana owners he prefers to keep the size of his fishy fortune a secret .
He refurbished an entirely separate building to hold his aquarium and sincerely believes the dragonfish brought him luck .
“ After I started keeping dragonfish , I felt better both in my work and life .
Maybe it brings me self confidence .
After all this fish is a kind of feng shui fish , ” he said , referring to the ancient Chinese belief in geomancy .
“ This fish has brought me luck that I had never expected . ”
From a network administrator to his boss .
Enjoy
Dear Boss ,
As an employee of an institution of higher education , I have few very basic expectations .
Chief among these is that my direct superiors have an intellect that ranges above the common ground squirrel .
After your consistent and annoying harassment of my co-workers and me during our commission of duties , I can only surmise that you are one of the few true genetic wastes of our time .
Asking me , a network administrator , to explain every nuance of everything I do each time you happen to stroll into my office is not only a waste of time , but also a waste of precious oxygen .
I was hired because I know how to network computer systems , and you were apparently hired to provide amusement to your employees , who watch you vainly attempt to understand the concept of “ cut and paste ” as it is explained to you for the hundredth time .
You will never understand computers .
Something as incredibly simple as binary still gives you too many options .
You will also never understand why people hate you , but I am going to try and explain it to you , even though I am sure this will be just as effective as telling you what an IP is .
Your shiny new iMac has more personality than you ever will .
You wander around the building all day , shiftlessly seeking fault in others .
You have a sharp dressed , useless look about you that may have worked for your interview , but now that you actually have responsibility , you pawn it off on overworked staff , hoping their talent will cover for your glaring ineptitude .
In a world of managerial evolution , you are the blue - green algae that everyone else eats and laughs at .
Managers like you are a sad proof of the Dilbert principle .
Seeing as this situation is unlikely to change without you getting a full frontal lobotomy reversal , I am forced to tender my resignation ; however , I have a few parting thoughts :
When someone calls you in reference to employment , it is illegal for you to give me a bad recommendation as I have consistently performed my duties and even more .
The most you can say to hurt me is , “ I prefer not to comment . ”
To keep you honest , I will have friends randomly call you over the next couple of years , because I know you would be unable to do it on your own .
I have all the passwords to every account on the system and I know every password you have used for the last five years .
If you decide to get cute , I will publish your “ Favorites , ” which I conveniently saved when you made me “ back up ” your useless files .
I do believe that terms like “ Lolita ” are not viewed favorably by the university administrations .
When you borrowed the digital camera to “ take pictures of your mother ’s b- day , ” you neglected to mention that you were going to take nude pictures of yourself in the mirror .
Then , like the techno - moron you are , you forgot to erase them .
Suffice it to say , I have never seen such odd acts with a ketchup bottle .
I assure you that those photos are being kept in safe places pending your authoring of a glowing letter of recommendation .
( And , for once , would you please try to use spellcheck ?
I hate correcting your mistakes . )
I expect the letter of recommendation on my desk by 8:00 am tomorrow .
One word of this to anybody and all of your twisted little repugnant obsessions will become public knowledge .
Never f*** with your systems administrator , Mister !
They know what you do with all that free time !
Sincerely ,
Your beloved network administrator

We owe our modern way of life to the high density energy that is found in fossil fuels , and also the many derivatives that are made out of oil ( plastics ) .
Everything from the food that we eat to keep us alive ( fertilizers , pesticides ) , to everyday entertainment gizmos like Xboxes , smart gadgets , electric skateboards , etc. is made possible in some part by oil .
Let 's not forget about the fact that the entire infrastructure around us , buildings , roads , bridges , dams , absolutely everything is in some way made possible , to varying degrees , by oil .
With such a big impact on our society we can safely say that we take oil for granted , and that 's what this website is going to be about .
Wait a minute now , why do you start this text talking about oil when the website name talks about the end of suburbia ?
Well guess what , suburbia is another thing that is possible and heavily depends on oil .
Sprawling networks of neighborhoods that stretch miles and miles from the city center require gasoline for commutes , grocery shopping , grocery delivery and in general access to services that can be only found in the city .
Infrastructure needed to support the suburbs is also heavily reliant on oil , for construction , maintenance .
Just take a look at this drone captured video footage of the recent Oroville dam crisis .
This video captured by a cheap camera drone clearly show us what we would n't be able to see from the ground .
This is another aspect of our live where drones became useful .
These mechanical birds are getting more and more popular .
I would not be surprised if they soon start delivering products ordered through amazon , or beers at bars !
That 's a perfect example of what I 'm talking about .
Entire infrastructure of the United States , which supports suburban way of life , requires an overhaul , for which massive amounts of energy are going to be required .
Energy
Energy is what drives us , literally .
Fossil fuels are energy , although they are also a resource since through processing oil we get things like plastics , fertilizers , pesticides , etc .
Without energy lights would n't turn on , tech gadgets can't be charged , homes can't be heated in the winter and air conditioned in the summer , cars can't be driven , or manufactured for that matter , you get the picture .
All the things that make our modern way of life are in large part possible because of energy .
Again have a look at GoPro FPV drone captured footage of the repair efforts on the Oroville dam .
Repairs are said to cost close to 5 million dollars per day .
Officials talk about costs in millions of dollars , what they should rather be doing is talking about cost in energy units , since energy is what does the work .
And that is exactly where the problems start , energy .
When talking about energy , just one graph is needed to show the predicament that we 're in .
This is a graph that show United States energy returns on energy invested or EROI for short for various different sources of energy .
In terms of oil , plainly speaking , EROI is a number that tells us how many barrels of oil are recovered for every barrel of oil that is spent by the oil rigs , machinery , processing , etc .
You might have heard it in the news that the United States is currently going through shale oil revolution .
Have a look on the graph what kind of EROI shale oil has , only a fraction of what conventional oil has .
Same thing is true for the Albertan oil sands in Canada .
We really are scrapping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to oil production , a resource of high importance for maintaining our everyday life standard .
Resources
After energy , the next major hurdle that we face if we are to continue our suburban way of life is resource depletion .
We 're talking about things like drinkable water , minerals , precious metals and other chemical elements that are vital for everyday life , like phosphorus for example .
Similarly to the theory that oil production is hitting its upper limits there is also a theory that we are facing a peak in the production of phosphorus .
Now you must be thinking why am I mentioning phosphorus , what difference does it make if we no longer have any phosphorus ?
Well again , just like oil , phosphorus is a very important component of fertilizers which are in turn vital for food production nowadays .
Without phosphorus plants like corn , wheat , soybeans , sunflower , potatoes cannot grow .
Without corn and wheat there is no meat production .
There is no precise number on the amount of phosphorus left in the ground .
Estimates suggests that there is still somewhere between 50 - 100 years of this life giving chemical element left in the ground for us to economically extract .
Peak would then be somewhere between year 2030 and 2060 .
That 's practically within the lifetime of people living today .
Other elements like minerals important for the production of electronics are also very hard to come by .
Let 's not forget about drinkable water which has already caused us to dam and prevent several rivers from reaching the sea ( Jordan , Colorado ) .
Everything for the sake of suburban way of life .
Society
Perhaps a better title for this section would be " population " because we 're going to be talking about the main driving factor behind such high energy and resource consumption , population .
Human population has seen an unprecedneted growth over the last 100 years .
We 've gone from 1 billion to 7 billion people , adding 1 billion people every 15 years or so .
Population growth in and of itself would n't be a problem if at the same time we did n't dramatically increase the per capita consumption of energy ( in the form of fossil fuels ) and resources ( water , minerals , chemical element , metals ) .
In other such high population numbers and growth would n't be a problem if we all lived like the Amish .
Trouble is , very few people choose to live like the Amish , myself included , or should I say excluded .
If we are to keep our lavish suburban lifestyles , with huge houses , high energy and resource consumption , we seriously need to consider decreasing the population numbers .
Conversely to that , if we are interested in increasing our numbers , we need to seriously consider decreasing our resource consumption .
Environment
As a consequence of everything that I 've talked about until now , environment is n't in such a good shape , it 's not in a good shape at all .
Climate , whether or not you choose to believe it 's because of humans , is changing .
Natural processes that are important for keeping a hospitable environment are being disrupted by either overuse ( logging , mining , hunting , fishing , habitat destruction ) or contaminated by reckless waste disposal and other types of contamination .
True extent of the damage currently being done is n't easy to grasp .
There is a number of factors at play from ocean acidification , polar ice cap and glacier meltdowns , jet stream crossovers and ocean current reversals , temperature rises , etc .
All these factors are closely related to each other .
Taking one , like for example current temperatures , to the extreme , takes all the others with them as well .
And again , if you 're thinking , what does ocean acidification has to do with the suburban way of life , let me just say that oceans produce somewhere between 50 - 85 % of the oxygen that we breath .
If the oceans turn more acidic , there are going to be consequences for humans everywhere , not just in the suburbs , whether we like it or not .
Economy
Everything that I talked about up until now is in turn tied to economy .
Some people dread to talk about the economy , but it needs to be addressed since it has such a huge role in everyday life .
One thing that our economic system relies on at the moment is growth driven by debt .
It is this type of economic arrangement that has caused us to end up in such a mess that we 're in .
Every country is basically in debt to every other country and there is no end to this trend .
It seems that debt is the only thing that has been growing , when listening to the news .
Most people say , who do we owe this money , to ourselves ?
Well the thing is , we 're borrowing this money from the future .
Future energy and resource recovery is what the economists are counting on to return all that debt .
It 's all complicated to explain in a few paragraphs , expect updates soon where I 'll try to explain the current state of the economy a bit better .
Plans for this website
In the preceding paragraphs I 've talked a bit about all the issues and topics that EndOfSuburbia is going to talk about .
This website will pose as a platform for discussing issues surrounding the current situation with energy , resources , environment , economy and how it relates to our everyday life .
Suburban way of life relies on a lot of different factors and it makes sense to be informed and prepared for whatever future has to bring .
I hope you 'll join us in our quest for a better more sustainable future .
Disagreeing with someone without making him mad is an art form .
So letâ€™s talk about how to get your point across without getting into a fight .
The 6 strategies of persuasion below are best utilized when you want to be heard , understood , and considered , when you seek productive exchange , when your goals involve truth and clarity , and when you want to change someoneâ€™s mind without landing yourself in a heated argument .
Â Â
Strategy # 1 : Be a good listener .
Your ears will never get you in trouble .
Kenneth A. Wells once said , â€ œA good listener tries to understand what the other person is saying .
In the end he may disagree sharply , but because he disagrees , he wants to know exactly what it is he is disagreeing with.â€ 
If I had to reduce this list down to just one piece of advice to help you persuade without offending , it would be this :
Ask questions until you understand your opponentâ€™s point of view .
Iâ €™ve seen far too many silly arguments that played like shadowboxing because a person wasted time attacking his own misunderstandings .
Whenever someone shows us new information ( a news report , an online article , a spoken opinion ) , we immediately interpret that information in light of our experiences .
In other words , half of what weâ€ ™re hearing comes from inside our own heads !
Only by asking questions and truly listening can we escape our presuppositions and understand another ’s viewpoint , and we must understand a viewpoint before we have any hope of changing it .
Strategy # 2 : An open mind leaves a chance for someone to drop a worthwhile idea in it .
If youâ€™re trying to persuade someone , thereâ€™s a good chance your mind has already closed around the conviction of your argument .
Therein lies the danger â€ “- a closed mind is great at action , but not at listening .
And listening is essential to pursuasion !
I would never tell you to discard your convictions , but do remain open to suggestion , and do seek clarity .
If your opponent knows youâ€ ™re open to his ideas , he may entertain yours .
Strategy # 3 : If the world were a logical place , men would ride sidesaddle .
Use phrases like â€ œIn my opinion , â€ â€ œI believe that , â€ or â€ 
In my experience , â€ to make it clear when youâ€ ™re expressing a matter of personal beliefÂ instead of a quantifiable scientific fact because this will show your opponent that you understand the difference and are open to its ramifications .
If you appear reasonable , your opponent may reciprocate .
Strategy # 4 : Speak two languages , one of them Body .
Effective non-verbal communication sets the stage for your persuasive argument , so itâ€™s worth paying attention to ; itâ€™s more than window dressing , even in intimate relationships where your partner knows what youâ€™re like behind the mask .
Smile to communicate friendliness and acceptance .
Sit up straight to project confidence .
Keep an open body posture ( no crossed arms or legs ) to communicate openness .
Speak in a relaxed manner ( mind the tone of your voice ! ) to project calm and clarity of thought .
Make appropriate eye contact .
Nod when the other person speaks â€ “ this communicates understanding , not necessarily agreement .
Another trick to communicate understanding without compliance is to periodically say , â€ œI understand , â€ or , â€ œI hear what youâ€ ™re saying .â€ 
Unless your opponent possesses a difficult personality that forces you to interrupt to get in a word in edgewise , let him finish his thoughts before offering yours .
Strategy # 5 : Just the facts , maâ€™am .
At one particular Internet forum , I was constantly impressed by a member who had an amazing talent for communicating complicated ( sometimes controversial ) ideas without making anyone angry .
So what did this Zen master of persuasion do that most of us do not ?
Simple :
He stuck to the facts and kept his ego out of it .
The block - quote immediately below is a hypothetical example of how not to foster a persuasive conversation , intended to contrast the genius of the real - life forum example from our Zen master , further down the page :
TV - Forum Newbie :
Hey guys , I think all televisions are the same .
I canâ€™t understand why some of you would pay 5 grand for a TV when the one for 500 bucks is just as good .
Could someone explain this to me ?
Mr. Ego : I completely disagree with you .
All televisions are not the same .
Why donâ€™t you read some product reviews so youâ€™ll be able to tell the difference ?
You will find differences in black level , brightness , video processing , colorimetry , geometry , contrast , and other variables .
Again , all televisions are not the same , and I completely disagree with the premise of this question .
Okay , so whatâ€™s wrong with the way Mr. Ego responded ?
At first glance , his response seems fine .
I mean , it certainly could have been worse !
But only one sentence in his response focuses on the facts .
The rest could easily be interpreted as a selfish assertion of ego , a quest for distinction and superiority , whether intentional or not .
So how did the Zen master handle this particular exchange ?
He used that one sentence Iâ€™m referring to , the one sentence that answered the question and stuck to the facts ( see below ) :
Newbie :
Hey guys , I think all televisions are the same .
I canâ€™t understand why some of you would pay 5 grand for a TV when the one for 500 bucks is just as good .
Could someone explain this to me ?
Zen Master :
You will find differences in black level , brightness , video processing , colorimetry , geometry , contrast , and other variables .
Not very interesting , is it ?
But the thread from which I copied this text proceeded smoothly , with the newbie asking questions and the expert responding with simple , uncolored facts .
The expert was eventually recognized for his expertise , the newbie left with newfound understanding , and no one became upset .
In short , a mind had been changed .
All because the Zen master stuck to the facts .
Strategy # 6 : Sometimes , itâ€™s what you donâ€™t say that counts .
The preceding example was important not merely for what was said , but for what wasnâ€™t .
Weâ€™ve already mentioned the benefits of avoiding ego driven statements , but hereâ€™s a more comprehensive list of statements that derail persuasion more often than not :
Assertions of Superiority : I do it the right way ;
This is unacceptable ;
My way is better ;
Why canâ€™t you do it like so - and - so ; Your way of thinking is flawed .
I do it the right way ;
This is unacceptable ;
My way is better ;
Why canâ€™t you do it like so - and - so ; Your way of thinking is flawed .
Assertions of Independence : I disagree ;
We donâ€™t see eye to eye ;
Weâ€ ™re not on the same page ;
My position is different than yours .
I disagree ;
We donâ€™t see eye to eye ;
Weâ€ ™re not on the same page ;
My position is different than yours .
Personal Attacks :
Your thinking is stupid ; I canâ€™t believe how dumb you are ; Hearing you say that makes me question your morality .
Aside from the personal attacks , many of the preceding statements have their place .
The key is knowing when to use them .
Usually , the person seeking to persuade is better off letting the strength of his argument establish both his superiority and independence without explicitly claiming them .
These 6 simple strategies of persuasion cannot make the logic of your argument more appealing or change the nature of the person youâ€ ™re trying to convince , but they can increase your odds of success .
These strategies have worked for me , and I am hopeful they will work for you .
By honing your persuasive talents , you too can discover the influence inside you — an influence waiting to break free , influence others , and change the world .
A long time ago — in the summer of 2001 if I recall correctly — I ran into an intriguing page at http://chaos.yerbox.org/face/
( Chaosmachine ’s more recent page can be found at blamcast .net ) .
The original page , which sadly resides only in the web archives nowadays , was all about this hidden “ demon face ” in one of Aphex Twin ‘s tracks , # 2 ( the long formula ) on “ Windowlicker ” .
This face was supposed to be viewable with a spectrograph program , so I decided to try it myself .
A spectrograph basically visualizes the sound spectrum .
First I needed to extract the track from the Windowlicker CD , which was easy with CDex .
The extraction of the whole track was not really necessary because the “ face ” is situated at the very end of the track , starting from the 5:27 mark and lasting for about 10 seconds .
There are other “ audio images ” on this particular track as well ( and one at the end of the first track ) , but the face is certainly the most exciting of them all .
After I had the wav- file , I used a program called Spectrogram to visualize the file .
To my amazement , it worked , and I was soon staring at the “ demon ” face :
I was , however , not content with this .
Why would the good ol ’
Twin have added a “ demon ” face into one of his tracks ?
I mean , the man does have a weird sense of humor , but I always thought demons were more up BoC ‘s alley …
While examining the image , I came to the conclusion that something was not right .
So I started messing around with the settings of the spectrograph program , and after a bit of knob twiddling the mystery revealed itself : the face was supposed to be watched with a logarithmic frequency scale , not with a linear scale .
A linear scale provided the “ demon face ” , but with a logarithmic scale the end results were quite different :
Why , it was none other than the Twin himself all the time , complete with his patented grin !
The settings which I used to get the above image were roughly the same as in the picture below ( they are n’t the exact same settings since I ’ve lost them somewhere , but if you try them yourself you ’ll find that they are more than close enough ) :
After this “ amazing ” discovery , I contacted the guy at chaos .
yerbox.org and informed him of the results .
He seemed interested to add this new - found info to his pages , but I suppose he never got around to actually do it — which is the primary reason for the existence of this particular page .
Next , I decided to inform the good folks on the IDM mailinglist about The Face .
It turned out that this “ picture to audio ” - thing was really not hard to do at all and there was a Windows program called Coagula that could transform any picture into soundwaves with minimum effort .
Aphex Twin himself had used a Mac program called Metasynth to do his images .
I tested Coagula and found it easy enough to use .
Now this new discovery raised a new question :
Were there more examples of this audio imaging available ?
Luckily the soundscapes that Coagula spits out are quite easy to notice in their aural form , so I did n’t have to look for long before I found another example :
On Plaid ‘s “ Rest Proof Clockwork ” , the track “ 3recurring ” contains a continuous stream of “ threes ” ( as seen on the cover art of their previous album , “ Not For Threes ” ) .
Besides the Plaid discovery I could n’t find any more examples of audio imaging on any of the CD ’s I own , but I did n’t bother to look that hard either .
However it is clear that this audio / image stuff was “ hip ” at 1999 , since both of the aforementioned records were released around that time .
After going public with my pages , I ’ve had several people contact me to offer more information on the subject or wanting to get an interview .
The most prominent one was the story run on Wired Magazine ( a well - researched story , but they got my age wrong by 6 years ) .
As a nice finish , here are is a small gallery of some audio images from Aphex Twin and other artists :
" I am only in favor of executing on a plan to push some USAs out if we really are ready and willing to put in the time necessary to select candidates and get them appointed .
It will be counterproductive to DOJ operations if we push USAs out and then do n't have replacements ready to roll immediately .
I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration , we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to make USA appointments .
[ By sidestepping the confirmation process ] we can give far less deference to home state senators and thereby get 1 . ) our preferred person appointed and 2 . ) do it far faster and more efficiently at less political costs to the White House , " - Kyle Sampson , Alberto Gonzales 's Chief of Staff .
We now know that a political purge of U.S. attorneys was directed by the president through the attorney - general , and was enabled by the Patriot Act .
The alleged reason for removing the U.S. attorneys - which the administration took a while to come up with - is that the U.S. attorneys were insufficiently devoted to rooting out Democratic voters ' alleged voter fraud .
( For a guide to this scam , see Josh Marshall 's long obsession , which now seems a little more justified and a lot less boring than it once did .
For TPM 's full backfill on the U.S. Attorneys story , click here . )
It seems to me pretty obvious that they 've been caught trying to rig the justice system to perpetuate Republican control of the House and Senate .
It seems to me that this originates with the president and Karl Rove .
And it seems more than obvious to me that Alberto Gonzales should resign .
No attorney - general with this kind of cloud over him can faintly summon public confidence as a neutral enforcer of justice .

Al Gore vs. Bonds : Who Roided It Up Better ?
I came across an article at ArmchairGM ( via Reddit ) about Barry Bonds vs. Mark McGwire : who was the better steroid user ?.
Personally , I thought they did the wrong comparison .
They should be looking at Al Gore .
Let 's assume that Barry Bonds uses / used steroids .
Let 's assume the same thing about Al Gore .
Nothing too controversial about either assumption , right ?
Right .
But it 's sure fun .
Which guy 's steroids regimen was the way to go ?
Barry Bonds is likely to break Hank Aaron 's home run record , but Al Gore has been breaking box office records himself .
The numbers alone were not enough for us to go on , so I present some pictures here .
1987 vs 1980
Here both Barry and Gore are looking pretty slim and twig - like .
1990 vs 1995
Barry is trying to decide whether he should start using steroids and Al Gore is learning about this new thing called the World Wide Web .
1993 vs 1997
Here they both are during the '90s , but both of them are still looking natural .
Gore looks like he could use some steroids .
1996 vs 2000
1999 vs 2008
Here 's a picture of Gore winning the 2008 presidential election .
He clearly has Bonds beat on the steroids use , and does n't even have to use body armor to win the presidency , unlike Bonds .
2002 vs 2010
And here they are at their most bulky .
Do you see what steriods does to you , kids ?
It makes you look like the sword - arm guy from 300 .
Here 's a picture of them from their rookie year , just to show you how much they 've changed :
Rookie
These pictures pretty clearly show the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs by both people .
Are we going to start screening for drugs before we swear in a United States President or are we going to allow this abuse to continue ?
Unicef says the study is the first of its kind for child well - being
Unicef looked at 40 indicators from the years 2000 - 2003 including poverty , family relationships , and health .
One of the report 's authors told the BBC that under - investment and a " dog- eat - dog " society were to blame for Britain 's poor performance .
The government says its policies have helped to improve child welfare .
Unicef - the United Nations children 's organisation - says Child Poverty in Perspective : An Overview of Child Well - being in Rich Countries is the first study of childhood across the world 's industrialised nations .
In its league table the Netherlands came top , followed by Sweden , Denmark and Finland .
Unicef UK executive director David Bull said all the countries had weaknesses that needed to be addressed .
" By comparing the performance of countries we see what is possible with a commitment to supporting every child to fulfil his or her full potential , " he said .
' Dog - eat - dog society '
The authors say they used the most up - to - date information to assess " whether children feel loved , cherished , special and supported , within the family and community , and whether the family and community are being supported in this task by public policy and resources " .
But they added : " The process of international comparison can never be freed from questions of translation , culture , and custom . "
We simply cannot ignore these shocking findings

Reaction in quotes Relative poverty explained
Professor Jonathan Bradshaw , from York University , one of the report 's authors , put the UK 's poor ratings down to long term under - investment and a " dog- eat - dog " society .
" In a society which is very unequal , with high levels of poverty , it leads on to what children think about themselves and their lives .
That 's really what 's at the heart of this , " he said .
The UK government said its initiatives in areas such as poverty , pregnancy rates , teenage smoking , drinking and risky sexual behaviour had helped improve children 's welfare .
Welfare reform minister Jim Murphy said the Unicef study was important , although it used some data which was now out of date .

" Hopefully it leads to a wider conversation about what more we can do to eradicate poverty , " he said .
Unicef 's league table drew on sources including the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) and the World Health Organization 's survey of Health Behaviour in School - age Children ( HBSC ) aged 11 , 13 and 15 .
For the UK , the HBSC survey is taken from responses of residents of England only .
Unicef also said some PISA indicators for the UK should be treated with caution because of low sample response rates .
The Children 's Society launched a website to coincide with the report , www.mylife.uk.com, which allows children to answer a series of surveys about their lives .
Chief executive Bob Reitemeier said : " We simply cannot ignore these shocking findings .

" Unicef 's report is a wake - up call to the fact that , despite being a rich country , the UK is failing children and young people in a number of crucial ways . "
The Children 's Commissioner for England , Professor Sir Al Aynsley - Green , said : " We are turning out a generation of young people who are unhappy , unhealthy , engaging in risky behaviour , who have poor relationships with their family and their peers , who have low expectations and do n't feel safe . "
UK REPORT FINDINGS UK child poverty has doubled since 1979 Children living in homes earning less than half national average wage - 16 % Children rating their peers as " kind and helpful " - 43 % Families eating a meal together " several times " a week - 66 % Children who admit being drunk on two or more occasions - 31 %
Colette Marshall , UK director of Save the Children , said it was " shameful " to see the UK at the bottom of the table .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne accused Chancellor Gordon Brown of having " failed this generation of children " .
" After 10 years of his welfare and education policies , our children today have the lowest well - being in the developed world , " he said .
Because Microsoft will never admit to any possible overheating problems with their beloved Xbox 360 design , Japanese - based Nikkei hired a thermal design expert to come examine the console .
They looked at two — one made in 2005 and one repaired in May 2007 .
Here ’s what they found :
â€ ¢
The temperature gap with room temp was 22 degrees C. “ When designing consumer products , it is common to seek a temperature gap of around 10 degrees C between exhaust and room temperatures , ” the thermal design expert said .
“ The 22 degrees C is quite a large gap … ”
â€ ¢
The cooling fan was half of desktop PCs — apparently to reduce noise .
â€ ¢
The expert pointed out , “ The heat sink on the graphics LSI is so small , I wonder if it can really cool down the board . ”
The reason for this ?
Apparently , Microsoft had to downsize the graphics LSI heat sink so that the DVD drive could be placed above it .
â€ ¢
In five minutes after booting up a game , the graphic LSI heat sink temp rose to 70 degrees C . In 15 minutes , the temperature for the microprocessor heat sink stabilized at 58 degrees , but the graphics LSI heat sink reached 80 degrees C .
If the room temperature was high ( like 35 degrees C ) , the heat sink could possibly hit 100 degrees C .
What ’s more , if the vents were clogged with dust , the temperature could also increase .
â€ ¢
The console repaired in May 2007 did not have a new heat sink placed in it .
This is bad design .
Really , really bad .
Wake - Up Progressives !
Where Do We Go From Here ?
By Jack Hughes
As the shock of the 2016 election results sink - in and the reality of total Republican control of the federal government along with an increasing majority of states , progressives are now , at long last , forced to assess what has happened and plan where to go from here .
We must recognize that the Democratic Party is now utterly and completely powerless to prevent Republicans from steam - rolling their radical agenda through Congress .
Anyone expecting Senate Democrats to filibuster Republican legislation still does n't appreciate the nature of the Republican opposition or their current position of total political domination .
After abusing the parliamentary tactic for the eight years of the Obama administration , Republicans will eliminate the filibuster the moment it becomes politically inconvenient .
Since the Gingrich Revolution , Republicans have not been the " loyal opposition . "
They have violated every norm and every tradition -- at least since the Civil War -- of American politics and civil behavior .
They have completely abandoned actual policy and governance in favor of shameless pandering to know - nothings and kooks , and using egregiously dishonest propaganda .
For instance , every time Republicans use the terms " tax cut " and " balanced budget " in the same sentence they are knowingly committing political fraud .
Right - wing propaganda has been so dishonest -- and so pervasive -- that the Republican base has become immune to historical facts , scientific data and rational discourse .
For Republicans , politics has become total political war .
Democrats have not understood this simple fact , which is why they -- we -- have continued to lose .
What is meant by political total war ?
Consider it a cold civil war , or as Bill Maher described it , a slow - moving coup .
Against the Democrats ' traditional politics of issue advertising and get - out - the - vote efforts , Republicans have deployed a generation - long saturation campaign of dishonest propaganda that bears the hallmarks of a domestic psychological warfare operation ; vote suppression and " voter caging " to reduce Democratic voter turnout ; extreme gerrymandering to concentrate Democratic majorities into fewer numbers of congressional and legislative districts ; and naked politicization of the courts .
Due to the Republicans ' " scientific " gerrymandering , Democrats routinely receive millions more votes , but are consistently consigned to minority status in the House of Representatives .
It gets worse .
There is every indication -- since exit polling is the only means to verify election results in the era of paperless electronic voting -- of extensive Republican election theft .
Does anyone seriously believe that the radicals who engage in sleazy anti-democratic vote suppression in full public view would balk at tampering with election results behind closed doors ?
Yet Democratic Party officials -- even the stunned losing candidates -- refuse to even consider the possibility of election theft as they passively watch predicted victories unexpectedly and mysteriously transformed into defeats where Republicans control the vote counts .
The ramifications are far too serious to ignore .
These measures , i.e. , extreme gerrymandering , vote - suppression and suspicious deviations between exit polls and official results that always favor Republicans , have led to de facto minority rule .
Minority rule is tyranny -- the real kind -- not the phony hyperbole that Republicans dishonestly bleat about whenever a Democrat manages to get elected .
What is the objective of all these sleazy anti-democratic tactics ?
In short , the establishment of corporate feudalism ; to reduce the American middle class to low - paid , politically powerless peasants .
The Big Money interests that finance the Republican Party and its propaganda machine do n't love guns or hate abortion or despise homosexuals .
Those issues are just a means to mobilize the rubes into voting against their own economic interests .
The middle - class fools who loyally vote Republican year after year have been brainwashed into mindlessly blaming Democrats for their decline in prosperity while our country has adopted “ conservative ” low - tax ( for the rich ) low - service ( for everybody else ) economic policies .
Enjoy your toll roads and sky - rocketing tuition rates and health - care costs , suckers .
Republicans are going to try to steal your Social Security and Medicare next .
So where do we go from here ?
First , progressives must realize that 21st Century politics is now primarily a propaganda war to capture the limited attention span of low - information voters .
The plutocrats have invested billions of dollars in a vertical network of foundations , policy institutes and think tanks , i.e. , propaganda shops , to carefully craft cleverly deceptive over - simplifications , half - truths , distortions , and outright lies , along with a horizontal network of blogs , websites , radio shows and cable - TV channels to disseminate them .
There is no similar advocacy structure for the interests of the poor and middle classes .
This must change starting with -- at a minimum -- central coordination of consistent , coherent , and most of all sustained , policy messaging for progressives to deliver with a unified voice and common rhetoric .
Simplicity and repetition is the key to successful propaganda .
Second , Democrats are still bringing a book bag to a gun fight .
The news media wo n't risk being branded as " biased " by exposing Republican lies .
It 's up to the Democrats to do it -- which means not just politely refuting dishonest Republican talking points -- but explicitly shaming right - wing PR flacks and politicians as " dirty goddam liars " by name and to their faces on national TV .
Republicans must be forced on the defensive .
Third , there is no reason for voters to turn out for " corporate Democrats " or " Conserva - Dems " owned by the same lobbyists and special interests that own the Republicans .
The era of Blue Dog Democrats is over .
Democrats must be divorced completely from special interests , freeing themselves to boldly inform voters that they 've been deceived and screwed by Republican politicians and their oligarch masters .
Democratic politicians can no longer simply present themselves to voters as " not Republicans . "
It 's political suicide .
Democrats must provide a truly progressive alternative .
Fourth , street protests accomplish nothing when they are not tied to specific political objectives .
In fact , they are often counter - productive when undisciplined and surge out of control -- used in right - wing propaganda to attack progressives and progressive ideals .
Far more productive would be if those protestors dedicated five dollars a month -- or more -- to the Democratic Party and volunteered their time at the local party level .
An influx of idealistic activists would re-build the Democratic Party into a more aggressive -- and much more progressive -- political party .
These strategies must be enacted immediately , starting at the state party level -- especially in Red States -- and in time to affect the 2018 mid-term elections .
Failure to do so will mean further Republican entrenchment , making it even more difficult to oust them from power .
Success wo n't be immediate , but sooner or later , consistent and sustained progressive messaging will begin to penetrate the political consciousness of America 's low - info voters .
The time for timid , apologetic , progressivism is done .
Only aggressive " Mad Dog Democrats " can reverse the current Republican strangle - hold on American politics and restore prosperity and justice to America .
The most important consideration in total political war is to recognize the fact that we 're engaged in one .
Even in the " post - factual " environment Republicans have manufactured , there is no more powerful political weapon than the truth .
If America is to survive as a liberal democracy , progressives must make Republicans choke on it .
Last week I showed how to profile a Rails application using ruby - prof .
The post was driven by our desire to improve MapBuzz ‘s map rendering speed .
Our nightly log analysis showed that rendering speed has significantly degraded over the last few weeks .
Since the whole point of MapBuzz is to share maps with others , we needed to find out what was taking so long .
A day of profiling and we had our answer .
With a few simple changes we were able to reduce rendering time from 7.8 seconds to 0.92 seconds ( note these times are gathered while profiling the application , so the real times are 2 to 3 times less ) .
What we found should be generally applicable to all Rails applications , so I ’d like to share them :
Do n’t use ActiveRecord #attributes
Get your :includes right
Do n’t check template timestamps ( cache_template_loading = true )
Do n’t use url_for
Do n’t let Rails parse timestamps
Do n’t symbolize keys ( local_assigns_support_string_keys = false )
If you interested in the nitty - gritty details of each change , keep reading !
A Bit of Background
MapBuzz renders maps in a two step process .
First , the html page is created and shown to the user .
Second , the browser makes an Ajax request to get the features that should be shown on the map .
The reason for having a two step process is that it allows users to zoom and pan around the map , without having to reload the whole page .
Log analysis revealed that the Ajax request was taking a long time – 1 to 2 seconds , with a big standard deviation .
Our goal is to reduce the average time to less than half a second and to significantly reduce the standard deviation .
If you look at the request URI , you ’ll see its an Atom feed of features and not an HTML page .
That has performance implications .
First ,
Atom feeds tend to have lots of links .
In our case , each entry has 10 to 15 links .
We limit the number of entries to 50 , so that means there are roughly 600 link per page .
Second , we generate Atom feeds in a modular fashion – each entry is created from 10 partials .
There is a partial for the user , one for ratings , one for content , one for icons , one for geometries , etc .
Why did we do it this way ?
Simple – to keep things DRY .
Having a set of partials creates an extremely modular system – we can mix and match them as needed depending on the context of the request .
Setup
Testing was done with two machines .
The first was my laptop , which is a Dell Latitude D610 running windows , Ruby 1.8.4 , and Rails 1.2.3 .
The second is our staging server , which is fairly high end Dell Desktop running Fedora Core 6 with a copy of our production database ( which is about 10 Gb ) .
Profiling was done with ruby - prof 0.5.1 ( of course ) , using the Rails plugin I described previously .
Note that the logging level was set to : debug , which will show up in the test results .
Baseline
To start we measured the baseline performance of our test setup .
It was ugly indeed :
Total : 7.828 % self total self wait child calls name 24.11 1.95 1.89 0.00 0.06 3605 Kernel#clone 13.15 1.04 1.03 0.02 0.00 569 IO # write 7.78 4.13 0.61 0.00 3.52 441 < Module :: Benchmark ># realtime - 1 7.41 0.58 0.58 0.00 0.00 125 PGconn#exec
One bit of solace is that profiling an application will slow it down 2 to 3 times , but that sill leaves us with a 4 seconds per request .
So let ’s start digging through the results .
The first thing that jumps out is the huge amount of time Kernel #clone takes .
A look at the call graph shows that the caller is clone_attribute_value .
And a bit more digging reveals this custom code in our application :
def rating # Convert cached rating from BigDecimal to float , # otherwise strange rounding errors happen attributes [ ' rating ' ] .
to_f end
The problem is that when you call ActiveRecord # attributes it returns a copy of the attributes , thus generating all the clone calls .
Uuggh .
I think this is a result of ActiveRecord ’s flawed attribute implementation , but that is for another blog .
What we want is access to the untyped , original value of the attribute .
In theory you are supposed to use the auto generated method , rating _before_type_cast , for this .
This has the advantage of skipping the clone call , but it relies on method_missing , which has some overhead ( we did not measure how much ) .
Or , you could use read_attribute directly , which also skips the clone call .
This is usually your best choice .
For performance critical code , you may wish to read the untyped attribute directly ( see the discussion about time below for an example ) .
That can be done using the method read_attribute_before_type_cast , except that it is private .
However , with Ruby , that ’s easily solved :
module ActiveRecord class Base public :read_attribute_before_type_cast end end
Lesson –
Do n’t use attributes
Gain – 24 %
Let ’s look at our updated results :
Total : 3.39 % self total self wait child calls name 16.73 0.57 0.57 0.00 0.00 569 IO # write 12.83 0.44 0.44 0.00 0.00 125 PGconn#exec 8.76 1.77 0.30 0.00 1.48 441 < Module :: Benchmark ># realtime - 1 5.99 0.22 0.20 0.00 0.01 40 PGconn#query
What stands out are the 125 calls to PGconn#exec – each one is a separate query .
Looks like we forgot to specify a table or two to be eager loaded via ActiveRecord # find ’s : include option .
Note there is one downside to using : include – you lose the ability to use the : select option .
For us that is important – and can be worked around by using the rails select_parser I ’ve blogged about before .
Lesson –
Get your :includes right
Gain – 12 %
After fixing attributes and includes , here is our current timings :
Total : 2.594 % self total self wait child calls name 12.64 1.14 0.33 0.00 0.81 361 < Module :: Benchmark ># realtime - 1 12.61 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.00 409 IO # write 4.90 0.13 0.13 0.00 0.00 403 < Class :: File >#mtime 4.86 0.16 0.13 0.00 0.03 30250 Hash # [ ]
3.62 0.09 0.09 0.00 0.00 5 PGconn#exec
A couple of things jump out .
First , using Benchmark # realtime is fairly time consuming .
Second , logging also takes its toll as seen in the times for IO # write ( remember we have
logging set to : debug ) .
However , the #mtime call looks suspicious .
Some more digging through Rails shows all 403 calls come from
ActionView :: Base #compile_template ?.
Let ’s take a look :
def compile_template ?( template , file_name , local_assigns ) method_key = file_name || template render_symbol = @@method_names[method_key ] if @@compile_time[render_symbol ] && supports_local_assigns?( render_symbol , local_assigns ) if file_name && !@@cache_template_loading @@compile_time[render_symbol ] < File.mtime( file_name ) || ( File.symlink ?( file_name ) && ( @@compile_time[render_symbol ] < File.lstat(file_name ).mtime ) ) end else true end end
Remember I mentioned that it takes roughly 500 partial calls to generate the output ?
This is where it bites us –
by default Rails checks the timestamp of cached templates before running them .
In a production environment that
is totally unnecessary .
The solution is simple – just update your production.rb file like this :
# Do n't check view timestamps !
config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true
And while we are at it , we ’ll change the debug level to : info to reduce its impact on the results .
Lesson – Set cache_template_loading to true
Gain – 5 %
We ’ve managed to reduce the request time from 7.8 to 2.5 seconds .
Not bad .
But we still have more work to do .
Total : 2.531 % self total self wait child calls name 13.59 1.91 0.34 0.00 1.56 45 < Module :: Benchmark ># realtime 12.25 0.31 0.31 0.00 0.00 409 IO # write 4.98 0.81 0.13 0.00 0.69 361 < Module :: Benchmark ># realtime - 1 4.94 0.13 0.13 0.00 0.00 40 ActiveRecord :: Associations : : HasManyThroughAssociation # construct_sql 3.71 0.09 0.09 0.00 0.00 5 PGconn#exec 3.04 0.08 0.08 0.00 0.00 29847 Hash # [ ]
3.00 0.11 0.08 0.00 0.03 2097 Hash#each 1.86 0.28 0.05 0.00 0.23 322 ActionController :: Routing : : RouteSet#generate
Of particular interest is the ActionController : : Routing : : RouteSet#generate .
Although it only runs for 0.05 seconds , its total time , including children , is 0.28 .
Thus creating 322 urls takes 11 % of the request time .
People have previously mentioned how slow url_for is – well , its true .
Instead of using url_for , just create your urls manually using string mashing .
For example , if you want an absolute uri , then do this :
" #{request.protocol}#{request.host_with_port}/controller/#{map.id} "
Lesson –
Do n’t use url_for or link_to
Gain – 11 %
After removing url_for , we ’ve smashed the 2 second barrier :
Total : 1.391 % self total self wait child calls name 9.06 0.13 0.13 0.00 0.00 726 String#sub !
8.99 0.13 0.13 0.00 0.00 40 ActionView : : Base ::CompiledTemplates # _run_ratom_47app47views47geometry47_geometry46ratom 6.69 0.09 0.09 0.00 0.00 5 PGconn#exec 5.54 0.08 0.08 0.00 0.00 741 Item#id 5.54 0.30 0.08 0.00 0.22 121 < Class :: Date >#_parse
Next up is < Class : : Date > #_parse , whose total time , including children , is a whopping 21 % of the time .
Ouch .
If you take a look at the code ( its in the standard ruby library ) , you can see its quite complicated
since it tries to parse a variety of date formats .
In addition , it makes use of rational numbers , which are none too fast .
Taking a look at a graph profile , we see that < Class : : Date > #_parse is called from < Class : : ActiveRecord : : ConnectionAdapters :: Column>#string_to_time .
Thus Rails uses it to convert timestamps received from the database into Ruby objects .
As I detailed in a recent post , the problem is that Ruby ’s DateTime implementation is extremely slow compared to its Time implementation .
The solution is to avoid DateTime ’s entirely and use custom time parsing code .
Fortunately , our database can output time in ISO 861 format , which Time can quickly parse .
So , any place we access times , we simply roll our own attribute readers and writers like this ( note that we do n’t use read_attribute ! ) .
def created_on @created_on || Time.iso8601(read_attribute_before_type_cast(' created_on ' ) ) end def created_on= ( value ) write_attribute ( : created_on , value ) @created_on = nil end def updated_on @updated_on || Time.iso8601(read_attribute_before_type_cast(' created_on ' ) )
end
Lesson – Do n’t let Rails parse timestamps – do it yourself
Gain – 20 %
We ’ve almost hit the 1 second barrier :
Total : 1.156 % self total self wait child calls name 8.13 0.11 0.09 0.00 0.01 642 Kernel#send -3 8.13 0.09 0.09 0.00 0.00 5 PGconn#exec 6.75 0.08 0.08 0.00 0.00 7497 String#concat 4.15 0.05 0.05 0.00 0.00 817 Hash#each 4.07 0.05 0.05 0.00 0.00 40 ActiveRecord :: Associations : : HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation # construct_sql 2.77 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 6360 String #match 2.77 0.06 0.03 0.00 0.03 47 Array#each_index 2.77 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 280 IconType#size 2.60 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 4309 Array # [ ]
At this point , most of the easy wins are gone .
However , there is at least one left .
Although its not shown in the flat profile , the graph profile shows that the method ActiveSupport :: CoreExtensions : : Hash :: Keys#symbolize_keys takes 2.77 % of the time including its children .
Additional rummaging through the call graph shows that the calls come from ActionView#compile_and_render_template :
def compile_and_render_template( extension , template = nil , file_path = nil , local_assigns = { } ) # convert string keys to symbols if requested local_assigns = local_assigns.symbolize_keys if @@local_assigns_support_string_keys
A bit of research shows that local_assigns_support_string_keys is deprecated and slated for removal from Rails !
Sweet – that means we can save an additional 3 % simply by adding this line to environment.rb :
config.action_view.local_assigns_support_string_keys = false
If only all optimizations were so simple .
Lesson –
Do n’t symbolize keys
Gain – 3 %
Wrapping Up
So what ’s our final time ?
Let ’s see :
Total : 0.922 % self total self wait child calls name 10.30 0.10 0.10 0.00 0.00 5 PGconn#exec 3.47 0.17 0.03 0.00 0.14 312 Array#each - 2 3.47 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 212 ActiveRecord :: ConnectionAdapters : : Quoting #quote 3.47 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 19455 Hash # [ ]
3.47 0.36 0.03 0.00 0.33 360 ActionView :: Base #render - 2 3.36 0.06 0.03 0.00 0.03 47 Array#each_index 3.36 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 299 ActiveRecord :: Associations : : AssociationProxy#initialize 3.36 0.14 0.03 0.00 0.11 705 ActiveRecord :: Associations : : AssociationProxy #method_missing
Not bad – we reduced the request time from 7.8 to 0.92 seconds with a day ’s worth of work .
Obviously there is still much to be done – we need to run the code through our performance monitoring suite and make sure that the average time holds across a number of requests and that the standard deviation is in line .
But we ’ve at least made a good start .
Did you see what happened last week ?
I mean did you really see what happened ?
What happened was the US economy , and much of the world economy entangled with it , was forced to go cold turkey .
But first a look at how they got hooked on junk in the first place .
For the last five or six years America 's alleged free marketeers took a page from Barry Bonds ' personal play book .
America and Americans were already heavy hitters on the world economic stage .
But why be satisfied with being just good .
Why not leverage our economic strength by pumping it up with artificial wealth – cheap , easy credit .
And so it came to pass .
Debt became the enhancing drug of choice for heavy hitters and wannbe heavy hitters .
And it worked , at least for a while .
Even after cutting taxes and increasing spending , a seemingly endless supply of cheap , easy credit flowed in to fund government spending from pushers in Asia .
Corporations took notice and began doing the it too , borrowing , buying other companies , borrowing against those assets , buying more companies , building entire corporate empires upon mountains of debt .
Joe Sixpacks down on Main Street figured they 'd like to be heavy hitters too .
So they beat a path to credit pushers , their own banks , credit card companies , DiTech and such .
Consumers loaded up on the stuff .
And it worked for them too , for a while .
They bought all kinds of crap they would otherwise not been able to afford -- SUVs , flat panel televisions and , most importantly , houses .
If they already owned a house they used it as collateral for more of the stuff , more credit , more debt .
By August 1 , 2007 nearly everyone from Washington to K - Mart shoppers were hooked on cheap , easy credit .
Wall Street analysts and government economists downplayed the problem with the standard junkie 's refrain , “ We can stop any time we want . ”
Of course they never tried to prove it .
They never did stop .
Then suddenly last week their drug of choice dried up .
From San Francisco to New York City , from Dog Patch , Idaho to Sacramento , California , from Washington to Hong Kong , London , Germany , France , not a cheap , easy credit pusher in sight .
For three , painfully long days , cheap , easy credit disappeared .
And by day - two world markets went into what can only be described as “ withdrawals . ”
Cut off from their picker - upper of choice , banks , mortgage lenders , hedge funds , bonds , mutual funds , home builders and foreign banks began going through the DT's .
By Thursday things had become so unruly , the whines and cries for “ spare change , ” gotten so shrill , that the Federal Reserve Bank , the pusher of last resort for credit junkies , finally stepped forward and provided the markets the only thing that would calm them – a booster shot of cheap , easy credit .
What happened next should erase any remaining doubt that America 's free market big talkers have become nothing more than credit addicted phonies .
Because , as you may have noticed , their DT 's eased within a hour after the Fed injected their drug of choice – billions of dollars of bargain basement priced credit .
And the Fed did not even try to get these junkies into treatment .
On the contrary .
The Fed actually sweetened the deal , allowing already debt weakened institutions to get all the credit they say they need to remain afloat at wholesale prices .
But wait , there 's more .
The Fed 's fixes are being handed out through what
it calls its “ overnight discount window . ”
Discount window
Fed loans have traditionally been overnight loans given to banks to smooth the flow of capital between institutions .
The loans the Fed approved in the wee hours of Thursday night are 30 - day loans .
But wait , there 's more .
If , at the end of that 30 - day period a bank claims it can't pay the money back , the Fed says the banks can roll them ( renew ) them for another 30 - days .. and then another and another .
And , like the sub - prime rules that allowed unqualified borrowers to get those loans without documentation or other proof of worthiness , the banks endlessly renewing these Fed “ loans , ” are not required to prove they really need to in order to remain solvent .
( A 'if you can't beat them , join them , ” tactic by the Fed . )
But wait , there 's more .
Since there was suddenly no market for the billions in mortgages and mortgage backed securities these banks were saddled with , the Fed , for the first time , allowed the banks to use those now nearly worthless assets as collateral against which troubled institutions can borrow even more cheap , easy terms money .
Well !
Nothing quite perks up a junkie like a fresh fix !
The DOW index soared the moment markets opened Friday morning .
And our Euopean co-dependents felt the rush too :
Paris shares soar on news of Fed discount rate cut ; banks lead charge PARIS ( Thomson Financial ) -
Share prices rebounded in spectacular fashion in afternoon trading following the Federal Reserve 's decision to cut its discount on loans to banks to 5.75 pct from 6.25 pct , citing increasing risks to economic growth , market sources said .
Announcing the rate cut , the Fed stated : ' Financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward . ' [ Full ]
Of course , all the Fed accomplished Thursday was to temporarily stabilize all those twitching credit addicts .
They also managed to reinforce the irresponsible behavior that has created a world economy all hopped up on credit - juice .
In the weeks ahead expect the Fed to pump more of the stuff into the body - economic by lowering interest rates .
What 's really needed is a tough - love intervention .
But , with a national election just over a year away do n't expect anyone , in either party , to tell credit junkies , from Countrywide Mortgage to CitiBank to Uncle Sam himself , they need to get off the junk and back to basics .
Of course , anyone who knows a junkie or an alcoholic understands that sooner of later such matters take care of themselves .
Rock bottom looms in the future of every untreated junkie .
It 's not a matter of if , but when .
It 's an ugly way to get the message .
But for the worst of the worst , it 's often the only way .
Unfortunately , when this mega - addict plummets into that pit the rest of us are going to be sucked along by the downdraft .

Report : U.S. not ready for disaster WASHINGTON 
The U.S. is n't prepared to handle disasters and lacks an effective way to track $ 88 billion doled out to help rebuild the Gulf Coast after last year 's killer hurricanes , according to government reports released Wednesday .
The reports by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congress ' investigative agency , say that safeguards are not in place to ensure speedy responses to the nation 's next catastrophe .
" We are clearly better off than we were five years ago and one year ago , but we are not where we need to be , " said GAO Comptroller General David Walker .
VIDEO : Five years after 9/11 , are we any safer ?
Max Stier of the Partnership for Public Service , a non-partisan group that promotes effective government , said that the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina were " wake - up calls " and that the new GAO reports highlight a " critical need for leadership " in government .
The three reports examine the government 's progress in addressing its response after Hurricane Katrina , which hit Aug. 29 , 2005 , and left more than 1,700 people dead in Louisiana and Mississippi .
Among the findings : • The Homeland Security Department says it has made changes to improve its ability to respond to disasters , " but there is little information available on the extent to which those changes are operational . "
Responders still do n't have the ability to communicate by radio during a crisis .
Department spokesman Russ Knocke said some of Homeland Security 's new policies are not made public for security reasons .
" There has been a tremendous amount of reflection on what did and did n't work " during the Katrina response , he said .
•
The government has no place to collect data on how and where 23 agencies are spending their share of the $ 88 billion Congress has allocated for Gulf Coast recovery .
Congress needs to know " how much federal funding has been spent and by whom , whether more may be needed , or whether too much has been provided , " the GAO said .
Taxpayers and hurricane victims also should be able to find out how the money 's being spent , one report said .
•
The Army Corps of Engineers is " following a piecemeal approach " to flood prevention .
" We are concerned that the Corps is proceeding with over $ 7 billion of interim repairs and construction without a comprehensive strategy , " the GAO said .
The GAO report also expressed concern about the delays and costs to repair damaged levees .
The costs have risen from $ 841 million to more than $ 1 billion .
The corps " generally " agrees with the GAO , according to a written response from John Paul Woodley , assistant secretary of the Army for civil works .
However , Woodley said , the corps is " moving forthright to re-establish lines of defense . "

:
A furious push by the White House to broaden its wiretapping authority appeared on the verge of victory Saturday as a bill advanced in Congress to give the Bush administration more latitude temporarily to eavesdrop without court warrants on foreign communications that it suspects may be tied to terrorism .
The Senate passed the measure Friday night and sent it to the House for its consideration , where Democratic leaders acknowledged that it would probably pass .
For decades , posters depicting rabbits with inflamed , reddened eyes symbolised campaigns against the testing of cosmetics on animals .
Now the most severe of those tests are to be banned across the European Union .
The so - called Draize tests are a series of notorious procedures that involve applying cosmetics ingredients to the eyes and skin of live laboratory rabbits .
The animals ’ reactions are used to gauge whether the ingredient is an irritant or not .

The Art in Computer Programming
The following is an adaptation of material originally presented in Aarhus , Denmark , at the Java and Object Oriented Conference , on September 12 , 2001 .
What exactly is software development , and why is it so hard ?
This is a question that continues to engage our thoughts .
Is software development an engineering discipline ?
Is it art ?
Is it more like a craft ?
We think that it is all of these things , and none of them .
Software is a uniquely human endeavor , because despite all of the technological trimmings , we 're manipulating little more than the thoughts in our heads .
That 's pretty ephemeral stuff .
Fred Brooks put it rather eloquently some 30 odd years ago [ Bro95 ] :
" The programmer , like the poet , works only slightly removed from pure thought - stuff .
He builds his castles in the air , from air , creating by exertion of the imagination .
Few media of creation are so flexible , so easy to polish and rework , so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures .
( As we shall see later , this very tractability has its own problems . ) "
In a way , we programmers are quite lucky .
We get the opportunity to create entire worlds out of nothing but thin air .
Our very own worlds , complete with our own laws of physics .
We may get those laws wrong of course , but it 's still fun .
This wonderful ability comes at a price , however .
We continually face the most frightening sight known to a creative person : the blank page .
1. Writer 's Block
Writers face the blank page , painters face the empty canvas , and programmers face the empty editor buffer .
Perhaps it 's not literally empty — an IDE may want us to specify a few things first .
Here we have n't even started the project yet , and already we 're forced to answer many questions : what will this thing be named , what directory will it be in , what type of module is it , how should it be compiled , and so on .
The completely empty editor buffer is even worse .
Here we have an infinite number of choices of text with which to fill it .
So it seems we share some of the same problems with artists and writers :
How to start
When to stop Satisfying the person who commissioned the work
Writers have a name for difficulties in starting a piece : they call it Writer 's Block .
Sometimes writer 's block is borne of fear : Fear of going in the wrong direction , of getting too far down the wrong path .
Sometimes it 's just a little voice in your head saying " do n't start yet " .
Perhaps your subconscious is trying to tell you that you 're missing something important that you need before you can start .
How do other creative artists break this sort of logjam ?
Painters sketch ; writers write a stream of consciousness .
( Writers may also do lots of drugs and get drunk , but we 're not necessarily advocating that particular approach . )
What then , is the programming equivalent of sketching ?
Software Sketches
Sometimes you need to practice ideas , just to see if something works .
You 'll sketch it out roughly .
If you 're not happy with it , you 'll do it again .
And again .
After all , it takes almost no time to do , and you can crumple it up and throw it away at the end .
For instance , there 's a pencil sketch by Leonardo da Vinci that he used a study for the Trivulzio equestrian monument .
The single fragment of paper contains several quick sketches of different views of the monument : a profile of the horse and rider by themselves , several views of the base with the figures , and so on .
Even though the finished piece was to be cast in bronze , da Vinci 's sketches were simply done in pencil , on a nearly - scrap piece of paper .
These scribblings were so unimportant that they did n't even deserve a separate piece of paper !
But they served their purpose nonetheless . [ 1 ]
Pencil sketches make fine prototypes for a sculpture or an oil painting .
Post - It notes are fine prototypes for GUI layouts .
Scripting languages can be used to try out algorithms before they 're recoded in something more demanding and lower level .
This is what we 've traditionally called prototyping : a quick , disposable exercise that concentrates on a particular aspect of the project .
In software development , we can prototype to get the details in a number of different areas :
a new algorithm , or combination of algorithms a portion of an object model interactions and data flow between components any high - risk detail that needs exploration
A slightly different approach to sketching can be seen in da Vinci 's Study for the Composition of the Last Supper .
In this sketch , you can see the beginnings of the placement of figures for that famous painting .
The attention is not placed on any detail — the figures are crude and unfinished .
Instead , da Vinci paid attention to focus , balance and flow .
How do you arrange the figures , position the hands and arms in order to get the balance and flow of the entire piece to work out ?
Sometimes you need to prototype various components of the whole to make sure that they work well together .
Again , concentrate of the important aspects and discard unimportant details .
Make it easy for yourself .
Concentrate on learning , not doing .
As we say in The Pragmatic Programmer [ HT00 ] , you must firmly have in your head what you are doing before you do it .
It 's not at all important to get it right the first time .
It 's vitally important to get it right the last time .
Paint Over It
Sometimes the artist will sketch out a more finished looking piece , such as Rembrandt 's sketch for Abraham 's Sacrifice Of Isaac in 1635 .
It 's a crude sketch that has all of the important elements of the final painting , all in roughly the right areas .
It proved the composition , the balance of light and shadow , and so on .
The sketch is accurate , but not precise .
There are no fine details .
Media willing , you can start with such a sketch , where changes are quick and easy to make , and then paint right over top of it with the more permanent , less - forgiving media to form the final product .
To simulate that " paint over a sketch " technique in software , we use a Tracer Bullet development .
If you have n't read The Pragmatic Programmer yet , here 's a quick explanation of why we call it a Tracer Bullet .
There are two ways to fire a big artillery gun .
The first way is to carefully measure the distance to the target , compensate for wind speed and direction , the weight of the ordinance , and so on , crunch all the numbers and give the orders to fire :
" Range 1000 ! "
whirr .
click .
" Elevation 7.42 ! "
whirr .
click .
" Azimuth 3.44 "
whirr .
click .
" FIRE ! "
BOOM .
Oh bad luck , there .
Missed .
" Range 2015 ! "
whirr .
click .
" Elevation 9.15 ! "
etc. . .
By the time you 've set up , checked and rechecked the numbers , and issued the orders to the grunts manning the machine , the target has long since moved .
In software , this kind of approach can seen in any method that emphasizes planning and documenting over producing working software .
Requirements are generally finalized before design begins .
Design and architecture , detailed in exquisite UML diagrams , is firmly established before any code is written ( presumably that would make coders analogous to the " grunts " who actually fire the weapon , oblivious to the target ) .
Do n't misunderstand : if you 're firing a really huge missile at a known , stable target ( like a city ) , this works out just great and is the preferable way to go .
If you 're shooting at something more maneuverable than a city , though , you need something that provides a bit more real - time feedback .
Tracer bullets .
With tracer bullets , you simply fill the magazine with phosphorus - tipped bullets spaced every so often .
Now you 've got streaks of light showing you the path to the target right next to the live ammunition .
For our software equivalent , we need a skeletally thin system that does next to nothing , but does it from end to end , encompassing areas such as the database , any middleware , the application logic or business rules , and so on .
Because it is so thin , we can easily shift position as we try to track the target .
By watching the tracer fire , we do n't have to calculate the effect of the wind , or precisely know the location of the target or the weight of the ammunition .
We watch the dynamics of the entire system in motion , and adjust our aim to hit the target under actual conditions .
As with the paintings , the important thing is n't the details , but the relationships , the responsibilities , the balance , and the flow .
With a proven base — however thin it may be — you can proceed in greater confidence towards the final product .
Group Writer 's Block
Up till now , we 've talked about writer 's block as it applies to you as an individual .
What do you do when the entire team has a collective case of writer 's block ?
Teams that are just starting out can quickly become paralyzed in the initial confusion over roles , design goals , and requirements .
One effective way to get the ball rolling is to start the project off with a group - wide , tactile design session .
Gather all of the developers in a room [ 2 ] and provide sets of Lego blocks , plenty of Post - It notes , whiteboards and markers .
Using these , proceed to talk about the system you 'll be building and how you think you might want to build it .
Keep the atmosphere loose and flexible ; this gets the team comfortable with the idea of change .
Because this is low inertia design , anyone can contribute .
It 's well within any participant 's skills to walk up to the whiteboard and move a PostIt - note , or to grab a few Lego blocks and rearrange them .
That 's not necessarily true of a CASE tool or drawing software : those tools do not lend themselves readily to rapid - feedback , group interaction .
Jim Highsmith offers us a most excellent piece of advice :
The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner .
Blast through that writer 's block , and just start .
Just Start
Whether you 're using prototypes or tracer bullets , individually or with a group , you 're working — not panicking .
You 're getting to know the subject , the medium , and the relationship between the two .
You 're warmed up , and have started filling that blank canvas .
But we have one additional problem that the painters do not have .
We face not one blank canvas per project , but hundreds .
Thousands , maybe .
One for every new module , every new class , every new source file .
What can we do to tackle that multiplicity of blank of canvases ?
The Extreme Programming [ Bec00 ] notion of Test First Design can help .
The first test you are supposed to write — before you even write the code — is a painfully simple , nearly trivial one .
It seems to do almost nothing .
Maybe it only instantiates the new class , or simply calls the one routine you have n't written yet .
It sounds so simple , and so stupid , that you might be tempted not to do it .
The advantage to starting with such a trivial test is that it helps fill in the blank canvas without facing the distraction of trying to write production code .
By just writing this very simple test , you have to get a certain level of infrastructure in place and answer the dozen or so typical startup questions :
What do I call it ?
Where do I put it in the development tree ?
You have to add it to version control , and possibly to the build and / or release procedures .
Suddenly , a very simple test does n't look so simple any more .
So ignore the exquisite logic of the routine you are about to write , and get the one - line test to compile and work first .
Once that test passes , you can now proceed to fill in the canvas — it 's not blank anymore .
You 're not writing anything from scratch , you 're just adding a few routines .
. . .
2 . When to Stop
We share another problem with painters : knowing when to stop .
You do n't want to stop prematurely ; the project wo n't yet be finished .
[ 3 ]
But if you do n't stop in time , and keep adding to it unnecessarily , the painting becomes lost in the paint and is ruined .
There 's only one way avoid either trap : feedback .
Before you even start a particular task , you have to have a way to determine that you 're done .
For example :
A. . . is done when .
. .
Project Customer accepts Development Passes functional tests Module Passes unit tests
Bug fix
Test that previously failed now passes Meeting objective for meeting achieved Document Deliver exactly what 's needed Talk Done when audience throws rotten fruit Paper
You are still reading this , right ?
We had a client once who seemed to have some difficulty in the definition of " done " with regard to code .
After toiling for weeks and weeks on a moderately complex piece of software , Matthew ( not his real name ) proudly announced the Code Was Done .
He went on to explain that it did n't always produce the correct output .
Oh , and every now and again , the code would crash for no apparent reason .
But it 's done .
Unfortunately , wishful thinking alone does n't help us get working software out to users .
It 's easy to err on the other side of the fence too — have you ever seen a developer make a career of one little module ?
Have you ever done that ?
It can happen for any number of political reasons ( " I 'm still working on XYZ , so you can't reassign me yet " ) , or maybe we just fall in love with some particularly elegant bit of code .
But instead of making the code better and better , we actually run a huge risk of ruining it completely .
Every line of code not written is correct — or at least , guaranteed not to fail .
Every line of code we write , well , there are no guarantees .
Each extra line carries some risk of failure , carries an additional cost to maintain , document , and teach a newcomer .
When you multiply it out , any bit of code that is n't absolutely necessary incurs a shockingly large cost .
Maybe enough to kill the project .
How then , can we tell when it 's time to stop ?
Painting Murals
Knowing when to stop is especially hard when you can't see the whole thing that you 're working on .
Mural painting , for instance , takes a special eye .
In corporate software development , you may only ever see the one little piece of detail that you 're working on .
If you watch mural painters up close , it 's quite difficult to discern that the splash of paint they 're working on is someone 's hand , or eyeball .
If you can't see the big picture , you wo n't be able to see how you fit in .
The opposite problem is even worse — suppose you 're the lone developer on a project of this size .
Most muralists are simply painting walls , but anyone who 's ever painted their house can tell you that ceilings are a lot harder than walls , especially when the ceiling in question covers 5,000 square feet and you have to lie on your back 20 meters above the floor to paint it .
So what did Michelangelo do when planning to paint the Sistine Chapel ?
The same thing you should do when faced with a big task .
Michelangelo divided his mural into panels : separate , free - standing areas , each of which tells a story .
But he did so fairly carefully , such that the panels exhibit these characteristics :
High cohesion
Low coupling
Conceptual integrity
These are things we can learn from .
Cohesion
What is cohesion ?
As used here , cohesion refers to the panel 's focus and clarity of purpose .
In the Sistine Chapel ceiling , each panel tells a single Old Testament story — completely , but without any extraneous elements .
In software , the Unix command line tool 's philosophy of small , sharp tools ( " do one thing and do it well " ) is one example .
Each tool is narrowly focused on it's primary task .
Low cohesion occurs when you have giant " manager " classes that try to do too many disparate things at once .
Coupling
Coupling is related to orthogonality [ HT00 ] : unrelated things should remain , well , unrelated .
Following the object - oriented principle of encapsulation helps to prevent unintended coupling , but there are still other ways to fall into the coupling trap .
Michelangelo 's panels have low coupling ; they are all self - contained ; there are no instances of figures reaching from one panel into the next , for instance .
Why is that important ?
If you look closely at one of the panels that portrays angels gliding about the firmament of heaven , you 'll notice that one of the angels is turning his back to , and gliding away from , the other angels .
You 'll also notice that said angel is n't wearing any pants .
He 's rather pointedly " mooning " the other angels .
There is surely a tale that explains the bare tail of the mooning angel , but for now let 's assume that the Pope discovered the mooning angel and demanded that it be replaced .
If the panels were n't independent , then the replacement of one panel would entail replacing some adjacent panels as well — and if you had to use different pigments because the originals were n't available , maybe you have to replace the next set of panels that were indirectly affected .
Let the nightmare begin .
But as it stands , the panels are independent , so the offending angel ( who was apparently on Spring Break ) could have been easily replaced with a less caustic image and the rest of the project would remain unaffected .
Conceptual Integrity
But despite that independence , there is conceptual integrity — the style , the themes , the mood , tie it all together .
In computer languages , Smalltalk has conceptual integrity , so does Ruby , so does C. C++ does n't : it tries to be too many things at once , so you get an awkward marriage of concepts that do n't really fit together well .
The trick then is to divide up your work while maintaining a holistic integrity ; each Sistine Chapel panel is a separate piece of art , complete unto itself , but together they tell a coherent story .
For our projects , we have several techniques we need to use inside code , including modularity , decoupling , and orthogonality .
At the project level , consider architecting the project as a collection of many small applications that work together .
These interacting applications might simply use a network connection or even flat files , or a heavier - duty component technology such as Enterprise Java Beans ( EJB ) .
Time
Up until now , we 've concentrated on splitting up a project in space , but there is another very import dimension that we need to touch on briefly — time .
In the time dimension , you need to use iterations to split up a project .
Generally speaking , you do n't want to go more than a few weeks without a genuine deliverable .
Longer than that introduces too large of a feedback gap — you can't get the feedback quickly enough in to act on it .
Iterations need to be short and regular in order to provide the most beneficial feedback .
The other important thing about iterations is that there is no such thing as 80 % done .
You ca n't get 80 % pregnant — it 's a Boolean condition .
We want to get to the position where we only ship what really works , and have the team agree on the meaning of words like " done " .
If a feature is n't done , save it for the next iteration .
As the iterations are short , that 's not too far off .
In time or space , feedback is critical .
For individual pieces of code , it is vital to have competent unit tests that will provide that feedback .
Beware of excuses such as " oh , that code 's too complicated to test . "
If it 's too complicated to test , then it logically follows that the code is too complicated to write !
If the code seems to be too complicated to test , that 's a warning sign that you have a poor design .
Refactor the code in order to make it easy to test , and you 'll not only improve the feedback loop ( and the future extensibility and maintainability of the system ) , you 'll improve the design of the system itself .
3. Satisfying the Sponsor
Now comes the hard part .
So far , we 've talked about problems that have simple , straightforward answers .
Organize your system this way ; always have good unit tests ; look for and apply feedback to improve the code and the process ; etc .
But now we 're headed into much more uncertain terrain — dealing with people .
In particular , dealing with the sponsor : the person or persons who are paying to make this project happen .
They have goals and expectations all their own , and probably do not understand the technology with which we create the work .
They may not know exactly what they want , but they want the project to come out perfect in the end .
This must be the artist 's worst nightmare .
The person paying for the portrait is also sitting for it , and says simply " Make me Look Good " .
The fact that the sitter is royalty who commands a well - oiled guillotine does n't help .
Sounds pretty close to the position we find ourselves in as we write software , does n't it ?
Let 's look at it from the sitter 's point of view .
You commission an artist to paint you .
What do you get ?
Perhaps a traditional , if somewhat flat looking portrait such as da Vinci 's Portrait of Ginevra Benci in 1474 .
Or maybe the realistic , haunting face of Vermeer 's Girl With a Pearl Earring .
How about the primitive ( and topless ) look of Matisse 's Seated Figure , the wild and fractured Portrait of Picasso by Juan Gris , or the stick - figured jumble of Paul Klee 's Captive ?
All of these are portraits , all interpretations of a commonplace thing — a human face .
All of which correctly implement the requirements , but all of which will not satisfy the client .
Beyond The Obvious
Each of these paintings captures the essence of a person , not just the form .
More than simple photographs , each painting looks below the surface to capture something that the camera can't .
As programmers , we must do the same thing , only we tend to call it abstraction .
The phrase " requirements gathering " implies that requirements are simply lying about , ready to be scooped up and worked on .
That 's akin to a simple photograph , in that it only examines the obvious , surface level elements .
In order to emulate the painter , we need to go beyond what 's asked for .
We need to ask the wicked questions to help the client discover what 's really needed .
Systems Thinking [ Sen90 ] suggests asking a minimum of five " whys " beyond the first one .
The classic example involves a factory floor where the consultant notices a small puddle of oil on the floor .
He asks the shop manager about it , who grumbles and barks an order to the cleaning crew to get over here and clean up the oil .
But the consultant persists : why is the oil there ?
The manager says it 's the cleaning crew 's fault .
But where did the oil come from ?
A little investigating and more than five " why " questions later , it turns out that an overly cost - conscious purchasing agent got a deal on cases of O -ring seals for the overhead pipes .
Problem was , the rings were the wrong size — that 's why they were such a deal .
What seemed like a cost savings was in fact costing quite a bit of money in various ways .
We once were approached to develop a complex , enterprise - level data processing system that mail room staff would use to coordinate , sort , and track incoming payment checks prior to their distribution to the correct department .
The company 's current manual procedure was error - prone and unreliable ; checks were being lost or misrouted to the destination department .
What 's the real requirement here ?
A fancy system to sort and catalog mail for the sole purpose of delivering it to the right address ?
Hmm .
Seems like there 's already a system in place that handles that sort of thing .
So instead of a nice , fat , year - long contract , we told the company to use a different postal address for each department .
Let the Post Office do the sorting , hopefully without opening the pieces and losing the checks .
Requirements are rarely simple , and should n't be taken at face value .
Remember , a portrait is more than just a picture .
Conventional Wisdom
Even stories about requirements may need deeper examination .
There 's a marvelous story of technology and consultants gone wild , developing the Fisher Space Pen .
The story goes that the U.S. Government spent millions of dollars of taxpayer 's money developing a space pen — a pen that the astronauts could take to the moon that would operate in the harsh conditions of weightlessness , extreme heat and cold .
Technology rushes to the rescue , and develops a miracle pen that can write upside down in a boiling toilet .
The Russians , by comparison , decided to use a pencil .
A marvelous tale of an inappropriate solution , except for one small problem .
It 's not true .
Both the Russian and the U.S. astronauts used pencils at first , but there was a danger of the leads breaking and shorting out electric components , and the wood of the pencil itself was combustible as well .
In a pure oxygen atmosphere , that 's a really bad thing .
The Fisher corporation realized this and , at its own cost , designed the Fisher Space Pen , which it then sold to NASA at reasonable cost .
After the disastrous Apollo One fire , NASA made the Fisher pens mandatory .
Fisher listened to the real requirement , even before the client knew it .
In time , NASA came to realize that they were right .
It was an appropriate use of high - technology to solve a very real problem .
Technology For It 's Own Sake
Of course , there 's always the inappropriate solution : engineering for it 's own sake .
As luck would have it , we happen to have an anecdote for this case as well .
There was this company that had developed a sophisticated video camera that could pan and tilt , looking for a subject in its field of view .
A wonderful , high - tech solution in search of a problem .
In time , the company sold this technology to a government agency to help take pictures for driving licenses .
You'd go into the licensing agency and have a seat in front of the machine , which would whir and click , grind and gyrate until it had locked onto your face .
The flash would fire , and in a few minutes your completed driver 's license would be ready .
One day , 58 year - old Fred complained that the pretty 20 year - old blonde girl on his license just did n't look much like him .
The company and the government agency kinda scratched their heads ; they were n't sure what the problem was .
Problems like Fred 's were popping up over , but other then getting a bunch in a row , there did n't seem to be any pattern to it .
Finally , the police started to complain — and got quite upset — when they started seeing driver 's licenses that featured beaming , cartoon smiley faces instead of a photo .
They discovered that the technology had gone awry : in some cases , the camera would n't get a lock , and would simply continue to grind and whir , looking all over the room for the subject .
After a few minutes of watching the camera carefully inspect the ceiling and windows , folks like Fred would get bored and wander off .
The next driver comes in , and with a flourish of clicks and whirs , the camera would snap their picture — and associate it with the previous driver 's license .
Now the office staff figured out pretty quickly what the problem was , but they had no feedback path to the developers .
They knew that once the machine got out of sync , they 'd get bad licenses all day .
So one clever user figured out that one could draw a happy face with marker on a piece of white paper , stick that over the chair , and the machine would happily snap the picture .
The real requirements were ignored in the rush to be clever , with predictably poor results .
How We Do It
So how do you find out what 's in the client 's head ?
At The Pragmatic Programmer 's offices , we use " special equipment " ( picture a 1950 's mad scientist 's laboratory replete with buzzing vacuum tubes , arcing Jacob 's Ladders , and cranial implants ) .
If that does n't work , or if we 're out in the field where health and safety restrictions prevent us from using our " special equipment " , we resort to the old fashioned method of asking questions , both of the client and of ourselves .
What is the user 's level of sophistication ?
What is the context in which the software is used ?
Real - time on the factory floor ?
In a life - critical system ?
For a home grocery list ?
What is the lifetime of the application ?
Unused after next week , or do you need to worry about the year - 2038 bug ?
What are the risks ?
Not just the development or technical risks , but what are the sponsor 's risks in taking on this project ?
The best way to get these questions answered , of course , is to always involve the users as you go along .
Seek frequent feedback to make sure you hear stories about anyone making smiley faces as soon as it happens . [ 4 ]
Maintain short iterations with frequent deliveries , and work with the real users directly as much as possible .
User representatives ( such as a supervisor , manager or director ) generally are n't as representative as we'd all like to think .
In our perpetual rush to jump in and start coding to the first neat idea we come across , we run the risk of getting locked in to a half - baked idea too early .
Instead , try to cultivate emergence :
Allow the solution to find itself where you can .
Part of a developer 's job is to provide a fertile ground in which ideas can grow .
This means having code that is agile : code that supports rapid reassembly so you can try things out .
Code that is easy to refactor , or that uses flexible configuration and / or metadata to facilitate rapid — but reliable — change , bolstered by a reliable safety net of complete revision control and competent unit tests .
Does all of this really work ?
Yes , it does .
We 've done it successfully , we know other people who 've done it successfully .
It 's lot of work , and it's a lot of hard work , and despite our best intentions , it might still not be a success due to factors beyond our control .
So why do we bother with it all ?
Because , as Brooks said , we programmers create .
We can create awe - inspiring works with little more than the exertion of the imagination .
Why do we do it ?
We do it for the pleasure of watching them show it off to others , of watching them use in novel ways we 'd never imagined .
For the thrill of watching millions on millions of dollars in transactions flow through your application , confident in the results .
For the joy of building and being part of a team , and for the satisfaction of knowing that you started with a blank canvas and produced a work of art .
And if you 've gone to all that trouble , we think you should " sign your work " .
You should be proud of it .
It is , after all , a work of art .
###
Endnotes
1 Sadly , the project 's sponsor canceled the monument due to lack of funds .
Some things never change .
2 If you 've got more developers on the team than will fit in an ordinary room , then you 've got bigger problems than we can address here .
3 In software as well as in modern art , the distinction between intentional and accidental omissions is often difficult to make .
4 Again , the longer the gap before you get feedback the higher the likelihood of getting feedback in the form of a subpoena .

I really did not intend this blog to become a repository of Haskell code snippets , but I ’ve been rather busy as of late , and writing toy code while waiting for a compile to finish has somehow become my primary means of entertainment .
Here is the latest .
Arithmetic coding is a remarkably simple and clever thing .
The idea is that given some half - open interval [ a , b ) , that is , the interval a < = x < b , we can partition it into half - open subintervals , such that there is one subinterval per character in the message to be encoded , and the lengths correspond to the character frequencies multiplied by b-a .
The same procedure is applied , recursively , to each subinterval , resulting in an infinite hierarchy of coverings of the original interval — call it S. Now , if we throw a rock at S , record the point where it hit , and follow the interval hierarchy , we ’ll come up with a unique infinite string of characters .
To construct the actual encoding , set S to [ 0,1 ) , and find out which subinterval S_1 the first character of the message falls into .
For the second character , let S_2 be the appropriate subinterval of S_1 , for the third character , let S_3 be the appropriate subinterval of S_2 , and so on ; if we repeat this procedure as many times as there are characters , we ’ll arrive at some interval S_n .
Numbers that fall in this interval have a useful property : given any such number , call it x , we have x in S_{n - 1} ( since x is in S_n , and S_n is a subinterval of S_{n - 1} ) , x in S_{n - 2} by the same argument , and , by induction , in every subinterval that we picked while encoding the message .
Any such x , therefore , uniquely encodes the message : to decode , simply follow the hierarchy .

The last test shows the output of ‘ encode ’ : the length of the message is 2000 characters , this is followed by character distributions ( in a practical setting , frequencies would be returned instead of explicit intervals ) , and finally the encoded message .
The entire 2000 byte string is encoded in the fraction 9/85 .
Toy code follows .
As mentioned earlier , ‘ encodeToStream ’ is a helper function that breaks the fraction into a pair of lists of bytes ; the actual encoder and decoder consist of just ‘ encode ’ , ‘ decode ’ and ‘ freqRanges ’ , weighing in at 23 lines of code including type annotations and line breaks .

“ Even Saddam Hussein had more legal counsel than I ever had , ” said Mr. Vance , who said he planned to sue the former defense secretary , Donald H. Rumsfeld , on grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated .
“ While we were detained , we wrote a letter to the camp commandant stating that the same democratic ideals we are trying to instill in the fledgling democratic country of Iraq , from simple due process to the Magna Carta , we are absolutely , positively refusing to follow ourselves . ”
A spokeswoman for the Pentagon ’s detention operations in Iraq , First Lt. Lea Ann Fracasso , said in written answers to questions that the men had been “ treated fair and humanely , ” and that there was no record of either man complaining about their treatment .
Held as ‘a Threat ’
She said officials did not reach Mr. Vance ’s contact at the F.B.I. until he had been in custody for three weeks .
Even so , she said , officials determined that he “ posed a threat ” and decided to continue holding him .
He was released two months later , Lieutenant Fracasso said , based on a “ subsequent re-examination of his case , ” and his stated plans to leave Iraq .
Mr. Ertel , 30 , a contract manager who knew Mr. Vance from an earlier job in Iraq , was released more quickly .
Mr. Vance went to Iraq in 2004 , first to work for a Washington - based company .
He later joined a small Baghdad - based security company where , he said , “ things started looking weird to me . ”
He said that the company , which was protecting American reconstruction organizations , had hired guards from a sheik in Basra and that many of them turned out to be members of militias whom the clients did not want around .
Mr. Vance said the company had a growing cache of weapons it was selling to suspicious customers , including a steady flow of officials from the Iraqi Interior Ministry .
The ministry had ties to violent militias and death squads .
He said he had also witnessed another employee giving American soldiers liquor in exchange for bullets and weapon repairs .
On a visit to Chicago in October 2005 , Mr. Vance met twice with an F.B.I. agent who set up a reporting system .
Weekly , Mr. Vance phoned the agent from Iraq and sent him e-mail messages .
“ It was like , ‘ Hey , I heard this and I saw this . ’
I wanted to help , ” Mr. Vance said .
A government official familiar with the arrangement confirmed Mr. Vance ’s account .
These documents often offer an optimistic view of the future , characteristic of the author .
The early Energy Substitution Model is described and analyzed in detail in the following papers :
This is a brief account of the Energy Susbstitution Model developed by Cesare Marchetti in the 1970s at IIASA .
Using data from the latest BP Statistical Review the evolution of the energy market is compared with the model to understand why the Hubbert Peak of fossils fuels represents a problem today .
This post in large measure addresses the " Energy source X will do it " claims , and can be considered part the Contrarian Arguments series .
A lifetime of research
Cesare Marchetti was born in Luca ( Italy ) in 1927 and got a degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale at Pisa in 1949 .
We would then leave Academia to never return back .
In his own words :
I found University too constraining and in many ways petty , so , after my degree in physics , I chose to start free roaming , an attitude I did conserve for the following 50 years of my career .
By 1950 he was already working on Nuclear energy , researching heavy water reactors at CISE ( Centro Informazioni Studi Esperienze ) .
Later in the decade , after roaming some time in Argentina and Switzerland , he joined Agip Nucleare ( now part of ENI ) where he researched gas - cooled reactors .
In 1959 , with Agip Nucleare going to state hands , Marchetti joined Euroatom with his 50 person team assembled at Agip .
In a few years he had one lab in Italy and another in the Netherlands .
It was during this time at Euroatom that Marchetti and his team produced the most lasting results : the concept of Hydrogen as an energy vector and a " Hydrogen Economy " , the concept of the Atomic Isle and the self sinking of radioactive waste away from the Earth ’s crust .
All of this still in the 1960s .
In 1973 Marchetti joined the recently assembled IIASA , in his words to veer away from an hostile environment at Euroatom .
He started researching on energy with the intention of staying for some months , but a continued comfortable relationship kept him there for the rest of his life .
It was at IIASA that Marchetti brought successfully to energy systems analysis the simple concepts of logistic growth from the biology sciences .
Although Hubbert had reached similar conclusions in the 1940s for the case of Oil , Marchetti widened the concept of deterministic behaviour of energy systems .
Beyond energy , Marchetti would study innovation , population dynamics , transport systems , war , banking and much more , using the same concepts of logistic predictive modeling .
An interesting auto - biography is available here .
The energy substitution model
The first problem Marchetti took on , after joining IIASA , was to find a long term energy market model , at the time an uncommon idea :
The first problem was to meet a challenge set by our boss for the energy group Prof .
Haefele , physicist and theologian : to find a simple and predictive model describing energy markets for the last century or so .
For the beard of Newton .
Marchetti tried using logistic curves to describe the way energy sources enter and leave the market .
Using the Fischer - Pry analysis technique he plotted the share each energy source had on the market .
This kind of analysis was introduced as a tool to study the market penetration of new technologies .
Simplifying , this approach consists in calculating the market share of each energy source , F , and then calculating F / 1 - F .
The interesting thing about this representation is that on a logarithmic scale a new element entering the market following a logistic curve will describe two straight lines , one during the growth period , another during the decline period , connected by an arch at the peak .
Further insight on the Fischer - Pry analysis can be found here .
Figure 1 – Using the Fischer - Pry representation for a Hubbert curve .
Click for full image .
Using data for Wood , Coal , Oil and Natural Gas , Marchetti found indeed that the long term market penetration of these energy sources was ruled by logistic growth and decline .
In his first paper on the Energy Susbstitution Model [ pdf ] from 1977 the results published were these :
Figure 2 – The Energy Substitution Model identified by Marchetti in 1977 .
Click for full image .
Marchetti did n’t use hydroelectric power in his analysis , probably due to lack of data .
Hydroelectric energy has never penetrated more than 6 % into the market ; its absence changes little to the final result .
Beyond those elegant curves drawn in a logarithm - scale by the Fischer - Pry technique , this chart showed a very important thing : all of the Industrial Age energy sources follow a similar trend when entering the market .
It takes 40 to 50 years for an energy source to go from 1 % to 10 % of market share and an energy source that eventually comes to occupy half of the market will take almost a century to do so , from the epoch it reaches 1 % .
Internal Clocks
" Internal clocks " was a term Marchetti used to put in simple ways the deterministic behaviour of the energy market observed in the 1970s .
From his analysis it seemed clear that energy sources enter and leave the market on a pre-determined fashion , beyond outside control .
Later , in 1978 , Marchetti was invited to address the methodology of energy systems analysis at the IIASA Third Energy Status Report .
A written version was published in 1979 entitled Energy Systems – The Broader Context [ pdf ] where he took a somewhat informal approach on the subject :
I am originally a physicist , a bit of the Bridgman school , and I always try to find an operational description of certain statements .
The best operational description for our case is that of Alice in Wonderland who sees flowers and flowers , picks them , and then sees better flowers , so she throws the old flowers away and so on .
Marchetti also tried to grasp who decides which flowers
Alice picks :
But the question now is who pick the flowers [ … ] perhaps politicians , or the heads of large companies , are decision makers .
Well , I had long discussions with them and a lot of them say : " We seem to be decision makers but we are so strongly conditioned that finally we do n’t recognize any decision in our decisions .
We are just optimizers . "
But a subtle warning remained ; the market does n’t have to evolve exactly as the models predict :
Waiting for more insight , I would suggest not underrating the built - in wisdom of the system .
As Nakicenovic showed , a " natural " phase - out of the old primary energy sources , and a phase - in of nuclear and perhaps of a new source around year 2020 , may provide a smooth transition , with no muddling whatsoever , to the year 2030 .
The real constraints appear to be not in the realm of physical resources , but in that of international cooperation .
There perhaps decision makers ( optimizers ! ) should concentrate their action .
All of this was written before Iraq invaded Iran removing 8 Mb/d of Oil from the market almost overnight .
Looking at it today
Thirty years later it is interesting to see how the market behaved .
Using the data from the latest BP Statistical Review of World Energy , the result is the following :
Figure 3 – The Energy Substitution Model from 1977 and data from the BP Statistical Review of 2007 .
Wood fuel data from FAOSTAT .
Click for full image .
In large measure the real data moved away from the model of the 1970s .
This was probably due to the Oil shocks that upset the market , but the prolonged effects are not as easily explainable .
What immediately emerges to view is that after the Oil crisis was surpassed in the 1980s , the market seems to have frozen , with each energy source maintaining its market share .
A closer look to each source is useful .
Wood
Marchetti only had data for Wood up to 1950 and extrapolated future production falling and loosing market share in line with the previous trend .
FAO has published data for wood fuel consumption since 1961 that is considerably higher than the curve Marchetti projected .
Wood fuel consumption data is something considerably hard to assess , and even FAO has preformed considerable revisions in later years .
The discrepancies can be attributed to poor quality of the data prior to 1950 , but the current trend in consumption is markedly different from what the model projected , still growing although not as fast as the Fossil Fuels .
Coal
Coal was following a logistic phase - out of the market when the Oil shocks came ; it immediately stopped losing share .
Since the year 2000 Coal has been moving upwards and looks as the best candidate to take Oil ’s dominant place , as soon as the former peaks .
Oil
Interestingly , although Oil was the most battered energy source since the 1970s , it is the one following closer the substitution model .
This means that Marchetti probably underestimated Oil ’s trend which was bound to hit the 50 % market share in the 1990s , soon before peaking .
Today
Oil is clearly loosing ground and will likely follow a downward trend not far from that inscribed in the model .
Natural Gas
Unlike Coal , Natural Gas was already in an alternate trend at the start of the 1970s .
By then the understanding of this energy source was not the same it is today , and the model looks highly optimistic .
The underestimation of Oil is probably reflected here in an overestimation of Natural Gas .
Still it is interesting to see that the projected peak in market penetration by 2030 is in the same epoch of the presently expected production peak .
Nuclear
Marchetti expected Nuclear to enter the 5 - 10 % interval by the year 2000 , but that happened much sooner , Nuclear went over 5 % in 1987 .
Up to the 1990s Nuclear energy greatly surpassed his expectations in the wake of the Oil crisis ( which facilitated market penetration ) but as liquid hydrocarbons production started growing again , Nuclear ’s penetration in the market slowed down .
By 2000 it hovered around 6.5 % , but has fallen below 6 % since then .
An interesting thing to note is that Nuclear is today very close to what Marchetti’s curve showed it would be .
The difference is that the trend is currently downwards , while Marchetti expect the world to be entering the Nuclear Age by now .
Sol - Fus
There is n’t much to say about alternative energy sources , except that they never shown up .
As a benchmark , Wind energy occupies today 0.2 % of the energy market , a point Nuclear energy crossed still in the 1950s .
Looking ahead and back
What is the importance of the Energy Substitution Model ?
It seems that it broadly failed to achieve its intents : to predict future market dynamics .
First of all it is essential to observe that the growth trends were only broke during the Oil crisis , Nuclear energy ’s spectacular growth occurred between 1975 and 1985 .
Besides this brief event never the growth trend was surpassed .
Most important of all is to understand what did n’t happened .
Although Nuclear is today very close to where Marchetti expected it to be , it is in a clear downward trend , that even in the face of Peak Oil might not immediately reverse .
The last time an energy source crossed over 1 % share of the energy market was 35 years ago .
The last time an energy source crossed over 10 % share of the market was more than 50 years ago .
This is why the Hubbert Peak is a problem today .
To have a new energy source with 10 % of the market by 2010 , it had to have crossed the 1 % threshold by 1970 the latest .
Using the same metaphor ,
It seems that Alice feel in love with some flowers and forgot about picking more .
Does this mean that abandoning Nuclear energy was an error ?
Possibly .
But more relevant than abandoning Nuclear energy was doing it without opting for an alternative .
Abandoning Nuclear could have been an option back in the 1970s if a clear alternative had been pursued with proper research and development .
Naturally , in exceptional times a new energy source can penetrate the market much faster than the pace predicted by the model .
Either by Society ’s commitment to it , either by the decline of other sources , a new element can rapidly take its share , like Nuclear did during the Oil crisis .
But these are exactly the disturbed times Society should avoid .
Finally it is important to stress that Oil is much more than an energy source today .
It is the world ’s most important manufacturing commodity , paramount to most industries , from Pharmaceuticals to Civil Construction , from Electronics to Clothing .
And above all , the base of modern Agriculture .
Will Society ever be able to plan in advance for multi-decade cycles ?

Kevin Whitrick broadcast his suicide over the internet
Kevin Whitrick , 42 , of Wellington , Shropshire , broadcast his death over the internet in March .
The father - of - two was found hanged after suffering from severe depression for several years .
The CPS said comments made by chatroom users at the time did not amount to a criminal offence .
A spokesman said in a statement : " This is a tragic case which resulted in the untimely death of Kevin Whitrick .
" We examined all the evidence passed to us by the police and have concluded that none of the comments made in the chatroom amounted to a criminal offence .
" As a result , there is insufficient evidence to prosecute any person for any criminal offence arising out of Mr Whitrick 's death . "

Tribler has also been made to work with the PlayStation 3
The team has created a peer - to - peer system called Tribler in which selfless sharers earn faster upload and download speeds but leechers are penalised .
The technology is being assessed by a European broadcasting body looking at ways of piping TV across the net .
Tribler has also been used to turn Sony 's PlayStation 3 into a video - sharing device .
Fair sharing
While file - sharing networks are good ways to help lots of people get hold of large files often they have far more people taking from the system than they do giving .
Peer - to - peer networks can become sluggish if too many users download content without sharing with others .
Using bandwidth as a kind of currency helps to encourage better habits said Dr Johan Pouwelse , an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology and co-creator of Tribler .
Dr Pouwelse has been working with associate professor David Parkes from Harvard University to add an accounting system to Tribler to encourage users to upload as often as they download .
" In our model your TV would use " TV watching minutes " , our form of P2P currency , to download content , " said Dr Pouwelse .
" The TV would connect directly to the internet and provide video on demand in HDTV quality .
" After you watch a program on TV , the system would automatically share this program during the night with other people , until your ' TV watching minutes ' credit is healthy again , " he said .
" If we get this right , it would mean quite a change in the TV business , " said Dr Pouwelse .
Using bandwidth as a currency helps make sharing fairer
" In peer - to - peer , I can build up credit by offering upload capacity and then use the credit for download in the future , " he said .
" There is still a balance , but the balance is on the order of days rather than seconds and this time - shifting can be welfare enhancing , said Dr Parkes .
Future proof
Tribler has already caught the attention of the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , which is trying to create a standardised internet broadcasting system across Europe .
" Tribler is a good candidate , " said Franc Kozamernik , senior engineer at the EBU .
" We are in the process of testing it and checking whether it fulfils our requirements or not , " he said .
The EBU has already tested a number of other P2P systems and is in the process of building a media portal which will allow EBU members to publish their radio and television channels across Europe .
Overlaid on Tribler is social networking technology that helps to police the system and encourage fair sharing .
A passionate community was as effective at policing content as a central administrator , said Dr Pouwelse .
" I was doing research back in 1999 looking at an obscure website called Slashdot , " he said .
" It was a technology - related news website controlled by volunteers and it actually worked .
A few people would post bad things but 99 % of users were nice . "
Peers can " gossip " or report on the behaviour of malicious users .
And because content is not stored on a central server , it is harder for malicious users to attack a P2P network , said Dr Pouwelse .
" One user can not bring the network as a whole down , " he said .
" Just as the electric grid has no central elements , Tribler has no central element and should be more robust .
" The only danger is what is sometimes called a ' cascading failure ' .
It happened to Skype a few days ago .
But in four years , Skype broke down just once . "
Despite 20 years of research , the benefits of zinc lozenges as a therapy for the common cold have not been proven .
A new study , published in the Sept. 1 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases , currently available online , reviews the 14 placebo - controlled studies from the past two decades and finds significant fault with 10 of the studies .
Of the four remaining studies , three reported no therapeutic effect from zinc lozenge or nasal spray , and one study reported positive results from zinc nasal gel .
“ The best scientific evidence available indicates that zinc lozenges are not effective in treating colds , ” said Jack M. Gwaltney , Jr. , MD , one of the authors .
With colds affecting virtually everybody ( one study estimates that adults experience an average of three colds each year and children may experience as many as eight or 10 ) , people are eager to alleviate the discomfort that accompanies a cold .
In 1984 , the first study reporting that zinc lozenges effectively reduced the duration of the common cold was published .
Many other studies followed , some seeming to support the idea of zinc either lessening symptoms or length of illness and some finding no effect .
In this new research , the authors have sorted through 105 studies of zinc and the common cold .
From this , they extracted the 14 randomized , placebo - controlled studies , the type of study that might provide the strongest evidence for or against zinc ’s usefulness in cold - relief .
They then checked each study for 11 features of experimental design that needed to be met in order for the study to produce valid results .
The research was performed by medical student Thomas Caruso of Stanford University School of Medicine with the direction of Dr. Gwaltney , a professor of internal medicine , emeritus , at the University of Virginia School of Medicine , and with the assistance of Charles Prober , MD , also at Stanford .
They found significant flaws in 10 of the studies , flaws that may have invalidated the results .
The most frequently found problem was the lack of an “ intent to treat ” analysis , which ensures that data for all subjects will be used regardless of whether or not they complete the trial .
This is important because if study subjects who are taking zinc decide it ’s not having an effect and quit the study , and their data is not included in the analysis , then they might leave behind only those subjects who think the zinc is having an effect , creating a significant bias in favor of the effectiveness of zinc .
Other problems found in the studies included lack of a quantifiable hypothesis or sample sizes too small to produce statistically valid findings .
Of the four studies that met the authors ’ criteria , two studies reported that zinc lozenges had no effect on the symptom severity or duration of a cold , one study reported no effect of zinc nasal spray , and one study reported a positive effect of zinc nasal gel in lessening symptoms and length of a cold .
“ Since less information is available on the intranasal approach , additional well - designed studies of intranasal zinc spray or zinc - treated nasal swabs should be performed , ” said Dr. Gwaltney .
As the search for a cure for the common cold continues , some may be happy to learn that it is n’t contained in a zinc lozenge , as the lozenges are frequently reported to be unpleasant to the taste and may produce stomach ache and nausea as side effects .
In addition , chronic zinc intake of greater than 40 mg / day can lead to malfunctioning of the immune system and chronic fatigue ( various brands of lozenges have between 5 and 24 mg of zinc in each lozenge ) .

The Bush Administration sent the 43 Million dollars to reward the Taliban Government for it 's declaring that opium growing is against the will of God .
The Bush administration gave this money to the Taliban with the full knowledge that Osama Bin Laden was in Afghanistan operating his Al Qaeda terror network .
To make matters worse Bin Laden had already launched the 1998 attacks on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which left 225 people dead and injured more than 4,000 .
If that was n't bad enough Bin Laden had also ordered the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole which left 17 sailors dead along with another 39 injured .
Had Bush forgotten that President Clinton had bombed Bin Ladens terrorist camps in Afghanistan in retaliation for these attacks ?
The Bush administration also conveniently ignored the fact that the Taliban brutally oppressed the female population of Afghanistan .
The Taliban also tortured and executed it 's opponents and required religious minorities to wear clothing that marked them as non Muslims which was similar to what the NAZI 's had done to the Jews , Gypsies , and Gays .
In the end it turned out that the Taliban had fooled the Bush administration because instead of banning Opium in reality the Taliban had actually increased the production of opium .
But what else should we expect from the Bush Administration except more ignorance and more lies .

Since we launched last100 , just over eight weeks ago , I ’ve been obsessively trying out every Internet TV application that I can get my hands on .
To assist some of our newer readers , here ’s a quick recap of the Internet TV apps we ’ve profiled so far .
Note : Many of the following applications offer very different features and solve different problems .
This post is n’t designed to be a product comparison — because it would be like comparing apples with oranges — but instead serves as an overview of some of our coverage to - date .
Joost
Platform : Windows / Intel Mac
Status : Invite - only Beta
From the founders of Skype and Kazaa , Joost is an on - demand video service that utilizes P2P technology to deliver a TV - like experience on a PC .
In this respect , think of it as cable television without the need for a set - top - box .
Additional functionality is provided through a number of built - in applications ( called ‘ widgets ’ ) which include a channel - based chat room , an IM client ( currently GTalk and Jabber only ) , and an RSS - based news ticker .
In terms of content , big names signed up include : MTV , Comedy Central , CNN , Sony Pictures television , CBS , and National Geographic .
Our verdict : Joost is an impressive entry into the world of Internet TV .
Its peer - to - peer technology not only lowers the cost of distribution for content owners , but also does it in a way that appears to solve the piracy problem .
That said , picture quality could be better , and the license restrictions on content seriously impedes users who reside outside of the US .
Babelgum
Platform : Windows
Status : Invite - only Beta ( we have invites )
Babelgum is a peer - to - peer online video service founded by Italian billionaire Silvio Scaglia , which like Joost , aims to combine the “ lean - back experience ” of television with the interactivity and social elements of the web .
Babelgum does n’t yet have the mainstream content deals that Joost boasts , and instead the company ’s strategy seems to be more about helping niche content find and connect with niche audiences , so as to exploit the “ Long Tail ” .
Babelgum ’s additional features include the ability to rate and bookmark clips , as well as create a playlist of channels .
Our verdict : Whether Babelgum can overcome Joost ’s first - mover advantage and make a success of it ’s niche content strategy — against a backdrop of big media competition — is yet to be seen .
But either way , the peer - to - peer Internet TV space looks a lot more healthy with at least two competitors rather than just one .
RealPlayer 11
Platform : Windows
Status : Public Beta
The new version of RealPlayer combines media player and jukebox and CD burning functionality ( similar to iTunes ) , with a new flagship feature : the ability to download videos from the web .
With RealPlayer 11 installed , when you visit a website with embedded video ( Real , Flash , QuickTime or Windows Media ) , a floating tab appears giving you the option to download the file or ‘ record ’ it in the case of a live stream .
Once you click ‘ download this video ’ a copy is then placed into your RealPlayer library .
The feature only works with web videos that do n’t utilize DRM .
Platform : Windows
Status : Public Beta
Our verdict :
While it will be hard for RealPlayer to shake off its poor reputation , there ’s much to like about version 11 .
The new interface and jukebox functionality has been appropriately borrowed from iTunes , and the ability to download and save videos from the web , not only works well , but should prove popular with users who want to build their own personal video collection .
Vuze
Platform : Windows ( required to playback paid - for content ) / Mac
Status : Full public release
Vuze is an application that enables users to search , browse , and download ‘ near DVD ’ and HD quality video content , using the peer - to - peer protocol , BitTorrent .
In particular the company is pitching the platform as a way for independent video and film producers to distribute their content to millions of users — at no cost — and with a higher picture quality than other competing services .
In addition to being an open platform where anybody can publish their content , Vuze has signed licensing deals with a number of larger players , such as the BBC , A&E , and Showtime , who are offering paid - for content : rental and to - own .
Although Vuse can function as a video library , rather oddly , the application does n’t have its own media player .
That ’s because Vuze is format agnostic , so content producers are free to upload their video in any number of formats , meaning it ’s simpler to let playback be handled outside of the application ( using QuickTime or Windows Media Player , for example ) .
Our verdict : Vuze will appeal to independent producers who want to distribute their content at zero-cost and up - to HD - quality .
While the option to charge for content is only currently available to those who ’ve signed formal licensing deals , an upcoming version of the software will enable all content creators to set their own prices , select a business model ( rental , to - own or ad supported ) , manage territories , and choose whether to use DRM .
VeohTV
Platform : Windows
Status : Invite - only Beta
VeohTV is pitching itself as a more ‘ open ’ alternative to the likes of Joost or Babelgum .
Rather than being restricted to formal licensing agreements , VeohTV pulls in videos from thousands of sources — which currently includes NBC , CBS , FOX , YouTube , MySpace , and Veoh ’s own video - sharing site — with content browsable via a cable TV - style program guide .
In addition , VeohTV enables you to download and save almost any DRM - free online video to your library ( similar to the way RealPlayer 11 works ) .
Our verdict : VeohTV represents a bold attempt to create a simple video player / aggregator for any type of online video , and for that reason we really wanted to like the application .
But in reality this is also why it falls short .
Inconsistent picture quality and download times — although not the fault of Veoh — results in a confusing viewing experience , and in attempting to make subscribing to and managing video podcasts seamless with watching other types of online video , VeohTV actually makes the process more complicated .
Having said that , many of these issues could be addressed through a few simple interface tweaks , so do n’t write off VeohTV just yet .
Zattoo
Platform : Windows / Mac / Linux
Status : Beta ( limited to a few European countries )
Zattoo is an Internet TV service which , like Joost and Babelgum , utilizes peer - to - peer technology to deliver streaming video to a PC .
However , Zattoo is n’t an on - demand affair , and instead offers live streaming of existing ‘ over - the - air ’ and cable TV channels .
And rather than attempting to re-create the lean - back experience of traditional television , the service is more at home used in a multi- tasking environment , where users watch television in one window on their computer , while accomplishing other tasks in another , such as chatting to friends over IM , surfing the web or writing email .
Our verdict :
We really liked Zattoo for its simplicity , near - zero buffering , and good picture quality .
The only downside is the limited number of channels ( which should increase ) , and the fact that it ’s only currently available in Spain and Denmark , with the UK .
LiveStation
Platform : Windows
Status : Private Beta
Similar to Zattoo , LiveStation utilizes peer - to - peer technology to deliverer live TV to a user ’s PC .
The software has been developed by UK startup , Skinkers , and is in - part based on technology licensed from Microsoft Research ( who get a small amount of equity in return ) .
Of note , the front - end for LiveStation is powered by Microsoft ’s newly launched Flash - competitor , Silverlight .
Our verdict :
As it stands , LiveStation is more a proof - of - concept , with only one channel being available during its closed - testing phase ( BBC News24 ) .
However , like Zattto , there ’s near - zero buffering time , and picture quality is good .
Jalipo
Platform : Windows / Mac
Status : Full public release
Jalipo is a web - based Internet TV service which offers on - demand ( TV shows and movies ) and live broadcasts on a minute by minute “ pay as you go ” basis .
Jalipo content — most of which we were unfamiliar with — is viewed in exchange for J: Credits , the company ’s own online currency .

Miro
Platform : Windows / Mac / Linux
Status : Public preview
Miro ( formerly known as Democracy Player ) is an open - source Internet TV application that combines a media player and library , content guide , video search engine , as well as podcast and BitTorrent clients .
Developed by the Participatory Culture Foundation , Miro aims to make online video “ as easy as watching TV ” , while at the same time ensuring that the new medium remains accessible to everyone , through its support for open standards .
Our verdict : Miro is quite possibly the best video “ podcast ” client and player out there .
Its multi - format support , coupled with a very well thought out user interface , extensive content directory , and support for a number of popular video sharing sites , makes it a formidable Internet TV application .
The only major drawback is the lack of support for the iPod or AppleTV , both of which would be a natural fit .
Paul Wolfowitz failed to appear at a high - profile World Bank meeting yesterday , sparking rumours that he was on the verge of quitting as president .
No explanation was offered for Mr Wolfowitz 's absence from the conference in Washington , on the day when the bank 's governing board was meeting to discuss the controversy over the president 's ordering of promotions and pay rises for his partner , Shaha Riza .
The board , made up of 24 representatives of the bank 's member countries , had cleared its agenda to deal with the breach of the bank 's ethical rules by Mr Wolfowitz .
The former Pentagon second - in - command , a leading architect of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , has been embroiled in the scandal for the last two weeks , leading to calls for his resignation from bank staff and aid agencies , as well as rumbles of discontent from the bank 's European member states .
On Wednesday the White House again offered only a tepid endorsement to the man appointed to the job by President George Bush in 2005 .
" As we 've said before , the president has confidence in Paul Wolfowitz , " Dana Perino , the White House press secretary , said .
But when asked if that meant the White House would abide by whatever decision was made by the World Bank board , she replied : " Wolfowitz has said he would abide by what the board said . "
European development ministers - including Britain 's Hilary Benn - made it clear at the weekend that they thought Mr Wolfowitz 's continued presence was damaging for the institution .
They have been keeping up the pressure since the weekend spring meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
" Discussions have been going on at a high level between European states on what to do .
We are monitoring the situation very closely " , said one European official .
Sources in Europe said they were willing to play a " long game " , preferring to see Mr Wolfowitz resign rather than force the issue to a vote of the Bank 's board , where the US might use its veto to prevent Mr Bush 's appointment from being removed .
The episode that led to the current row took place in 2005 , when Mr Wolfowitz overruled bank staff to demand a 46 % pay increase and a promotion for Ms Riza when she was moved outside the bank to avoid rules forbidding partners from working together .
Ms Riza was seconded to the US state department , where she was paid more than Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 17 — It is not often that a local government tries to turn down $ 10 million in federal construction money .
But then it is not every day that an Alaska congressman surprises a Florida community with the gift of a highway interchange that just happens to abut the property of a major political fund - raiser .
The money for the interchange was the work of Representative Don Young , the Alaska Republican who was chairman of the transportation committee before the last election .
Officials of Lee County considered the project a low priority , environmental groups opposed it and the Republican congressman from the district never asked for it .
Protesters have been vocal about Zimbabwe 's economic woes
Amnesty International claims that female demonstrators can be subjected to arbitrary arrest , beatings and in some cases torture in police custody .
The human rights group , which interviewed dozens of activists , urged the country 's authorities to " stamp out any discrimination against women " .
Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe economic crisis .
Shops are running out of even the most basic items and inflation is approaching 5,000 % .
Men live on average for 37 years but life expectancy for women is worse at just 34 years - among the lowest in the world .
' Important resource '
Male protesters do face widespread human rights abuses , but female activists quoted in Amnesty 's report , Between a Rock and a Hard Place - Women Human Rights Defenders at Risk , described receiving brutal treatment at the hands of the police .
" Detained women human rights defenders have been subjected to sexist verbal attacks , and denied access to food , medical care and access to lawyers , " the report said .
ZIMBABWE CRISIS
Inflation : approaching 5,000 % Unemployment : 80 % 4 m need food aid Life expectancy : 37 ( men ) , 34 ( women )
Mugabe in economy vow
" Some have been severely beaten while in police custody , in some instances amounting to torture . "
An activist called Irene , from the group Women of Zimbabwe Arise , told Amnesty 's researchers how she had been arrested eight times .
During a protest in 2006 she said a police officer kicked her in the stomach while she was two months pregnant , causing a miscarriage .
Amnesty 's secretary general , Irene Khan , said female activists were an " important resource for the development of Zimbabwe " .
" They play a pivotal role in addressing the many human rights challenges the country is facing , " she said .
" The government must acknowledge the legitimacy of their work and stamp out any discrimination against women . "
African leaders are due to gather in August for the Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) summit in Zimbabwe .
Ms Khan called on them to " redouble their efforts " to end human rights violations in Zimbabwe .
" SADC leaders should insist that President Mugabe immediately stop the intimidation , ill - treatment , torture and harassment of critics of government policies . "
Tasked with rescuing the major labels from it ’s very public death spiral , the Recording Industry Ass. of America has struck on a novel idea .
Sue Everyone !
Not just old ladies and children but everyone in the US .
While you might think it ’s a joke , its not .
As a first step in their plan to sue everyone in the US the Recording Industry Ass. of America has launched a website where anyone that has received one of their “ We ’re gonna sue you ” letters can go and settle - up .
The Recording Industry Ass. of America has invited a couple hundred college students to beta test the site ( via “ We ’re gonna sue you ” letters sent to them last week ) .
The key to the Recording Industry Ass. of America ’s plan for suing all American ’s is the total automation of the process , from initial bullying to final ransom .
The launch of this site , completes the automation process and now the Recording Industry Ass. of America can identify , accuse , threaten and shakedown every American without having to have expensive , and increasingly counter - productive , court appearances .
The basic idea behind the site is to complement the Recording Industry Ass. of America ’s automated process for identifying and accusing anyone with an IP address , and an MP3 file , of copyright infringement .
The site allows people accused and threatened by the Recording Industry Ass. of America to confess their sins and make their shakedown payments via credit card .
In an amazing show of customer service , the site even includes a phone number in case you want to arrange a longer term payment plan .
One of the slick , fast - talking MBA ’s at the Recording Industry Ass. of America apparently ran the numbers and came up with this innovative new business model .
I reverse engineered their thinking and it goes something like this .
There are arounf 200 million adults in the US and be using their new automated process to threaten just 15 % of that population , with a 5 % pay - up rate at $ 2,000 per shakedown , the recording industry could pull in $ 3 billion dollars in year one .
That ’s almost 1/3 the total value of the US recorded music industry in 2006 .
Assuming modest growth in the number of threats and the average payment size , the revenue regenerated from the RIAA ’s shakedowns new business model could equal that of the entire music industry in just five years .
Hows thats for the monetization of P2P ?
To show that they care the Recording Industry Ass. of America has included a helpful FAQ on the site which provides potential payees with insightful tips like this :
How are P2P copyright infringers identified for lawsuits ?
They are initially identified by their Internet Protocol ( IP ) address – the Internet address that the computer uses to communicate .
Technology companies retained by the record companies monitor a variety of P2P networks to determine whether individuals are uploading or downloading the record companies ’ copyrighted music .
So no need to mount a defense or or try to fight it , once you get your “ We ’re gonna sue you ” letter just go to the site and pay up .

As a software developer , how much time do you actually spend writing code ?
I recently have discussed this topic with both junior and senior coworkers , from which I have realized that this is a very important question for many developers .
The amount of time the average developer actually spends coding can be surprisingly small , and is determined by a variety of factors :
Your position .
Are you a junior developer , a senior developer , or a team lead ?
In my experience , senior people often have less time for coding because of time spent providing assistance to junior resources and providing input on higher - level topics like project direction , architecture , or design .
Very junior people , especially those fresh out of school , are often given a greater share of the mundane , non-coding tasks like user support , updating documentation .
Development team leads , even of small teams , must spend time managing and coordinating the activities of the team .
Intermediate developers and juniors with a few years of experience generally get the most coding done .
The kinds of projects you are working on .
A typical development project to create a new application will involve a lot more coding than maintenance of an existing suite of operational applications .
This may be one reason that many developers prefer to be on development projects rather than maintenance .
The phase your work is in .
Whether you are working on a major new application or on a small enhancement to an existing application , there are periods when non-coding activities will predominate , such as when gathering requirements , clarifying the solution , testing and fixing defects , or producing documentation .
In my experience , there is a natural fluctuation in the amount of coding - some weeks or months you get a lot of coding in , and other weeks or months almost none .
The organizational culture .
Every workplace has a certain amount of weekly overhead activities , such as time sheets , weekly or daily team meetings , performance reviews , etc .
Places with more process or more required documentation typically mean less time spent coding .
The period of time when I was doing the most coding was on a project to create a new application , during the construction phase .
The waterfall methodology was being used , and the design phase had been completed .
The team was quite small , with only one junior resource , so we were able to spend the majority of our time coding new features .
I spent over 90 % of my work week coding .
Currently , in contrast , I am doing very little coding - probably under 20 % - due to my role as architect or technical lead on a number of projects .
How much coding are you doing ?

The Danes love their beer , but increasingly they are looking beyond the old Danish standby , Carlsberg , to quench their thirst .
The beer draws its inspiration from the open source movement
It is called Vores Oel , or Our Beer , and the recipe is proving to be a worldwide hit .
The idea behind the beer comes from open source software .
This is software whose code is made publicly available for anyone to change and improve , provided that those changes and improvements are then shared in turn .
Perhaps the most well - known example of open source software is the Linux operating system .
Microsoft , on the other hand , creates proprietary software , meaning the company does not tend to let others see how its software works .
The Danish brewer Carlsberg takes a similar approach to beer .
Rasmus Nielsen , who runs a Copenhagen - based artist collective called Superflex , wanted to challenge the idea of " proprietary " beer .
Software and alcohol
He was teaching a workshop on intellectual property and copyright at the Information Technology University in Copenhagen .
It 's the kind of beer that you feel afterwards that you 've eaten a steak or something
Rasmus Nielsen , artist
" Why not take those ideas back to the old world , and try to apply them to other things as well ? " asks Nielsen .
Why beer ?
As the Vores Oel website says , why not ?
" It 's a universal commodity that we like to think of as free , but unfortunately it is n't , " says Mr Nielsen .
" So , I thought it was an appropriate medium to confront these issues . "
A group of about 15 students at the university agreed .
" Beer is an amusing subject in a university environment , " says Thorarinn Stefansson , one of the students who signed up for the open source beer project .
" It 's something more stimulating than perhaps making something non-edible or non-drinkable . "
Heavy brew
To get started , the students met with the author of a Danish book on home - brewing .
Then , they came to an agreement on what kind of beer they wanted .
They bought the ingredients , and brewed up 100 litres of it in the university cafeteria .
Mr Stefansson says he and the other students decided to call it Our Beer , version 1.0 .
Denmark is better known for its Carlsberg beer
Our Beer turned out to be a darker , heavier brew than your typical Danish lager .
" It 's the kind of beer that you feel afterwards that you 've eaten a steak or something .
I mean , it 's not the kind of beer you 'd want to be drinking for a bachelor party or something , " says Mr Nielsen .
The students did supply an extra kick to their beer .
They added guarana , a South American berry that packs a caffeine - like punch .
The students also created a label for the beer , and a website that comes complete with catchy , open source music and sound effects .
Global interest
Most important , the students released the recipe under what is called a Creative Commons licence .
" You 're free to change it , " says Mr Nielsen .
" But if you use our recipe as the basis for your beer , you have to be open with your recipe as well .
That 's the legal framework that follows the beer . "
You can even sell your own version , as long as you credit Our Beer for the recipe .
The tipple has proved a hit .
The Our Beer website has been a busy place , says Mr Nielsen .
" We got loads of questions from small beer brewers in Mexico , Brazil , and even Afghanistan , " he says .
" Afghanistan , that was weird . "
One smaller Danish brewer is even planning on brewing up some of Our Beer to sell in the autumn .
Both Mr Nielsen and his students hope that what people take away from the Our Beer project is that open source is not just for the digital world .
Mr Nielsen says there is no reason that developing countries could not use the idea to manufacture , for example , their own HIV / AIDS drugs .

When your little one is born , there are several items you require to make their lives comfortable . …
With Peter 's observation that everything good in Computer Science happened during the " Golden Age " freshly in mind , I found Russ Cox 's recent article on regular expressions to be enjoyable reading .
This is a tale of two approaches to regular expression matching .
One of them is in widespread use in the standard interpreters for many languages , including Perl .
The other is used only in a few places , notably most implementations of awk and grep .
The two approaches have wildly different performance characteristics ...
The trends shown in the graph continue : the Thompson NFA handles a 100 - character string in under 200 microseconds , while Perl would require over 10 ^ 15 years .
Combining implementation details , finite automata , and a foray into decades - old theory , this article shows how most of our favorite little languages have an enormous performance bottlenecks for certain categories of string comparisons .
An additional data point : The Shootout benchmarks have a large string comparison test .
It 's interesting that Tcl is at the top of the heap for performance .
Guess which one is using the Thompson NFA algorithm for regular expressions ?
My favourite meteor show is less than 2 weeks away now , so I wanted to give you all another gentle reminder to get organized and make sure that you ’re able to enjoy the Perseid meteors this year – the shower will be peaking on the night of August 12 , and into the next morning .
It ’s going to be a special event because the shower coincides with a new moon .
The sky will be at its darkest , and the meteors will be at their brightest .
The shower gets its name because they will appear to originate from the constellation of Perseus .
Do n’t worry about finding the constellation , though , just lay on your back and stare up , you ’ll see them .
On the evening of August 12 , the first thing you ’ll want to do is head outside shortly after sunset .
If you ’re lucky , you ’ll see “ earthgrazers ” .
These are some of the most beautiful meteors that you ’ll see in the whole evening .
Then settle down , find some satellites , and wait for the show to really get going .
It you ’ve got the stamina , the best viewing will happen in the early dawn hours of Monday , August 13th .
At that point , you could be seeing a few dozen every hour .
To really get the best experience out of this , travel away from the lights of the city .
Here in Vancouver , we need to get about 50 km away to start seeing the Milky Way above our heads .
We ’ve got a dark sky park in a suburb called Abbotsford that ’s perfect .
So get organized .
Book the evening with your friends , map out where you ’re going to go .
Bring hot drinks , warm clothes , and a comfortable place to sit back and enjoy the show .
And if you ’re interested , Pamela and I recorded an episode of Astronomy Cast dealing with meteors and meteor showers , so you can listen in the car before you reach your viewing spot .
Enjoy , and let me know how it goes .
Jordanians are angry a wedding was hit in the bombings
The arrests came as al - Qaeda in Iraq allegedly named the four bombers - all Iraqis , including a husband and wife .
" They vowed to die and they chose the shortest route to receive the blessings of God , " the statement said .
In Amman , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned the " heinous crime " and " the scourge of terrorism " .
" No ideology , no cause can justify the vicious killing of innocent civilians , " said Mr Annan .
Rare justification
The al - Qaeda statement appeared on a website often used to make such claims , but it has not been independently confirmed .
It named the bombers as Abu Khabib , Abu Muaz , Abu Omaira and Om Omaira .
It said the hotels that had been bombed were centres for launching wars on Islam .
IDENTIFIED DEAD 33 Jordanians 6 Iraqis 4 Palestinians 2 Bahrainis 1 Saudi 1 American 1 Syrian - born American 1 Indonesian 2 Chinese
Al - Qaeda 's new direction Bombings in detail
The group seems to have been taken aback by the furious response , which included marches in Amman calling for its leader to " burn in hell " .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Amman says it is unusual for the group to put out additional statements justifying its actions .
Many Jordanians have - or had - some sympathy for the group , but few understand the reason for bombing a wedding .
King Abdullah vowed Jordan was " not afraid " and would not be cowed into changing its policies .
Most of the casualties in Wednesday 's attacks were Jordanian .
The Grand Hyatt , Days Inn and Radisson SAS hotels were the targets of the bombings .
The blast at the latter caused carnage at a wedding reception .
Prayers and condemnation
Jordanians have been saying special prayers of mourning in mosques and taking part in rallies on Friday .
There has been condemnation of the bombings from Arab voices ranging from Saudi newspapers to Palestinian militants .
A Hollywood producer and his daughter were killed in the blasts
Syrian - born Hollywood producer Moustafa Akkad - who was behind the Halloween horror films and the Anthony Quinn epic The Message - died on Friday of wounds sustained in the bombing .
His 33 - year - old daughter Rima was killed in the blast .
The producer 's death took the number killed to 57 .
At least three bombers also died .
HAVE YOUR SAY I was just a few blocks away from the Radisson SAS hotel where the one of the explosions took place and I heard a huge thundering bang
Yazeed , Amman
Send us your comments
DNA tests are being used to identify at least 14 bodies , including those of the bombers .
Jordan has become a base for Westerners who fly in and out of Iraq for work and has long been regarded as a prime target for attack , correspondents say .
Security has been tightened around Amman and Jordan 's land borders have been closed .
Using records dating back to 1855 , hurricane researchers say they have uncovered an ongoing rise in the number of Atlantic hurricanes that tracks the increase in sea surface temperature related to climate change .
Critics of such a link argue that this trend is merely because of better observations since the dawn of the satellite era in the 1970s .
But the authors of the new study say the conclusion is hard to dodge .
" Even if we take the extreme of these error estimates , we are left with a significant trend since 1890 and a significant trend in major hurricanes starting anytime before 1920 , " say atmospheric scientists Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , and Peter Webster of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
Looking at data from 1855 through 2005 , Webster and Holland found that the total number of tropical cyclones per year doubled in that time , from an average of six at the beginning of last century to 14 over the past decade .
And the present regime has yet to stabilize : " With increasingly higher sea surface temperatures it is hard to imagine anything lower than 15 storms per year " going forward , the two conclude .
Globally , areas of warm ocean have nearly tripled in size since the beginning of the 20th century , from roughly 17 million square miles to more than 46 million square miles , Webster and Holland note .
" There has been an average of one additional tropical cyclone for each 0.1 - degree Celsius increase in sea surface temperature and one hurricane for each 0.2 - degree Celsius rise , " they write in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A .
Critics note that although there has been an increase in the number of storms since 1995 , the effects of Atlantic currents , rather than climate change , could be responsible .
And improvements in detecting tropical cyclones may be more to blame for this trend than anything else .
" In 2005 we had 27 major storms , the most ever measured .
But six or seven of them were exclusively in the central Atlantic , " notes William Gray , a meteorologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins .
" The record it broke was 1933 that had 21 major storms , but there was no satellite or aircraft data then .
Had they had those measurements we probably would have had a comparable number of storms that year . "
But Holland and Webster assumed that measurements taken before aircraft and satellites made storms easier to spot could have missed as many as five hurricanes per year .
" Including these errors in our analysis changes the magnitude of the trend but leaves all the substantial conclusions unaffected , " they say .
Gray 's team will come out with its latest forecast for this year 's hurricane season at the end of this week , having previously predicted 17 storms this season .
" We will continue to predict an above average year , " he says .
" There 's a chance we might lower the numbers slightly but if we change it , we 're not going to change it by much . "
And Gray predicts that a global cooling will set in within the next decade , finally putting the climate change link on ice .
The experts agree that natural variability is largely to blame for the relative intensity of various hurricanes , but Holland and Webster note that the locations of such storms have changed .
" As more storms form near the equator , they are experiencing much better conditions for intensification and they are experiencing these conditions for a much longer period , " the pair note .
And that means more numerous and stronger hurricanes in the foreseeable future , whether the forecast is from a computer model or a meteorologist 's instincts .
The Hubble Space Telescope is 17 years old — that 's like 150 to you and me .
Next year , the geriatric orbiting eye will receive its final tune - up , and soon it will go live on a farm where it can play with other obsolete space - based observatories .
The good news is that NASA scientists have already cooked up a replacement .
The James Webb Space Telescope , scheduled for a 2013 launch , folds to fit into the cone of a rocket for deeper deployment than its predecessor .
Once in orbit , it will capture infrared instead of visible light and — since distance equals time in space — will be able to see back to about 400 million years after the big bang .
That should let it snag shots of the first bright objects , the origins of planetary systems , and the assembly of galaxies .
" Every time you get new capabilities , you see a quantum jump in progress , " says Mark Clampin , the observatory 's project scientist .
" I 'm sure we 'll discover things we 've never seen before . "
The New Space Telescope , Unfolded
For more , visit wired.com / video. 1 Mirrors
Hubble 's reflectors are too small to probe the farthest galaxies .
So the Webb is equipped with 18 hexagonal beryllium mirrors , each 51 inches wide .
Beryllium is lighter , stronger , and more stable then glass — the completed array will be half the weight of Hubble 's main mirror but 2.5 times bigger .
Each segment can pivot in six different directions and can be adjusted from Earth .
2 Micro shutters
The business end of the telescope ( the collector ) has 62,415 openings , measuring about 100 x 200 microns each .
These can capture spectrographs — images of incoming electro magnetic radiation — from 100 galaxies at a time .
Scientists will be able to open and close the shutters separately , depending on which gal axies are in the Webb 's field of view .
3 Infrared devices
The new telescope features four high - pixel density image sensor arrays — not so different from the ones found at the heart of a typical digicam .
In this case , there 's a near - infrared camera , a near - infrared spectrograph , a mid-infrared camera , and a fine guidance sensor .
4 Sun shield
The sun 's heat can easily overwhelm the infrared light that the telescope is looking for .
Solution : five tennis - court - sized Mylar shields .
Coated in aluminum and conductive silicon , the parasols will keep the scope cold enough to capture images while protecting it from radiation .
Why five layers ?
Micrometeoroids !
More layers means the slow buildup of small holes wo n't have an effect .
5 Location
Earth is a crummy vantage point for looking at space — a hazy atmosphere prevents detection of some wave lengths , heat screws up infrared imaging , and atmospheric turbulence distorts focus .
To avoid all this , scientists will shoot the Webb telescope to what is known as Lagrange point 2 , a spot 932,000 miles out that 's balanced between the gravities of Earth and the sun .

Last week Amazon said it faced a bleak holiday period of slowing sales growth .
' Unusual flexibility '
Amazon said the new programmes build on technology which allows customers to search inside a book before buying it , and should help make books available at " any time and any where " .
Its new schemes come as internet search Google announced the launch of a virtual library , allowing online access to millions of " public access " books from major libraries .
Text of these works - which are out of copyright - are being put online by the search giant 's digitisation project .
The text will be searchable and users will be able to save images of pages .
Meanwhile , announcing its Pages scheme , Amazon.com said it would allow people to buy only the relevant bits they needed from books .
" Amazon Pages and Amazon Upgrade leverage Amazon 's existing Search Inside the Book technology to give customers unusual flexibility in how they buy and read books , " said Jeff Bezos , founder and chief executive of Amazon.com .

World 's oldest car for sale
Steam - powered 1884 car will be auctioned at Pebble Beach in August .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A steam - powered car , billed as the oldest car in the world that still runs , will be sold in a Pebble Beach , Calif. , auction in August .
The car was built in France in 1884 , about a year before Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz of Germany built their first experimental gasoline - powered cars .
( The two were working independently of one another . )
Henry Ford , the man many Americans mistakenly believe invented the automobile , built his first car 12 years after this one .
4 Record - breaking car sales
The four - wheeled De Dion - Bouton et Trepardoux , nicknamed " La Marquise , " was originally built for the French Count De Dion , one of the founders of the company .
The car has had only two other owners since , according to auction house Gooding & Company , which is handling the sale .
In an 1887 demonstration drive , the car covered a 19 mile course at an average speed of 26 miles per hour .
The following year , it won the world 's first car race , according to Gooding , beating a three - wheeled steam - powered De Dion - Bouton .
Fueled by coal , wood and bits of paper , the car takes about a half - hour to work up enough steam to drive .
Top speed is 38 miles per hour .
" That 's as fast as you want to go , " said David Gooding , founder of the auction company .
" It feels like going 80 or 90 miles per hour in a newer automobile .
And , by newer , I mean 1910 . "
The car runs on thin tires of solid rubber wrapped around metal wheels .
Bob Casey , curator of transportation for the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn , Michigan , agreed that the De Dion - Bouton is , quite possibly , the oldest running automobile .
( The definition of " automobile , " in this case , excludes large steam - powered carriages that were , essentially , rail cars without rails . )
Casey 's museum has an American - made steamer dating from the 1860s but it's no longer safe to drive and probably was n't even when Henry Ford bought it in 1930 .
Gooding estimates the car 's value at between $ 1. 5 million and $ 2 million .
It will be auctioned on August 19 in Pebble Beach , Calif .

Technology Correspondent , BBC News
But is this just a flash - in - the - pan , an internet fad that will soon go the way of CB radio in the 70s ?
And is it just for the under - 25s ?
As a 40 - something Technology Correspondent , determined to keep up with my younger colleagues , I felt duty bound to find out .
So I got myself a profile on MySpace , bebo and Facebook .
I also signed up to the hottest new social networking service , Twitter .
This has an added twist - you can send short updates to everyone in your network via text message , providing a running commentary of your life .
After a few days I can't help noticing one thing about my virtual social life - I do n't seem to have many friends .
I have tried to find anyone I know on these sites - but nobody seems to be there .
My school and university both have active networks on Facebook and bebo - but none of my contemporaries are there .
I get to grips with the language of Facebook and , with some trepidation , " poke " a few of the young people in my office .
' Pity ' friends ?
Graciously , they agree to be friends , but I can't help feeling they are doing it out of pity .
Then , a moment of excitement - I 've suddenly got a friend on MySpace .
My Twitter updates proved less than riveting reading ...
He 's called Tom .
My 16 - year - old son - a veteran of social networking - puts me right .
" Dad , Tom is the guy who runs MySpace - he 's everybody 's friend " .
Time to seek help .
I 've found a group on Facebook called : " I cant get out of bed without the Today Programme " .
I now have a tiny Bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
I contact its founder Benna Schellhorn , and she comes over to look at my Facebook profile and give me some advice .
" Oh dear Rory , you really do n't have many friends , " she says , in a reproving tone .
Social events
She explains that Facebook has helped her keep in touch with old university friends , organise social events - and rediscover someone she last saw when she was 12 .
" You can use it to organise nights out clubbing , " she suggests , brightly .
Hmmm - I 'm not sure she understands the nature of my middle - aged social life .
But I follow her advice to put a little more work into my profile - and try again to persuade old friends to join me .
My social network - the founders of Bebo become my friends
By now I am having a bit of luck with Twitter - but I 'm beginning to wonder why I signed up .
My circle of Twitterers - all of them in my age bracket - include my oldest friend , a Cardiff doctor using the soubriquet TopDoc , and two friends from the murky world of public relations , Suburbman and TheClackster .
Soon my phone is twittering with every detail of their mundane lives .
" Not much happening right now .
About to take a shower , " says Suburbman
" Up at dawn , back hurting .
read the Guardian online , " is the thrilling news from TopDoc .
Slightly pretentious
" About to cook for Mrs Clackster , duck stir fry thing .
Drinking excellent Bouzeron ( burgundy ) , " is the slightly pretentious missive from TheClackster .
In a final attempt to prove that I can network , I head for a meeting of some of the dotcom world 's biggest movers and shakers .
Sitting at the back of another seminar on the future of technology I am awed and humbled to spot a top French blogger , Loic Lemeur , sending live twitters from his laptop .
But I 'm a little reluctant to ask him or anyone else to network with me .
Then I spot the two founders of Bebo , Michael and Xochi Birch .
They try to convince me that the social networking phenomenon is now attracting more mature adherents - some even older than me .
So I feel emboldened to ask the couple " Will you be my friends ? "
Well , what could they do ?
I now have a tiny Bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
But despite my hard - won social success - and the constant twittering of my phone - I think I 've had enough .
I have decided I am too old to Twitter and too mature for Myspace .
Some things are best left to the young .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The percentage of likely voters who plan to vote for Democrats in Tuesday 's congressional elections increased in the past week , according to a CNN poll conducted during the weekend .
Those voters supporting Democrats also seem less likely to change their minds before casting ballots , the poll found
Democrats hold a 20 percentage - point advantage -- 58 percent to 38 percent -- over Republicans among likely voters in the survey released Monday morning .
The Democratic advantage was 11 percentage points -- 53 percent to 42 percent -- in a poll a week ago .
Pollsters asked people who identified themselves as being likely to vote which party 's candidate they would vote for in their congressional district if the election were being held today .
( Watch how the parties are trying to get voters to the polls -- 2:13 )
On this question , the poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
In the so - called " poll of polls , " which averages the results of five national surveys , Democrats have a 53 percent to 41 percent margin over Republicans .
When asked if it is possible they could change their mind before Election Day , 17 percent of those likely voters who supported Republican congressional candidates said they might instead chose a Democrat , while 10 percent of those supporting Democrats said a switch was possible .
The poll 's sampling error on this question was plus or minus 6 percentage points .
The CNN poll , conducted by telephone Friday through Sunday by Opinion Research Corp. , interviewed 1,008 adult Americans , including 636 likely voters .
Democrats need a 15 - seat pickup in Tuesday 's elections to regain control of the House of Representatives and a gain of six seats to reclaim the Senate .

A field of 600 mirrors reflects rays from the Sun A tour of the tower
How the solar tower works
Well , the memory of it kept me chuckling as I toured the extraordinary scene of the new solar thermal power plant outside Seville in southern Spain .
From a distance , as we rounded a bend and first caught sight of it , I could n't believe the strange structure ahead of me was actually real .
A concrete tower - 40 storeys high - stood bathed in intense white light , a totally bizarre image in the depths of the Andalusian countryside .
The tower looked like it was being hosed with giant sprays of water or was somehow being squirted with jets of pale gas .
I had trouble working it out .
In fact , as we found out when we got closer , the rays of sunlight reflected by a field of 600 huge mirrors are so intense they illuminate the water vapour and dust hanging in the air .
The effect is to give the whole place a glow - even an aura - and if you 're concerned about climate change that may well be deserved .
But ultimately , the entire plant should generate as much power as is used by the 600,000 people of Seville .
It works by focusing the reflected rays on one location , turning water into steam and then blasting it into turbines to generate power .
As I climbed out of the car , I could hardly open my eyes - the scene was far too bright .
Gradually , though , shielded by sunglasses , I made out the rows of mirrors ( each 120 sq m in size ) and the focus of their reflected beams - a collection of water pipes at the top of the tower .
It was probably the heat that did it , but I found myself making the long journey up to the very top - to the heart of the solar inferno .
David had to wear sunglasses to shield his eyes from the glare
It was like being in a sauna and for the last stages the metal rungs of the ladders were scalding .
But our reward was the cool breeze at the top of the tower - and the staggering sight of a blaze of light heading our way from down below .
So far , only one field of mirrors is working .
But to one side I could see the bulldozers at work clearing a second , larger field - thousands more mirrors will be installed .
Letting off steam
I met one of the gurus of solar thermal power , Michael Geyer , an international director of the energy giant Abengoa , which owns the plant .
He is ready with answers to all the tricky questions .
What happens when the Sun goes down ?
Enough heat can be stored in the form of steam to allow generation after dark - only for an hour now but maybe longer in future .
Anyway , the solar power is most needed in the heat of summer when air conditioners are working flat out .
Is it true that this power is three times more expensive than power from conventional sources ?
Yes , but prices will fall , as they have with wind power , as the technologies develop .
Also , a more realistic comparison is with the cost of generating power from coal or gas only at times of peak demand - then this solar system seems more attractive .
The vision is of the sun-blessed lands of the Mediterranean - even the Sahara desert - being carpeted with systems like this with the power cabled to the drizzlier lands of northern Europe .
A dazzling idea in a dazzling location .

Properties ... the next frontier .
Well , at least if you can't stop yourself from watching the Java blog space , which is abuzz with discussions about this topic .
Are Properties the next feature to save the world , give us that so desperately needed silver bullet , and finally make Java developers feel good in their skins again ?
Bah ... it 's boring to just theorise about the superpowers of Properties .
How about we see if Properties can be useful by actually adding them to Ruby and see how they fare ... and do n't worry : no Lexers , Grammars , or Language Specs were harmed during the production of this article .
Embedded DSL
How could we add Properties to Ruby ?
Well , let 's try to implement an Embedded DSL .
The best way to start a DSL is to doodle around and sketch something that looks right .
Let 's see ...
C# properties in Ruby would look something like that :
class CruiseShip
property direction
property speed
end
With the basic look done , we see that this is not quite legal Ruby code , but it 's not far off .
If you load this class , Ruby will complain about " direction " and " speed " being unknown .
Let 's give the property call a property name in a way that does n't get evaluated on load .
Yes : Symbols to the rescue !
class CruiseShip
property : direction
property : speed
end
The code parses and loads ... but it still throws an error : NoMethodError : undefined method ' property ' for CruiseShip : Class
To solve this we use a simple fact : Ruby class definitions are more than just declarations , they are actually executed at load time .
When this line is loaded :
property : direction
a function with name " property " is searched and then called with parameter : direction .
How do we get the property method in there ?
Well , for now , let 's just do this :
def property ( sym )
# do some stuff
end
class CruiseShip
property : direction
property : speed
end
And there we are : the code loads without complaints .
The property definition on top of the file is n't pretty , but we 'll deal with that later and make it reusable .
Let 's flesh out the code in the property function .
property is called when the class definition is executed , which means it can add methods to the class .
With this , we can define a method , which will then be part of the class .
Add this code to the property function :
define_method ( sym ) do
instance_variable_get ( " @#{sym} " )
end
This causes the equivalent of this code to be added to the class :
def direction
@direction
end
This is the getter for the direction property , the code for the setter can be added in the same way :
define_method ( " #{sym}= " ) do |value|
instance_variable_set ( " @#{sym} " , value )
end
This is n't particularly useful yet ... actually , the same thing could have been done with attr_accessor : property which is already available in Ruby .
What ?
All this text and then the feature we implemented is already available ?
Not , quite .
With Properties we want more than just adding setters / getters on a class .
Properties should make it possible to register listeners that get notified when the value of a property changes .
After all , the trusty old Observer pattern has served us well .
Except , that using it in Java always involves a lot of tedious typing and boilerplate code .
There 's the code that actually calls all the listeners , which is always the same ... but before the notification comes the registration , which consists of defining add / remove methods that allow to register / unregister listeners .
Since this code is specific to the property names ( you want add_direction_listener , ... ) , there is no way to have an automatic way to do this in Java .
But wait !
This is a Ruby , which lends itself well to MetaProgramming , the art of having that lazy bum of a computer do the boring work for us , leaving us more time to smell the roses and feed the cat .
There is already some code that implements the setter
define_method ( " #{sym}= " ) do |value|
instance_variable_set ( " @#{sym} " , value )
end
Well ... could n't that just send out the notifications as well ?
define_method ( " #{sym} " ) do |value|
instance_variable_set ( " @#{sym} " , value )
fire_event_for(sym )
end
The other bit missing here are the listener management methods .
Here we just use the same define_method trick again , ie .
in the property function , define a method for this particular event :
define_method ( " add_#{sym}_listener " ) do |x |
@listener[sym ] << x
end
Methods for removing or accessing listeners would be handled the same way .
The code for setting up the listener lists and the rest is left to the reader as exercise .
( Stop moaning , it 's just a few lines of code each )
Using the code
Let 's see how all this works .
h = CruiseShip.new
h.add_direction_listener(Listener.new )
h.add_bar_listener lambda { |x| puts " Oy ... someone changed the property to # {x} " }
h.bar = 10
This will output : " Oy ... someone changed the property to 10 "
Dandy ... that was easy .
But before we continue we some more fun , let 's do a bit of cleaning .
Wrap it up an tie a bow around it
Now ... how do we get all this inside a class ?
This is where a very useful feature comes in : Mixins .
These are just ordinary Ruby Modules that are mixed into anclass definition .
Sounds odd ?
Nope , it 's as simple as this :
class Ship
extend Properties
end
This will make all functions from the Properties Module available from inside Ship .
This is how the simple notation for the property call works .
Other languages would have to resort to Inheritance for this , ie .
define the method in a class and force users to extend that .
With Mixins , the class hierarchy stays clean , and you can just mix in ( oh... that 's where the name comes from ! ) the features you need .
This means , that we can move the code in our demo code to its very own Mixin :
module Properties
def property ( sym )
# all the nice code
end
end
This is why you can do this
class Ship
extend Properties
property : direction
property : speed
end
This has the nice effect that it also records the fact that this class is using the Properties Mixin .
When reading this code , if you 're not yet familiar with this enhancement yet , just look at eithern the documentation for the Properties Mixin or look at its source .
Let 's have some fun
With the basic Property goodies in place , let 's have some fun .
The concept of Design by Contract allows you to define some constraints and invariants of your class .
Statically typed languages have a primitive version of this :
void foo( int x )
means that only int values can be passed in .
Of course ... what exactly is an int ?
Why are values in a range of 2^31 so interesting , particularly if we actually want the : speed property to accept only values in a range of 0..300 ( this ai n't your average cruise sheep ... ) .
Another way of looking at this are Gilad Bracha 's idea of Pluggable Type Systems , ie .
instead of relying on often inadequate existing type systems , simply define your own and allow to define type ranges in a more declarative way , instead of having to clutter the code with lots of if / else constructs and defensive programming .
So , why the lecture on DbC and Pluggable Type Systems ?
Well , since we 're busy extending the language , let 's add something useful , like a feature for specifying constraints on the property values .
This is where you can get creative and decide how you want this to look .
This can take a range , or any other named type .
You could also throw in some predicate
property ( : speed ) { |v| ( v >= 0 ) && ( v < 300 ) }
The implementation for this simple :
def property ( x , &predicate )
define_method ( " #{sym}= " ) do |arg|
if ( predicate )
if !predicate.call( arg )
return
end
end
instance_variable_set ( " @#{sym} " , arg )
fire_event_for(sym )
end
end
This does leave the nice side effect that the value of the property will always be in a defined range inside the class , without having to clutter the code with range , type or nil checks .
You just define all specific constraints of the property in one central space , and be done with it .
Actually , this speed constraint could be defined in a much more concise way .
This is outside the scope of this article , but as an exercise , try to implement something like this :
property : speed , in ( 0..300 )
Note that this is not legal Ruby code ( in is a Ruby keyword ) .
It 's useful to start from the way we want the code to look and then proceed to make it Ruby code .
Enjoy .
Conclusion
Of course , the latter part was not something that would get added to a Properties feature , simply because this kind of typing should be unrelated to the Property and Notification features .
But in Ruby , you can just mold the language around your needs ... this is just an example of what 's possible .
Arguments against Embedded DSLs are manifold .
Like the idea that they make code harder to read .
And it 's true .
Just like this is difficult to read : print ( x ) .
How in the world could you know what this function call does ?
Well ... you could read the documentation or peek at it 's source code .
But how is this different from the DSL implementation ?
It is n't .
The techniques used here are very simple , and every developer who does n't get scared of words such as Polymorphism or Recursive Type Realization ( or whatever 100 U$ words are popular now ) will understand them in a moment , and they make the code so much more concise , to the point and maintainable .
ITHACA , N.Y . --
Using the highest resolution radar - signal images ever made of the moon - images from the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Arecibo Telescope in Arecibo , P.R. , and the NSF's Robert C. Byrd Telescope in Green Bank , W.Va .
- planetary astronomers have found no evidence for ice in craters at the lunar south pole .
Cornell University , Smithsonian Institution and Australian scientists report the findings in the latest Nature ( Oct. 19 , 2006 ) .
" These new results do not preclude ice being present as small grains in the lunar soil based on the Lunar Prospector 's discovery of enhanced hydrogen concentrations at the lunar poles , " said Donald Campbell , Cornell professor of astronomy and a principal investigator .
" There is always the possibility that concentrated deposits exist in a few of the shadowed locations not visible to radars on Earth , but any current planning for landers or bases at the lunar poles should not count on this . "
Echoes from radar signals transmitted to the moon from the giant Arecibo telescope were received at the Green Bank telescope .
These echoes allowed scientists from Cornell , the Smithsonian Institution and the Defence Science and Technology Organization in Australia to create images , offering the best view ever of the shadowed terrain at the lunar south pole .
Since the 1960s , theories have suggested that ice may exist deep inside impact craters in permanent shadow from the sun , where temperatures on the moon 's surface do not exceed minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit ( or minus 173 Centigrade ) , at the poles .
The theory was bolstered in 1992 when Earth - based radar telescopes located " ice deposits " inside impact craters at the poles of the planet Mercury .
The Lunar Prospector orbiter discovered concentrations of hydrogen at the moon 's poles .
If this hydrogen were in the form of water molecules - still a subject of debate - then it would correspond to an average of 1 to 2 percent of water ice in the lunar soil in the shadowed terrain .
However , Earth - based radar measurements since the 1990s have consistently failed to detect ice deposits similar to those on Mercury .
Since water ice would be a significant resource for any future lunar base , many of the instruments on NASA 's 2008 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter / Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission seek to learn if water ice is present in permanently shadowed craters .
Even in the lunar summer at the south pole , the sun barely edges above the horizon , thus the bottom impact craters never see the sun .
Because of the tilt of the moon 's orbital plane relative to the Earth 's equatorial plane , the Earth can rise much higher above the horizon at the lunar south pole than the sun , so telescopes on the Earth can " see " some of the shadowed area .
However , since that area is permanently in shadow , only radar can image that terrain .
###
Donald Campbell and Jean - Luc Margot of Cornell University , Bruce Campbell and Lynn Carter of the Smithsonian Institution , and Nicholas Stacy of the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organization conducted the research .
Cornell 's National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center manages the Arecibo telescope , and the Green Bank Telescope is part of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , which is operated by Associated Universities Inc. for the NSF .
If there is anything to be learned in this life , it 's that there 's no such thing as a free lunch .
This is true even if you 're a bum and some rich guy comes up one day and buys you lunch , because he 'll probably expect to hear some of your bum tales and then he 'll go back to the office and tell everyone about how he charmed a " quaint little bum , " and before you know it , the rich guy has stolen your bum tales and is passing them off as his own .
Then someone overhears that guy and passes the tales off as their own , and so on , until one day your best homeless friend is telling you an all - too - familiar story .
Well no way , Chester , it was me who once chased Eddie Murphy down an alley , not you .
Nowhere on the Internet does this free lunch logic hold more true than at Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia anyone can edit .
Sure , it 's monetarily free , but it costs you heaps in credibility and accuracy , as well as the time spent combing over information for instances of " jason is a faggit " and other assorted such delights hidden mid-paragraph here and there .
Not to mention the incredible amount of useless information that nobody would ever need , as well as the self - important administrative body that comes complete with the wildest God complex this side of Waco .
But wait , if it sounds like I 'm hating on Wikipedia , I do n't mean to come off that way .
I love Wikipedia .
It 's by far the most entertaining open - source project to ever exist , and yes , I am counting LInux and all of the LInux User Group online photo albums it is responsible for .
You see , there are games you can play with Wikipedia .
Fun games that you can pass hours upon hours with .
I 'm not talking about hiding a clue to the supposed sexuality of your high school nemesis in the article about Lieutenant Worf .
A nondestructive Wikipedia game was invented last year by my good pals Dr. David Thorpe and Street Cactus , and I have to say that it blows that pedestrian - ass googlewhacking right out of the water .
" Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .
That 's what we 're doing . "
- Jimmy Wales , Wikipedia founder
The premise is quite simple .
First , find a useful Wikipedia article that normal people might read .
For example , the article called " Knight . "
Then , find a somehow similar article that is longer , but at the same time , useless to a very large fraction of the population .
In this case , we 'll go with " Jedi Knight . "
Open both of the links and compare the lengths of the two articles .
Compare not only that , but how well concepts are explored , and the greater professionalism with which the longer article was likely created .
Are you looking yet ?
Get a good , long look .
Yeah .
Yeeaaah , we know , but that is just the tip of the iceberg .
( We 're calling it Wikigroaning for a reason . )
The next step is to find your own article pair and share it with your friends , who will usually look for their own pairs and you end up spending a good hour or two in a groaning arms race .
The game ends after that , usually without any clear winners ... but hey , it beats doing work .
We go Wikigroaning on the SA forums from time to time and feel confident enough to share the fruits of our latest outing with the public .
We 're pretty proud of some of these .
Enjoy !

Sometimes we get these tips that come out of left field .
We got one late last night from reader Riku , who talks about his dad 's unusual acquisition for his high - end audio setup :
Hi !
My father 's hobby is to search for " the perfect sound " making him a high - end audiophile .
I was very surprised when I saw an old Playstation 1 ( Version SCPH - 1001 / 2 ) plugged into his super expensive audio rig .
He told me , that that particular version of the console has RCA - inputs in the back which has a superb sound output .
The console has become an underground sensation in the Hi-Fi scene .
He told me to check out some articles at 6 moons.com , an audiophile website .
So wait , the old beatup PS1 that I gave to my friend is a high - end audiophile machine ?
There 's no way this can be true !
Yet Riku was kind enough to provide us some links from 6 moons that talk about the power of Sony 's debut console .
In one article :
During all this audio fun , my pal Pete Riggle stopped by with an audio underground digital favorite , the Sony PlayStation 1 ( Model No. SCPH - 1001 ) .
I had heard rumors of just how good this particular version of the PS1 is when used as a CD player and was curious to give it a listen .
This kid 's video game player really does have outstanding audio performance .
I 'm guessing you 'd have to spend more than $ 6000 on a one - box CD player to equal let alone better it .
$ 6000 ?
To eBay and beyond ( the jump ) !
[ Thanks for the wonderful pic , Dyson ! ]
I 'm impressed that Sony put together such high - end parts in the PlayStation 1 that it could produce such quality sound .
Running a quick search on eBay for SCPH - 1001 brings up consoles priced at $ 5 - $ 35 , way below the $ 6000 equivalent system .
Another article provided to us says :
The Sony Playstation 1 SCPH - 1001 is another giant killer that 's a darling of the audio underground .
If you 're looking for audio sonic fireworks , the PS1 might not be your cup of tea but if you 're looking for an outstandingly musical digital front end that can play music better than just about every multi- kilobuck digital source , look no further - way recommended .
Now , I want to ask all our audiophile readers out there ( i.e. Dale North ) : what about the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 ?
Do these two later iterations of Sony 's console keep up the good work and provide a great deal for audiophiles ?
Or instead , did Sony only provide mediocre parts for your sound system ?

A cop guards the open gateway that leads from the house 's driveway to the side yard , in case the man inside attempts to flee .
At first the camera is static and the shot is simple : the cop , the gateway , vertical red fence planks , a right foreground portion of green bush .
After a few minutes of this , the cameraman starts playing with the composition .
The screen fills almost entirely with the bush , and then the view pans left from the bush to the cop , who is big and bald and has three upside - down blue V's -- sergeant stripes -- on the sleeve of his shirt .
The cameraman zooms in past the cop to the patio area beyond , to a lattice of firewood and the blur of something green .
The camera stills , focuses .
The blur becomes a wheelbarrow .
A green wheelbarrow leaning belly - exposed against a red wall .
While the shot of this particular wheelbarrow is superfluous to the television program being filmed here today and will be edited out along with most of the rest of this raw footage , there happens to be a story about the man inside the house in which a wheelbarrow plays a much more prominent role .
The story begins more than two decades ago , at a party in another house not far from this one .
The man inside was there , as were many of his friends , which meant that the attendees were a hodgepodge of the most notable lawyers and doctors and businessmen in Terrell , Texas .
Anybody compiling a list of local luminaries back then might have placed the name of the man inside at or near the top .
His high school class , of which he was president , had voted him most likely to succeed , and he had done so .
At the time of the party , not much more than a decade out of law school and still in his thirties , he was already district attorney of his home county .
The party 's host had hired a local kid named Eric Bishop to provide entertainment , and Bishop -- who would eventually change his name to Jamie Foxx and move west -- was playing old R&B covers , pounding them out on a borrowed piano .
The man inside stood near the keyboard , watching .
Watching and drinking .
A couple drinks and then a few and then who knows how many until he was well and truly lit , until he was finally a staggering mess , until he was finally so far gone that the prospect of walking home , never mind driving , was an Everest summit attempt .
And finally :
The host and another friend poured the shambling young district attorney into , yes , a wheelbarrow .
They delivered him to his home , legs and arms flopping out to the sides like the limbs of an upended turtle .
The reason people remember this story and still tell it twenty years on is that it is so remarkably uncharacteristic of the man inside .
He is a man so proper , so predictable , that when he occasionally dons a colored shirt , the modest color jolts the eyes of his friends , who are unaccustomed to seeing him in anything other than solid white .
Imagine how an episode of flagrant public drunkenness in the life of such a man might sear itself into the memories of those who witnessed it .
Twenty years later and they still laugh at the thought of him being barrowed home with a brain full of booze .
Hansen and the rest of his production team must always remain loose limbed .
The cameraman pulls back , revealing again all the ingredients at once : the bush , the cop , the wheelbarrow , the red fence .
A few seconds of this and then the view drifts upward to a chaos of tree branches against an overcast November sky .
A long view from a different camera shows the same cop in the same gateway .
More of the house is visible , along with the broad driveway .
Three voices are audible off camera .
" We should have craft services bring it in here , " the first voice says , referring to the catering truck .
The other voices laugh .
" If he 's not in there , [ inaudible ] gonna take some heavy abuse , " the second voice says .
" Oh , yeah , " says the third voice .
The third voice is exceptional .
A deep and furred rumble .
Even on the basis of just those two syllables , most would intuit that the owner of the voice is either a radio or television reporter .
Get a look at him and it's obvious he 's the latter , standing self - consciously erect , hands on narrow hips , a plumb line between the top of his head and his heels , posture and hair perfect .
It is past 3:00 p.m. and Chris Hansen , the host of " To Catch a Predator , " a recurring series on NBC's Dateline television news program , arrived here at 8:30 this morning , having gotten hardly any sleep the night before .
He never gets much sleep on these shoots .
Although aspects of his show are tightly choreographed , Hansen and the rest of his production team must always remain loose limbed , ready to adapt to changing circumstances and unpredictable hours .
The show 's protagonists , after all , are recruited on the fly , and everything depends on them .
They drive the plot , and Hansen never knows exactly where that plot is going to take him .
Before the unexpected series of events that began yesterday afternoon , for example , Hansen had no intention of ever being here , outside this house , waiting for a SWAT team on an overcast Sunday afternoon .
A crime - scene photo of Bill Conradt 's den , taken shortly after his death .
His laptop sits beside the far armchair , still on .
Police monitored it through a window to make sure Conradt did n't erase the hard drive , and later seized it as evidence .
Yesterday , at around 1:00 p.m. , a young actor named Dan Schrack leaned back against a folding table and held a tubular , bendable microphone close to his lips .
Headphones pinioned his blond Prince Valiant hairdo over his ears .
A coffee cup , a can of Diet Dr. Pepper , and a packet of Pepto - Bismol sat on the table , as did a Motorola cell phone .
The cell phone was plugged in to a recording device .
Before placing the phone in its cradle , Schrack had punched in the number of a man he knew as Wil , and now he was listening to the ringing in the headphones .
Schrack had assumed so many different identities during the last few days that he had to actually pause a few moments before in order to quiz himself on some of the vital stats of his newest alias to make sure he did n't screw anything up .
My name ?
Luke .
Age ?
Thirteen .
Family ?
Parents divorced , dad neglectful , stepdad no good .
Current location ?
In the empty home of neighbors who are paying me to walk their dogs while they 're away visiting an elderly relative .
In reality , the home he was in was not empty at all .
Far from it .
At the moment , it contained almost two dozen people .
There were cameramen and technicians and producers from Dateline .
There were people from a group called Perverted Justice .
There was Chris Hansen .
There was security : a former NYPD lieutenant and an off - duty police detective from a nearby city .
And these were only the people actually within the house .
Just outside , hidden in a moving van , there were at least a half dozen more people -- local city cops , the so - called Takedown Team -- all armed and ready to spring at a moment 's notice .
A couple of months ago , when Schrack showed up at an audition at the NBC studios in Burbank , California , he had n't really known what he was getting himself into .
He had been in Los Angeles a few years , a twenty - one - year - old whose naturally rosy cheeks and guileless smile make him appear much younger .
The biggest gig on his résumé was a Toys " R " Us commercial , and like many struggling actors , Schrack tried to squeeze in so many auditions that he did n't have time to properly research the roles he was reading for .
So though he had known that he was auditioning for Dateline , he thought Dateline was just looking to film one of those dramatic reenactments that other programs like America 's Most Wanted sometimes used .
He 'd never seen Dateline 's " To Catch a Predator " series and did n't have any idea how it worked .
A producer at the audition brought him up to speed .
The typical episode works something like this : Dateline leases a house in a small town somewhere in America and wires it for sound and video .
Members of Perverted Justice , a group to which Dateline pays a consulting fee , pose in online chat rooms as underage teens living in that small town .
If an adult man starts hitting on one of these fake kids , the Perverted Justice decoys save the transcripts of his chats .
Eventually , the man is invited over to the wired house for a liaison .
When he arrives , Chris Hansen confronts him with a printout of Perverted Justice 's chat transcripts and attempts to interview him .
As soon as he leaves the house , local cops ( the Takedown Team ) arrest him and charge him with online solicitation of a minor .
Each episode focuses on a decoy house in a single city and documents the catching of six or seven men .
Bill Conradt and his sister Patricia , and portraits of the two as children .
Schrack 's role in all of this would be as the real - life incarnation of the fake boys that Perverted Justice creates .
( An actress would be hired to portray the fake girls . )
His picture would be used in the online profiles , he would conduct any telephone or Web - cam conversations , and when the men showed up at the house , he'd be there to greet them at the door and invite them inside , usually getting a few moments of screen time before Chris Hansen makes his appearance .
A few hours after he left the Burbank audition , NBC offered him the gig : $ 5,000 per shoot , with each shoot lasting three or four days .
By this time , standing there with his headphones on , waiting for the man he knew as Wil to pick up his phone , Schrack had already wrapped two episodes and was one day away from finishing his third .
This would be his last , since the first had just aired , effectively blowing his cover .
Though he liked the money , he was n't going to miss much about working for " To Catch a Predator . "
He was n't experienced in improv , and he'd come to realize that improv was what this job amounted to .
Before making this phone call , he'd had to read the alternately mundane and smutty transcripts of all the chat sessions conducted between the Perverted Justice decoy and Wil over the last two weeks .
The transcripts gave him the parameters of the character he was playing and of his character 's relationship to Wil : Luke was a thirteen - year - old dog walker , and Wil was a nineteen - year - old college student .
Luke lived at home with his parents , who had not given him the Razr cell phone he'd asked for last Christmas , and Wil lived with a straight roommate , who had once walked in on him having sex with another man .
Luke had confessed to falling in love with Wil , and Wil had confessed that he liked young boys .
Within the broad parameters laid down in the chats , however , the actor was given conversational freedom .
His only mandate now was to entice
Wil to come visit him in the real world , at this new house about a half hour 's drive north of downtown Dallas in Murphy , Texas , a house that NBC had leased and booby - trapped for television .
The actor 's favorite roles had been in musicals .
He preferred productions like that , where every line and verse and dance step was preordained before the curtain rose , and he knew going in whether the show was a comedy or a tragedy .
Dateline 's Chris Hansen consulting with Murphy police chief Billy Myrick ( left ) and Detective Walter
" Hello ? "
" Hey , is this Wil ? "
" Yeah . "
" Hey , Wil , this is Luke ! "
" Hey !
How are you ?
Did you get the dogs walked ? "
" Yes , I did .
So what are you doing ? "
" Not anything .
Well , actually , I 'm sort of watching a football game . "
Until this last line , everything about the beginning of their conversation , both its words and its premises , was false :
The name of the man inside was not Wil , he was not nineteen , he lived alone , without a roommate , and he'd stopped being a college student more than three decades ago .
But there is reason to believe that the man inside was telling the truth about watching a football game .
He was probably referring to Texas Tech 's noontime rout of Baylor University , which Fox Sports Net was broadcasting at the time of the phone call .
He graduated from law school at Texas Tech and usually pulled for the team , though with nothing like the passion he displayed for the Longhorns of the University of Texas , his undergraduate alma mater .
He 'd been a Longhorns fan forever .
One of the precious gifts of his childhood had been a ticket to the 1964 Cotton Bowl , when the Longhorns beat Navy and seized the national championship .
His parents had swaddled the ticket in multiple layers of wrapping paper and boxes of descending sizes , a Russian doll of a present that he'd remember for the rest of his life .
Before the kickoff of Saturday 's game , the man inside had gone out for a little while :
He 'd dropped some of his white shirts off at the cleaners , he 'd shopped for groceries , he'd bought a Texas Two Step lottery ticket .
Then he had come home , where he'd probably turned on his RCA and tuned in FSN shortly before his phone rang .
As Dan Schrack leaned against a folding table and talked on the phone , a number of Perverted Justice employees sat at nearby desks , working on computers .
At some point , after Schrack hung up , some of these people ran the screen name and e-mail address and phone number of the man known as Wil through a variety of Internet search engines .
They made certain discoveries , among them Wil 's real name and occupation .
A cameraman recorded a scene shortly thereafter , when one of the Perverted Justice employees informed Chris Hansen .
He told Chris Hansen that the man they thought was nineteen was actually fifty - six , that his name was Bill Conradt , that he was not a college student but rather an assistant district attorney of a neighboring county , the county 's chief felony prosecutor .
He 'd never exposed a prosecutor before .
In the two years since the first episode of " To Catch a Predator " aired , Chris Hansen had exposed men from a variety of professions .
A doctor .
A handful of soldiers .
A couple of cops .
Teachers .
A rabbi .
A minister .
But he'd never exposed a prosecutor before .
The Perverted Justice employee rubbed his hands together , clapped them , obviously energized by the news he was imparting .
Chris Hansen 's usual on - camera listening expression -- lips tight , eyes slightly narrowed , just the hint of a furrow to his brow -- did not change .
Bill Conradt was a good prosecutor .
All of the judges and lawyers who knew him best , even the ones who served on the opposite side of the aisle from him , the men and women who defended their clients against him , say he was very good at his job .
He had a near photographic memory for the law , they say , and this made him either a formidable opponent or a valuable ally , depending on where you stood .
So Conradt no doubt knew that statute 33.021 in the Texas penal code description of the crime of " online solicitation of a minor " states that an adult offends when he " communicates in a sexually explicit manner with a minor , " and defines " minor " as anyone who represents himself or herself as being under the age of seventeen .
And yet here are some of the things Bill Conradt wrote during the two - week - long online relationship he had with thirteen - year - old " Luke " :
" could I feel your cock "
" how thick are you "
" i want to feel your cock "
" maybe you can fuck me several times "
" has anyone sucked you "
" just talking about this has me hard "
Bill Conradt , a good prosecutor , was used to straddling mires of facts and statutes and circumstances .
It is hard not to wonder what he would have made of his own case .
" Did you leave yet ? "
" No . "
" You did n't leave yet ? "
" No . "
" Are you gonna come or not ? "
Dan Schrack drenched the last line with all the petulance and neediness he could muster , so the final syllable stretched like taffy and leapt at least an octave in pitch :
Are you gonna come or nahhhhhhhttt ?
The desperation sounded genuine .
It was about 3:00 p.m. on Saturday , and this was their third conversation in as many hours .
Schrack had likely concluded their first conversation with an invitation to come visit him here at the decoy house , and Bill Conradt had accepted .
He 'd accepted and then he never showed up .
By this point , everyone in the house , including Schrack , knew Conradt 's real identity , and by this point the same question was on everyone 's mind :
Was he gonna come or not ?
" Yes , I shall , " said Conradt .
" Well when are you gonna come overrrrr ? "
" Well , a little later . "
" A little laterrrrrr ? "
" Yeah .
Is that all right ? "
" Yeah , I guessssss . "
In the edited Dateline episode , the SWAT entrance would seem dramatic , but in reality it was slow and plodding , as you can see over the next three pages .
Here , the team assembles in front of Conradt 's house .
The arrests made yesterday at the decoy house , like the arrests made the day before and the day before that , were all filmed .
The footage played out in real time on monitors in one of the rooms on the first floor .
Jimmy Patterson , an off - duty detective whom NBC was paying thirty - five dollars an hour to protect its employees in case one of the suspects got violent , had watched the first few arrests on these monitors .
Then he had stopped watching .
He knew if he kept watching , he would have to say something to somebody about all the stupid mistakes the Murphy Police Department 's " Takedown Team " was making .
Detective Patterson had worked for a suburban Dallas - metro - area police department for the last twenty - two years , had spent the last twelve of those years on SWAT , knew his tactics , knew his weapons .
And he knew that Murphy was just a small town , with a population of ten thousand , and so you could n't expect all the cops in Murphy to be as well trained as he was .
They did n't have the resources .
But still .
How hard was it to avoid a cross - fire situation ?
Because that 's what he saw on those little gray - scale monitors every time an arrest was made : cross - fire situations .
The cops on the Takedown Team would rush the suspect and surround him , guns leveled , and Detective Patterson winced when he saw it , because he knew that if those officers ever had to actually fire their weapons , well , they'd be just as likely to kill one another as the suspect .
Sometimes he'd get a view right down the barrel of a Murphy cop 's gun , a perspective straight out of Doom , courtesy of a Dateline buttonhole camera , and in the same shot he'd get a view of another cop 's back .
Not to mention that the whole intensity level of these arrests , the way the Takedown Team would holler at the suspect , the way they'd throw him to the ground , the whole idea of even having their weapons drawn in the first place , all of that struck Detective Patterson as ridiculous .
Just the other day , he'd been in a supermarket parking lot when he noticed someone who fit the description of a suspect in a bank robbery he'd been working .
He called the sergeant , told him to send over some of the boys .
And when his colleagues got there , you know how many guns were drawn , how much shouting was done ?
None .
The officers walked up , introduced themselves , asked the guy to show some ID , and that was that .
Sure , they had their holsters unsnapped , one hand near , but they did n't need to take it to the next level .
You hardly ever have to , not in the real world .
All that business -- the guns , the tackling , the shouting -- struck Detective Patterson as pure and simple TV :
It might look good on camera , but if you 're letting a camera influence how you do your takedowns , you 've got a problem .
You hardly ever have to [ take it to the next level ] , not in the real world .
All of this stuff was on Detective Jimmy Patterson 's mind when he heard people on the second floor start throwing around the name Bill Conradt .
He asked them to spell the surname .
Sure enough .
With a t .
He knew a Bill Conradt .
Had worked with him .
Bill Conradt was the chief felony prosecutor of the county that included part of Detective Patterson 's city .
Bill Conradt had prosecuted people that Detective Patterson had arrested .
Could n't be the same Bill Conradt .
Early Saturday evening , Detective Patterson asked to listen to the tapes of the telephone conversations .
The voice was familiar , but he could n't be sure .
Does he have a son ?
Sons often sound like fathers .
Anyway , a voice was n't enough .
Something like this , somebody like this , you 've gotta be extra careful .
You 're talking about law enforcement taking down law enforcement .
You 've gotta take extra precautions .
But the way things had gone these last few days , what with the overzealous made - for - TV cops outside and the real TV people here inside , Detective Patterson was n't at all sure that the necessary precautions would be taken .
As the evening wore on , Detective Patterson learned that Bill Conradt had stopped responding to Dan Schrack 's phone calls .
He 'd also stopped responding to the AOL instant messages that the Perverted Justice chat decoy was sending .
The IMs were starting to read like semiliterate poems of longing and anxiety :
i tried callin you alot
an u did n't answer :(
and i cried cuz ure so hot
At a little after 9:00 p.m. , Detective Patterson overheard Lynn Keller , the lead producer of " To Catch a Predator , " discussing Bill Conradt with another Dateline employee , trying to come up with different strategies they might employ to lure him to Murphy .
Detective Patterson was the only law - enforcement officer inside the decoy house , and at that moment , standing there listening to a couple of civilians devising ways to lure an assistant district attorney , he was beginning to feel very uncomfortable .
He felt as if he was being made party to something he was not at all sure he wanted to be involved in .
Finally he approached Keller , told her that as an officer with the Rowlett Police Department , he felt obligated to call his boss , the chief of police , and give him a heads - up regarding the whole matter brewing with Bill Conradt .
Lynn Keller stopped him cold .
" You 're working for Dateline now , " she said .
The SWAT team , marching in formation , preparing to enter Conradt 's house .
A day or two prior to the beginning of the sting operation , NBC technicians had installed a high - tech video - projection system in a room at Murphy Police Department headquarters .
Along with the projector , NBC installed all the equipment necessary to stream multiple live video and audio feeds from the decoy house a mile or so away .
The room was normally the police department 's training classroom and was usually referred to as such , but after the arrival of Dateline 's impressive array of electronics , some officers began referring to it as " NORAD " or " the War Room . "
Just around midnight on Saturday , the War Room was still busy , as it had been all day long .
The whole Dateline crew was planning to pack up and fly out tomorrow evening , yet though the operation was nearing its conclusion , new men continued to arrive at the decoy house .
Many of the Murphy detectives , whose job it would be to interrogate these men once they 'd been hauled to the station , stopped by to watch Chris Hansen interview them first , getting a real - time preview of the next episode of " To Catch a Predator . "
The chief of police , Billy Myrick , was here , too , as well as one of the chief 's lieutenants , a woman named Adana Barber .
Chief Myrick had held his current job for about a year and a half .
He 'd never been chief anywhere else but had been in law enforcement for more or less his entire adult life .
He was now forty - eight years old , a naturally burly man drifting toward middle - aged paunch .
When he applied for a job here in Murphy , the department ran a pretty comprehensive background check on him .
Most of the officers Myrick had previously worked with , in various departments around north Texas , all said pretty much the same thing :
He was a good officer but not a great leader .
When he began getting into supervisory positions , he changed , one of his former coworkers said .
" A bull in a china closet " who " blusters around " is how another put it .
" He probably should n't be in supervision but is a great officer , " the background report stated .
But shortly after Myrick started working as a cop in Murphy , the sitting chief and city manager departed , and the new city manager , who has hiring powers at the police department , promoted Myrick to chief .
On July 22 , 2006 , an officer named Kevin Carter approached Chief Myrick and told him that a group called Perverted Justice had offered the Murphy Police Department its services .
Two days later , Perverted Justice demonstrated what it could do , feeding the department information regarding an east - Texas ophthalmologist who'd been chatting with a Perverted Justice decoy .
The doctor , Perverted Justice informed the police , had set up a liaison at a Murphy convenience store .
Chief Myrick dispatched officers to the store , and sure enough , there was the doctor , waiting patiently in the front seat of his Ford Expedition , with a brand - new teddy bear .
After the cops arrested the doctor , they seized his vehicle , which became de facto city property .
Chief Myrick , who would eventually use that Ford Expedition as his ride - around vehicle , was hooked .
When Perverted Justice broached the subject of doing something more ambitious in Murphy , a " To Catch a Predator " sting operation with Dateline , he did n't hesitate .
Soon after , in early fall , he called a full departmental meeting , got all his officers together , and told them that " To Catch a Predator " was coming to town .
Not everyone in the department was sold on the idea .
One of the chief 's detectives , a man named Sam Love , stood up during that initial meeting and told the chief that the sting operation was going to generate a lot of cases , but the department would n't have the means to work them .
Detective Love said it was hard enough for the Murphy PD to handle all the homegrown cases here in Murphy without luring in who knows how many perverts from out of town .
And the Collin County District Attorney 's office , which encompassed Murphy , was n't on board , either .
A few weeks ago , Perverted Justice had faxed Collin County , notifying officials of the upcoming sting and requesting logistical and planning support .
John Roach , the district attorney , was very surprised that a civilian group , not the Murphy Police Department , was the first to inform him of the sting .
Roach directed Chris Milner , the head of his special - crimes unit , to draft a response and send it back to both Perverted Justice and Chief Myrick :
The DA 's office , the letter read , " will take no part in the planning or execution of the sting operation . . . we must take pains not to implicitly authorize or direct non-law - enforcement entities to act as our agents during law enforcement operations . . . the Collin County District Attorney 's office is in the law enforcement business , not show business . "
Roach worried that the involvement of Dateline and Perverted Justice might badly compromise the sting operation , and he hoped that his letter might serve as a wake - up call to Chief Myrick , giving the chief an out .
In the parlance of television news , they will ambush him .
But all this nay - saying aside , Chief Myrick , standing there in the War Room late on Saturday , seemed to think the operation a resounding success .
As he had told several officers , he hoped Dateline would " put Murphy on the map . "
He was in a joking mood :
Whenever a suspect pulled up in a particularly nice automobile , he would lean over to Lieutenant Adana Barber , a petite woman with short - cropped hair , and say something like , " That one 's mine ! "
At about 12:30 a.m. , according to Detective Sam Love , who was also in the War Room , Lieutenant Barber 's cell phone rang .
The conversation , recalls Love , was brief and mostly one - sided , and afterward Barber relayed a message to the chief : Chris Hansen wants the police to get an arrest warrant and a search warrant for Bill Conradt .
He and the rest of the Dateline crew have decided that since Conradt is no longer responding to IMs or answering his telephone , he is probably not going to come to the decoy house in Murphy .
Since he wo n't come to them , they 've decided to go to him .
Conradt lives in a small town called Terrell , about an hour 's drive southeast of Murphy .
Hansen plans to go to Conradt 's house the next day .
They 're hoping Conradt might have some sort of Sunday routine , might go out for coffee or something .
If he does , the Dateline crew will follow , and Chris Hansen will attempt to interview him .
In the parlance of television news , they will ambush him .
Then , if the Murphy police get the warrants , Bill Conradt will be arrested and carted away on camera .
Basically , the producers want the interview and arrest of Bill Conradt to follow the standard " To Catch a Predator " formula , despite Conradt 's evident unwillingness to visit the decoy house .
And they want the warrants ready by morning .
Approximately fifty minutes after Lieutenant Barber relayed this message , at about 1:20 a.m. , in a quieter room at the police department , Chief Myrick approached Detective Walter " Gator " Weiss .
He told him they were about to net a big fish .
A woman from Perverted Justice accompanied the chief , and she handed Gator a sheaf of papers that contained printouts of some Internet chat logs and a freshly burned compact disc that contained recordings of some telephone conversations .
The chief ordered the detective to review the material and prepare a search warrant and an arrest warrant for Bill Conradt .
And he told Gator they needed the warrants by morning .
The SWAT Team , just outside Conradt 's door .
In moments they will enter the house and make a grisly discovery .
Gator stared at his computer screen , wrestling with the assignment .
He 'd had qualms about the sting operation from the beginning , same issues that Detective Love had with it -- too many arrests , too much paperwork for a small department to handle -- but he figured that in the end , if it succeeded in taking some bad guys off the streets , they would have done some good .
He 'd been in and out of interrogation rooms for the past twenty - six hours straight , no sleep , talking with these suspects , and some of them , well , he sure would n't want them anywhere near his teenage son .
And the suspects had , after all , come to the decoy house .
That showed intent -- a willingness to take their whole mess off the Internet and into the real world .
This thing with Bill Conradt , though . . . it bothered Gator .
When the chief told Gator about Bill Conradt , the first thing Gator thought was , We can't do this alone .
This guy , he never came to the decoy house .
And this guy , he was a chief felony prosecutor .
He told the chief maybe they should call in the Rangers .
He told the chief he'd also like to call Chris Milner , the guy in charge of special crimes at the Collin County District Attorney 's office , get his advice .
Do n't worry about Chris Milner , the chief told Gator .
Just worry about getting the arrest warrant and the search warrant together tonight .
So Gator sat down at his computer and he read the transcripts and he listened to the telephone conversations and then he started putting what he read and heard into the form of an affidavit for an arrest warrant .
He wrote .
He continued writing .
He stared at the screen .
He stared at the keyboard .
He closed his eyes for a second .
He woke with a start .
Goddammit .
He 'd fallen asleep at his computer .
Just before dawn .
Pages to go .
Even in the hurry he was in , trying to push everything to the back of his mind , a bad feeling was gnawing at him , creating a bigger and bigger pit in his stomach .
Too much of a rush job .
Why do they need to get this guy so fast , right now ?
When Dateline airs the episode documenting this sting operation a few months later , Chris Hansen , narrating , will offer one explanation : " For some reason , " Hansen will explain , " [ Conradt ] abruptly stopped chatting , and Perverted Justice discovered he 'd deleted his MySpace page . "
Similarly , in a blog posting on the " To Catch a Predator " Website , Hansen will write : " We 'll never know why Conradt abruptly ended his conversations with the decoy and why he apparently started to delete material from a MySpace account , but in the eyes of law enforcement , he 'd already committed a crime .
That night , Murphy Police began the process of obtaining an arrest warrant and a search warrant for Conradt . "
And in interviews after the sting has ended , Xavier Von Erck , the head of Perverted Justice , will offer a similar account to both The New York Times and Bill O'Reilly , an account summed up on Perverted Justice 's own Website : " We began to notice that information was disappearing . . . and when we advised the police of this they chose to act . "
The implication was that the police had to get Conradt as soon as possible , since he was working posthaste to cover his tracks by deleting information from his MySpace account .
In the eyes of law enforcement , he 'd already committed a crime .
When asked this summer if Perverted Justice had saved any versions of the page that was mentioned during the broadcast , Von Erck will respond : " His MySpace is still up .
It was very blank then and it 's still very blank . "
And then Von Erck will provide a Web link .
The page will indeed still be up .
And it will show that nobody had accessed or deleted information from it since August of 2006 , three months prior to the sting operation .
Von Erck will not respond to follow - up e-mails for eleven days , at which point he will write back that " the MySpace you were linked to is just another of the profiles of his that we found afterwards . "
Neither he nor NBC nor the Murphy Police Department will produce any other evidence regarding Bill Conradt 's alleged vanishing MySpace page .
In any case , Gator had never been told about a MySpace page .
Nor had he been given any other information that made the rush for these warrants explicable to him .
He began to suspect the Murphy PD was trying to accommodate Dateline 's schedule .
If they 're not gonna call in other agencies , Gator thought , at least send the evidence to a grand - jury referral .
A confidential inquest .
Get them to look at the facts , decide if warrants are warranted .
Gator knew there was one easy way he could slow this down .
He could leave .
He could walk out the back door of the police department , drive home to his family , and sleep for a whole day .
He could quit .
He thought about it .
But that 's not what he did .
At a little before 11:00 a.m. , Gator finished writing the arrest warrant .
A local municipal judge , Cathy Haden , came to headquarters and signed it .
Chief Myrick told Gator to start in on the second warrant , the search warrant , immediately , and to radio him as soon as he'd gotten it signed .
Paramedics evacuating Bill Conradt after he has shot himself at point - blank range .
When the cops arrive at Bill Conradt 's door on Sunday afternoon , a dog starts barking somewhere inside the house .
Short , sharp , expulsions of nervous energy .
Unmistakably a small dog .
Bill Conradt has shared his home with a mini schnauzer named Lukas for the last several years .
Before that he shared it with another mini schnauzer , Bismarck .
Bismarck 's ashes sit in an urn on a mantel in the den .
His sister , Patricia , used to tease him about those ashes and his reluctance to part with them , told him to just bury Bismarck already , but then she lost her own dog and she did n't tease him about the ashes anymore after that .
A sergeant from the Terrell Police Department knocks on the door .
The Terrell sergeant is here because early this afternoon Lieutenant Barber called the chief of the Terrell PD , Todd Miller , and asked for his department 's assistance in making this arrest .
Chief Miller complied .
Along with the Terrell sergeant , a Terrell patrol officer and Murphy detective Snow Robertson are also at the door .
Chief Myrick and Lieutenant Barber are about thirty feet away , hiding behind trees .
Another man , a cameraman , is hiding behind a different tree , much closer to the door , evidently trying hard to stay out of the footage being recorded by the other NBC cameramen , perhaps for aesthetic reasons , perhaps because it is generally illegal for news cameras to be on private property without permission .
Dateline 's cast and crew outnumber the five cops here by a factor of two .
One of their cameras captures the sergeant as he presses a door buzzer that has not worked in years .
The Murphy detective then draws his gun and holds it in both hands , angling it down so it aims at a spot a foot or two in front of his feet .
The sergeant knocks again on the door , which does not lead into the house but rather into a large open courtyard .
He tries the doorknob .
He presses the useless door buzzer .
He waits .
Eventually the cameraman stops filming .
The video picks up again a few minutes later .
Chief Myrick and the Terrell sergeant are talking , facing the camera as much as each other .
Sometimes the camera zooms out a little and the back of Chris Hansen 's head enters the frame .
About twenty minutes ago , at 2:20 p.m. , Gator finally Nexteled in news of the completion of the search warrant , straight from the living room of the district judge who'd just given it his signature .
Hansen and his crew got here hours before the police did , but they never got their hoped - for chance to ambush Bill Conradt .
During the Dateline crew 's long and lonely stakeout , they did n't see much of note , though they themselves were seen and noted by many : Numerous residents phoned in suspicious - persons reports during the five hours that Dateline 's three crowded vehicles were in the area , sometimes parked in front of the neighborhood watch sign .
Actually , Hansen and his crew did notice one thing .
They saw the Sunday edition of The Dallas Morning News sitting just outside Bill Conradt 's door .
And then , the next time they looked , they did n't see it .
Which is what the chief is talking to the sergeant about .
" And I just clarified , " Chief Myrick says .
" They did n't actually see him come out .
But when they got here on surveillance , the paper was there .
And then they look up again , the paper was gone . "
" But no one 's left the residence ? " the sergeant asks .
Chief Myrick repeats the question to someone off camera .
" Yeah , " Chris Hansen answers .
He has n't seen anyone leave the residence .
" Okay , " says the sergeant .
" In view of that , and the dog 's barking , it 's evident that if there 's someone in there , they know we 're out here .
My chief says he 's more comfortable calling the tac team out and , um . . . "
" Make an entry ? " asks Chief Myrick .
" Make a forced entry , " says the sergeant .
" If it has to be like that , that 's what he wants to do . "
The decision to send in the SWAT team [ was ] " the stupidest and most unnecessary thing that I have ever heard of in law enforcement . "
Many will eventually question the decision to call in SWAT .
Ed Walton , at the time the sitting district attorney of Kaufman County , which encompasses Terrell , will label the Terrell Police Department " the most incompetent bunch of buffoons you 've ever seen " and wonder whether the decision had something to do with an embarrassing and locally well - publicized incident that took place just weeks earlier , in which the Terrell police were forced to drop charges against the prime suspects in a murder case because of what Walton calls a " bollixed " investigation .
Calling out their SWAT team for what they knew was going to be a nationally broadcast police operation was , in the opinion of Walton , " their great white hope .
You know , to try to come in and show they really were n't a bunch of lummoxes . "
When asked about the matter later , Terrell chief Todd Miller will answer , " The Conradt case was not a Terrell Police Service case , it was a Murphy Police Department case , " and refuse further comment .
Mike Minor , an attorney who has worked in Kaufman county for thirty years and was a friend of Bill Conradt 's , calls the decision to send in the SWAT team " the stupidest and most unnecessary thing that I have ever heard of in law enforcement .
If they really wanted to do the right thing , they could have waited until Bill came out .
[ Or ] they could have gone to the courthouse [ where he worked ] and arrested him .
You know , he was not like John Dillinger .
That was all for sensationalism . "
But this afternoon , on Bill Conradt 's lawn , nobody questions the decision , though one man takes pains to make clear that the decision does n't come from him : Chief Myrick splays his fingers wide , holds a hand out sternum - high and tilted slightly upward , palm down , a universal sign for abdication of responsibility .
" This is y'all 's call on that one , " he says .
Conradt 's body is loaded into an ambulance .
A few feet away from the chief , a man wearing blue jeans , an untucked olive - green button - down shirt , a brim - forward baseball cap , and a pair of big dark sunglasses says something .
Everyone here knows the man with the conspicuously incognito look as Frag , though Frag is not his real name .
All the members of Perverted Justice have fake names .
For example , the person who spent the last two weeks conducting an on - again , off - again chat - room relationship with Bill Conradt calls himself Jay Alternative , though his real name is Greg Brainer .
Ostensibly the members of Perverted Justice adopt these fake names so that the men they trap do not seek them out in the real world , but the cartoony , superherolike aspect of most of their aliases perhaps also says something about the way the members of Perverted Justice perceive themselves .
Online , Jay Alternative is a faceless crusader patrolling the dark side of the Internet .
Offline , Greg Brainer is a middle - aged man who lives in Milford , Michigan , and spends upwards of forty hours a week sitting at a computer pretending to be a sexually available boy .
Sometimes the fake names become real .
A few years ago , Phillip John Eide , the founder of Perverted Justice , legally changed his name to that of his alter ego , Xavier Von Erck .
Von Erck , formerly a computer tech - support worker , launched www.perverted-justice.com after witnessing how commonplace it was for adults to hit on children in the Portland , Oregon , chat rooms he frequented .
The Website was a sort of online equivalent of that medieval punishment , the stocks : Von Erck and other volunteers would pose as minors in chat rooms and then post and widely distribute the names , photographs , and other personal information of men that sexually solicited them .
There was no law - enforcement aspect to Perverted Justice 's early work , just a public shaming .
As Perverted Justice grew , it attracted increasing media attention .
In 2004 , Kevin Dietz , a television reporter at an NBC affiliate in Detroit , ran a piece on Perverted Justice .
Dietz was a friend of Chris Hansen 's , who saw the report and was inspired .
Dateline ran its first story on Perverted Justice in September of 2004 .
In that first report , Dateline documented how Perverted Justice decoys lured men to a house , and then Chris Hansen interviewed these men once they arrived .
But although that first episode drew high ratings , viewers complained that Dateline was not actually doing anything about the problem it was documenting and assailed local law enforcement for not arresting the men Dateline exposed .
So starting with episode three , the arrest of the suspect became an essential and always - present ingredient in the show 's formula :
It serves as the climax of every vignette .
The show 's title , after all , is not " To Catch and Release a Predator . "
Whatever wall may have once divided Dateline and the police has essentially collapsed .
Hansen and NBC News maintain that law enforcement and Dateline simply conduct " parallel investigations " that never influence each other , and that Perverted Justice creates an impermeable " wall " between the two entities .
But by this afternoon , in front of Bill Conradt 's house , whatever wall may have once divided Dateline and the police has essentially collapsed .
" You know we 've got the number , " Frag says to the cops standing on Bill Conradt 's lawn .
He points at Lynn Keller , the Dateline producer .
" If somebody wants to call in and try to talk him out . "
Neither the chief nor the sergeant nor any of the other officers on the scene have previously considered contacting Bill Conradt by phone .
They nod approvingly at the idea .
The sergeant flips open a cell phone .
Chris Hansen shuffles through a pile of papers , finds what he 's looking for , then slowly dictates ten digits .
The sergeant punches them in and settles the phone to his ear .
" Might make an easy way to resolve it , " says the chief .
Fifty - four seconds later , the sergeant hangs up .
He does n't leave a message .
Months from now , when Dateline has finished editing its raw footage , SWAT 's arrival will be dramatic .
The image on television screens will suddenly divide in three , 24 style , and the subscreens will host a confusing but portentous jumble of squad cars and body armor .
Today , in real time , SWAT 's arrival is a dull trickle .
The team leader , Ken McKeown , arrives first , strolls around the house , chooses a point of entry : a glass sliding door in the rear .
The Murphy detective , Snow Robertson , has posted himself at the door .
Through it , the detective can see a turned - on laptop screen glowing in a dark and empty room , and he 's informed Chief Myrick that he plans to bust in without waiting for SWAT if he observes Bill Conradt making a move toward his computer , so that Conradt can't destroy any evidence the computer may contain .
When the SWAT leader finishes his lap of the house , he waits across the street for the rest of his men .
Time passes .
A Dateline cameraman lingers on the branches of a sun-limned tree rising above an idle sergeant .
Eventually , SWAT is finally all here and ready .
A camera tracks them left to right as they march in slow formation across the front yard , toward the door in the gateway that leads to the side yard .
Their heads swivel in synchrony with their pace , eyes always on the house .
In the foreground of the shot , a campaign sign rises on two wire stalks from Bill Conradt 's lawn .
White letters on a red background : howard tygrett , who 's running in the upcoming election for district judge .
Four years ago , during the last election cycle , Conradt ran for that same position .
In fact , a bunch of his old campaign signs , dusty failures , sit in a pile in the closed garage that the SWAT team is now marching past .
At the time of that election , Conradt had been the district attorney of Kaufman County five times in a row , twenty - two years of service in all .
Becoming district judge seemed like the next logical step .
So when the sitting district judge announced his retirement , Bill Conradt announced he was quitting his district attorney 's post in order to pursue the position .
He campaigned hard , driving his dad's old pickup truck around the county , attending barbecues and fish fries .
And then , for the first time in his political career , he lost .
Maybe he lost for macro reasons , because he was a Democrat and his opponent was a Republican , and 2002 was a year in which a Republican wave swept through Texas , scouring away not just Bill Conradt but hundreds of other Democrats .
Maybe he lost for micro reasons , because the pastor at the Good Shepherd Episcopal Church , a church Bill Conradt had attended faithfully his entire life , a church he had served as a cross - bearing acolyte when he was a boy , had unexpectedly decided to support his opponent .
Maybe he lost because he was an unmarried middle - aged man in a rural county in Texas , and people talk .
Whatever the reasons , the loss devastated him .
He did n't work at all for about a year .
Then he went into private practice and slogged efficiently but without passion through the duties of a small - town defense lawyer .
His heart was n't in it .
He hardly ever even bothered to collect on his bills .
A CareFlite chopper then ferries his body to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas , where Conradt will be pronounced dead .
In the aftermath of what is about to happen today , some of Bill Conradt 's friends , trying to reconcile the exceedingly proper man they knew with the sordid and improper content of his chat transcripts , will reexamine their own memories , looking for signs .
Some of them will dwell on the period following the last election .
They will make oblique , tentative attempts to formulate some sort of explanation : Perhaps he lost more than an election .
Perhaps the man they knew as the epitome of restraint somehow lost , during those hard days , control of himself .
Although trying to make sense is what humans do , sometimes it is senseless .
Because four years ago , Bill Conradt fell , yes .
But then he got up , and moved on .
For proof , look no further than that campaign sign on his front lawn .
Howard Tygrett , the man whose name resides there , is the same man who beat him in the last election .
Bill Conradt is no longer wearing the ill - fitting suit of a defense lawyer .
He is again a prosecutor , and while he is now only an assistant district attorney rather than the top guy , he has told some people that he prefers it this way , prefers focusing on the cases rather than managing an office .
Just two days ago , on Friday afternoon , his best friend , Mary Gayle Ramsey , a woman he 's known forever , a fellow lawyer who helped him through the rough times following that lost election , ran into him in the hallway of the Rockwall County District Attorney 's office and they laughed and joked and talked shop like they always did .
And when they parted , he said what he always said , asked her if there was anything he could do for her , and she told him no , and he smiled , and when he walked away , she never would have guessed . . .
SWAT files through the gateway into the side yard .
Many of Bill Conradt 's neighbors , none of whom knew him well , have been gathering on their own front lawns , watching .
He 's always been friendly enough , but he 's a hell of a private guy , even though he 's got no private life at all , as far as they can tell :
This is the first time most of them can remember anyone besides the postman actually setting foot on his property .
The last SWAT officer through closes the gate behind him .
Gator slumps in the front seat of the same Ford Expedition they seized from that doctor back in July .
He 's got the signed warrant , though his weary hands had riddled it with errors , including the wrong city , county , and date .
A woman named Sandra , a Murphy animal - control officer , is at the wheel .
Sandra is driving because Gator 's too tired .
Might fall asleep behind the wheel , something he 's been known to do .
When they 're just pulling into Terrell , Gator radios , lets them know he 's almost on the scene .
Nobody responds for a minute .
Then his Nextel crackles to life .
" A tactical situation has developed , " he hears someone say , and then it goes dead , and nobody responds when he asks for clarification .
The pit in his stomach grows .
The nimblest of the SWAT members scale the low chain - link fence that encloses about a fourth of the two - acre backyard , then turn and help some of the bigger cops over , before a quick reformation under trees .
Bill Conradt 's father planted these trees : a maple , a cedar , a pear , a loblolly pine .
His father , a small - town physician who eventually became the medical director of the Texas division of Blue Cross Blue Shield , built this house .
Moved in with his wife , his young son , his younger daughter .
His children grew up here .
And eventually his wife died here .
And then , in 2000 , he died here .
And his daughter and his son decided to keep the house , and his son , who'd never married and lived alone with his mini schnauzer , sold his own house and moved here , back home , with Bismarck , who could run outside in this half - acre plot of fenced - in old cotton field .
SWAT 's slow march resumes for a few more paces , delivering them past a coiled hose , past a lawn chair , past a grill , to a glass sliding door that leads into the house .
One of the officers holds a black metal battering ram the size of a parking meter and is about to swing it .
The leader of the team stops him , pulls out a device called a Halligan bar , and uses it to lever the door until the lock busts under the pressure and the door slides open .
The SWAT team pushes through a floor - length curtain covered with a print of ducks and geese and rifles and enters a dim room .
The screen of a Sony VAIO laptop provides scant illumination .
The laptop sits in a far corner of the room , on an upside - down old - fashioned leather trash can , next to an easy chair .
Eyes adjust and flashlights flare .
This is a den .
Four easy chairs .
A couch .
A wood - paneled RCA television set .
Recessed bookshelves contain very old copies of National Geographic and Gourmet magazine and dozens of medical texts that belonged to Bill Conradt 's father .
Two old sepia - tone portraits of Bill Conradt 's parents , taken when they were children , hang in oval frames on the wall .
Among the few things in this dusty - feeling room definitely belonging to Bill Conradt , and not simply leftover belongings of his parents , is a tidy stack of books sitting on an end table by the sofa .
Atop the stack : a recently published , book - length account of the pivotal 1969 showdown between the University of Texas Longhorns and the University of Arkansas Razorbacks .
A green - and - white - checkered wool blanket puddles half on and half off the easy chair nearest the laptop , a note of dishevelment in the otherwise clutterless room .
Somebody left this chair in a hurry .
SWAT sweeps the den , then files into the next room , a dining area adjacent to the kitchen .
A crime - scene photo of Bill Conradt 's .380 Browning handgun .
" Terrell Police ! "
" Search warrant ! "
The kitchen is visible from here : wide open , with a cooking island in the middle where Bill Conradt 's mother used to prepare the recipes she gleaned from Gourmet magazine .
Conradt is a good cook himself , though the cupboards are n't as well stocked as they once were .
The team turns right , enters a large living room with floor - to - ceiling windows that would , if the shades were not drawn , look out onto the backyard .
The living room offers two paths :
Either cut through the room and to a door in the rear , or head left , down a long hallway .
Sergeant Hanks from Terrell SWAT shouts an order -- First four , follow me ! -- and heads for the door in the rear of the living room .
The remaining men , with an officer named Todd Wiley fronting them , turn left and head down the hallway .
One side of the hallway is glass .
Beyond the glass , a concrete walkway borders a rectangle of grass in the house 's interior courtyard .
On the far side of this small lawn , to the right of an American flag , the door to the front yard , the one with the busted doorbell , remains closed .
On the other side of that door : all the cameras and the neighbors and the cops wondering what 's going on here , inside .
Large plants in earthen pots line the hallway , growing so close together that the foliage brushes at the arms and legs of Todd Wiley and the men behind him .
They hold their guns square and close to their chests and march forward .
Up ahead , at the end of the hallway , an open door .
Bill Conradt steps into view .
Today he 's wearing one of his colored shirts .
Black slacks , a colored shirt , the same shock of thick fright - white hair he 's had since his thirties .
His small mouth , his wide - set eyes .
His skin still ruddy , the trace of a burn from a district - attorneys conference he attended down on South Padre Island a month ago .
He 'd stayed out on the beach so long that he'd come home with serious carnage on the tops of his feet .
The wall behind him bears a framed illustration from a book about Australian wildlife : a trio of striped kangaroos .
Conradt loves Australia .
He travels there whenever he can , as often as once a year , pure vacation time , never on business .
A friend who once accompanied him on one of his trips thinks Australia appeals to Bill Conradt so much because it is about the farthest he can get away from his hometown .
His love for the country has left its mark on his home , and also on his language .
Australian idioms creep into his speech and writing sometimes .
During his chat - room dialogues with " Luke , " for example , he sometimes typed both " good on you " and " no worries , " unusual terminology for a native Texan .
The few other decorative touches that Bill Conradt added to this house consist of framed historical memorabilia .
If he looks slightly to his right , at the wall beside the doorway that leads into the plant - lined hallway , he will see a poster - sized collection of Abraham Lincoln relics : a sliver of wood from his house , another from his law office , and a penny - sized scrap of fabric that once decorated the president 's coffin .
But Conradt is looking straight ahead .
All he sees is Officer Todd Wiley and his men behind him .
From the account Todd Wiley will write approximately two and a half hours from now : " He stepped back into dark room .
His hands came up .
I could see something shining . "
All of the officers will eventually write down their best recollection of what Bill Conradt says now , and their memories are pretty consistent .
If the testimony of at least one of the officers is perfectly accurate , then Bill Conradt says one of the following things :
" I am not gonna hurt anybody . "
" I 'm not going to hurt anyone . "
" Guys , I 'm not going to hurt anyone ! "
" I 'm not going to hurt nobody , guys . "
And , of course , that means his last words , whatever their exact phrasing , are a lie .
Although the microphones outside of Bill Conradt 's house have no trouble picking up a mini schnauzer 's barks , none record Bill Conradt 's Browning .380 handgun , which he places muzzle - first against his own temple and discharges .
The cops inside radio to the cops outside .
Lieutenant Barber enters and sees Bill Conradt lying faceup with part of the side of his head missing .
A SWAT officer is trying to put Condradt 's legs up on a large pot , to keep the blood flowing toward his vital organs .
After noting that " the scene is secure , " Lieutenant Barber goes back to the front yard to tell Chris Hansen what she 's seen .
" He shot himself , " she tells him , then explains she 's not sure exactly when he pulled the trigger , whether it was the moment he heard SWAT making entry , or later .
Chris Hansen outlines the scenario he prefers to a crew member .
" Well , I mean , there 's gonna be some controversy , " Hansen says .
" So it 's better that he did it as they were coming in , as opposed to . . . "
The noise of approaching emergency vehicles swallows the rest of his words .
The camera settles on one of the SWAT - team members standing outside the closed door of the ambulance after they load the body inside .
A middle - aged man in slacks and a sport jacket walks haltingly into the frame .
He approaches a cop , one of the Terrell officers who now swarm the lawn wrapping trees with yellow tape .
He 's asking questions , though you can't hear what they are .
The guy in the sport jacket is named Greg Shumpert .
He 's the assistant city attorney for Terrell , has known Bill Conradt for decades .
A friend .
The first friend on the scene .
And soon he 'll call other friends , mostly other lawyers , and the news will spread .
And the questions that Greg Shumpert is asking , the initial questions of what the hell is going on here , will lead to other questions .
Friends will question their memories of their friend .
Could he have done what the police say he did ?
Those transcripts .
The ghastly sordidness of it all .
It 's so hard to imagine a man who never tells a dirty joke having a such dirty mind .
Some will conclude that no , he could n't have done it .
Word will pass from friend to friend about a possible explanation .
An excuse .
Did you know that in the room where he worked on his laptop , on an ottoman not two feet from his own , he had a workbook from a conference he 'd attended back in June ?
Did you hear what the conference was about ?
The title of the workbook ?
Investigation and Prosecution of Child Sexual Abuse .
Does n't that mean something ?
Does n't that mean that he was probably working when he was typing those repulsive things ?
He was probably working on a little homegrown sting operation of his own , and then he got swept up in a larger sting operation himself .
A tragedy , this whole thing , but at least Bill Conradt was innocent .
It 's hard to imagine a man who never tells a dirty joke having a such dirty mind .
Of course the excuse does n't really make any sense -- if he was trying to catch predators , he would pose as a child , not an adult teen -- but people , even smart people , invest themselves in explanations that provide them with the least painful world to live in .
A world where their friends , their friend , the one who wears pressed white shirts and lives alone with his dog and always asks if there 's anything he can do for you , does n't , did n't , harbor unpleasant sexual fantasies .
Most of his friends wo n't even bother with this sort of speculation , will just leave the gray areas gray .
They 'll try to dwell on the good things , recount his many kindnesses :
This was a guy who , when the Longhorns played for the championship , in 2006 , had rustled up four tickets to one of the biggest Rose Bowls in history for his niece and her husband , his nephew , and his sister , even though he could n't go , since he was in Australia .
But they wo n't be able to stop wondering about his last hours .
How long did he know what was coming ?
Did he see Dateline 's vans early in the morning , like so many of his neighbors did ?
Did he realize then ?
Or did he not realize until the police arrived ?
Or even until SWAT busted in ?
When did he know for sure ?
And when did he decide what he was going to do ?
Five hundred friends of Bill Conradt will attend his memorial service a few days from now , and for a little while they 'll stop asking questions and just sit in receptive silence .
Another crime - scene photo .
The bloodstained floor shortly after Conradt 's body was removed .
What happens after a police officer arrests a suspect in Murphy , Texas , and charges him with a felony ( say , online solicitation of a minor ) is that the suspect is detained and a magistrate sets bail and then , eventually , the police send their evidence to the Collin County District Attorney 's office .
It is up to the DA 's office to decide whether to present the evidence to a grand jury for indictment or , if there is insufficient or problematic evidence , to drop the case .
The woman responsible for making the initial review of evidence is Doris Berry , one of the most experienced felony prosecutors in the 108 - person office .
In the months following today , Doris Berry will review the cases the Murphy Police Department submits to her against the twenty - three men they arrested outside Dateline 's decoy house , and she will find a variety of problems .
She will find that all of the arrests may have been illegal .
Some of the problems will be technical .
For example , in most of the cases , she will find so - called venue problems .
In order to pursue a case on an online - solicitation - of - a - minor charge , you 've got to prove that either the suspect or the victim in the case was physically present in Collin County at the time the crime was committed .
The location of the decoy house is irrelevant :
What 's important is where the chat suspect and the chat decoy were when they were actually doing their chatting .
But in sixteen of the cases that the Murphy Police Department will submit to her , Doris Berry will find it impossible to prove that either the Perverted Justice decoy or the suspect was inside Collin County when the crime was allegedly committed .
The law is the law , and you can't just wish a batch of mangled cases good .
Some of the problems will be more fundamental :
She will find that all of the arrests may have been illegal .
Under Texas law , there are only certain circumstances under which a police officer can make an arrest without a prior warrant .
But in all of these " To Catch a Predator " decoy - house arrests , it will come to light that not only was there no warrant but the police had done literally no prior investigation .
Instead , they simply camped outside the decoy house and arrested the men who emerged after receiving a prior signal from the Dateline crew inside .
The only thing Doris Berry wo n't quite be able to figure out is whether this means that Dateline had become an agent of the Murphy Police Department or whether the relationship was the other way around .
She 'll discuss this question with her boss , John Roach , the district attorney , and Roach will eventually form the opinion that " the Murphy Police Department was merely a player in the show and had no real law - enforcement position .
Other people are doing the work , and the police are just there like potted plants , to make the scenery . "
The thing is , Doris Berry is a prosecutor .
She wants to see bad guys punished .
She 's read the transcripts , which means she knows most of these men are bad and a lot of them are probably dangerous .
And if she rejects the cases , she knows what will happen : Instead of receiving the incarceration and supervision that might prevent them from someday soliciting real kids , not fake ones , they 'll receive only Dateline 's nationally televised shaming .
But the law is the law , and you can't just wish a batch of mangled cases good .
On June 1 , 2007 , seven months after the end of the sting operation , three months after Dateline airs the relevant episode of " To Catch a Predator , " the Collin County District Attorney 's office will announce that it has decided not to pursue indictments for any of the suspects Murphy police arrested outside the decoy house .
Gator arrives at the house soon after the SWAT team secures it .
He enters and hastily executes the search warrant , seizing Conradt 's Sony VAIO and a mainstream pornographic DVD called DreamBoy , as well as a bunch of other things that his sleep - deprived and shocked mind falsely thinks might have some relevance to this case , including an in - flight magazine called Red Hot and packets of imported Australian Vegemite .
Months later , Gator will learn that a forensic analysis of the laptop has verified that Bill Conradt was the person who chatted online with " Luke , " but that the computer hard drive was otherwise devoid of anything illegal or indicative of sexual predation .
Soon afterward , Gator will resign from the Murphy Police and consider never returning to law enforcement .
He will make ends meet working at a private security firm .
He will meet with a reporter in the reporter 's hotel room , recount what he did and what he did n't do , and he will start to cry and then apologize for making a fool of himself .
Of the people directly involved in the events leading up to the death of Bill Conradt , only a couple of others besides Gator will express anything close to regret .
Dan Schrack , the actor , will feel terrible , as if he is somehow responsible .
He will be at the decoy house when Frag phones in with the news .
A few minutes later , Dateline will announce that it 's shutting down the operation right away .
Schrack will be hustled to the airport early .
After he boards his flight , he will mull over his feelings that the pursuit of ratings was behind what happened today , and he will decide that he wo n't recommend auditioning for " To Catch a Predator " to his actor buddies .
It 's too real .
The search warrant for Bill Conradt 's house , executed overnight by Detective Gator Weiss .
Because of the rush job , the warrant would contain numbers errors , including the wrong city , county , and date .
District judge Mark Rusch , who signed the search warrant , wo n't necessarily feel guilt , but he 'll feel anger when he learns that Dateline was present during the arrest attempt , a possibility the affidavit had not warned him of .
He 'll call the Murphy police , rip into an officer there :
Did it ever occur to them that maybe , just maybe , an assistant DA who sees a camera crew out front and knows what he 's been up to on his own damn computer can put two and two together , and had that camera crew not been out there , maybe he 'd still be alive ?
But most of the people involved wo n't express any second thoughts at all .
( Chief Billy Myrick and Lieutenant Adana Barber will decline repeated interview requests . )
Xavier Von Erck , the founder of Perverted Justice , will say his only regret is that Bill Conradt died before he could face justice .
And Chris Hansen , during a phone interview eight months later , will say that though Conradt 's suicide was very sad , something " nobody can feel good about , " he does n't have any regrets about how things were handled in Murphy or Terrell .
He will say that the " To Catch a Predator " concept of " parallel investigations " works " pretty darn well " and that the police and Dateline are completely independent of each other : " Just like the police do n't tell me how to do the interviews , we do n't tell them how to do their business .
Aside from saying hello in the beginning , I really do n't have contact with law enforcement . "
He will deny that Dateline 's presence constituted " surveillance , " as Chief Myrick had characterized it on site , and deny that its cameramen were ever on Conradt 's property .
When asked about Frag 's actions in Terrell , he will insist that " Frag was not out there , " and then angrily suggest that the question stems from some " notion that Perverted Justice was calling the shots .
Nobody from Perverted Justice was out there .
I was there . "
It is only when it is described to Hansen what Frag was wearing that day , in detail , that he will put the phone on hold to consult with his producer , Lynn Keller ( who declined to be interviewed ) , and then come back on the line and concede he was wrong .
Similarly , he will heatedly deny that Perverted Justice or NBC personnel ever encouraged the Murphy Police Department to get warrants for Bill Conradt .
A spokeswoman for Dateline , Jenny Tartikoff , will decline to comment on the future of " To Catch a Predator " or on the show 's relationship with Perverted Justice , other than to say , " We always evaluate our news - gathering procedures before and after each broadcast . "
Among the final footage Dateline shoots today is a view of a CareFlite chopper that squats thundering in Bill Conradt 's backyard , ready to take him to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas , where the pronouncement will be made .
The shot pans from the chopper to Lieutenant Adana Barber .
She 's on her cell phone .
Although you can't hear what she 's saying because of the helicopter , it 's possible that she is on the phone with Jimmy Patterson , the off - duty detective NBC had hired to work security .
Detective Patterson will later recall that it was at about this time that he called Lieutenant Barber .
He knew Lieutenant Barber because she used to work at his department , in Rowlett .
Detective Patterson had left the decoy house , was on his way out of the neighborhood , and had just noticed two Murphy Police Department squad cars pulling in behind him , lights flashing .
He was in his black Ford F - 150 pickup truck .
Dateline had earlier advised the Murphy Police Department Takedown
Team that one of the suspects scheduled to come to the house that day owned a black Ford F - 150 pickup .
Detective Patterson tells Lieutenant Barber that the Murphy Police are pulling him over for some reason .
" Jimmy , you look like a pervert ! " she says , laughing .
He tells Lieutenant Barber that several Murphy police officers have surrounded his truck .
" Your guys are pointing guns at me , " he tells her .
" You can take them ! " Lieutenant Barber responds , still laughing .
The cops have yanked the F - 150's door open and are now trying to physically haul Detective Patterson out of his vehicle .
" Tell your people to get their fucking guns out of my face , " he says to Lieutenant Barber , and then drops his cell phone .
Eventually , a few minutes after the cops push Detective Patterson against his truck and handcuff him , the misunderstanding is resolved .
A man should take stock of the history of the desires he 's never acted on , and whether he should ever have to defend that history in court , or see it detailed on television .
But the larger questions provoked by the last few days remain .
Is it possible that Bill Conradt , an adult pretending to be a teenager , might have suspected , correctly , that " Luke " was also an adult pretending ?
Yes : Everybody knows that the Internet is a swamp of false identities .
And is there any evidence that Conradt had ever acted on the longings that his chats illuminated ?
On the contrary , he chose not to when presented with the opportunity .
Was it morally wrong for Bill Conradt to engage in online sex chats with an apparent child ?
Of course .
But did his actions merit the response to them ?
Before answering this question , a man should take stock of the history of the desires he 's never acted on , and whether he should ever have to defend that history in court , or see it detailed on television .
Other questions may be answered in court .
Patricia Conradt will say she plans to file a wrongful - death lawsuit , seeking $ 100 million , against NBC .
Her lawyer , Bruce Baron , will explain that although this suit will not preclude suits against Perverted Justice and the cities of Murphy and Terrell , they plan to go after NBC first because " when you want to knock something like this out of our society , you knock it out from the head , not the legs .
NBC is using everyone , including the police , to act as buffers , to do what they themselves can't ethically do as journalists . "
And further questions may be answered in the wake of another lawsuit , one that a former " To Catch a Predator " producer will file in May of 2007 , claiming she was wrongfully terminated after she complained about an unethical level of collaboration between Dateline , local police , and Perverted Justice .
After ending her cell - phone call , Lieutenant Barber looks at the camera .
She asks the cameraman a question , speaking loudly enough to be heard above the rumble and whine of the rotors .
Although the events of the last couple of days provoke a lot of questions , perhaps the one Lieutenant Barber now asks is the most pertinent .
When law enforcement and television entertainment have commingled so completely and so lethally , perhaps there is really only one question left that matters at all .
" We having fun ? "
She asks the question , she smiles wide , and then she relays an update Frag gave her a little while ago , something about a three - hundred - pounder nabbed back at the decoy house .
A few minutes later , the tape ends and the screen goes blank .

In March , an aspiring Republican presidential couple -- Rudolph W. and Judith Nathan Giuliani -- appeared in a fashion layout in Harper ’s Bazaar that accompanied an interview with Mrs. Giuliani .
The most striking thing about the feature , a coming - out of sorts for Judith Giuliani , was their pose .
Sitting on the arm of her husband ’s chair , eyes closed , she tipped her head down , caressed his face and planted a kiss that looked like a precursor to something steamier .
“ Rudy ’s a very , very romantic guy , ” Judith Giuliani told the magazine .
“ We love watching ‘ Sleepless in Seattle . ’
Can you imagine my big testosteronefactor husband doing that ? ”
A couple of months later , after seeing a photograph of presumed presidential hopeful Fred Thompson ’s much younger wife , Jeri Kehn Thompson , in a low - cut gown that would be modest on a Hollywood red carpet but could be shocking at a Washington social event , MSNBC talk show host Joe Scarborough quipped , “ Do you think -- think she works the pole ? ”
( He had been discussing women who use stripper poles in their exercise routines . )

Not long after that , Cindy McCain , wife of presidential candidate Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , gave Fox News talk show host Greta Van Susteren a tour of the couple ’s new Phoenix condo .
Mrs. McCain wore a pink blouse with a plunging neckline , and heavy makeup that would not have been out of place at a black - tie event .
In this long , hot campaign season , intimations of sexuality are sprouting like wildflowers along the road to the White House .
Not that the commingling of sex and politics is anything new , but for what seems to be the first time in memory , voters are being confronted with questions that do n’t usually break the surface :
Just how sexy is a first lady allowed to be ?
And what constitutes an appropriate display of affection between candidates and their spouses ?
With a nominating field full of older men and younger wives , experts say that a youthful , even sexy wife offers a none - too - subtle message about the vitality of the candidate .
Not since Al Gore ’s ostentatious lip lock with Tipper at the 2000 Democratic National Convention has sexuality - as - strategy raised its head in quite so insistent a fashion .

“ What ’s going on reflects what ’s happening in the larger culture , a culture increasingly focused on young , attractive women and blatant sexuality , on display for all to appreciate , ” said Elizabeth Sherman , a political sociologist and Democrat who is married to former Republican Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma .
“ The candidate ’s wife is a strategic asset .
How are you going to deploy that asset ? ”
Though voters may profess to evaluate candidates on their policies , Scarborough ’s racy comment revealed an attitude that , for better or worse , is always simmering .
“ Sexuality has this unconscious power , ” said Pepper Schwartz , a University of Washington sociologist who believes that the looks and interactions of political couples send powerful messages .
“ It goes past the rational brain and goes into the emotional circuit .
It ’s one of those visceral things where voters say one thing and think another . ”
Schwartz said that although older women might be put off by the May - December aspect of some of these marriages , younger men might be impressed .
“ The men say , ‘ What a guy ! ’ and women say , ‘ What an ego ! ’ ”

For the record , Thompson is 24 years older than Jeri .
She is a political professional who has worked for the Republican National Committee and as a media consultant for a Washington law firm .
McCain is 18 years older than Cindy , Giuliani 11 years older than Judith .
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , a Democratic hopeful , is 18 years older than his wife , Jackie .
The prize for greatest age gap , however , goes to Democratic contender Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio , who is 31 years older than his 29 - year - old wife , Elizabeth .
As often is the case in a campaign , let alone a marriage , it is hard to tell when spontaneity ends and calculation begins .
Public displays of affection are no exception .
Robert Watson , director of American studies at Lynn University in Florida , recalled that when President George H.W. Bush had sagging poll numbers during his 1992 reelection campaign , his advisors begged him to show some affection to his popular wife , Barbara , on the trail .
Advertisement
“ He just would n’t do it , ” Watson said .
“ He had that cold Yankee demeanor . ”
( And we all know how the election turned out : America went with the guy who held hands with his wife on national TV as he admitted he ’d “ caused pain ” in his marriage . )
In 1998 , when President Clinton ’s affair with Monica S. Lewinsky was about to drive the nation into a paroxysm of partisanship and eventually , impeachment , the Clintons were photographed , paparazzi - style , on a beach in the Virgin Islands , in bathing suits , waltzing together on the sand .
It was an apparently tender marital moment , and because he was preparing to be deposed in Paula Jones ’ sexual harassment lawsuit , many believed it was not spontaneous .
Advertisement
“ That will live in my gallery of infamy , ” said social critic Camille Paglia , convinced the moment was fake .
( Nor was there any question about what George W. Bush , then Texas governor , was referring to when he campaigned on a pledge to restore “ honor and dignity ” to the White House . )
Some believe there is a calculated quality to the touchy - feelyness of couples like the Giulianis .
The former New York mayor and his wife need to present a solid , loving front to the world because they are each on their third marriage and he engaged in an affair with her while still married to his second wife , Donna Hanover .
“ I think it ’s a very ostentatious , egregious and rather offensive appeal to women voters , and I think it ’s condescending and actually off the mark , ” said Paglia , a professor of humanities and media studies at Philadelphia ’s University of the Arts .
“ I feel the great majority of women voters do n’t like to see a woman with her hands and lips all over her man . ”
Giuliani spokesman Michael McKeon disputed whether anything was calculated about the Harper ’s Bazaar photograph .
“ That was more of a spontaneous thing than anything else , ” he said .
“ It was just a reflection of them and their relationship , and of the moment . ”
Advertisement
Thompson , who was single for 17 years after his divorce and who had a rich dating life between marriages , nevertheless does not have Giuliani ’s kind of relationship baggage .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , a Republican who has been running third in national polls behind Giuliani and the undeclared Thompson , has been married for nearly four decades to his high school sweetheart , Ann , a fact the Romneys tout on the campaign trail .
Richard Land , a politically influential evangelical Christian , sees nothing improper about husbands and wives displaying affection for each other .
( “ I certainly liked Al kissing Tipper rather than an intern , ” he said . )
But he was offended by the photo of Giulianis ’ embrace .
“ If I were Rudy Giuliani and I were in my third marriage and my third wife was the woman I was committing adultery with when I was cheating on my second wife , I would probably avoid public displays of affection , ” said Land , president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , the public policy entity of the Southern Baptist Convention .
“ Most evangelicals have had their families touched by divorce , but what matters is the number and the circumstances . ”

McKeon countered : “ How can you criticize a couple for being affectionate toward each other ?
You have to be sort of a jaded person to go there . ”
The Clintons are a singular case , say observers .
Land lauded Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who is now a New York senator and Democratic presidential contender -- for staying in her marriage , but Schwartz said the couple had to be careful how they related to each other in public .
“ I genuinely believe they like and respect each other , ” she said , “ but the sexual part has been complex , to say the least .
I would tell them to be warm and respectful , and do n’t pretend you are the love affair of the century . ”
Recently , the Washington Post ’s fashion critic , Robin Givhan , stirred the ire of the Hillary Clinton camp ( and provided a peg for a fundraising pitch ) when she noted that Clinton had worn a lower - than - usual neckline to make a Senate speech .
Though Clinton was hardly displaying what one would call cleavage , Givhan wrote that “ there was the sense that you were catching a surreptitious glimpse at something private . ”
The blogosphere and talk shows ate it up .

When Barack and Michelle Obama were on the cover of Ebony ’s February issue , their pose , while close , hewed to the traditional vision of a president and first lady .
She stood behind the candidate , in the support role , her arms around his shoulders .
His arms were at his side .
And yet Sen. Obama ( D - Ill. ) has become a sex symbol himself .
In a much viewed Internet video , “ I Got a Crush ... on Obama , ” a young woman -- “ Obama Girl ” -- sings about her unrequited love for the candidate .
She poses in a bathing suit next to a widely published photograph of him frolicking in the surf during a Hawaiian vacation last Christmas .
“ The video cuts both ways , ” said psychologist Drew Westen , who is advising Democrats on language and imagery .
“ On the one hand , it turns Obama into even more of a rock star than he is .
“ But on another , it activates all the stereotypes of the sexualized black man who wants to be with white women , or in this case , a woman of ambiguous race , which the Republicans used against Harold Ford in Tennessee just a few months ago .
It also has overtones of phone sex with Monica Lewinsky .
I would be surprised if Michelle Obama enjoyed it . ”
Advertisement
( Ford , a black Democrat , lost his Senate race to Bob Corker , who is white .
A Republican National Committee ad featured a white woman saying , “ I met Harold at the Playboy party ....
Harold , call me ! ” )
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the campaign did n’t have a response to the Obama Girl video .
“ Supporters show their support in all sorts of ways , ” he said .
“ But ultimately people are paying attention to the more important things in their lives , and what Obama has to say about issues like ending the war in Iraq . ”
Maybe .
But in a world obsessed with appearance and sexuality , even presidential campaigns are offering something to sate our national appetite for the superficial .
To paraphrase the old Jell - O campaign , there ’s always room for cleavage .
Politics experts often say that a candidate ’s spouse is a negligible factor in helping voters choose a president .
But that may be changing , said Sherman .
“ A candidate ’s spouse has to be a positive enhancement .
If not , at least do no harm .
The way things are sliced today , 1 % here , 2 % there can make a big difference .
One false move can destroy your whole campaign . ”

Infoq first asked Castelein to describe how Azul 's appliances work :
The capacity of the compute appliances is accessed using a new deployment model called network attached processing .
An existing application is hosted on a traditional server , which can be Sun / Solaris , x86 / Linux , PA - RISC / HP - UX , or POWER / AIX .
The conventional JVM on that system is replaced with the Azul JVM , a fully compliant JVM implementation .
The Azul JVM is implemented in software and loaded on the conventional server .
Upon application launch , the bytecode - including the VM bytecode and the application 's Java bytecode - are ported over a standard Gigabit Ethernet network to execute on the compute appliance .
The application 's configuration , I/O , and files remain hosted on the conventional server .
But the Java application and VM reside in the compute appliance 's memory and are executed on the compute appliance .
The main benefits of this approach are the following :
No changes required to the application .
The application still behaves as though it was hosted on the conventional server , and it accesses the capacity of the compute appliance transparently .
The only change required is to launch the application on the Azul JVM as opposed to the conventional JVM
The application has access to a lot more capacity .
Typically each JVM is able to achieve 10X or greater scalability once executing on the compute appliance
The compute appliances are able to run multiple applications simultaneously .
In that sense they constitute a large pool of virtual compute capacity .
Each application remains isolated on its own dedicated server and OS instance but accesses shared capacity of the compute appliances over the network
InfoQ also asked about support for multiple versions of Java , and Castelein replied that the new appliances supported different versions of Java , and also different applications running on the appliance at the same time .
InfoQ also inquired about Java - based libraries and APIs such as J2EE , and Castelein said that because all of the bytecode was transported over the network to the Azul appliances , nothing was needed to support these APIs and they functioned transparently .
However , technology - related releases are not the only thing Azul has been in the news for lately , however - they took Sun to court in March 2006 , claiming that Sun had been threatening to sue them over infringement of Sun patents .
Sun responded with a counter - suit claiming that Azul had infringed upon several Sun patents , and the two companies settled out of court last month after agreeing to undisclosed terms .
Remember this post ?
I ’m doing it again .
I once said that your choice of a web browser reveals something about your personality .
Same can be said about the choice of your preferred text editor .
Tell me what is the default editor on your system , and I will tell you what kind of person you are .
Vim or Vi
You are a minimalist at heart , but you value raw power of a sophisticated , and yet simple editor .
You hate to waste key strokes .
You laugh derisively at the fools fighting with their silly Notepad like editors .
You either use a traditional unix keyboard or you switched around Ctrl and Caps Lock so that they are in their popper places .
Chances are that you might be ( or have been ) a sysadmin .
You think that Emacs is not a text editor , but a fucking operating system with a built in kitchen sink , and a circus tent .
You might as well use an IDE .
Emacs
Your choice of text editor was simple .
You wanted the most powerful , and most extensible editor on Earth .
And you can write a formal mathematical proof that Emacs is that editor .
You are a lisp hacker and you are not afraid to use it .
In fact , when you watched Matrix you were disappointed that the streaming code on the screens was not lisp .
You still think that the back - end and AI of the Matrix is done in that language .
You might have ( or are working towards ) a PHD .
Pico or Nano
As everyone knows , Pico is an acronym which stands for “ I ca n’t figure out vi and Emacs is crazy ” .
You do try to be as hard - core as your Vi and Emac ’s friends but you just can’t deal with their funky editors .
You are ok trading off all their power for familiar simplicity because you do n’t need advanced features .
All you need is a working text editor .
And Pico / Nano is just that .
No frills , no bells , no whistles .
Just rock solid functionality .
You think that people who put time and effort into “ mastering ” a text editor have way to much time on their hands .
It is very likely that you are using Pine for your email .
Pine of course stands for “ ca n’t figure out Mutt ” .
Notepad
It actually never occurred to you to try a different text editor .
Notepad was always there , and you never needed more .
All the extra features in the other editors are just making them slower and harder to use .
Notepad does what it was designed to do , and does n’t get in your way .
Gedit
You are a bit like the Notepad user , but you use Ubuntu or Fedora instead of Windows .
Gedit is the default , and that ’s what you use .
It is completely sufficient for editing small config files , and you never really needed stuff like syntax highlighting .
It never occurred to you that you could use anything else .
The KDE practice of starting names of all their applications with k annoys you .
Microsoft Word
Microsoft
Word is not a text editor .
You should not be allowed near a computer .
In fact you are the cancer that is killing the internet .
Kill yourself .
Kate
You are a hard code KDE user .
Kate is not only a robust editor with syntax highlighting – it is also a fully functional KDE component .
This means that you can use it to edit files on remote servers in place by simply using the fish :// or sftp:// protocol in the file dialog .
Because of this you would n’t change this editor for any other .
In fact , almost every single application that you use on daily basis starts with a K : kontact , kmail , koffice , kopete , kdevelop , konqueror , konsole and etc. .
You try to use as few non KDE apps as possible .
GTK applications piss you off because they clash with your interface , use counter - intuitive file dialogs , and look awkward and unpolished .
Ed
Ed is the standard text editor .
Enough said .
You are in fact , too fucking awesome for this article .
You have yet to meet a person who would be worth your respect .
Every person you ever worked with was a fucking clueless n00b .
You are a BOFH and proud of it .
On the systems you administrate you symlink vi , emacs and nano to ed just to watch the lusers squirm in their seats and hit Ctrl +C repeatedly .
You are likely to have a big bushy beard , and are probably wearing a T - shirt with a cryptic joke that only people with unix background will understand .
Notepad2 , Notepad ++ and etc..
You like the simplicity of Notepad , but you wanted a bit more .
Not to much – just some syntax highlighting and maybe having line numbers displayed on the margin .
You do use the editor to write some code , but you like to keep it simple .
You are not a Linux user so you have no clue what that whole Emacs vs Vi thing is all about .
You also hate IDE ’s – they are bloated and get in the way of doing your work .
Simplicity is your mantra .
TextMate
You tried many different text editors .
You could never get a hang of vi and Emacs .
You think it ’s a bit crazy to spend time and effort learning how to use them .
You were dissatisfied with every single editor on the market .
They were either to difficult to use , to simplistic , or too bloated .
Then you found TextMate and it felt like an extension of your body .
It did for text editing what OSX did for operating systems .
You love this editor so much , that you actually do n’t mind it ’s not free .
For you it ’s worth every penny .
You do n’t mind being the only guy in your town who actually paid for a text editir .
You are a smug Mac user , and proud of it .
You have recurring fantasies in which you strangle Justin Long with you Mighty Mouse cord .
Cream
You love vim but you ca n’t deal with it ’s sharp learning curve , and funky key bindings .
So you took the easy way out , and got the best of both worlds – the power of Vim , and standard key bindings for the most common functions .
When hanging out with your Vim buddies you usually forget to tell them about this and act as if you were using the real thing .
Because in essence you are .
Your version just has the added key bindings .
You would be embarrassed if anyone found out abut it though .
SciTe
Your text editor is lightweight , full featured , extensible and cross platform .
In addition , it can work as a stand - alone executable which requires no installation .
Fits perfectly with all your other portable tools on your USB thumb drive .
You also love how SciTE let ’s you write Lua scripts to extend it ’s functionality .
You take your text editor choice very seriously .
You like tinkering , and minimalistic , portable applications .
TextPad or EditPlus
You use your editor for programming .
What you want is something like a mini IDE with the ability to launch compilers from within the editor , and capture their output , but without the bloat .
You value simplicity .
Scite was to funky to you , and choices like Notepad2 were bit too basic .
Your current editor has everything that you can need , and you probably wo n’t ever need more .
You suffer from a common affliction known as IDE phobia .
Whenever you want to make yourself puke all you have to do is to just imagine working in Visual Studio and / or Eclipse .
You think that all the Vi and Emacs people are even more crazy than the poor misguided souls who use IDE’s .
Joe
Jey , 1987 called and they want their Word Star key bindings back !
Edit
You are one of the last representatives of the dying breed of MS DOS enthusiasts .
You are master at batch scripting , and you wrote dozens of scripts , and small applications to streamline your work on Windows .
You are one of the last few people who knows how to squeeze out every bit of functionality out of cmd.exe .
You are to windows what a hard - core vi/ed user is to unix .
You know almost all there is to know about windows , and all your systems run blazing fast and efficiently .
You strip all your windows installations down to their bare bones , move around important files , and optimize everything .
You think that Windows 2000 was the best OS that came out from Microsoft .
You run a mix of win NT , win95-98 and win2 k boxes at home but you do n’t own Windows XP .
Vista scares you .
It signifies an end of an era and a sad victory of bloat and eye candy over simplicity and functionality .
Q10
You are one of those smug assholes who thinks it is hip , cool and retro to use a full screen editor .
“ Uh , oh !
I ’m a big time writer .
I ca n’t be distracted by a taskbar and a clock when I write . ”
Give me a break .
You probably also use words like blogosphere and blogerati and consider yourself a journalist .
Sigh …
—
That ’s all I have for now .
Feel free to “ remind me ” about your favorite editor that I omitted in the comments .
Also please note that this is all good natured humor .
So feel free to complain that judging people by their text editor is stupid , shallow and etc .
But that just means you are not getting it and you will be laughed at .
A Wal - Mart store sign as seen in Niles , Illinois , November 24 , 2006 .
The Wal - Mart Stores Inc. worker fired last month for intercepting a reporter 's phone calls says he was part of a larger , sophisticated surveillance operation that included snooping not only on employees , but also on critics , stockholders and the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. , The Wall Street Journal reported .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Wal - Mart Stores Inc. worker fired last month for intercepting a reporter ’s phone calls says he was part of a larger , sophisticated surveillance operation that included snooping not only on employees , but also on critics , stockholders and the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. , The Wall Street Journal reported .
As part of the surveillance , the retailer last year had a long - haired employee infiltrate an anti-Wal - Mart group to determine if it planned protests at the company ’s annual meeting , according to Bruce Gabbard , the fired security worker , the Journal said .
The company also deployed cutting - edge monitoring systems made by a supplier to the Defense Department that allowed it to capture and record the actions of anyone connected to its global computer network , the Journal said .
The company fired Gabbard , a 19 - year employee , last month for unauthorized recording of calls to and from a New York Times reporter and for intercepting pager messages .
Wal - Mart conducted an internal investigation of Gabbard and his group ’s activities , fired his supervisor and demoted a vice president over the group .
Gabbard said in the Journal that he recorded the calls on his own because he felt pressured to stop embarrassing leaks .
But he said in the Journal that most of his spying activities were sanctioned by superiors .
A company spokeswoman , Sarah Clark , characterized its security operations as normal .
“ Like most major corporations , it is our corporate responsibility to have systems in place , including software systems , to monitor threats to our network and our intellectual property so we can protect our sensitive business information , ” she said in the Journal .
“ It is also standard practice to provide physical and information security for our corporate events and for our board of directors and senior executives . ”
For some reason , amazon.ca has Lisp in Small Pieces by Christian Queinnec for CDN$ 3.95 .
A guy I know ordered it and he reports it 's a full , normal copy .
I think LiSP is a very nice book , so if you were deterred by the price ( other stores have it for between US$ 50 and US $ 100 ) , this is a good way to get a cheap copy .
update Apparently people are taking advantage :
Lisp in Small Pieces is currently # 4 # 2 # 1 on Amazon.ca's top selling books list .
( This is cool news , but my excitement was dampened when a little Amazonian bird told me amazon.com does more business in 30 minutes than amazon.
ca does all day .
But still !
LiSP is big in Canada ! )
A Neat Problem
Here ’s a neat game , with a really neat solution .
I ’ll post the solution later , but this post shows a Haskell implementation of the game .
I first encountered this game as a puzzle in a game ( an otherwise unremarkable one ) called Keepsake by The Adventure Company .
The game looks like this .
There are five displays , which display the letters A through E .
The letters cycle through that sequence , wrapping back to A at the end .
There are also five buttons , which are numbered 1 through 5 .
Each of the button changes each display my some random amount ( from zero to four steps forward ) .
Pressing a button five times consecutively will always get things back to where they were before it was pressed .
The goal is to get from the ( randomly chosen ) starting point to the ( randomly chosen ) ending point .
For example , if the starting point were ABCDE , the target were EDBDE , and button 3 advanced the first and third dials by two and the second by 1 ( what I ’ll call a “ signature ” of [ 2 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ] ) , then the correct answer could be obtained by pushing button 3 twice .
The first press would change it to CCEDE , and the second to EDBDE ( because the third dial wraps ) .
module Main where import Control .
Monad ( replicateM ) import System .
Random import System .
IO
Three fundamental pieces of information are used to define instances of this problem .
There is a starting display , a target display , and the actions of each of the five buttons .
The program chooses random values for these three , prints the target , and then starts processing moves by the user .
main :: IO ( ) main = do mat <- buildMat disp <- replicateM 5 $ randomRIO ( ' A ' , ' E ' ) tgt <- replicateM 5 $ randomRIO ( ' A ' , ' E ' ) putStrLn $ " Target = " ++ tgt continue mat disp tgt
The actions of each of the five buttons are represented in a matrix of sorts .
Each button has a row in the matrix ; and the columns represent the effect on each of the letters in the display .
type Matrix = [ [ Int ] ]
Random values for the matrix are chosen as follows .
randomMat :: IO Matrix randomMat = replicateM 5 $ replicateM 5 $ randomRIO ( 0 , 4 )
There is one quirk , though .
We want the problem to have a solution .
Clearly there are some random matrices for which the problem has no solution .
( For a trivial example , imagine a matrix of all zeros ; then it ’s impossible to change the display . )
It turns out that , for reasons I will explain when I post the solution , it is sufficient for the matrix to have a non-zero ( mod 5 ) determinant .
So here ’s the code to calculate the determinant ( by cofactor expansion along the first column )
det :: Matrix ->
Int det mat | length mat == 1 = head ( head mat ) | otherwise = sum $ map det ' [ 0 .. length mat - 1 ] where det ' n = let x = head ( mat !!
n ) submat = map tail ( take n mat ++ drop ( n + 1 ) mat ) sign = if n ` mod ` 2 == 0 then 1 else - 1 in x * sign * det submat
The choice of a matrix , then , is performed by continuing to generate matrices until we find one with a non-zero ( mod 5 ) determinant .
buildMat :: IO Matrix buildMat = do m <- randomMat if det m ` mod ` 5 == 0 then build Mat else return m
Once the problem is generated , the next step is to keep asking for which button to press until the user accomplishes the goal .
continue :: [ [ Int ] ] -> [ Char ] -> [ Char ] -> IO ( ) continue mat disp tgt | disp == tgt = do putStrLn " Congratulations !
You win . " | otherwise = do putStrLn disp putStr " Enter 1 through 5 : " hFlush stdout s <- getLine let n = read s let disp ' = apply mat ( n - 1 ) disp continue mat disp ' tgt
Only two more functions are needed .
First , apply takes the matrix and a button number , and calculates the result of pressing that button .
apply :: Matrix -> Int -> [ Char ] -> [ Char ] apply mat n vals = zipWith ( $ ) ( map add ( mat !! n ) ) vals
Finally , the add function rotates a single letter of the display by a given amount .
add :: Int -> Char ->
Char add n s = iterate nxt s !!
n where nxt ' A ' = ' B ' ; nxt ' B ' = ' C ' nxt ' C ' = ' D ' ; nxt ' D ' = ' E ' nxt ' E ' = 'A '
Putting all of this together gives an implementation of the puzzle .
The puzzle can be fun to play with , but there ’s also a neat straight - forward mathematical technique for finding the solution , which I ’ll post in a few days .
Until then , have fun !
Starting yesterday , the Washington Post began running a four - part series on the Vice - Presidency of Dick Cheney , during which we have seen the role of the Vice - President increase in behind - the - scenes power to an extent never before seen in American history .
The first two articles have focused on Cheney ’s role in the War in Iraq and the War on Terror and they have been , to say the least , revealing :
Yesterday , for example , we learned the extent to which Cheney has created a back channel to the President that allows him to bypass most of the President ’s senior advisers and cabinet members when he wants to promote his agenda :
Just past the Oval Office , in the private dining room overlooking the South Lawn , Vice President Cheney joined President Bush at a round parquet table they shared once a week .
Cheney brought a four - page text , written in strict secrecy by his lawyer .
He carried it back out with him after lunch .
In less than an hour , the document traversed a West Wing circuit that gave its words the power of command .
It changed hands four times , according to witnesses , with emphatic instructions to bypass staff review .
When it returned to the Oval Office , in a blue portfolio embossed with the presidential seal , Bush pulled a felt - tip pen from his pocket and signed without sitting down .
Almost no one else had seen the text .
Cheney ’s proposal had become a military order from the commander in chief .
Foreign terrorism suspects held by the United States were stripped of access to any court — civilian or military , domestic or foreign .
They could be confined indefinitely without charges and would be tried , if at all , in closed “ military commissions . ”
“ What the hell just happened ? ” Secretary of State Colin L. Powell demanded , a witness said , when CNN announced the order that evening , Nov. 13 , 2001 .
National security adviser Condoleezza Rice , incensed , sent an aide to find out .
Even witnesses to the Oval Office signing said they did not know the vice president had played any part .
The episode was a defining moment in Cheney ’s tenure as the 46th vice president of the United States , a post the Constitution left all but devoid of formal authority .
“ Angler , ” as the Secret Service code - named him , has approached the levers of power obliquely , skirting orderly lines of debate he once enforced as chief of staff to President Gerald R. Ford .
He has battled a bureaucracy he saw as hostile , using intimate knowledge of its terrain .
He has empowered aides to fight above their rank , taking on roles reserved in other times for a White House counsel or national security adviser .
And he has found a ready patron in George W. Bush for edge - of - the - envelope views on executive supremacy that previous presidents did not assert .
What is even more interesting is this exchange between former Vice - President Dan Quayle and Cheney shortly after Inauguration Day in 2001 :
“ I said , ‘ Dick , you know , you ’re going to be doing a lot of this international traveling , you ’re going to be doing all this political fundraising . . . you ’ll be going to the funerals , ’ ” Quayle said in an interview earlier this year .
“ I mean , this is what vice presidents do .
I said , ‘ We ’ve all done it . ’ ” Cheney “ got that little smile , ” Quayle said , and replied , “ I have a different understanding with the president . ”
“ He had the understanding with President Bush that he would be — I ’m just going to use the word ‘ surrogate chief of staff , ’ ” said Quayle , whose membership on the Defense Policy Board gave him regular occasion to see Cheney privately over the following four years .
The obvious implication of that statement , of course , is that Cheney had an agreement with Bush in 2000 when he agreed to stand as the VP running mate .
What the details of that agreement are is unclear , but that manner in which Cheney has acted as Vice President give the implication that Cheney asked for , and received , a much greater role in Administration policy making than any Vice - President had ever had .
The last time anything resembling that happened was in 1980 when Gerald Ford put similar conditions on becoming Ronald Reagan ’s running mate .
Reagan , of course , turned down the offer .
The biggest Cheney ’s assertion of Vice - Presidential power is n’t so much that it was done —- the Constitution is silent on the powers of the Vice - President and , if the President chooses to grant him authority , that would seem to be his right —- but the fact that much of it was done in secret .
Take , for example , the controversial torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay :
Three days after the Ashcroft meeting , Cheney brought the order for military commissions to Bush .
No one told Bellinger , Rice or Powell , who continued to think that Prosper ’s working group was at the helm .
After leaving Bush ’s private dining room , the vice president took no chances on a last - minute objection .
He sent the order on a swift path to execution that left no sign of his role .
After Addington and Flanigan , the text passed to Berenson , the associate White House counsel .
Cheney ’s link to the document broke there : Berenson was not told of its provenance .
Berenson rushed the order to deputy staff secretary Stuart W. Bowen Jr. , bearing instructions to prepare it for signature immediately – without advance distribution to the president ’s top advisers .
Bowen objected , he told colleagues later , saying he had handled thousands of presidential documents without ever bypassing strict procedures of coordination and review .
He relented , one White House official said , only after “ rapid , urgent persuasion ” that Bush was standing by to sign and that the order was too sensitive to delay .
After reading something like this , it becomes clear why the rush to John Ashcroft ’s hospital bed in early 2004 was such a big deal .
When you ’re dealing with people who act in secret without impunity , a scene directly out of The Godfather is n’t implausible at all .
One of the most serious problems with the Bush Administration has been the extent to which it acts in secret , and in ways that allow it to evade the technicalities of the law ( by , say , using RNC email to discuss government business so it does n’t get saved on the White House server ) .
Now it ’s clear where the inspiration for much of that secrecy comes from .
It was four years ago tomorrow night , early in the morning on March 20th Baghdad time , that the Iraq War finally began .
After more than a year of build - up , accusations of links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda that were later proven to be false , and stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction that never existed , it all started with a bomb attack on a bunker where Saddam was believed to be hiding .
As would prove to often be the case as the war went on , it turned out that the intelligence indicating that Saddam and his cronies was in the targeted bunker was , in fact , false .
In retrospect , it makes you wonder if anything we thought we knew about the Iraqi regime in the days , weeks , and months before March 2003 was even halfway true .
The reasons for going to war , however , are mostly irrelevant at this point .
We went there , we ’re still there .
Now the question is what happens next .
According , to the latest CNN poll , the answer the American public wants to hear is that we ’re getting the heck out of there :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
Americans are starkly less confident and proud of their country ’s involvement in Iraq , according to poll results released Sunday .
However , the poll — results of which were released on the eve of the Iraq war ’s 4 - year anniversary — also indicated that Americans are no more worried about the conflict than they were when it began in March 2003 .
The CNN poll of 1,027 adults was conducted March 9 - 11 by Opinion Research Corp .
The sampling error for the poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
According to the results , 35 percent of Americans are confident about the war , the poll said .
When the war began , 83 percent of Americans expressed confidence in the campaign .
Similarly , 30 percent of those polled this month said they were proud of the war , as opposed to 65 percent who expressed that sentiment in 2003 .
The poll also showed that 33 percent of Americans are afraid of the war and 55 percent are worried by it .
Those percentages are roughly the same as they were four years ago .
Sunday ’s results came on the heels of a Saturday release indicating that years of war had whittled away at Americans ’ support for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
When the Iraq war began , 68 percent of Americans said they felt the situation in the country was worth fighting over .
Now , 61 percent of those surveyed say it was not worth invading Iraq , according to the poll .
That survey of 1,027 adults by Opinion Research Corp. was conducted by telephone March 9 - 11 as well .
It has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The poll showed that support for the Iraq war had dwindled to 35 percent .
In 2004 , support for the war was about 56 percent .
Last year , the number dipped to 37 percent , and today about 35 percent of Americans say they support the war , according to the poll .
There will be much debate between now and the 2008 election over what the proper course of action in Iraq should be and what happens on the ground between now and then is anyone ’s guess .
What seems unlikely at this point , barring a miracle that seems unlikely , is that the war , or at least the Bush Administration ’s war policy , will ever regain the support it had when the bombs started falling four years ago .
The Bush Administration has nobody to blame for that but itself .
Not only was the planning for the war nearly non-existent , which led to the problems we ’ve experienced since the troops start movement , but the public was never really prepared for the kind of war that this turned out to be .
In the beginning , most Bush Administration officials , most notably including Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld , were telling the public that American troops would be welcoming by the citizens of Iraq and that there would be no need for a long , bloody occupation .
Now , it ’s entirely possible that they actually believed this , but reports that have come out over the past four years make it clear that there were people in the military warning that the invasion plan itself was flawed and that the planning for a post- invasion occupation was inadequate .
Those people were ignored , and the men wearing the rose - colored glasses remained in charge .
In the end , it ’s hard to see how things could have turned out any differently than they did .
MySQL has defended a decision to end free community access to the latest source code for its popular database in an attempt to snag paying customers .
Chief executive Marten Mickos said MySQL remains in full compliance with the principles of Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) , adding the company 's decision will help build a " well - funded business model " capable of producing yet more GPL software .
Mickos ' comments accompanied those of vice president of community relations Kaj Arno who insisted it was business as usual for MySQL Community and Enterprise Servers , saying both will continue to benefit from the other and denying they will grow apart and split the user base .
" Our intention is for MySQL Community Server to be very good , and for MySQL Enterprise Server to provide further value on top of that , " Arno blogged .
The executives spoke up after a decision that 's left some in its usually supportive and loyal ecosystem voicing concerns MySQL is taking another step away from the community that helped it build market share ( 50 per cent among developers ) and to become synonymous with Web 2.0 and the LAMP stack .
Some have even voiced concern the Community Server will be dropped by MySQL , as the company focuses on commercial activities .
The main issue stems from MySQL 's decision to remove source code tarballs - bundles - from its public ftp.mysql.com site and place them on the enterprise .
mysql.com site with tarballs made available only to paying subscribers .
Non-tarballed code will continue to be available through the MySQL BitKeeper repository under the GPL .
The decision to keep code back - or at least well hidden - from the community has led some to question whether MySQL is , in fact , going closed source .
MySQL developer and community member Mike Kruckenberg blogged : " It does n't seem to fit with the spirit of open source .
When I think open source I think freely available source , not source I can get once I 've paid for a license . "
There is concern that restricted access to source will harm the quality of the final product while leaving the community straddled with a second - class database that slips out of touch with MySQL 's development cycles .
It 's believed keeping code back will deter the kind of grand - scale testing by the community that 's helped maintain quality by finding bugs missed by the company , as source in the BitKeeper library is " not relevant " for rigorous testing .
Jeremy Cole , formerly with MySQL and now running Proven Scaling , warned these latest changes would do " absolutely nothing " to address quality control issues on bugs and delays that crept in with the release in late 2006 of Community Server .
As part of the new regime , MySQL has promised at least four mature , scheduled source code builds each year .
Cole claimed there are infrequent releases of Community Server with " very little vetting , and there 's not a real feedback loop with the users , due to the delay in seeing actual fixes implemented . "
One community member has pledged to pick up the slack by providing on - going access to MySQL code .
Organizers of the Dorsal Source initiative - which provides builds of MySQL for Linux and Windows - have promised to deliver those source releases being taken from the public site along with binary builds and historical releases .
Dorsal Source is backed by Cole 's Proven Scaling .
The decision to keep source back for paying customers seems part of a program by MySQL to convince customers there 's more value in paying for subscriptions , as they actually get something that 's not available to users of the free Community Server .
Mickos has made it increasingly clear MySQL has faced problems in converting free users into paying consumers .
That 's a problem for a company that - with an IPO in the wings - will be under pressure to assure investors it 's got plenty of growth ahead as a public company .
MySQL has clearly embarked on what it believes to be a strategy analogous with Red Hat 's Fedora .
Responding to one blogger , Mickos agreed with the Fedora analogy and drew on MySQL Cluster as a good example of a taking a closed - source product from a well - funded organization ( Ericsson ) and building a thriving business by releasing it under GPL .
" That 's in my mind the win - win for FOSS , " Mickos said .
While few doubt MySQL 's need to make cash , skeptics are questioning the wisdom of following the Red Hat model and apparently putting a wall between itself and the community to " get more customers " . ®
Several sources have reported a Chinese ASAT test was carried out against the Chinese FENGYUN 1C polar - orbiting weather satellite on 2007 January 11 .
For details , see :
These reports were confirmed by the Chinese government on January 23 :
In order to illustrate the circumstances of this attack , I have produced an STK Viewer file ( see bottom of this page for more information on STK Viewer ) which confirms the basic facts reported by AW&ST .
It shows the period from 2007 January 11 at 22:26:10 UTC ( which analysis shows as the most likely time of the event , slightly different than the time of 22:28 UTC reported by AW&ST ) until January 12 at 0600 UTC .
The orbit of FENGYUN 1C ( pre-attack ) is shown in red and the location of the Xichang Space Center is also shown .
I am also providing a Google Earth location file for the Xichang Space Center , with recently released details of the launch complex and surrounding facilities .
FENGYUN 1C and the other pieces of debris now catalogued by NORAD are shown in green .
From this animation , it is easy to see the spread of the resulting debris cloud for the first couple of orbits .
It should be noted that the spread of debris at the time of the event is due to the error associated with propagating the TLEs back from the time they were released to the time of the event .
Screen shot from STK Viewer file of Chinese ASAT scenario ( five minutes post- attack )
As of 2012 June 22 ( another 10 TLEs were released on this date ) , 3,312 pieces of debris — including whatever 's left of the original payload — have been catalogued by NORAD .
Only 256 have decayed as of this date .
That makes this event the largest debris - generating event on record — far surpassing the 713 pieces cataloged when the Pegasus rocket body that launched STEP 2 exploded on 1996 June 3 .
NASA 's Orbital Debris Program
Office now estimates more than 150,000 pieces of debris larger than 1 cm from this event :
For additional information on historical debris events , visit the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office web site or check out their publication History of On - Orbit Satellite Fragmentations .
Updating the initial analysis by CSSI just after this event was first reported shows pieces in the debris cloud ranging from below 200 km in altitude up to almost 4,000 km ( see Gabbard plot ) , posing a threat to many operational satellites , due to the polar orbit of the debris cloud .
Potential conjunctions with satellite payloads currently on orbit can be found by searching for " FENGYUN 1C " using SOCRATES or by generating an automatic search .
Using the SOCRATES run from 2008 January 22 at 1300 UTC , there were 3,100 occasions predicted where a piece of FENGYUN 1C debris would come within 5 km of a satellite payload in low - Earth orbit over the next week — over 28 percent of all predicted conjunctions over that period .
We are now routinely seeing about 3,000 conjunctions within 5 km over a seven - day period between the FENGYUN 1C debris and payloads in Earth orbit .
The figures below ( from 2007 December 5 ) give a sense of the risk to other satellites in low - Earth orbit ( LEO ) , including the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The first figure shows how the orbit of the ISS passes through the ring of debris at the southern part of its orbit .
The second figure shows the larger population of LEO satellites — payloads , rocket bodies , and debris ( size exaggerated for visibility ) — which could also be affected .

View of LEO Satellites ( green ) and Debris Ring ( red ) from Chinese ASAT Test
This debris event is so large that the debris can still be fairly easily seen without doing anything to emphasize the debris cloud , although the debris ring has widened considerably over the past eleven months .
View of All Satellites including Debris Ring from Chinese ASAT Test Readily Visible
As of 2008 January 22 , an analysis of the current SATCAT shows there are 3,231 payloads in Earth orbit or beyond ( see SATCAT Boxscore for details ) .
Of those , we have orbital data for 2,864 payloads in Earth orbit .
Of the missing 367 objects , some are in deep - space orbits around the Sun or other planets and some are not released by the US government , for whatever reasons .
Of the 2,864 payloads we do have data for , 1,899 of these payloads pass through the regime now affected by the debris from the Chinese ASAT test — fully two - thirds of all payloads in Earth orbit .
Despite several statements by NASA officials that the ISS is not at risk due to this event , UPI reported 2007 February 2 that US and Russian officials maneuvered the ISS specifically to avoid a piece of debris from this event .
For details on this report , see :
At this point , however , I am unable to independently verify this story via official sources at NASA or the Russian Space Agency and analysis of the TLE data for 2007 does not support the claim that the ISS has been maneuvered since the ASAT test was conducted .
UPI subsequently revised their original story to say that the Russian Mission Control Center spokesman " was describing a general policy . "
( The ISS was maneuvered on 2007 March 15 in preparation for the arrival of Soyuz - TMA 10 , as reported in ISS Status Report SS07 - 13 . )
The first acknowledged maneuver to avoid a piece of debris from the Chinese ASAT test occurred on 2007 June 22 when flight controllers at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center briefly fired the thrusters on their TERRA satellite to avoid a 7 percent chance of being struck the following day :
Several analysts have suggested that the debris from this event would be relatively short - lived and only remain in orbit for ten years or less .
Unfortunately , nothing could be further from the truth .
A detailed analysis of the orbital lifetime , performed on 2007 October 10 , of the debris cataloged so far — using the Lifetime model implemented in STK — predicts that just over 6 percent of the debris ( 136 pieces ) will have decayed within ten years and 79 percent will still remain in orbit 100 years from now .
As of 2008 January 22 , only 23 of the 2,377 pieces cataloged to date are shown as having decayed from orbit—less than one percent in the first year .
The majority of the debris from this one event will remain a hazard for centuries to come .
( Note : This analysis was only done for 2,150 of the 2,247 pieces catalogued as of 2007 October 10 since it appears that 97 pieces were missing from the catalog at that time . )
The graph below shows a prediction of the percent of the total Chinese ASAT test debris population which has decayed from orbit over time based on our analysis .
The baseline orbital lifetime analysis results are shown in blue along with high - drag ( upper line ) and low - drag ( lower line ) excursions to help assess the impact of uncertainty in the baseline assumptions .
Plot of Orbital Decay Rate of ASAT Debris
Without specific information on size , mass , and shape of individual debris pieces resulting from this test , it was necessary to make a number of assumptions to complete the orbital lifetime analysis .
First , it was assumed that all pieces were large enough to be tracked by US SSN ( approximately 10 cm ) which , given the size of the original satellite , meant that each piece would be roughly the same size .
Assuming they had roughly the same densities , the total dry mass of the satellite prior to the test ( 850 kg ) was divided by the number of pieces in the public SATCAT ( 2,247 ) at that time , yielding an average mass of 0.38 kg .
These assumptions were used for the baseline analysis .
Next , it was necessary to select an appropriate atmospheric model to estimate drag .
STK has nine atmospheric models which can be used in its Lifetime tool .
Sensitivity analysis using the various models showed differences on the order of months , which was expected ( and can be seen from the graph ) to be a small difference when compared to the overall lifetime of most of the pieces .
Therefore , the Jacchia - Roberts model was chosen , since it is an analytical model and runs much faster than the other models , most of which are numerical or not as sophisticated .
The analysis used the latest Schatten space weather predictions for the period 2006 October until 2030 May .
STK / Lifetime replicates this cycle throughout the analysis period beyond the Schatten predictions ( 2030 –2107 ) .
In fact , the effects of the solar cycle can be seen throughout the curves in the graph above , especially in the high - drag case .
Considerable variability is likely in these predictions , though , since our ability to predict solar and geomagnetic cycles is still quite crude .
The impact , however , should not be as significant for the majority of debris pieces , which are above the original FY 1C orbit .
In fact , the chart supports this assumption since the variability due to the solar cycle is far less than the uncertainty in the drag due to the ballistic coefficients of the debris .
The baseline analysis also assumed a coefficient of drag of 2.2 .
However , due to the uncertainty in the size , mass , shape , and coefficient of drag for each of the pieces , additional runs ( excursions ) were conducted which varied the ballistic coefficient by a factor of two relative to the baseline assumptions .
That is , the ballistic coefficient — which is the product of the coefficient of drag and the cross-sectional area divided by the mass — varied from half the baseline ballistic coefficient ( low - drag case ) to twice the baseline value ( high - drag case ) .
The results indicate that while there may be considerable variability due to the uncertainty in the debris characteristics , even doubling the drag on all the debris still only results in 36 percent of the debris decaying from orbit within 100 years .
As of 2009 June 10 , only 50 pieces of this debris have decayed from Earth orbit .

Expanded coverage of CSSI analysis :
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A senior operative for al Qaeda in Iraq who was caught this month has told his U.S. military interrogators a prominent al Qaeda - led group is just a front and its leader fictitious , a military spokesman said on Wednesday .
A briefing slide released by the Multi-National Force - Iraq on July 18 , 2007 .
The organizational chart includes a white box representing the position of Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , leader of the self - styled Islamic State of Iraq , which was purportedly set up last year .
REUTERS / Handout
Brigadier - General Kevin Bergner told a news conference that Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , leader of the self - styled Islamic State of Iraq , which was purportedly set up last year , did not exist .
The Islamic State of Iraq was established to try to put an Iraqi face on what is a foreign - driven network , Bergner said .
The name Baghdadi means the person hails from the Iraqi capital .
Bergner said the information came from an operative called Khalid al - Mashadani who was caught on July 4 and who he said was an intermediary to Osama bin Laden .
He said Mashadani was believed to be the most senior Iraqi in the Sunni Islamist al Qaeda in Iraq network .
“ In his words , the Islamic State of Iraq is a front organization that masks the foreign influence and leadership within al Qaeda in Iraq in an attempt to put an Iraqi face on the leadership of al Qaeda in Iraq , ” Bergner said .
U.S. military officials in recent weeks have been pressed to explain the link between al Qaeda in Iraq and bin Laden ’s global network given the military ’s heightened focus on al Qaeda in Iraq as the biggest threat to the country .
The military blames al Qaeda in Iraq for most of the major bombings in Iraq , saying the group is trying to spark all - out civil war between majority Shi’tes and minority Sunni Arabs .
Bergner said Mashadani served as an intermediary between the al Qaeda in Iraq leader , Egyptian Abu Ayyab al - Masri and bin Laden and also the Egyptian cleric Ayman al - Zawahri , who is the global network ’s No. 2 commander .
The Islamic State of Iraq was set up in October , comprising a group of Sunni militant affiliates and tribal leaders led by Baghdadi .
In April , it named a 10 - man “ cabinet ” .
The Islamic State of Iraq has claimed many high - profile acts of violence .
But Bergner said Mashadani and Masri had co-founded a “ virtual organization in cyberspace called the Islamic State of Iraq in 2006 as a new Iraqi pseudonym for AQI ” .
“ To further this myth , Masri created a fictional head of the Islamic State of Iraq known as Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , ” he said .
“ To make al - Baghdadi appear credible , al - Masri swore allegiance to al - Baghdadi and pledged to obey him , which is essentially pledging allegiance to himself since he knew Baghdadi was fictitious and a creation of his own , ” he said .
“ The rank and file Iraqis in AQI believe they are following the Iraqi al - Baghdadi .
But all the while they have been following the orders of the Egyptian Abu Ayyab al - Masri . ”
Voice recordings purporting to be from Baghdadi have appeared on the Internet , although Bergner said he had been played by an actor .
He did not refer to any video clips .
Bergner said Mashadani was al Qaeda ’s “ media emir ” for Iraq .
He said the operative was “ providing significant insights into the nature and circumstances of al Qaeda in Iraq ” .
The U.S. military has always said al Qaeda in Iraq was run by foreigners .
Forty years on :
The bitter legacy of the 1967 Middle East war
By Jean Shaoul
18 June 2007
The 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbours has long been recognised as a disaster for the Arab regimes and for the Palestinian people in particular , many of whom fled or were driven out by the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) .
Those who remained have been subject to four decades of military occupation and ever worsening poverty .
It is less well understood that a major military victory against numerically superior forces inaugurated a process that has produced a political and social disaster for Israel .
Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian territories has been marked by endless conflict with the Palestinian people and the ruinous costs — economic , social and moral — associated with it .
Israel was established after World War II following a vote at the United Nations in 1947 that was engineered by the US and the Soviet Union , each of which saw the formation of a Jewish state as a way of asserting their own power in the Middle East at the expense of Britain and France .
The ostensible homeland for the Jews was realised in the form of a state based on the dispossession and forced expulsion of its Palestinian inhabitants and on religious exclusivism .
Despite this , the creation of the state of Israel was viewed with sympathy and lent legitimacy in the eyes of millions around the world by one of history ’s greatest crimes — the annihilation of 6 million European Jews in the Nazi holocaust .
Israel ’s rulers concealed their own crimes against the Palestinians behind the claim that Israel was to be “ a land without people for a people without land . ”
Many of Israel ’s original citizens were Jews who had been in left - wing movements in Europe , and had amongst their number notable musicians , scientists , intellectuals and writers .
The country ’s communal kibbutzim became bywords for a striving for a new social order .
The ruling Labour government capitalised on this and promoted the view of Israel as a brave little state based on social justice — a beacon of democracy and the rule of law in the Middle East surrounded by a sea of despotic enemies .
Beneath this progressive veneer , Israel was maintained for the next 19 years through provocations and military attacks against its neighbours , including a full - scale war against Egypt in 1956 .
Those Palestinians who remained after the establishment of the state were subject until 1966 to military law , while inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens was enshrined in law .
The 1967 war exposed the expansionist character of the Israeli state and brought to the fore the reactionary essence of Zionism .
The war is usually presented as the victory of an Israeli David over an Arab Goliath .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , writing recently in the Guardian , described 1967 as an “ unwanted war to defend [ Israel ’s ] very existence . ”
However , Menachem Begin , the former terrorist who became the leader of the Likud party , admitted , “ In June 1967 , we had a choice .
The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that [ Egyptian President ]
Nasser was really about to attack us .
We must be honest with ourselves .
We decided to attack him . ”
The Israelis had , in fact , prepared militarily and mounted provocations against its neighbours in order to provoke a response that could be used to justify an expansion of its borders .
The Labour Party leaders had long since concluded that Israel , surrounded by numerically superior and hostile neighbours , needed “ defensible borders ” and could not survive any war unless it attacked first .
The Revisionist tendency , then a minority tendency within the Zionist movement , had always championed the seizure of Jordan and the whole of British Mandate Palestine .
As far back as 1923 , it had insisted that Zionism was “ a colonising adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force . ”
Other right - wing elements had advocated the Jordan River as Israel ’s eastern border .
Facing both domestic and international opposition to such an expansionary policy , a suitable pretext was needed for its implementation .
In 1967 , Egypt ’s President Colonel Gamal Abdul Nasser provided it .
The war that broke out in June , and which lasted just six days , followed several years of escalating conflict between Israel and Syria over grazing rights in the demilitarised no - man ’s land between the two countries , as well as repeated Palestinian raids from Syria and Jordan .
For Israel , this land was too near one of the sources of the Jordan River to allow Syria to control it .
In a particularly provocative aerial battle in April 1967 , Israel downed six Syrian planes in a matter of minutes .
The Syrians and the Palestinian leadership had for years appealed for support to Nasser , looking to him because of his overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy , his expulsion of the British from the Suez Canal , and his espousal of pan-Arab nationalism .
Nasser ordered the United Nations to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip on May 16 , which Egypt then controlled , and Sharm el - Sheikh , where , since the 1956 Suez crisis , they guarded the Straits of Tiran — the access route from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean .
Later he announced the closing of the straits to Israeli shipping .
But , with his coffers empty and most of his special forces bogged down in the civil war in Yemen , Nasser did not want a war with Israel .
And the Israelis knew it .
Yitzhak Rabin , then chief of staff with a reputation as a hawk , later admitted as much .
As the tension mounted during the weeks preceding the war , Tel Aviv denounced the blockade of the port of Eilat , Israel ’s only access to the Red Sea , as an act of war and a threat to Israel ’s existence .
The Labour government brought in General Moshe Dayan , an arch hawk , as minister of defence , and Menachem Begin as minister of state , both of whom were outspoken proponents of an expansionary policy .
Both the Soviet Union and Britain ’s former Conservative Deputy Foreign Secretary Anthony Nutting warned Nasser that Israel would strike against Egypt , and his own army chiefs and Syria advocated a first strike .
Nasser refused to accept this , believing that the US , as it had done during the 1956 Suez crisis , would not allow a war by Israel , and made no preparations .
However , in 1956 Washington ’s intervention had been motivated by its determination to end Britain and France ’s hold on the Middle East .
Now , the US faced the growing radicalisation of the Arab masses and Moscow ’s increasing interest and influence in the Middle East , including Egypt ’s turn to the Soviet Union for development loans and military aid .
In addition , Egypt was fighting a war against Washington ’s ally , Saudi Arabia , in Yemen .
So on June 5 , with Washington ’s support , Israel seized the opportunity to initiate the first strike , wiping out almost the entire Egyptian air force on the ground .
In the words of Israeli politician Shimon Peres , “ It took 80 minutes to execute a plan that had been in the making for 10 years . ”
The Arab armies were routed and Israel vastly expanded its territories to include all of what was British Mandate Palestine and part of Syria , confirming Israel ’s position as the major military power in the Middle East .
The war created a new generation of refugees who fled the Israeli troops .
Apart from Sinai , handed back in 1981 after the peace deal with Egypt , and Quneitra , recaptured by Syria during the 1973 war , Israel still occupies these lands today .
The Labour government , after achieving the stated objective of the war , the opening of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping , refused to hand back the captured lands .
Instead , it annexed East Jerusalem , captured from Jordan .
Dayan , the defence minister , ordered the destruction of Syrian villages and towns in the occupied Golan Heights .
Within months , Israel began to colonise the occupied Palestinian territories and Syria ’s Golan Heights .
Theodor Meron , the foreign minister ’s most senior legal advisor , writing to the prime minister on September 18 , opposed this , warning , “ My conclusion is that civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention . ”
In defying international conventions , the Labour government openly embraced a militarist and colonialist strategy , behind which all the major strands of Zionism united .
The realities of conquest and occupation produced a profound political shift that was to affect all aspects of Israeli life .
The Labour government , despite it democratic pretensions , had to administer a repressive military occupation .
The Palestinians in the occupied territories were denied any political rights , and the occupation became increasingly brutal as the Palestinians resisted .
Homes were demolished , property destroyed , many Palestinians were shot , tear gassed or injured , while many more were detained without trial .
The 1967 war brought to the fore a new generation of political leaders , such as Moshe Dayan , Shimon Peres , Yigal Allon and Yitzhak Rabin , all with the closest connections to the military .
The war had enhanced their reputation , particularly Dayan’s .
The passing in 1974 of the premiership to Rabin , who had been chief of staff in 1967 , signified the end of the old guard .
A senior military command became the prerequisite for a successful political career .
The occupation , the subsequent war of attrition on the Suez Canal , the 1973 war , the wars in Lebanon in 1976 and 1982 , and the suppression of the 1987 and 2000 intifadas required the increasing militarization of Israeli political life and society as a whole .
While the army had always been a conscript army , with citizens liable to reservist duty every year , conscription and reservist duty became longer and more difficult to evade .
The corollary of an ever more brutal occupation was the dehumanising impact it had on the Israelis themselves , who were made party to grave crimes and human rights abuses on the basis of the insistence on an existential threat posed by the Palestinians .
Israel was transformed to a greater extent than heretofore into a garrison state .
Washington responded to 1967 and the confirmation of Israel ’s position as the major military power in the Middle East by massively increasing its military and economic aid .
Today it is worth $ 3 billion a year , more than six times all US aid to sub-Saharan Africa .
Without this aid and other economic and political support , Israel would long ago have collapsed .
In return , Israel intervened to suppress the Palestinians in Jordan and Lebanon , suppressing the Arab working class and keeping decrepit regimes in power .
It served Washington ’s Cold War aims by keeping the Stalinist regime in Moscow at bay by defeating the Soviet Union ’s allies Egypt and Syria in another war in 1973 .
Having developed its own nuclear arsenal , it acted against Iraq , then allied to Moscow , by bombing its nuclear reactor in 1981 .
Israel supplied arms to Iran during the Iran - Iraq War and backed other regimes that the US could not be seen to be openly supporting .
Last summer , it launched a murderous war against Hezbollah to eradicate opposition to the US - backed government in Lebanon .
All this has only served to make Israel more abhorrent in the eyes of its neighbours and turned millions of people around the world — who once looked upon Israel with sympathy — against it .
The settlements , surrounded by a hostile Palestinian population , were not attractive to the majority of Israelis .
A new wave of immigrants was therefore encouraged to come and settle in the Occupied Territories .
Israelis , who could not otherwise have afforded a home , were given financial inducements to settle there .
The settlements became a magnet for a right - wing and violent layer , epitomised by Rabbi Meir Kahane , leader of the US Jewish Defence League , who recruited a new wave of religious immigrants to come from the US and built a fascistic party , Kach .
The expansionary policy was portrayed by religious groups as an opportunity and duty to realise the biblical vision of the “ whole land of Israel , ” of “ Judea and Samaria . ”
As Chuck Freilich , deputy national security advisor under Ariel Sharon , recently told the New York Times , “ The 1967 war convinced Arabs that Israel is here to stay .
But it ’s also a cancer .
Occupation is corrupting in the long run for any society , and the war also brought a religious messianism into Israeli life that really was n’t there . ”
This ultra - right wing tendency was further swelled by more than 1.5 million impoverished and politically disorientated immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union — constituting nearly a third of Israel ’s Jewish population today .
The “ Greater Israel ” policy thus spawned a new social layer , for whom right - wing nationalist parties such as Likud , under the leadership first of Menachem Begin , and ultra-religious parties became a political vehicle .
They demanded that the West Bank be formally annexed by Israel .
Similar tendencies developed within the Labour Party and among its political allies .
Sharon , the architect and sponsor of the settler project , made no attempt to hide his objective :
To prevent the creation of a Palestinian state .
Like the military , the ultra-nationalist and religious parties have come to wield disproportionate power in Israel ’s fractured political system , enabling them to play a pivotal role in cobbling together coalition governments .
They have imposed their demands on successive governments and shifted official politics sharply to the right .
Settler violence and theft against Palestinians go unpunished .
The power of the religious authorities and religious control over Israeli citizens have increased , raising sharp tensions with the secular majority .
Thus , the Zionist state has spawned its own brand of religious fundamentalism , no different in essence to that found in various Muslim states .
The layers that proved most susceptible to the siren call of the religious right included in their number significant sections of the most impoverished and oppressed in Israel .
But the drive for Israeli expansion and profits for the ruling elite , coupled with the demands of military spending , has come at a huge cost to the entire working class .
State enterprises have been privatised , social benefits slashed , the pension age raised , corporation tax and income tax for the rich cut , and health , education and social programmes gutted .
Unemployment has risen alongside the highest per-capita ratio of migrant workers in the world .
These super - exploited workers are used to force down wages yet further .
Workers and their families face a precarious existence , with more than one quarter of households living below the poverty line , including many whose members are employed .
Wage erosion caused by the rapid polarisation of incomes and the growth of employment by manpower companies has pushed tens of thousands of wage - earning families below the poverty line .
While the gross domestic product ( GDP ) has risen from $ 1,500 per capita in 1967 to $ 24,000 per capita in 2006 , placing Israel 23rd in the United Nations Human Development Report , much of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of just six families , who control 40 percent of the value of the shares traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange .
These families control 12 of the 17 economic conglomerates , including the banks and commercial media , giving them enormous financial , economic and political power .
Foreign corporations and investors , particularly from the US , own almost all of the remaining shares traded on the stock exchange .
As well as the social chasm between the handful of multimillionaires and billionaires and the mass of the population , Israeli society is riven by numerous other divisions — between secular and religious Jews , between the more prosperous Jews of European descent ( Ashkenazi Jews ) and the more impoverished layers whose families came from the Middle East and North Africa ( Sephardi Jews ) .
The destruction of the welfare state and social insurance has eliminated the basis for creating an integrated and more egalitarian society .
It has prevented any assimilation of East European immigrants , allowing rightist parties to pose as defenders of orthodox minorities against “ arrogant ” and secular elites that are descended from the postwar immigration of European Jewry and organised in and around the Labour Party .
The Sephardi Jews and other impoverished layers are increasingly to be found in the so - called development towns , euphemisms for concrete slums on Israel ’s borders with its hostile neighbours , which bear the full brunt of the Palestinian attacks on Israel .
A further 16 percent of all employees are migrant workers ( with and without work permits ) , the highest per capita ratio in the world .
They , like the Palestinian workers , receive less than the minimum wage , without benefits such as overtime pay or annual vacations .
Even more telling is the division between Jewish Israelis and the 20 percent of Israelis of Palestinian origin .
Second class citizens , denied equality in the eyes of the law , Arabs suffer budgetary discrimination .
No new Arab towns have ever been built , while the old ones fall into decay .
They lack access to healthcare and education and are twice as likely to be unemployed and poor .
Their family land has been expropriated .
Political parties that do not recognise Israel ’s right to exist are banned .
All this is has been implemented by a ruling elite that is one of the most venal in the world .
Israel ’s business and political leaders are mired in scandals and corruption , including both the prime minister and the two most recent presidents , both of whom were forced to step down .
The Israeli government does not represent the majority of the Jewish people who live in Israel , let alone the interests of its citizens , Jewish and Palestinian .
It is the political representative of Israel ’s financial elite , which is allied to its chief sponsors in Washington .
In acting in its own interests and as the US ’s policeman in the region , Israel ’s ruling elite has relentlessly suppressed the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
For the last 40 years , the lot of the majority of Palestinians has been hardship and misery .
Today , three quarters of the Palestinian people are displaced , while there are 5 million refugees throughout the world .
By closing the borders with the West Bank and Gaza , denying tens of thousands the right to work in Israel , and imposing more than 500 roadblocks within the occupied territories , Israel ’s armed forces have penned the Palestinians into a virtual prison and strangled their economy .
More than 66 percent of households in the Palestinian Authority live below the poverty line , while 24 percent of the workforce is unemployed .
Since 1967 , more than 650,000 Palestinians have been detained by Israel , a figure equal numerically to 40 percent of the male population .
While the West Bank was not formally annexed , East Jerusalem has been incorporated into the Zionist state .
The settlements have continued to grow , even after the 1993 Oslo agreement promising a Palestinian state on the land captured during the 1967 war .
The so - called security wall is intended to permanently expand Israel ’s borders , ensuring control of the whole of Jerusalem and much of the West Bank .
There are today about 250 settlements scattered throughout the West Bank , with a total population , including East Jerusalem , of 450,000 .
These settlements have access to roads off - limits to the Palestinians .
The prospect of statehood held out to the Palestinians , even were it to be realized , would do nothing to secure their basic democratic rights and social needs .
The official policy of Israel and the US — honoured mostly in the breach — would leave the Palestinians with a bifurcated state , with the West Bank and Gaza cut off from each other and the West Bank itself reduced to a series of isolated and impoverished towns and villages , penned in by the security wall and surrounded by Israeli troops .
These are the circumstances that have given rise to the bitter internecine war between Hamas and Fatah .
Quite rightly viewed as crimes by the vast majority of the world ’s population , Israel ’s actions , both in its own and in Washington ’s interests , are some of the most incendiary factors in world politics today .
Zionism ’s solution to its problems , the expansion of Israel ’s borders , has proved to be no solution at all .
Events since the 1967 war have exposed the failure of the Israeli state to deliver its promise to provide a safe haven for the Jewish people and a just and egalitarian society .
Rather , Israel is a social tinder box that threatens to destroy itself .
As a further tragic irony , it is reproducing within Israel and the Occupied Territories the ghettos , repression , civil strife and wars from which earlier generations of Jews had fled .
Many Israelis are sick and tired of the constant state of war and disgusted by the brutal treatment meted out to the Palestinians .
They want peace , but are confronted on all sides by parties based on militarism and war .
A break with Zionism and a recognition that its failure is the inevitable consequence of a nationalist perspective is a precondition for the development of an independent political struggle to unite Arab and Jewish workers for the building of a socialist society that would eliminate the artificial borders dividing the peoples and economies of the region .
