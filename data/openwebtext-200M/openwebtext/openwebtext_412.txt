Tonderai Ndira will not be campaigning when Zimbabwe votes again .
He will not rally his neighbourhood , as he did two months ago , for one last push against an unwanted regime .
Instead , he is buried in an unmarked grave in the Warren Hills cemetery in Harare .
A week on from his funeral , only his brother knows for sure which of the mounds is his .
He will not leave a marker because he believes state agents are still not finished with the murdered activist .
They would like to dig up his brother 's remains to remove the incriminating evidence .
Mr Ndira 's body was only found by accident in one of the capital 's morgues a fortnight ago .
His eyes had been gouged out and his tongue cut off .
The 30 - year - old was so badly beaten his father had trouble identifying him .
A distinctive ring confirmed the identity of a man compared by some to South Africa 's murdered rights activist , Steve Biko .
Mr Ndira , a lifelong campaigner for political change , had been arrested more than 30 times but kept up his opposition to the government that has led Zimbabweans to the lowest life expectancy in the world .
His remains – a crushed skull , a bullet wound through the chest and blood - stained shorts – are a depressing metaphor for Zimbabwe in the aftermath of a stolen election .

On 27 June , this bankrupt and terrorised country will go back to the polls .
A wave of abductions , punishment beatings and murders of opposition activists is under way in an attempt to turn the outcome on its head and prolong the rule of President Robert Mugabe .
This effort has entered a new phase and , while the bodies of the disappeared are starting to turn up in the mortuaries , more are being abducted all the time .
At least 50 have died , 1,500 have been treated in hospital , 25,000 have been driven from their homes and countless more have lost their livelihoods .
David Coltart , an opposition senator , says violence in rural areas where the ruling Zanu - PF party did badly in the March poll , mainly in the north and north - east , has intensified .
Speaking in London , the human rights lawyer said an estimated 25,000 people had been displaced in the past three weeks and the authorities had begun targeting individuals in the " second and third tier " of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
It was in this phase that Mr Ndira met his fate .
His circumstances echo those of scores of others victimised in a state - sponsored campaign to beat the MDC into submission .
A veteran of numerous arrests and internments , beatings and torture , Mr Ndira was accustomed to keeping on the move and staying one step ahead of the state security apparatus .
Two weeks ago , suffering from exhaustion , he returned home to Mabvuku township outside Harare .
Before dawn , say his family and other witness , a group of about 10 men , some masked and carrying Kalashnikov AK - 47 rifles , appeared at his doorstep and demanded to see him .
His wife called out to him and he asked the visitors to call back later .
Instead , they burst into the activist 's home and beat him in front of his two young children , before dragging him outside and into a truck , bloodied and still in his underwear .
In the weeks that followed his abduction , his family made frantic efforts to obtain any details about what happened to him .
What took place can only be surmised by the unidentified , broken body that was found in a field in Goromonzi , 20 miles outside the capital , and taken to the mortuary at Harare 's Parirenyatwa hospital .
Mr Ndira was reportedly identified only after someone recognised the mutilated corpse from its tall and thin frame and guessed the rest .
It was a fate that would not have surprised the man himself .
Interviewed by the BBC's Panorama programme in 2002 , Mr Ndira said : " We are prepared to die .
It is just the same , we are still dying in Zimbabwe .
We are dying by hunger , by diseases , everything , so there is nothing to fear . "
Fear is exactly what the Mugabe regime is counting on as it looks to overturn a first - round defeat that saw 56 per cent of the country voting against the only president they have known since independence , and saw his party lose its majority in the lower house of parliament .
The octogenarian leader , who famously boasted that he has a " degree in violence " , is relying on state security personnel backed up by paid militias to prevent a similar result in the run-off ballot .
The outcome of the first round was withheld for more than five weeks before the government conceded that Mr Tsvangirai had beaten Mr Mugabe by six points , though falling just short of an overall majority because a third candidate , Simba Makoni , took a small share of the vote .
A leading Zimbabwean army general has called on the nation 's soldiers to vote for Mr Mugabe in the run-off or quit the military , the state - run Herald newspaper reported .
The chief of staff , Major - General Martin Chedondo , told troops : " Soldiers are not apolitical .
Only mercenaries are apolitical .
We have signed up and agreed to fight and protect the ruling party 's principles of defending the revolution .
If you have other thoughts , then you should remove that uniform . "
He added that Mr Mugabe was head of the defence forces and " we should therefore stand behind our commander - in - chief " .
This echoes a similar statement by the joint chiefs of staff before the first round , in which they said they would not recognise any government other than that of Mr Mugabe , and they would refuse to salute Mr Tsvangirai if he won .
The MDC leader returned to Zimbabwe only last weekend , having stayed abroad for most of the past two months amid fears for his safety .
On Friday , he gave what he called a " state of the union " address in which he called for a " new era of governance " in the country .
Publicly , Mr Tsvangirai has said he remains confident that Zimbabweans will defy the intimidation campaign .
However , there are serious concerns as to whether a democratic shift is at all possible .
" We are witnessing the actions of a government which has thrown caution to the wind and will do anything to win the run-off , " said Mr Coltart .
Despite this , he believes Mr Tsvangirai still has an " excellent chance " of defeating Mr Mugabe .
In March , he said , the urban vote was low because of scepticism about the electoral process .
The surprise result that time is likely to lead to a sharp increase in turnout in Harare and Bulawayo , increasing the overall vote by up to 300,000 , most of which is likely to go to the MDC candidate .
Austin Police have charged 21 - year - old UT studentwith a third - degree felony for hindering the apprehension of friendby helping him flee to Mexico after the murder of 21 - year - old .
Pitonyak has been charged with Cave 's murder and is being held in the Travis Co. jail on a $ 1 million bond ;
Hall is in jail on a $ 175,000 bond .
Police found Cave 's body in the bathtub in Pitonyak 's apartment on Aug. 18 ; she 'd been shot , stabbed , and dismembered .
Pitonyak was arrested in Piedras Negras , Mexico , on Aug. 23 , after police got a tip from a confidential informant that Pitonyak and Hall were staying at a Holiday Inn there  a tip that was confirmed with a video image of Hall 's dark green four - door Cadillac crossing the border into Mexico .
Authorities quickly expelled the two from Mexico on an immigration violation , and U.S. Marshals arrested Pitonyak in Eagle Pass .
Hall was not arrested and was released into her father 's custody .
Later that day , APD homicide detectives got a call from a witness , Said Aziz , who said that Hall had called him several times that morning .
Aziz said Hall told him that she and Pitonyak had " hauled in her Cadi " down to Mexico and that she was surprised that police had found them so quickly .
Hall allegedly told Aziz that she wanted to help Pitonyak , and that Cave 's murder was an accident .
If Hall were to stick up for Pitonyak , she allegedly told Aziz , there would be a chance that Pitonyak might be acquitted on the murder charge .
Aziz told police that he asked Hall why she would want to stick up for someone " who had just killed a girl much like herself , " reads Hall 's arrest affidavit , to which she replied that she loved Pitonyak and that " that 's just how I roll . "

This is me in front of the windfarm which I helped finance two years ago .
It 's up and running , and will be generating clean energy for the next 20 - 25 years - at a price guaranteed not to increase for the whole period .
It was inaugurated yesterday and christened Princess Amalia windfarm , after the young daughter of the Dutch crown prince .
Now that European wholesale power prices are becoming higher than the feed - in tariff paid to wind farms in most countries that have them ( ie it 's getting cheaper to buy " subsidized " wind power than regular , " competitive " power on the free market ) , it 's particularly sweet .
French day - ahead electricity prices on Powernext ( free reg. required ) .
The regulated tariff for wind power is 82 EUR / MWh or lower .
Of course , the costs ( and the tariffs ) for offshore wind are still slightly higher than for onshore , but this is likely to change quickly as the sector moves away from semi-experimental construction procedures to standardised methods , and as the current bottlenecks in the supply chain recede as more production capacity is put in place .
The fact remains : onshore wind costs 40 - 70 EUR / MWh and offshore wind power costs 90 - 120 EUR / MWh today and both will cost that , or less , in 15 years ' time .
Can any other electricity source say that , except for hydro ( which cannot increase its production capacity ) or solar ( which needs a few more years of development to see its still high costs - 250 - 350 EUR / MWh - come down to more attractive levels ) ?
Wind 's only obstacle today is the still widespread perception that it is not a " serious " energy source , that it 's only a small part of the solution , and that it 's not really reliable anyway .
It was heartening to see earlier this week this ad in all French newspapers , whereby all the big French utilities ( including almost - all - nuclear EDF ) publicly supported wind power and insisted they would continue to invest in the sector :
( It was somewhat less heartening to see Poweo 's Beigbeder 's self - serving and bad faith ode to competition in today 's Le Monde - I will respond separately to that article ) .
But as power generation manufacturers like GE , Siemens and others get a increasingly large share of their turnover from selling wind turbines , as Vestas ( the leading wind turbine manufacturer ) sees its market capitalisation reach EUR 15 - 20 billion , as foundries , steel makers , gearbox manufacturers , shipping companies and others see massively increasing orders coming their way from the wind industry , and as local farmers and public officials realize that they can get extra income , and extra local jobs , maybe the tide of " seriousness " will turn readily enough .
And as wind capacity installed each year continues to increase by 20 % or more each year worldwide , its share of world production will quickly reach undismissable levels .
This year , a number of symbolic threshholds were reached - 100GW of installed capacity , one exajoule of annual electricity generation , 40 % of electricity produced from wind in Spain on some days .
All of this , essentially starting from scratch less than 10 years ago .
what will another 10 years bring us ?
Massive unreliability , as we need to wait for wind to blow to turn on our computers or our air conditioning ?
Or simply new ways to run the grid , as the experience of Denmark ( which has enjoyed a number of days when more than 100 % of its electricity needs was produced by wind ) or Spain shows ?
The French grid operator , RTE , long extremely wary of wind power and its unreliability , had this to say in its latest annual report ( big PDF , in French , see p.49 ) :
The second point is about wind 's contribution to peak demand : despite wind 's intermittency , wind farms reduce the need in thermal power plants to ensure the requisite level of supply security .
One can speak of substituted capacity .
The capacity substitution rate ( ratio of thermal capacity replaced to installed wind capacity ) is close to the average capacity factor of wind farms in winter ( around 30 % ) for a small proportion of wind in the system ( a few GW ) .
It goes down as that proportion increases , but remains above 20 % with around 15 GW of wind power .
Intermittency is a real issue , but it is one that can be dealt with at what , so far , appears to be an extremely low cost - investment in the grid , something that 's useful in any case if we want resilient systems .
Ah , but wind farms are ugly !

Analysts fear that banks beyond Bear Stearns may be hard hit
The US Federal Reserve has cut a key lending rate , but the move failed to buoy investor confidence .
At one stage it took $ 1.5904 to buy one euro , before it strengthened to $ 1.5745 in late trade in New York .
With giant investment bank Bear Stearns needing an emergency rescue , there are concerns other banks may follow suit .
The dollar also weakened to 95.72 yen , its lowest since August 1995 .
" It has certainly been something of an historic weekend , with an emergency Fed rate cut and news that JP Morgan intends to acquire Bear Stearns marking the next chapter in the credit crisis , " said James Hughes of CMC Markets in London .
" Unsurprisingly this has been broadly bad news for the dollar with [ the ] euro - dollar managing a short - lived breach above 1.5900 , " he said .
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson declined to speculate on potential intervention in currency markets to support the dollar .
He said that the US government had a " strong dollar policy " , which was in the nation 's interest .
' Alarming '
JP Morgan Chase is set to acquire Bear Stearns , Wall Street 's fifth - largest investment bank , for $ 2 a share - a fraction of its previous value .
" This is not the kind of help you want to see .
Bear Stearns getting sold at $ 2 is alarming , " said Peter Boockvar , equity strategist at Miller Tabak in New York .
" When you see the Fed relying on tools that have n't been used since the Depression , it 's alarming , " he said .
In a surprise move on Sunday , the US central bank lowered the discount rate - the rate given to financial institutions - to 3.25 % from 3.5 % .
As the greenback continues to weaken , investors are opting to place their money in commodities , contributing to the sharp rise in oil prices .
Sweet crude oil climbed to a new high approaching $ 112 a barrel , before later slipping back to around $ 106 .
" Gold will be the main beneficiary [ of the falling dollar ] as a hedge against global risk , " said Australia & New Zealand Bank senior commodities analyst Mark Pervan .
George Carlin , one of the most important social critics of the last half - century , is dead .
Carlin , like he was for millions , was a formative influence on my youth , and via the collective youths of multiple generations , the national consciousness .
He will forever be remembered for being part of the wave of comedians that turned simple humor into biting social commentary — the children of Lenny Bruce .
It strikes me that , in many ways , Carlin had turned himself into a modern Socrates , always questioning our words , thoughts , and actions , and finding himself disappointed in the lack of reflection in the rest of us .
Carlin acknowledged this in perhaps his most important routine :
“ I love words .
I thank you for hearing my words .
I want to tell you something about words that I uh , I think is important .
I love , as I say , they ’re my work , they ’re my play , they ’re my passion .
Words are all we have really . ”
The Seven Words routine was a milestone not just because Carlin managed to highlight the dilemma at the core of the modern condition , but also because it gave us a landmark Supreme Court case on freedom of speech that highlights how dangerous words can be to the guardians of mainstream mores , FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation .
Carlin ’s monologue , played on Pacifica Radio in NYC , engendered a dispute as to what constituted decent speech on broadcast media — and the Court decided that the population needed to be protected from hearing those “ deadly ” words spoken by Carlin , who had done so in an effort to help us enlighten ourselves about the power of speech .
Justice William Brennan , writing in a stinging dissent from the majority on that decision , stated that : “ because the radio is undeniably a public medium , these actions are more properly viewed as a decision to take part , if only as a listener , in an ongoing public discourse . ”
Censorship of language is an attempt to silence this public discourse , to stifle thoughts , actions , and ideas .
George Carlin understood this perfectly well .
Carlin was concerned with pointing out how we , as a society , have started using euphemistic language as a way to avoid dealing with tough concepts .
This is a corollary — and perhaps more dangerous than the official censorship — to the FCC ’s abrogation of speech on TV and radio : self - censorship .
In one of his books he noted :
“ I mentioned several reasons we seem to employ so much of it [ euphemistic language ] : the need to avoid unpleasant realities ; the need to make things sound more important than they are … but no matter what the purpose , the one thing euphemisms all have in common is that they soften the language .
They portray reality as less vivid .
And I ’ve noticed Americans have a problem with reality ; they prefer to avoid the truth and not look it in the eye .
I think it ’s one of the consequences of being fat and prosperous and too comfortable . ”
Of course , the easy political examples are those we ’ve been familiar with for a time now : George W. Bush ’s “ enemy combatants , ” the “ homicide ” bombers , collateral damage .
Carlin was adept at pointing these out along with the more common expressions we use between friends and colleagues .
Religious , political , and cultural hypocrites were not spared his withering gaze — I once noted how a portion of his audience left during one of his anti-religious diatribes at a concert of his that I attended .
So what , then , is Carlin ’s legacy ?
At the end of another of his famous routines he said that “ the planet is fine , the people are fucked . ”
He was amused with our capacity to , essentially , kill ourselves off as a species .
He said that :
“… it amuses me .
Because it means the system is beginning to collapse , beginning to break down .
I enjoy chaos and disorder .
Not just because they help me professionally ; they ’re also my hobby .
I ’m an entropy buff . ”
We are inundated with food yet prices are rising and people starve ; we are awash in oil and prices have never been higher ; we are aware of the effects of human - caused global warming and most of us choose to do nothing except complain about the weather ; our government openly lies and violates Constitutional rights and all we do is shrug .
Carlin ’s choice was not to simply laugh at the downward spiral we were all on ( by our choice ) ; that is too superficial a reading of his humor .
He was deeply concerned by the stupidity and violence we do to each other through laws , morals , and simply not acting .
His legacy , I think , is that our understanding of speech , of words , and our constant questioning of their meaning and use is our only outlet to discovering potential truths , to exposing lies , and perhaps building a world that ’s a little nicer to live in , or at least , a little more amusing .
It is , perhaps , a call to action , to understand that he was bitterly disappointed in how passive most people are in the face of injustice .
In that respect , those of us who are political activists , or even those of us who are just trying to make small changes in our lives , could learn from Carlin to keep thinking and to be the gadfly that wo n’t let things rest , to tell the truth about the world in which we live .
Carlin , of course , put it best :
“ Here ’s the Secret News :
All people are afraid .
No one knows what they ’re doing .
Everything is getting worse .
Some people deserve to die .
Your money is worthless .
No one is properly dressed .
At least one of your children will disappoint you .
The system is rigged .
Your house will never be completely clean .
All teachers are incompetent .
There are people who really dislike you .
Nothing is as good as it seems .
Things do n’t last .
No one is paying attention .
The country is dying .
God does n’t care .
Shhhhhh . ”

Study : Young adults now find porn more acceptable
Availability online may be a factor
College students , including young women , are far more accepting of pornography than their parents , a shift that might be related to easy access to porn on the Internet , a study reports today .
Most young women in the study said they personally did not use porn , but nearly half said viewing X - rated material was an acceptable way to express sexuality .
Only 37 % of the fathers and 20 % of the mothers surveyed agreed .
The attitude of the young women and men in the study might be influenced by pornographic images that have proliferated on the Internet in the past 10 years , says Jeffrey Arnett , the editor of the Journal of Adolescent Research , which will publish the study in January .
In the 1980s , young adults had to go to a store and ask for the porn magazines , which often were kept behind the counter .
But Arnett says kids today are the first generation in which X - rated images can be pulled up with wireless technology from a hand - held device .
" We 're in an age of pocket porn , " says study author Jason Carroll .
Carroll , a social sciences researcher at Brigham Young University , and his colleagues studied 813 college students from six schools across the USA .
The students went online and answered questions about their views on pornography .
The researchers found that young men were much more likely to use pornography : 86 % reported that they viewed such material in the past year .
The study also found that one in five young men said they viewed pornographic material every day or nearly every day .
But only 31 % of young women reported any viewing of pornography .
Only 3.2 % said they saw such material weekly or daily .
The gender differences in use and acceptance raise a lot of questions , Arnett says .
For example , will the college students change their attitudes toward porn as they get older and form stable relationships ?
Young women who say they are tolerant of viewing Internet porn might not be so accepting of a spouse who 's visiting an X - rated site every day , he says .
The study also linked regular porn use with risky behaviors , Carroll says .
Regular porn users were more likely to go on drinking binges and more likely to have sex with multiple partners .
Additional studies must be done to determine whether frequent porn use leads to greater acceptance of such behavior , which can put students at risk for a host of health problems , such as alcoholism and sexually transmitted diseases , he says .
Children and teenagers are regularly bombarded with X - rated and suggestive images that imply that casual hook - ups are the norm , says Sabrina Weill , editor in chief of MomLogic , a website that helps mothers deal with a variety of parenting problems .
" It 's really important for mothers to have a frank conversation with their kids , " she says , because children who can talk openly to their parents are more likely to go on to make wise decisions in college .
Why is Big Oil still receiving tax breaks ?
I ’m fine with giving tax incentives to help create green energy ( except not for ethanol ) but for the life of me , I ca n’t figure out why the oil industry is still receiving welfare from Americans .
As the industry sets historical profits , there should be no reason whatsoever to give them a penny .
When oil was $ 10 / barrel and Congress was too stupid to think about the future , perhaps .
But today ?
Are you kidding me ?
The same GOP Congress that never believed in helping individual Americans during times of need and the same people who now want rebate checks for wealthy Americans can surely appreciate this issue , right ?
While it may make sense to help an industry during troubled times , oil is now setting new records quarter after quarter and can surely function on their own .
If they can ’t , they may need to get out of that business and shut the doors .
Moving forward , Congress and our next President should look closer at how we can help businesses that are building the energy for the future .
If we can afford to give Big Oil handouts , we surely can find money for green energy .
Besides helping the country move away from oil , this will be a fast growing sector that will add jobs .
The GOP should put aside the silly argument over the reality of global warming and just understand that this is an emerging market .
Growing this industry means new jobs , new business and new money for everyone .
All of this is dependent on the US getting started now , not in 10 years when the market is already set .
Is that such a hard thing to understand ?
I love it when some snotty punk kid gets taken down a peg or two , and the mother of one particular teenager has truly delivered .
The boy was expected to perform chores , but he had other ideas .
Rather than do something to earn his sordid keep , he decided instead to break the vacuum cleaner so he did n't have to do any work .
Well , his mother decided that an eye was worth an eye , and is now selling his Xbox 360 to pay for it :
My son seems to think everything should be handed to him on a silver platter , so the XBOX is going bye bye .
I do have an assortment of games as well , that I will sell for $ 15 each .
Price is firm , must replace vaccum that he broke thinking that would get him out of having to do chores .
As if that was n't bad enough for the hapless spawn , his mother has also informed the world that she 's busted him for looking at porn sites .
His Internet access is now safely locked behind a password and his mother also apparently put a picture of Snoopy on his MySpace .
Is it just me , or does this woman sound like the most kick - ass mother in the world ?
In all seriousness , this mother is taking no crap from her son and is showing him that if he wants to act like a jackass , there will be consequences .
If more parents did this rather than blame outside sources for their brats ' bad behavior , we'd be living in a much , much better world .
Kudos to that woman .

There are numerous ways to express one ’s creativity .
While some find comfort through virtual expression ( websites and such ) , others find that real intervention helps to better express themselves .
A friend of mine sent me this link , to the Mark Jenkins website , and I thought it would be nice to share it with you .
Although it has no direct relation to graphic design , it shows how creativity and inspiration can be drawn from simple daily occurrences , like walking down the street for example , and we should n’t limit the possibilities of artistic expression to our computers screens .

Struggling as we are with the housing bust , the credit crunch , shrinking consumption , rising unemployment and faltering business investment , we can be forgiven for thinking that all the big shoes have dropped .
There is another one up there , however , and it is about to come down .
State and city governments have yet to shrink the economy ; indeed , they have even managed to prop it up .
They have quietly maintained their spending at pre-crisis levels even as they warn of numerous cutbacks forced on them by declining tax revenues .
The cutbacks , however , are written into budgets for a fiscal year that begins on July 1 , a month away .
In the meantime the states and cities , often drawing on rainy - day savings , have carried their share of the load for the national economy .
That share is gigantic .
At $ 1.8 trillion annually in a $ 14 trillion economy , the states and municipalities spend almost twice as much as the federal government , including the cost of the Iraq war .
When librarians , lifeguards , teachers , transit workers , road repair crews and health care workers disappear , or airport and school construction is halted , the economy trembles .
None of that , or very little , has happened so far , not even in California , despite a significant decline in tax revenue .
“ We are looking at a $ 4 billion cut to public schools and deep cuts that will result in thousands of Californians losing their health care , ” said Jean Ross , executive director of the California Budget Project , offering a preview of coming hardships .
“ But the reality is we have not pulled money off the streets yet . ”
David Weinberger writes ,
" The FCC is suggesting that it will make a slice of spectrum available for free Internet access to users , so long as the providers filter out all the porn…and , if the filters do n't work , then the providers have to use ' other means , ' which presumably might include blocking entire application types or protocols , or blocking encrypted data .
It includes filtering p2 p traffic .
The idea is now open for public comment .
One of the prominent supporters of this idea , M2Z , which is bidding for it , bills itself as a ' free family friendly broadband ' company . "

IT 業界うわさの彼女という特集ページが CNET
Japan にある。どうしてマグラスみづ紀さんにインタビューをオファーせんのだ！ というのはともかくとして、一つ気になった回がある。
「 楽天ブックスの姉貴はキラキラ輝く仕事人」の2ページ目にあるタイムスケジュールが無茶苦茶なのだ。
もちろんこれが平均的一日ではないのかもしれないが、睡眠2時間半なんてワタシなんか日常的には絶対できんね。
「玄関から先には仕事を入れないことに決めてるの」と仰るが、朝の7時半から深夜24時まで会社にいて、なお家に仕事に持ち込んだら、それは単なる「無能」だろう（実は大して仕事してねーだろ、という意見もある）。
しかも25時半に帰宅（24時に「帰社」って書いてあるが、これは「退社」の間違いだろう）してから「旦那様へ夕飯の支度」って、それ「夕飯」言わんよ。
つーか、深夜1時半に帰宅した妻に飯の支度をさせるこの「旦那様」はバカですか？
自分で作るなり、外で食っとくなりしろよ（夫が事情により生活が不規則という可能性もあるが）。
しかし、これだけ時間に切迫した生活を送りながら、わざわざ行き付けの店で帰りに軽く一杯とかしていて（さっさと帰れよ）、いやはや、できる女の演出も大変ですね、と思った次第。

On February 7 , an internal Obama campaign spreadsheet leaked in the press .
It contained the campaign ’s predictions for all of the remaining primaries .
Now that the primaries are over , we have the opportunity to judge the accuracy of Obama ’s prognosticators , who , as everyone knows by now , showed remarkable prescience in their planning this campaign season .
Below are the spreadsheet ’s popular vote and delegate predictions compared to actual results .
The numbers show that the Obama campaign strategists were routinely too conservative : they underpredicted both the margins of their victories and their losses .
They often anticipated a close to 50 - 50 split in a state that turned out to seriously favor one of the two candidates .
Of the states they predicted correctly , they underpredicted their margin of victory ( aka were too pessimistic ) in 16 states and underpredicted their margin of loss ( aka were too optimistic ) in six .
They only overpredicted their margin of victory in two states , and never overpredicted a loss .
In total , they got 24 of the 27 primaries after February 5th correct .
Of the ones the campaign got wrong , they were too hopeful in South Dakota and Indiana , where they predicted victories but suffered losses , and were too pessimistic in Maine , where they predicted a close loss but actually saw a substantial victory .
They nailed the delegate count exactly in five states , and were within one delegate in five more .
They predicted their delegate count to within five delegates in 23 of the 27 primaries .

Somalia was racked by violence Tuesday , as suspected Islamist insurgents killed government soldiers and seized territories throughout the capital , Mogadishu , in a backlash against a US missile strike earlier this month that killed a leader who the US says had links to Al Qaeda .
Further highlighting the deteriorating law - and - order situation , two foreign aid workers were kidnapped at gunpoint from the capital .
The incidents came just a week after peace talks sponsored by the United Nations failed to produce an agreement between Islamist forces and the Somalian government .
Agence France - Press reports that at least 10 people were killed in violence yesterday .
Islamic extremist insurgent attacks killed at least 10 people Tuesday in and around the Somali capital Mogadishu , witnesses and officials told AFP .
Three government soldiers and two civilians died when insurgents armed with machine guns and rockets ambushed a checkpoint manned by Somali soldiers around 15 kilometres ( nine miles ) south of Mogadishu …
In a separate incident , a joint Somali and Ethiopian patrol was struck by a roadside bomb blast near a former military academy in southern Mogadishu .
Violence has been growing in Somalia since 2006 , when neighboring Ethiopia , with support from Washington , launched a military operation inside Somalia to oust an Islamist movement that had seized control of the capital and other cities , Voice of America reports .
Islamist insurgents launch almost - daily attacks on Somali government forces and allied Ethiopian troops .
More than a year of fighting has killed thousands of Somalis and displaced hundreds of thousands more , mostly from Mogadishu .
The Islamists are trying to create a fundamentalist state , and there is barely any educated class to work against them , writes Mark Bowden , author of " Black Hawk Down , " in the Philadelphia Inquirer .
[ The ] Islamist radicals ... care about society as a whole , but only insofar as they can shape it to their own zealous ends .
They impose their harsh interpretation of sharia , or Muslim law ...
One of the things Somalia lacks is a capable , homegrown movement of educated , determined nationalists capable of fending off the religious radicals , disarming and controlling the warlords , and standing up for the interests of people who just want a stable , civil society .
Time magazine reported that the US has bombed Somalia five times since the Ethiopian army launched its operation in 2006 .
The U.S. missile strike that killed Somalia 's most notorious Islamist insurgent , Aden Hashi Ayro , has dealt a major blow to al - Qaeda 's allies operating in East Africa …
Ayro had been trained by al - Qaeda in Afghanistan in the late 1990s , where he later fought alongside the Taliban against the Northern Alliance and the U.S. before returning to Somalia in 2003 to join — and quickly come to lead — a group of Somali and foreign radical militants that had been established by Osama bin Laden in remote swamps in the southeast of the country .
It was this group that Washington blames for the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , and for the 2002 attack on an Israeli - owned hotel in Kenya , as well as several other attempted atrocities .
While the US airstrike in May appeared to have been the first to take out a key target , many had questioned its impact , reported The Christian Science Monitor .
The Associated Press reports that the increasing violence this month appears to be a backlash against that missile strike on Somalia 's highest level Al Qaeda leader in May .
Earlier this month , the insurgents vowed to avenge the May 1 death of Hashi Aden Ayro , the leader of the Islamic al - Shabab militia , who was killed in a U.S. missile strike at his home in central Somalia .
Somalia has long been a focal point of US military intervention , particularly during the 1990s , when a failed attempt to capture a Mogadishu warlord resulted in the " Black Hawk Down " debacle , in which 18 US soldiers were killed by Somalian militias , reported Time magazine .
More recently , however , the focus has been on terrorism , and particularly on Ayro as he rose up the chain of command in Al Qaeda 's East African operations .
Adding to the sense of unrest , two Italian aid workers were taken at gunpoint Tuesday .
Islamists had earlier vowed to kidnap foreigners in retaliation for Ayro 's death , the Associated Press reports .
The uptick in violence comes just days after failed peace talks in Djibouti , where the UN attempted unsuccessfully to broker an agreement between the government and the Islamist forces that were ousted by Ethopia 's military , the BBC reports .
Peace talks on Somalia have broken up without any face - to - face discussions between the government and the main opposition alliance .
After four days meeting UN diplomats in Djibouti , the two sides agreed to attend further talks in two weeks time .
... the peace talks [ were held ] between the government and the Asmara - based Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia , which includes leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) .
The UIC ruled much of Somalia in 2006 before being ousted by Ethiopian forces backed by Somali government troops , who have been struggling to exert their control over the country ever since .
Al - Shabab , the militant wing of the UIC , did not attend the talks .
More than 100,000 air travelers across the nation wrestled with flight cancellations , long lines and ruined vacation plans Wednesday as American Airlines continued to ground planes for maintenance inspections and said more disruptions were coming in the days ahead .
American Airlines canceled 1,100 flights Wednesday and said it expected to scrub at least 900 more flights today while it inspects and makes adjustments to wiring bundles on its fleet of 300 MD - 80 aircraft .
There has been a string of air travel disruptions caused by maintenance inspections in recent weeks .
The latest cancellations that began Tuesday created chaotic conditions at several major airports around the country , including Los Angeles International , where American is the biggest carrier in terms of passenger boardings .
Passengers complained of jammed phone lines to American ticket agents and a lack of warning from the carrier ’s computerized travel update system .
“ We know we have to fly and we have no say - so , ” said Ron Ensz , 52 , who was trying to get home to Wichita , Kan .
“ They tell us to wait in line like cows , we wait in line like cows . ”

Adding to the problems : Alaska Airlines canceled 25 flights -- including one at LAX -- while it performed checks on its MD - 80s .
American said the inspections were prompted by a Federal Aviation Administration spot check Monday related to the agency ’s airworthiness directives , which spell out precise procedures for keeping the nation ’s air fleet in top condition .
Many travelers waiting at LAX said they did n’t understand why the airline would inconvenience so many travelers if there was n’t any danger .
And one travel expert said the repeated maintenance - related cancellations were taking a toll .
“ Travelers cannot count on the air travel system as it stands right now , ” said Kevin Mitchell , head of the Business Travel Coalition .
About 40 % of members responding to a survey this week said they would be less likely to fly because of safety issues , Mitchell said .

At LAX , where American scrubbed 25 of its 92 scheduled departures , hundreds of travelers waited in a line that snaked through Terminal 4 to re-book their flights .
American employees set out cartons of orange juice , bottled water and coffee on a nearby table and handed out slips containing an apology and an 800 number , but few customers were mollified .
American Chief Executive Gerard Arpey , in Marina Del Rey to attend a conference of airline executives at the Ritz Carlton , apologized “ for the inconvenience that we have caused our customers because of the continued inspections of our MD - 80s . ”
“ We are doing everything possible to reaccommodate customers on other American Airlines flights or on other airlines .
We obviously failed to complete this airworthiness directive to the precise standards that the FAA requires , and I take full responsibility for that . ”
Many passengers said their biggest complaint was the lack of advance warning from the airline .
Although American said Tuesday that it was automatically notifying affected passengers , many said they did n’t find out about their travel disruptions until they arrived at the airport .
Advertisement
“ They did n’t get a message to me at all , ” said Colleen Betts , 63 , who was flying from Sydney , Australia , to visit her son in Denver .
“ For them to not let anybody know is just disgraceful .
It ’s just common courtesy to let people know . ”
Joe Sanders , owner of a home healthcare business , arrived at Palm Springs International Airport on Wednesday morning to find his flight to Omaha had been canceled .
Sanders , 69 , said the airline had n’t contacted him by phone or e-mail to warn him .
“ In fact , I got an e-mail from them this morning that said , ‘ Would n’t you like to print your boarding pass here before getting to the airport ? ’ ” he said .
American re-booked him on a flight from LAX to Omaha with a layover in Dallas , and shuttled Sanders and other passengers to LAX .
Advertisement
“ However , now that I ’m here , they ’ve informed me that Dallas to Omaha is now canceled , ” Sanders said .
“ So now I ’m not where I want to go , and I do n’t know what ’s happening .
I ’m sure tired of standing in line . ”
American reportedly had to shut down its automated flight re-booking system after the computer began assigning passengers to MD - 80 flights that were then canceled .
As the cancellations rolled through American ’s schedule , some customers received e-mails saying they had been rebooked on another flight , only to receive a subsequent e-mail saying that flight had been canceled too .
And passengers at LAX said the 800 number they were told to call to re-book their flights was jammed with calls .
Although American said it would re-book passengers on its flights and on those of other airlines , it ’s tough to find empty seats as carriers cram more people on planes .
American ’s flights were 84 % full in March .
Advertisement
Flights were also canceled at airports in Orange County , San Diego , Ontario and Burbank .
Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago ’s O’Hare International Airport , American ’s two biggest hubs , were hardest hit Wednesday , with 337 and 168 flights canceled , respectively .
Including its American Eagle subsidiary , American accounts for about 80 % of the traffic at Dallas - Fort Worth .
LAX , O’Hare and Dallas - Fort Worth are among the country ’s busiest airports .
The MD - 80s are the same planes that American took out of service two weeks ago for wiring inspections mandated by an FAA directive .
“ Our mechanics used to have a little latitude in accomplishing these airworthiness directives and that ’s no longer the case , ” American spokesman Tim Wagner said .
Advertisement
The abruptness of Wednesday ’s cancellations may partly stem from American ’s hope that it would be allowed to inspect its MD - 80s in batches over several days .
But the airline decided to ground the entire fleet after discussions with FAA officials in Washington .
As of late Wednesday , American said it had inspected 179 of its MD - 80s .
Sixty had been returned to service , while 119 were undergoing work and 121 still needed to be inspected .
Last week , the FAA released findings from the first phase of an in - depth audit of maintenance practices at the nation ’s airlines .
The probe was launched after the agency fined Southwest Airlines $ 10.2 million in early March for missed safety inspections .
In addition to American and Alaska , Southwest , Delta Air Lines , American Eagle and United Airlines have had to cancel flights while maintenance checks were carried out .
Advertisement
The FAA said it was conducting a related investigation of four airlines -- which it has not named -- for failing to comply with specific regulations .
Two of the carriers were cited for failing to complete inspections of wiring bundles .
American declined to say whether it was one of the carriers under investigation .
It ’s not clear how much the disruptions will cost American , although the price tag probably will climb into the millions of dollars .
Besides paying to fly its customers on competitors ’ airplanes , American is bearing the cost of feeding and housing passengers forced to stay overnight between destinations .
It is also giving out $ 500 travel vouchers to affected travelers .
For Betts from Australia , it was too little , too late .
She had been planning on visiting the States again in August , but is reconsidering the trip .

“ I do not think I could do this again , ” she said .

Getting from here to there
Contending with a canceled flight is a frustrating experience .
Travel experts offered these tips to help travelers get to their destinations :
Advertisement
Be aware : Know the status of your flight before you leave your home or hotel .
Have a plan : Identify travel alternatives early if you are on your way to a must - attend wedding or business meeting .
Take action :
If you get to the airport and find your flight has been axed , do n’t get in line with 100 other irate passengers and yell at the gate agent .
Grab the nearest phone and call the airline directly .
Be ready to pay :
If the squeeze is on and you have a restricted ticket , consider abandoning it and paying more for same - day travel .
You will have a better chance of getting a flight .
Advertisement
Consider other options :
Be flexible about the times you will fly and even the airports .
There might be seats on a later flight at a nearby airport .
Be nice !
If you are courteous to gate agents and other airline employees , you may get extra help .
Go online :
If you are still at home or otherwise near a computer , check your airline ’s website .
Be philosophical :
In the end , however , there ’s a good chance that there ’s not much you can do .
“ Sometimes you have to just tough it out , ” said Tim Winship , editor - at - large for SmarterTravel.com .
“ There are no easy answers . ”

Treason doth never prosper : what ’s the reason ?
For if it prosper , none dare call it treason .
Ovid
One interesting question within political theory is the question of when armed rebellion against a government is justified .
Most people that tackle this subject try to find some set of moral lines that a government must cross before it becomes illegitimate and thus armed rebellion becomes morally OK .
Being an anarchist I take a different tack .
To me , since there is no such thing as a legitimate government and any organization that steals or commits acts of aggression against innocent people is behaving immorally , the question is one more of practicality than morality .
The tax - man is another thief come to pick my pocket , and may morally be repelled with the same degree of violence directed toward any other thief .
However , such violence may be unwise .
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war , while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win .
Sun-tzu – The Art of War
In the late 19th century , as anarchism was coming into full flower , a significant faction of anarchists came to the conclusion that any government official , just like any extortionist or serial thief , could be attacked and even killed .
They even encouraged such assassinations , reasoning that if government officials faced a high likelihood of death , they would quit their jobs , replacements would be hard to find and that the state would become paralyzed .
They assassinated presidents and policemen , nobles and commoners .
The “ bomb throwing ” anarchist had a major influence on history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Far from weakening the state , their attacks strengthened it .
Why ?
Because they did not consider the effect of their attacks on society as a whole .
The vast majority of people did n’t think President McKinley was a gangster who needed killing .
Rather they were horrified by the nihilistic abandon of the anarchists and terrified that such violence would be visited upon them .
Rather than seeing the assassins ’ targets as villains , the vast majority of people saw them as victims and the laws proposed to check the depredations of these anarchists were greeted with wide popular support .
The Palmer crackdowns of World War I , the laws suppressing political speech opposed to the war and government ’s assumption of control over the economy were all justified as being necessary tools for government to protect the citizenry against the ‘ anarchist threat ’ .
If fate means you to lose , give him a good fight anyhow .
William McFee
Of course , just because a rebellion is doomed to failure does not mean that it should not be attempted .
Take the brave Poles who fought heroically against the Germans in the Warsaw Ghetto .
They had no chance of succeeding ; the Germans had more artillery pieces than the Poles had bullets , yet with the exception of a handful of people like Mahatma Ghandi , most human beings would consider their rebellion and fight to the death to be honorable and praiseworthy .
So where do we draw the line ?
Why was President McKinley ’s assassin wrong and Adolf Hitler ’s would - be assassin right ?
Remember , the U.S. Army was happily slaughtering Philipinos and committing atrocities against civilian populations during the McKinley administration .
To me , the criterion that establishes the appropriateness of armed rebellion is the question of what impact the rebellion will have on society as a whole .
Armed rebellion is rarely a good idea because it is very destructive to civil society .
The violence expands as innocent people are harmed .
People are forced to choose sides and choose reactively – driven to pick a side out of revenge or fear .
Neighbor turns against neighbor , brother against brother , and the wounds of war are not easily healed .
Often the victors establish a new more oppressive government to suppress their enemies than the one that was overthrown .
If we wish to live in a free society , then we must choose the actions that help bring about a free society .
A free society is only possible when a preponderance of the people choose freedom , choosing not only to live peaceably with their fellows , but to leap to their neighbors ’ defense when their neighbors are threatened .
A free society is only possible if , when someone like Ron Reiner proposes to force people to send their children to his indoctrination centers and to force 1 % of the population to pay for this operation , the idea is greeted with widespread derision and rejected out of hand .
It means that people choose to respect their neighbors and they resist the impulse to loot their neighbors .
War is not its own end , except in some catastrophic slide into absolute damnation .
It ’s peace that ’s wanted .
Some better peace than the one you started with .
Lois McMaster Bujold , The Vor Game
Therefore , to muster an effective resistance , a person must choose a set of actions that help bring about a more peaceful society .
Grabbing a rifle and shooting at those who oppress us as Carl Drega purported to do , no matter how tempting , is ultimately futile and counterproductive .
Not only does it not attract people to one ’s cause , but it provides the government with a opportunity to send out very persuasive propaganda to the effect that those who oppose the government are a menace to their neighbors and that the draconian measures that government officials take are needed to protect the citizenry from these dangerous non-conformists .
But we must also stand up against those who say that somehow this is all right , this is somehow a political act — people who say , I love my country , but I hate my government .
These people , who do they think they are saying that their government has stamped out human freedom ?
U.S. President Bill Clinton , Remarks at Emily ’s List Event , May 1 1995
To create a free society , we must persuade our neighbors to seek freedom .
We must persuade them to adopt our aims as their own .
This is done through speech and writing , by setting a public example through acts of civil disobedience .
Examples of these forms of resistance includes such steps as
Videotaping police operations and publishing them on youtube .
Inventing new technologies that make bad laws impossible to enforce .
Befriending law enforcement officers and persuading them to question the bad laws they enforce .
Organizing mass movements that publicize the pro-freedom cause .
Flouting unjust laws in a manner that elicits public contempt for them .
The Revolution was effected before the War commenced .
The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people ; a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations .
This radical change in the principles , opinions , sentiments , and affections of the people , was the real American Revolution .
John Adams
What is needed is a propaganda war , and these are the tools of the effective propagandist .
Most people do have a rudimentary emotional sense of justice and the most effective forms of resistance are ones that evoke it .
The goal is to have everyone , including government officials , rally to one ’s cause .
Is violence never appropriate ?
Hardly .
Violence is appropriate when both of the following conditions are met :
The violence must be proportionate to the aggression being resisted .
The violence cannot be overly destructive or murderous .
It must rather be at the minimum level to end whatever aggression one is defending against .
Should the aggressor end his aggression and withdraw , the violence must end .
This latter point is very important , since the only way a peaceful and freer society is going to happen is if the rebellion ends with the survivors willing to live peaceably with each other .
And , of course , the violence cannot be aimed at innocent individuals .
The picture to the right is not ‘ collateral damage ’ – it is murder !
The violence will not make things worse .
This requires that one of the following two conditions are met ,
The majority , or a sizeable minority of the populace supports the rebels ’ aims but refuses to act out of fear .
In the early 1920 ’s , as the Bolsheviks sought to establish control over the Russian empire , the GRU prosecuted a terror campaign against the citizenry .
At any time of day there could be a knock on the door , or an agent seizing hold of a victim on the street or in their workplace .
The victims would be bundled off to be tortured and , all to frequently , shot without even the pretense of a show trial to justify their murder .
One Russian writer who witnessed this reign of terror commented that had one in ten households met the GRU agents with clubs and knives , it would have stopped the organization in its tracks .
The GRU counted on fear and its ability to prevent its victims from acting in concert to enable their murderous campaign .
When one faces certain death like the Poles facing deportation to Treblinka .
In this case one has absolutely nothing to lose .
But if those criteria are not met , then violent rebellion is probably counterproductive and should be avoided .
In the vast majority of cases , these criteria are simply not met .

Found this when I went to the site 5 minutes ago :
The image is a link thats takes you to this website .
The website is apparently designed to combat this FRA .
“ Everything you do on the network will be monitored ,
All your phone calls will be intercepted ” is the headline .
Google translator says the title , StoppaFraLagen , means “ Stop the FRA Law ”
On Wikipedia it says it ’s Sweden ’s version of the NSA combined with the RIAA .
It ’s had a run-in with the Swedish Pirate Party plus conducts email and phone wiretapping .
Hm .
Not only does the Pirate Bay borrow the front page , now they ’re using it for social and political issues .
I ’m looking forward to seeing the ship decked with Christmas lights .

Monash University research into heavy metal contaminant levels in dolphins from Port Phillip Bay and the Gippsland Lakes has revealed high mercury levels may be a contributing factor to dolphin deaths
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Researchers from the School of Biological Sciences have confirmed levels of mercury found in the dolphins were within a range considered to cause negative health and mental effects and were higher than mercury levels found in populations around the world .
Supervisory researcher Dr Ross Thompson said the mercury concentrations in 20 live and eight dolphins which died after becoming stranded , collected over the last two years , were measured by Honours student Alissa Monk .
Levels in the dead dolphins averaged 3.45 milligrams of mercury per kilogram of tissue compared to 1.32 mg/kg in living dolphins .
" Mercury levels detected are sufficient to cause significant health impacts and were comparable to those found in areas of the world that are considered highly polluted , including the Mediterranean Sea , " Dr Thompson said .
Mercury has been shown in previous national studies to bioaccumulate in dolphins , but this is the first study to find particularly high levels in stranded animals in coastal Victoria .
Bioaccumulation is the food chain process whereby smaller fish containing mercury are eaten by larger mercury contaminated fish , which are then consumed by dolphins , who can consume up to ten kilograms of fish a day .
Mercury levels found in fish were considered low ( < 0.5 mg/ kg ) and were fine for human consumption .
" Dolphins may be becoming stranded as a direct consequence of mercury contamination which damages their neurological system .
They become potentially confused and disorientated , and strand themselves .
Even the apparently healthy dolphins had high levels of mercury which put them at risk of future health complications , " Dr Thompson said .
Dr Thompson said mercury is likely to have come from the sediments of the Bay and researchers are concerned that dredging activities may increase the dolphins ' exposure .
" Sediment contains mercury , which is likely to have originated from historical gold mining sites where mercury was used in gold processing , as well as from other industrial sources .
Over time , the mercury has been washed down through waterways , including the Yarra River , and come to rest on the bottom of the Bay , " Dr Thompson said .
Dr Thompson said it was critical that further studies were done throughout the bay dredging process to ensure any further decline in dolphin health could be identified and managed .

Architects who question the NIST and 911 Commission Reports on technical grounds , are aware that Sibel knows the reports are wrong , and are starting to get some press .
The media is showing flesh and anything else they can to cover up the story , and are thereby damaging Britney like they are trying to damage the public .

Perhaps the defense in the upcoming AIPAC trial of Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman is too partisan and considers Sibel to dangerous to consider this , but I wonder , given they are subpoenaing folks like Marc Grossman and Condi Rice , if that 's being done in any kind of confrontational way , that they might consider putting Sibel on the stand too !
Somehow I doubt it .
But it seems like that angle should be researched to make sure there 's not door to open there !

Perhaps she 's trying to push the idea that she should monetize the use of her underwear for ad or other paid content space , and her handlers think she 's gone of the deep end where she might be being smart ( or paranoid , depending on who 's asking her to put what on it ) .

# 6 Calipendence given they are subpoenaing folks like Marc Grossman and Condi Rice , if that 's being done in any kind of confrontational way , Last time I seen Condi Rice under oath , she behaved like a Teenager that just got popped smoking weed in the school bathroom .
( I would have defined her as a hostile witness )
Without removing them from power and being protected by executive power they will not be forthcoming .
And even still , they may decide to claim they do n't recall .
. . or rig something at higher levels .
They can not even get Blackwater to admit they might have killed Iraqi civilians .
Come on , no thinking person believes that nonsense .
Just last week be accidentally blew up some contractors !
This administration just continues to claim they did nothing wrong .
So , I 'd have to say the only way to get to the bottom of any of this is to get it and all it 's appointees , judges , and cronies out as soon as possible .
There 's where the importance of paper ballots hand counted with public oversight , and an unbroken chain of custody come into play .
There may be some exceptions to this but I Doubt it .
I pointed out a week or two ago Technical Amendments to the Regulations Providing Whistleblower Protection for Federal Bureau of Investigation Employees and if that ain't changing Sibel 's situation , then it 's like I am suggesting , the problem is deeper and at higher levels of government .
But I ai n't no lawyer , and I ain't no journalist .
Seems like if the DOJ is going to amend rules to give FBI Whistleblower 's protection , and yet we still can't get Sibel 's case to see the light of day , we 'll be needing more than some words on an amendment ( 28 CFR ) printed on papers somewhere collecting dust .
These people do n't want any cracks to allow the light to come in and the truth to get out .

In a cloudless sky , above the market towns and green and pleasant fields of Warwickshire , it is hard to believe that it is worth the effort of the Environment Agency to map in painstaking detail every bump and dip of the terrain down below .
But the project - to plot the topography of England and Wales to within six inches of accuracy - is seen as a vital first step in preparing the country to face the emerging threat of flash flooding from tropical - style downpours .
Fitted to the floor of a leased aircraft is a Lidar unit which fires a laser beam downwards 100,000 times every second , scanning a swath of land up to 600 m wide .
So far , 56 % of England and Wales have been surveyed , with the focus now on the urban areas most at risk from torrential surface water during heavy storms .

On board , scientist Chris O'Dwyer activates the laser for a series of passes one mile long and watches the data stream into a bank of consoles .
During our flight , he told me : " The difference between an area flooding and not flooding is 6ins and the data we are gathering here has an accuracy in elevation of about 15 cm .
That could be the difference between the water flowing over the threshold of somebody 's doorstep and not . "
The result is a highly detailed series of three - dimensional maps .
I was shown one of Hull , one of the most vulnerable cities and badly hit last summer .
Unexpected deluge
The aim is to create a basic database to which local authorities , water companies and private businesses can then add their own information about drains and water courses - to try to provide the best possible estimate of the locations most at risk from flash flooding .
It is a huge task .
Although Hull is used to the threat of flooding from the sea and from the River Humber , the flooding last June was caused by an intense and unexpected deluge .
A total of 8,647 homes was affected along with 91 out of 99 schools in the area .
And even now , nearly one year on , 547 families are still living in caravans .
The head of flood risk at the Environment Agency , Phil Rothwell , told the BBC that an urgent and nationwide effort to prepare for downpours was now needed .
" I think this is a very big issue .
We saw last week monsoon - style rainfall in Oxfordshire .
This is the sort of thing we can expect more of in the future - very local , very heavy rain .
" We saw last year the floods demonstrated that over half the property was flooded by water on its way to the rivers , not coming from the rivers .
It 's flash flooding , urban flooding . "
And Mr Rothwell appealed for better co-ordination to tackle surface water flooding - to have a single organisation in charge of overseeing the running of all the systems for handling flash floods .
" If we do n't get the management of our cities ' drainage structure right , this will be a continuing problem , even an increasing one , " he says .

post scriptum :
An interesting distinction .
This statement is intriguing .
I recall Michael Lewis making a similar point in his book The New New Thing : A Silicon Valley Story .
Michael pointed out that change was being driven by the young because they did n’t have any sense of self to hang on to .
This is crucial .
If you think of yourself as a — for example — Lisp Programmer , learning Factor and trying it on a project is not just an intellectual exercise , it ’s a shedding of a little of who you think you are .
If you have built software — successfully — using large teams with meticulous planning , working with a small team in a less structured setting is again more than an experiment , it ’s walking away from part of what you are .
When you are young , you do n’t have that sense of self to protect .
You ’re driven by a need to find out who you are , to turn the pages of your biography and see how the story turns out .
If people around you are doing something you do n’t understand , you assume the problem is your inexperience and you go to work trying to understand it .
But when you are old , when you know who you are , everything is different .
When people around you are doing something you do n’t understand , you have no trouble at all explaining why they aremistaken .
Let me give you an real - life example .
One of the examples I give for using andand is with regular expression matching .
I had a bunch of code that looked like this :
And being the type of person who dislikes the proliferation of mutable variables , I rewrote my code to look like this :
This week , I received a very tactful email from Cornelius Mika pointing out that Ruby has this use case covered :
My first reaction was rather unprintable .
I have read the documentation for the String class many times , but for some reason this never stuck .
My brain refused to parse the fact that [ ] means all of the following : Quite obviously , my brain is hanging onto a bunch of stuff about regularity , and discoverability , and languages consisting of a small number of features that interact in powerful ways .
I do n’t understand why [ ] means index sometimes but search some others .
Why does ' string ' [ 5 ] return a character , ' string ' [ 2,3 ] return a substring ( but not the same substring as ' string ' [ 2..3 ] ) and ' string '[ regexp , 1 ] look kinda sorta like but ' string '[ regexp ] [ 1 ] but with maybe Monad semantics thrown in ?
I am confused , and that is before thinking about the fact that [ ] also means “ call ” for lambdas !
As you can see I was mightily resisting the idea that sometimes , a useful tool consists of a collection of things you need , put within easy reach .
I know that I need the semantics that both my andand example and ' string '[ regexp , 1 ] provide , and I simply need to embrace the Ruby way of doing it for a while .
Recognizing that we need to let go of ourselves in order to learn and grow is difficult .
Part of my job is to bring my experience to the table , to guide and grow the team using the things I have learned .
But I also have to accept that there are things I still must learn .
And because I am a fully formed person , to make room for a new idea I must be willing to let go of an old one , I must be willing to chuck a piece of myself overboard .
How do I know when to hold fast and when to try something new ?
I do n’t .
Sometimes when a bunch of people are doing something , and my gut tells me they ’re mistaken , I override my gut and try it , I go along with what everybody else is doing .
If you want a new idea , you have to silence your inner critic .
Your sense of right and wrong , of smart and stupid works by comparing new ideas to what you already know .
Your sense of what would be a good fit for you works by comparing new things to who you already are .
To learn and grow , you must let go of you , you must be young again , you must accept that you do n’t understand and seek to understand rather than explaining why it does n’t make any sense .

A futures contract is an agreement to deliver a specific amount of a commodity  5,000 bushels of wheat , say  on a certain date in the future .
Such contracts are important hedging tools for farmers , grain elevators , commodity processors and anyone with a stake in future grain prices .
A futures contract that calls for delivery of wheat in July may trade for more or less for each bushel than today ’s cash market price .
But as each day goes by , its price should move a bit closer to that day ’s cash price .
And on expiration day , when the bushels of wheat covered by that futures contract are due for delivery , their price should very nearly match the price in the cash market , allowing for a little market friction or major delivery disruptions like Hurricane Katrina .
But on dozens of occasions since early 2006 , the futures contracts for corn , wheat and soybeans have expired at a price that was much higher than that day ’s cash price for those grains .
For example , soybean futures contracts expired in July at a price of $ 9.13 a bushel , which was 80 cents higher than the cash price that day , Professor Irwin said .
In August , the futures expired at $ 8.62 , or 68 cents above the cash price , and in September , the expiration price was $ 9.43 , or 78 cents above the cash price .
Corn has been similarly eccentric .
A corn futures contract expired last September at $ 3.36 , which was a remarkable 55 cents above the cash price , but the contract that expired in March 2007 was roughly even with the cash price .
“ As far as I know , nothing like this has ever happened in the corn market , ” said Professor Irwin .
Wheat futures had been especially prone to this phenomenon , going back several years .
Indeed , the 2007 study by Professor Irwin and his colleagues concluded that wheat price distortions reflected a “ failure to accomplish one of the fundamental tasks of a futures market . ”
And while the situation improved sharply for wheat futures in Chicago late last year , it deteriorated for futures traded in Kansas City .
And it has gotten worse for corn and soybeans , Professor Irwin said .
Many people have a theory about why this is happening , but none of them seem to cover all the available facts .
Mary Haffenberg , a spokeswoman for the CME Group , which owns the Chicago Board of Trade , where these contracts trade , said the anomalies might be a temporary result of “ a lot of shocks to the system , ” including sharp increases in worldwide food demand , uncertainty about supplies and surging commodity investments .

Giant agribusinesses are enjoying soaring earnings and profits out of the world food crisis which is driving millions of people towards starvation , The Independent on Sunday can reveal .
And speculation is helping to drive the prices of basic foodstuffs out of the reach of the hungry .
The prices of wheat , corn and rice have soared over the past year driving the world ’s poor – who already spend about 80 per cent of their income on food – into hunger and destitution .
The World Bank says that 100 million more people are facing severe hunger .
Yet some of the world ’s richest food companies are making record profits .
Monsanto last month reported that its net income for the three months up to the end of February this year had more than doubled over the same period in 2007 , from $ 543 m ( £ 275 m ) to $ 1.12 bn .
Its profits increased from $ 1.44bn to $ 2.22bn .

Vijay had been playing video games his whole life , but he ’d never really become addicted to one until the first incarnation of Fuck Me.
Adding an element of real - time strategy to the already - frenetic Gestalt Warrior combined construction , emergent behavior , and blob - themed violence in a way that both Vijay and the Selfish GAME found satisfying .
Game addiction burns hot and fast , unless the game itself keeps changing .
Having spawned Fuck Me , the Selfish GAME shuffled its pedigree and came out with Super Fuck Me .
This led to Ms. Fuck Me , which begat Fuck Me Heels , Fuck Me Millennium Edition , Let ’s Have A Meaningful Relationship , and other profane heralds of blob megadeath culminating in Fuck Me Harder , which was too complex for anyone not skilled at earlier iterations .
Fuck Me Harder put Vijay ’s brain through strange transformations and he did not do well on the phone while playing it .
“ Yes , hello , Rodney , ” he said , cradling the fake cell phone against his neck .
He reached for the laptop keyboard , waving away the dangling cord that connected the Sabertooth set to his real cell phone .
“ Is this a random call ?
‘ Cause I ’m kind of busy . ”
Vijay had met Rodney at a conference he ’d attended only to give a paper about the SimShitty fab layout program .
Their only shared interest was making meaningless phone calls to fool NSA data miners .
“ Is that noise real ? ” asked Rodney .
“ It sounds like glitch metal . ”
“ I ’m playing a game , ” said Vijay .
The Selfish GAME did not understand soundtracks or sound effects , and the games it produced were noisefests .
Vijay always left the sound on and tuned it out ; there was nobody around to bother him about it .
“ You ’re busy –what game sounds like that ? ”
“ Fuck Me Harder . ”
“ Is that the name or … ”
“ Yeah . ”
Vijay picked up a scroll and destroyed all blue blobs within a certain radius .
He instantly regretted this since his own blue blobs had been playing an important role in a pincer movement .
“ So , no , it ’s not an Entropy call .
I called you to ask if you want to help me test the radio friendly unit shifter . ”
Vijay paused the game and stared at the frozen LCD , repeatedly projecting blob movements for the next few seconds before snapping back to the present .
“ The what now ? ”
“ My signal retransmitter , for Pyromancy .
I ’ve been posting about it on my anonoblog for months . ”
“ Oh. I skipped those because I hate circuit diagrams . ”
Actually Vijay had been skipping most of what Rodney posted on his blogs .
“ Cretin !
So I ’m going to try it out on this call .
It ’ll sound like we ’re talking through a vocoder . ”
“ It ’s an effects pedal for radio and phones ?
That ’s going to get you into Pyromancy ? ”
“ Oh , it ’s extremely illegal .
It clobbers all sorts of FCC rules . ”
“ But you could make a legal one , could n’t you , that worked like the Sabertooth ? ”
“ Yes , I could , if I wanted to mess up my own calls .
This one messes up other peoples ’.
You ready ? ”
Vijay was neither ready nor un - .
“ Hmm , how is this possible ?
Does n’t it use a lot of power ? ”
“ No more than your tiny cell phone needs to broadcast on the same frequencies .
RTF circuit diagrams .
Here we go ! ”
Vijay reached for the keyboard again and played half a second of Fuck Me Harder before his headset bleated static even worse than the soundtrack to the game .
He dropped the fake cell phone like a piece of bread he ’d just discovered was moldy .
The noise stopped .
“ Hey , you still there ? ” came Rodney ’s voice from the Sabertooth .
“ Yeah , way to go , mister circuit diagram .
You messed with an encrypted phone call and you turned it to garbage . ”
“ No , this is actually good , because it demonstrates the value of voice encryption .
I ca n’t overpower someone ’s encrypted call and change what they ’re saying .
The Pyromancy guys love the public service angle . ”
“ You still want to try it out ? ” asked Vijay .
“ Turn off the encryption on your end . ”
He held his thumb to the side of the Sabertooth .
“ You ca n’t just turn off encryption ! ” said Rodney , as if Vijay had suggested removing the condom .
“ Why not ?
You ’re not going to say anything during the test .
Mallory already knows you called me .
Who cares if she hears unencrypted noise instead of encrypted noise ? ”
“ Forget it , ” said Rodney .
“ I ’ll buy two throwaway phones and call one with the other . ”
“ Hey , whatever floats your boat .
Let me know how it goes . ”
“ Fine .
Are you working on anything interesting ? ”
Vijay took inventory .
“ I ’m supposed to be fixing bugs for my boss .
But he ’s away at a Demo so I ’m working on the game .
Now that you mention it , I think it would make a good Pyromancy entry . ”
“ You wrote this game ?
How can a game be illegal ? ”
“ It ’s more a factory for games than one specific game . ”
Vijay was sinking into a game fugue , not interested in defending his nerd honor .
With his free hand he swatted at an imaginary fly .
But after Rodney hung up , Vijay sat back in his chair and let all his blobs die .
He ’d discovered common cause with Rodney ( who was still annoying ) .
Along with hundreds of other hackers and hobbyists , they were consumed by projects that could never be released , whose only possible futures were infamy or permanent nagging obscurity .
Katamari Pyromancy offered a purge of the mind , end - of - life with dignity .
Vijay projected his own movements into the future .
An abstract submitted to the Pyromancy organizers , then the laptop searching a day ’s spam for the secret coordinates of its grave .
Himself stepping off a plane , then out of a rental car , shedding technology like winter clothes .
Nothing in his hands now but the two universal tools : the personal computer , and duct tape .
He climbs a hill and sees his tribe below , assembled through a thousand anonymous transactions .
Shy people turned social by the end of the world , showing off a crop of forbidden machines .
He tells and hears the Demo .
Rodney ’s machine screws up some guy ’s pirate radio software and everybody laughs .
Some video installation that nobody understands , not even the artist .
A girl with green hair , like the token girl in hacker movies , looks over Vijay ’s shoulder all friendly like , and touches his arm .
Maybe it gets wild , maybe not .
Who knows if you can trust people ’s Pyromancy stories when the whole point is deniability .
There ’s probably drugs but no sex : just what ’s necessary to suppress your child - preservation instinct at the crucial moment .
Vijay takes up the Selfish GAME one last time and migrates to the center with everyone else .
He straps it to its brothers with duct tape , one panel on a big ball of creativity .
He climbs that hill again , he and the hacker girl and Rodney and the guy who was in jail , all looking down .
Then like that irrevocable moment when you decide this is it , you ’re going to throw up — bam ! , there goes everybody ’s year in a big fireball .
Artificial closure .
Then back to the car to the plane to productivity .
To a new laptop , sending innocent encrypted emails to the hacker that eventually peter out .
Back to working for Keith and the Weyo entity , waiting for another idea to colonize the empty space in his brain .
Except Vijay would never have another tenant after the Selfish GAME .
As the years went by he ’d decorate the shell with nostalgia : enlargements of that splendid explosion , an incendiary finger raised to Mallory ’s spy satellites .
Vijay had read his crypto diagrams and he knew the best you can do is evade Mallory , show her you know she ’s watching .
The thought of playing to win did not occur to him .

Here ’s how the Demo goes when Keith sings it :
He spreads a towel over the table and dumps a bunch of toys onto the towel .
A dining car for a model train , a covered bridge for same , some click - brick minifigs , a milled garnet sculpture , a grinning plastic tree person .
One hundred miles away , his business partner has just decided to blow up his laptop .
“ A Demo is just a story , ” says Keith , “ and my Demo is about people who like to tell stories themselves .
I brought some pieces of their stories to use as illustrations .
“ Let ’s consider two Weyo customers , Alice and Bob .
Alice plays in a shared virtual world , where she builds things and shows them off to her online friends .
We at Weyo look at a virtual world and see a big , user - friendly CAD program . ”
Keith holds up the smiling tree - guy .
“ Here ’s one of Alice ’s virtual creations .
She sends them to us and we print them out in 3D , so she can put them on her coffee table and show them off to her real - life friends .
“ On the other end of the spectrum we have Bob .
Bob plays in the real world , but his hobby involves a lot of small custom parts .
Maybe he ’s a sculptor .
Maybe he ’s a wargamer who needs authentic - looking half - inch Panzers .
Maybe he builds little robots and he needs custom casings .
But in actuality , Bob does model train layouts , and he needs landscaping . ”
Keith holds up the dining car and the bridge .
“ Now , unlike with Alice , there ’s no shortage of people selling items for Bob ’s coffee table .
There are whole stores full of this stuff .
The problem is that none of it is exactly what Bob has in mind , and most of it is pretty poor - quality molded plastic .
Bob has put up with this for years , kitbashing and scraping off and repainting .
Weyo ’s 3D printing gives him precisely what he wants at much better resolution .
Now Bob can build the model train layout of his dreams .
“ Bob ’s friend Charlie has a similar hobby : he builds complex structures out of toy click - bricks .
Whenever he needs a custom brick or a new color , he draws it up in a CAD program and prints it out with Weyo .
As you can see , he ’s made a little figure of Bob to inhabit his creations . ”
Keith holds up one of the click - brick humanoids , and sure enough it ’s Keith , polo shirt and everything .
He laughs bashfully , a skill retained from high school .
“ I guess now ’s a good time to admit that Bob is me . ”
They kind of smile .
Good enough .
“ There are hundreds of stories like these , all with the same basic pattern .
People have ideas and landscapes in their heads ;
Weyo turns them into products .
We can do it dirt cheap in plastic , resin , foam , or pressed wood .
For a little more we can do it in metal or semiprecious stone .
The big expense is shipping .
We ’ve been profitable in this market since day one , and we ’re looking to expand .
Yes . ”
Keith points at one of the VCs , who was about to ask a question anyway .
The Demo is a story but it ’s also a video game .
You ca n’t say your piece and walk off .
It requires agility and the all - important hand - eye coordination .
“ It seems like your business is pretty well - established .
Why are you looking for investment money ? ”
This is level one : dodgeball .
“ Right now we ’re a profitable small company .
We want to be a profitable large company .
Hobbyists are always on the cutting edge ; they ’ll pay more for less .
That wo n’t last long .
“ We want to bring create - on - demand to the mass market , so everyone prints things out instead of buying them pre-made .
We want everything to be customized : guitar bodies , pool tiles , even furniture .
If you ’re missing a part , you just print one out .
With more money we can improve our processes and get new fabbers for large , complex objects . ”
Large here being the size and mass of a loaf of bread ; no furniture yet .
“ Do n’t Pixelstub and Artifactory already do large - scale custom fabbing ? ” Level two : ritual arena combat .
“ They make one - off prototypes .
We make the real thing , and we keep the design around so you can make one whenever you want .
We even have a marketplace set up so you can sell your designs to other people with your hobby .
When hobbyists start getting their own fabbers at home instead of using ours , that marketplace is where the money will be . ”
Keith ’s getting grilled and he likes it .
But as cute as they are , he needs to pull those click - brick figures from the Demo , because they look just like the click - bricks made by a large Scandinavian company , and that triggers the worry in the back of every VC ’s mind .
Here it comes now .
“ What , ” says the guy Keith ’s age , “ what ’s to stop people from using your service to duplicate copyrighted images ?
Let ’s say they reproduced an action figure and started selling it as original . ”
Always some nerd fouls up Keith ’s Demo world of smiling Alices and Bobs .
Today it ’s spiky - hair Chad here .
Probably the youth liaison , VP for strategic keeping it real .
Instead of a fairly easy level three , Keith is warped straight to a confrontation with the final boss , Mallory .
Mallory owns all the copyrights and trademarks , she makes the plastic toys around here , and she ’s mad about people butting in on her territory .
She ’s always poking her nose into Alice ’s business and Bob ’s , firing off swarms of cease - and - desist letters .
One day she ’ll notice Weyo and brush it aside with her big lizard tail .
“ You would n’t get many takers for an action figure at three times the market price , ” says Keith weakly .
He ca n’t find the boss ’s weak spot .
With his towel spread out on the table , he looks like a kid running away from home with his toys in a knapsack .
Keith ’s only hope when he sings the Demo is to rack up the highest possible score before Mallory clobbers him ; then maybe he can finally get some money .
A belief not much different from one he held years ago : that if he got really good at Mutant ’s Revenge , Paul Harriman would want to make out with him .
“ But the possibility ’s there , ” says Chad .
Always the possibility with Mallory , always the precaution , the timidity before power .
“ If anyone can print out anything , there ’s bound to be abuse .
It would only take one lawsuit to shut you down .
Even if you were legally in the right , you could n’t afford it . ”
Frickin’ Mallory .
“ Well , first , we ’ve had zero complaints so far .
But if we ever do get complaints from a copyright owner , we ’ll handle them in good faith on a case - by - case basis .
That ’s the best we can do . ”
Keith ’s overpowered PDA pops up a notice .
This is the worst possible time , thinks Keith , but he ’s defeated anyway .
He pulls it off the table .
“ Sorry , ” he says .
“ Excuse me a minute .
I have to make a phone call . ”
Keith ducks out into the hall .
Behind his back he ’s sure the VCs are smirking , guy has to go make a phone call , frickin’ amateur .
The notice on his PDA shows a Bible text and a phone number he ’s never seen before .
It ’s time for Keith to do his part to defeat the NSA .
He plugs in his Sabertooth and dials the number .
“ Yello ? ”
It ’s male , a smoker ’s voice , Midwestern .
“ Entropy calling , ” says Keith .
“ Some random text for you .
Psalms 32:8 .
‘ I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go ; I will counsel you with my eye upon you . ' ”
“ Hey , you know what I hate ? ” says the voice on the other end , desperate for company .
Human contact is the last thing Keith needs right now .
“ ‘ Do not be like the horse or the mule , which have no understanding … ' ”
He finishes the 32nd Psalm and starts on the 33rd .
After one minute and fourteen seconds , he hangs up and goes back into the conference room .
“ You been talkin ’ about me ? ” he asks .
Just trying to lighten the mood a little .
#
Vijay came in to to work late that evening to make a custom glow - in - the - dark logo for his laptop .
He snuck the design into an after - hours batch and was waiting on the printer when Keith saw him and decided it was a good time to give him a new assignment .
“ Now is not a good time , ” said Vijay .
“ I ’m just finishing up a personal project for Katamari Pyromancy .
I think I have a really good chance of being the one who gets arrested . ”
“ You had better be joking , ” said Keith , clearing off the whiteboard .
“ C’mon , nobody gets arrested , ” said Vijay .
“ Mallory never even knows where it ’s being held until it ’s too late . ”
Keith turned , leaving a state diagram half - erased .
“ What does Mallory have to do with Pyromancy ? ”
“ You know , secret policewoman Mallory .
Alice and Bob want to go to Pyromancy , and Mallory wants to intercept them ’ cause they ’re gonna do bad bad things when they get there . ”
“ Oh , the generic Mallory , ” said Keith .
“ You spooked me because I ’ve been thinking about business problems as though they were crypto diagrams . ”
Keith finished erasing the whiteboard and tapped the eraser against his slacks a couple times .
“ Weyo has a Mallory who is driving me crazy , and what I need from you is in the way of a countermeasure . ”
Vijay sat up despite himself .
“ Aha , that ’s got your attention , ” said Keith .
He picked up a marker and drew a doodle on the whiteboard : a stick figure and a rectangle .
“ All month I have been going in front of people who have money , ” he said , “ and telling them what I thought they wanted to hear . ”
He pointed at the whiteboard doodle , which Vijay now realized was a picture of Keith pointing at a whiteboard .
“ It turns out that all they really want to hear is how we keep people from putting sports team logos on their blobs . ”
Vijay sagged into the fake Volt chair and let his tongue fall out of his mouth .
“ It ’s stupid , but it ’s the deal breaker .
Nobody ’s gonna give us money just so we can piss it away getting sued .
We need some way of rejecting blobs that use trademarks or copyrighted images , so that there ’s no confrontation with the Mallories who own them . ”
Vijay raised his hand .
“ Okay , so that ’s less a countermeasure than a capitulation . ”
“ Stop being such a drama queen , ” said Keith .
“ It makes us actual queens look bad .
I ’m asking for a defense against a skilled attacker with effectively unlimited resources .
You could do it as a crypto diagram :
Alice wants money , and Bob has money , but Bob ’s afraid – ”
“ I get it .
Who even cares about this crap ?
Bob is just being paranoid . ”
“ You may not be interested in Mallory , ” said Keith , “ but Mallory is interested in you .
I do n’t want this company to end up like a Your Power or a Xyppicu .
Plus it ’s the right thing to do .
Do you want us to be the next guys who make it trivial to commit mass copyright infringement ? ”
Keith popped the cap of the whiteboard marker over and over again .
The 3D printer beeped via the computer ’s case speaker .
“ My nachos are done , ” said Vijay .
He carefully opened the printer case , uncovering a wobbling sculpture of plastic blobs bound together by thin grey filaments .
“ I honestly do n’t care , ” he said , consulting the map on the computer monitor as he plucked items from the spiderweb .
“ It ’s not a big priority for me .
I ’d rather do things than stop people from doing things . ”
“ As an officer of Weyo , you need to care , ” said Keith .
“ My life does not revolve around these damn shares , ” said Vijay .
“ Not like yours .
I have interests beyond this boring fabber software .
It may not look like it . ”
“ Hey .
I know how you work and I do n’t push it .
I do n’t make you show up here every day just so I can look over your shoulder .
But when I really need something from you , I need it in Weyo ’s timeframe , not yours .
Even if it means skipping something like Pyromancy . ”
“ Well that ’s a real shame , ” Vijay drawled , rounding up a herd of HO scale cows suspended in midair , “ because I was really looking forward to being irradiated with PCBs while making out with an obese bisexual sysadmin from Indiana . ”
“ Take something seriously , dammit . ” Keith actually wrote DAMMIT on the whiteboard .
“ We are at the point where we make it big or we stay the size of a comic book shop forever . ”
“ Wait a minute , ” said Vijay , “ someone ’s been cattle rustling .
These cows all have different brands . ”
He dropped the bovine chunks into a labeled mailer and sighed .
“ I ’m sorry , dude , ” he said .
“ You know I get worked up and start throwing around words like ‘ Indiana ’ just to push your buttons . ”
“ Right now Mallory can crush this company and nobody will notice except a couple of blogs .
We need some kind of defense or we ’re stuck under the radar forever . ”
Vijay smirked .
“ You want it when ? ”
Two grown men briefly clutched their stomachs and made ritual heaving noises , imitating the mimeograph - era cartoons hung on the office wall , the connotation of which had plunged through playfully ironic to genuinely depressing until Keith had livened them back up with speech bubbles like “ OH GOD THE MUSHROOMS ” .
“ I can possibly meet with some Boston guys in three weeks , ” said Keith .
The whiteboard marker dropped as he held up crossed fingers .
“ Keith and Vijay can spend their time however they want , but Weyo needs to go up there and at least pretend to have a solution to this Mallory problem . ”
“ Check it out , ” said Vijay , reaching into the center of the spiderweb and pulling out a green plastic square : Pyromancy funeral clothes for his laptop .
“ People are idiots if they do n’t buy glow - in - the - dark versions of everything they ’ve already bought from us . ”
Keith interrogated the laptop logo .
“ GAME ?
What ’s that mean ?
Is that a word or a … trademarked name ? ”
“ Maybe it ’s trademarked .
I do n’t know . ”
“ You draw that double helix or get it off an image search ? ”
Vijay toked an imaginary joint .
“ Man , why you gotta ask what happens to all the pot we confiscate ? ”
“ Can you do this ?
Seriously ? ”
“ Okay , said Vijay , “ I will concoct something to help out the courtship .
But then I am definitely going on vacation . ”
“ Fine . ”
“ To Indiana . ”
“ Gar . ”

Deep beneath Yucca Mountain , Nevada , Mallory monitors the world ’s communications .
Lacking physical form , she works through unwitting confederates and side effects : tweaking reward systems , modifying instructions en route .
In cryptography diagrams , her symbol is a malevolent , all - seeing eye .
Mallory spies on presidents and paupers , national secrets and credit card transactions .
She swallows whole any message not designed to resist her .
The rest she cracks like lobsters : with brute force .
Like any bureaucracy , her motive is self - perpetuation , sheer hunger for data .
The ruined lives and pointless wars are just more side effects .
Mallory is made of information , and she needs to eat .
This sort of paranoia is very old , but computer science has institutionalized it and gotten good mileage out of probing Mallory ’s capabilities .
Ask a programmer Vijay ’s age , and he ’ll say the two most interesting projects are : to slow the flow of information towards Mallory , and to help its distribution elsewhere .
Doing either risks Mallory ’s wrath , which is why , to a first approximation , all those programmers are constantly breaking the law .
Mallory , though metaphorical , was not at all hypothetical .
Vijay ’s Mallory obsession climbed once he blew off Pyromancy , his designated outlet .
The program he was writing could never hurt anybody , since it would never work , but it would have made a great prop for a Mallory Halloween costume .
Under Demo conditions , it would sound a satisfying buzzer when Keith fed it the logos of major corporations .
Scary !
The only good thing about the trademark project was its inconvenient timing , which had prevented Vijay from going to Pyromancy .
Saved from destruction , the Selfish GAME made a grand evolutionary breakthrough into its next phase of being : producing games that did n’t even work , dammit .
This was probably just an algorithmic dead - end , but Vijay considered it a personal betrayal by an idea that had lived in his head rent - free since he was a boy .
Vijay had grown up playing Mutant ’s Revenge and the Puddle Play games in local arcades .
When he finally got his own computer , he resolved to save his quarters by writing his own version of Mutant ’s Revenge , replete with gameplay improvements and with much better graphics .
The blame for his failure he laid squarely on his tools .
His dinky first - generation Muse Calliope , yes , but also the computer that moved his eyes and his guts , which turned out incompatible with whatever tape made you a whiz - kid programmer .
Thanks to the General Arcade Machine Emulator , Vijay now inhabited a golden age .
His laptop held every arcade game ever released , or at least the important ones , the ones written before games started getting ridiculous peripherals like drum kits and full - scale Army tanks .
The only hard part had been finding the seedy web site that offered all the games as a graph .
Because these games , even the forgotten ones , are still under copyright , and that eight kilobytes of data ca n’t go on your laptop unless you ’ve got the two - hundred - pound cabinet to go with it .
Even three thousand games were n’t enough for Vijay , because none of them were perfect .
So he ’d built the Selfish GAME , which bred mutants with barbarians , spaceships , and wizards .
It had been fun for two years and now it had stopped working .
A week after the Pyromancy deadline , while all the cool people were converging on a field in Idaho with their machines and duct tape , Vijay was doing the most boring thing he could think of : making a spreadsheet .
Most of the work he delegated to a script , but writing the script was so boring he did n’t mind when Rodney called .
“ Oh , hi , ” said Rodney .
“ I thought you could n’t take your phone to Pyromancy .
I was just going to leave a message . ”
“ Guh .
I ’m not at Pyromancy .
My game is behaving strangely .
I do n’t want to kill it until I figure out what ’s going on . ”
“ So you did get invited ? ”
“ No , ” said Vijay , “ I did n’t even submit .
Why are you – oh , maybe you got the invitation and missed it . ”
“ I went through every piece of spam manually , ” said Rodney .
“ If I got one , it went right past me . ”
“ Maybe the unit shifter just was n’t what they were looking for .
I mean , it ’s a device for vandalism .
It ’s technically impressive , but to someone like me who does n’t understand the details , it ’s not beautiful .
I ’m glad you made it , but I really think the world would be a better place if you did blow it up .
And it seems to me that ’s not in the spirit of Pyromancy . ”
“ Well , you ’re in luck , because I just had my own little Pyromancy in the backyard .
Smashed it up with a hammer .
Keeping that thing in my house for another year is asking for trouble . ”
“ Yeah , there you go .
Who needs it ? ”
“ Not my wife .
She does n’t want me doing homebrew broadcasting anymore .
She ’s gotten all paranoid . ”
“ I do n’t blame her .
Look , I do n’t know anything about spectrum engineering , but there must be something you can still make . ”
“ Easy for you to say ; you ’re pure software .
You can come up with something totally new , have some fun before they make it illegal .
Speaking of which .
What ’s wrong with your game ? ”
“ The factory ’s putting out games that you ca n’t play for more than a couple seconds .
It ’s driving me crazy .
I ’m trying to see if the games have anything in common , before I go grovelling in the machine code . ”
“ Do you need any help ? ”
“ From the universe , yeah .
Not so much from humans . ”
“ ‘ Kay , I ’ll leave you to it . ”
Of the sea of ROMs on its laptop , the Selfish GAME was using fifty - three to build what Vijay called the Player Two series .
These source games had more ludemes than average , and Vijay considered most of them classics , but they had nothing else in common .
The completed spreadsheet broke the Player Two games into their component ludemes , and cross-referenced them to the original fifty - three ROMs .
There were obvious clusters , but the only explainable one consisted of Jake Michaelson ’s four glorious machines from the early eighties .
Almost all the clusters contained games from a single company , but why those games in particular ?
Again Vijay did the most boring thing he could think of .
He went to one of those tease sites that ’s full of bibliographic information about arcade games but does n’t actually have the ROMs for download .
He scraped the data for every game made from the late seventies to the early nineties , and wrote a fitness function that used this data to grow hypotheses about the Selfish GAME ’s clusters .
It took an hour to write and a minute to run .
The correlations became clear during the debugging , and once everything worked they were obvious .
All the clusters , not just the Jakemike ’s , were by author ; by company only as a side effect .
The arcade industry had never been good about crediting its talent , but there was enough data to make sense of the patterns .
The outliers could be chalked up to plagiarism .
The Selfish GAME had figured out which people had written the classic games , and built new games based exclusively on their work .
Games it would n’t let Vijay play .
“ Huh , ” said Vijay .
Then , “ I wonder if I can get contact info for these guys . ”
Now his vacation had a goal .
Vijay threw himself into Weyo work , fixing bugs in SimShitty and attacking the trademark recognition problem with the same tools he threw at everything else .
He spent his breaks getting Fucked Harder .
At night he poked at the early - termination games in a futile attempt to uncover their secrets .
He left the apartment only after realizing that shut - in behavior would pop a red flag in Mallory ’s data - mining net .
To trick Mallory , Vijay had already joined the Entropy project and purchased a Sabertooth unit for his cell phone .
Keith cynically noted that this was what geeks did as a substitute for religion , but Keith was a religious guy and he ’d done the same thing .
Now Vijay was randomly going for walks around the block to hide the fact that he was in hermit mode .
When he discovered that the walks did something –they cleared his head and made him more productive –he could n’t decide whether or not to continue .
Any purposeful action leaked information to Mallory .
From the perspective of this secular Zoroastrianism , what Vijay planned to do was a sin .
From a threat model standpoint , it was simply insane .
Random walks that stopped being random were bad enough .
Now Vijay planned to enter the houses of untrusted strangers and show them exactly what he had done with the stolen intellectual property of large corporations .
Mallory never forgot a face , or anything else .
Law enforcement agencies were her playthings .
Slip up once and she had you ; it did not matter if you were a good person , how often you went to temple or how much you gave to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Furries .
Vijay would have been better off immolating his laptop in the manicured anonymity of Katamari Pyromancy , that pagan sacrifice to opportunity cost .
He had to be a man , take a calculated risk .
Mallory dogma does not recognize degree – telling one person is as good as telling everybody – but in real life , his road trip was safer than releasing the Selfish GAME or its creations onto the net .
Nobody would get a copy of his software , and he could put off a decision until he saw the results of his experiment .
After a week of work , Vijay told a Demo to Keith , claiming with a straight face that the trademark recognizer was ready for use in Keith ’s own Demos .
“ It ’s called V - squared , ” he said finally , tapping the cap onto the whiteboard marker , proud of his ugly offspring .
“ Do I want to know what that stands for ? ” asked Keith .
“ It ’s not obscene ! ” said Vijay .
“ It stands for the Violator Violator .
‘ Cause when you violate trademark , it – ”
“ Okay , V - squared it is , ” said Keith .
“ They say it in the damn Bellewether Romance books !
Where the woman ’s always defending her honor so there are no dirty parts . ”
Keith finally laughed .
“ You ’re just digging yourself in deeper .
Go on vacation . ”
This was a sensible idea .
Vijay went outside and tossed the Selfish GAME on top of the duffel bag in his busted - up Epsilon .
#
“ What I am about to show you , ” said Vijay , “ has two distinct parts .
I think the first part is very interesting , so I ’m showing it to you first .
The second part is either the most amazing thing in the history of humankind , or it ’s a huge crock of crap .
I need your help to figure out which it is .
But either way , the expected value of this demo is pretty high , so you ca n’t complain . ”
“ Guess not , ” said Brody Rosaen .
Vijay ’s mistake is singing the Demo like a stock Hero ’s Quest .
Someone with the knack can put the audience in the role of Hero , but Vijay just talks about what he had to go through to make the pixels dance just so on the screen , and save it for your festschrift , pal .
So Keith is the Demo - bard for Weyo , but this was Vijay ’s solo venture , and there was no money involved anyway .
“ I ’ll just start from the beginning .
Like most kids my age , I grew up playing your games , especially Mutant ’s Revenge . ”
A.k.a. Mutants Revenge and Mutants ’ Revenge on variant cabinets , but always Mutant ’s Revenge in the ROM , which is what ’s survived .
“ When I got my own computer , I thought I ’d write a clone of Mutant ’s Revenge .
But I ’ve never been a very good programmer and it never worked out .
Now skip to high school , when I learned about evolution .
They could n’t say ‘ evolution ’ because they were afraid of lawsuits , but my teacher snuck it in under the radar by calling it ‘ descent with modification ’ .
“ Which was actually good , because when he called it that , I noticed the similarity with what I wanted to do to Mutant ’s Revenge , and every other game I ’d ever played , my click - brick sets , every book I ’d read , and the whole world in general .
I wanted to make my own version that worked better .
“ I did all this inter-library loan crap to see if other people had had this idea , and of course they had .
Genetic algorithms , right ?
If you set up the ways something can vary , and you have a rule for determining fitness , then you can evolve a solution without doing the hard work –what to me was the hard work .
This was my science project for like three years .
What ’s so funny ? ”
All through this speech Brody Rosaen was leaning back in his chair smiling , running his hand through hair that was n’t there anymore .
“ Nothing , ” he said .
“ You just remind me of me when I was your age . ”
“ That ’s really … that ’s a great compliment .
Thank you . ”
Huh , wait , so what ’s going to happen to Vijay in thirty years ?
Tired , sitting in a rocking chair while some punk kid shows him what he did to the Selfish GAME ?
“ Go on . ”
“ Sorry , lost my train of thought . ”
Vijay ’s starting small with your Brody Rosaens , working his way upwards and westwards to Jake Michaelson ; Sir Jacob , if you buy into the colonialism bullshit .
Vijay ’s Demo tour takes him all the way to the edge of the Pacific , to the Jakemike ’s self - contained geodesic habitat .
Well - known to computer nerds and the Pacifica zoning board , come the Big One this tensegrity eyesore will be the only structure spared – or so believe the devout .
As San Mateo County crumbles into the roiling sea , the Jakemike ’s transparent dome will be liberated from its moorings , and through sheer mechanical genius and split - second improvisation it will drift like a soap bubble up to the L5 point .
Vijay ’s Demo song is going to blow the Jakemike ’s mind because Vijay has read his histories of the personal computing revolution , and he has Michaelson sussed as a guy who is constantly reminding himself that most people are just not as clever as he is .
By industry standards this counts as modesty .
And among the accoutrements that will sweeten Jakemike ’s lonely trip among the stars is an old - fashioned arcade room containing thirty classic game machines , including the four mind - blowing quarter - eaters that the Jakemike designed at Zymurgy .
Brody Rosaen has put his game - design past behind him , but Jake Michaelson still has the passion .
This was not what Vijay was saying , and the things he was saying were being pitched to Jakemike on the other side of the country , not Brody Rosaen who was sitting right there .
Okay .
“ Do you by any chance have a cabinet of Mutant ’s Revenge ? ” Vijay asked .
“ A souvenir , for nostalgia ’s sake ? ”
“ Why ? ” said Brody .
“ Do you need to use one ? ”
“ Nope , ” said Vijay .
“ It ’s just a thought experiment .
Why do n’t you have one ? ”
Brody ticked off the reasons .
“ Too much space , too hard to maintain , too expensive , my wife would kill me . ”
None of these are obstacles to Jakemike , a lifelong bachelor whose extravagant tastes cannot drive him into debt or even down to regular code - slave wealth , a man so rich that he must come up with specialized money - losing schemes like promoting bicycle races and trying to fix the California public school system .
But Brody Rosaen is pretty well - off and he can’t keep around the one perfect machine he designed , the one so beautiful that Vijay got a summer job making squicky burgers just so he could play it for free .
Vijay pulled out his laptop .
“ Have you ever heard of GAME ?
The General Arcade Machine Emulator ? ”
“ Yeah , ” said Brody .
“ Great , ” said Vijay .
“ So obviously you can play Mutant ’s Revenge on your PC . ”
Vijay loaded up the game , over two decades old , and pressed the 5 key to insert a virtual coin .
“ Right , ” said Brody .
“ Okay , good , ” said Vijay , whose unattended avatar on the screen was quickly ravaged by assorted mutants .
“ If you know where to look on the net you can get Mutant ’s Revenge and Renegade and any other arcade game you want .
“ But I took the underlying emulator , the GAME – actually GLAME with the LISP extensions – and added genetic algorithms to create what I call the Selfish GAME .
Which does n’t just simulate the instructions of the original arcade game : it simulates the input of someone playing the game . ”
Vijay set the Selfish GAME to analyzing Mutant ’s Revenge , and a slew of windows popped up , each playing the game in super - fast - motion .
“ Pretty wild , ” said Brody .
“ It goes even faster when it does n’t have to write to the screen , ” said Vijay .
“ Anyway , it plays a game a few million ways to develop strategies .
Once it ’s mastered the gameplay , it figures out how the game works , which pieces of code correspond to which parts of the game .
That way it decomposes the game into ludemes , or what I call GAMEtes : the basic units of gameplay .
It can recombine the ludemes within a general framework to create new games .
Like so . ”
Vijay killed the analysis session and loaded up one of the Selfish GAME ’s more playable recent efforts .
It was recognizably Mutant ’s Revenge , but it took graphics and an element of stealth from Brody ’s lesser follow - up effort , Renegade .
“ Every ludeme is simulated as though it were part of the original game .
They communicate through a standard interface to make up a new game .
So , really , what we see as a single game is running on up to twenty simulated chipsets . ”
Vijay took to the arrow keys and demonstrated a couple moves , shorthand for the delta between Mutant ’s Revenge and the new “ Renegade Mutant ” .
“ The ludemes are like chromosomes , you dig ? ”
Wait , why did he say “ dig ” ?
“ The Selfish GAME breeds new games and evaluates them according to the same criteria it used against the human - created games .
When I play one of its games , it watches what I do and uses that information , too .
The best games survive and pass on their genes .
I ’ve made about ten thousand games with this .
Some of them are a lot of fun . ”
“ This is amazing .
What was on the title screen ?
I noticed it said ‘ Player Two ’ . ”
“ Good job .
Near as I can tell , the title screen is gibberish , except for that one thing .
Recently started making these games that said ‘ Player Two ’ .
Then a week ago it started making games that just died after a couple seconds of play .
At first I thought it was a bug , but if I ’m right , those two things are connected , and that brings me to the second thing I want to show you .
Let me demonstrate a game that dies . ”
Vijay killed the Selfish GAME .
His first emulator session was still running stock Mutant ’s Revenge .
Vijay ’s untouched quarter had long since GAME OVERed and decayed back to the teaser screen .
Vijay ’s finger hovered over the key that would kill this session too .
“ Oh , I ’ve always wanted to ask you , why the revenge ? ”
“ What ? ”
“ The title .
What did I ever do to the mutants that they want revenge ? ”
“ They ’re just mad at society in general , ” said Brody .
#
The day after that visit , when Vijay looped back from Vermont and started tearing across the country , Brody called him unencrypted from his home phone .
The only thing dumber than Brody doing this was Vijay ’s taking the call .
Now Mallory had a confirmed voice connection in addition to email correspondence and the paper trail of Vijay ’s gas purchases .
“ I want copies of those games , ” said Brody .
“ I ’m driving , ” said Vijay , squishing his real cell phone to his shoulder .
He ’d set the cruise control to exactly four miles over the speed limit .
“ Sure , ” said Brody .
“ It ’s just … I still feel it in my fingers , you know ?
I ’m hooked . ”
Pretty rich coming from the Mutant ’s Revenge guy , but Vijay too had the screen - capture videos from the night before stuck in his head .
“ They wo n’t run on the stock system , ” he said .
“ When I get back home , I ’ll try to package them as standalone executables .
I ’m being deliberately vague here because this is an insecure line . ”
Vijay ’s muscle memory twitched on down the Atlantic Seaboard , guessing at moves to games he had n’t played .
Vijay had stuck his hands into the universe and built something great .
Man , the hell with Mallory .
That was more than she ’d ever done .
#
Vijay swung through Kentucky to meet Keith ’s parents .
Dinner turned out to be chicken , but it was n’t the first time he ’d cheated on vegetarianism .
“ Imagine a plant , ” he told them , emphasizing plant just to be mean .
“ Plants are phototropic : they seek out light .
But this is no ordinary plant : you can train it to do tricks .
You can give it a green light and a blue light , and train it to prefer the green light over the blue .
You with me ? ”
“ Sure , ” said Keith ’s father .
“ Now this program , V - squared .
Imagine that certain colors of light are trademarked .
Well , actually some colors are trademarked , but – never mind .
The point is that we ’re legally allowed to fabricate model train cars in certain colors but not others .
“ So what do we do ?
We hook up the plant to the database of trademarks , and train it to seek out only the trademarked colors .
Whenever someone wants a train car of a certain color , we shine that color of light on the plant , and see if it reacts . ”
He waited for the tough questions , but they never came .
“ Well , that sounds really interesting , ” said Keith ’s mother , handing him the rice .
“ There ’s no real plant , ” said Vijay helpfully , spooning it out .
“ It ’s just a metaphor . ” A metaphor with obvious problems !
C’mon , trademarks are n’t colors ; they ’re shapes , names , and concepts .
They ’re claimed within a specific field of endeavor .
And copyright is even worse !
You need a lawyer for this stuff , and all Vijay had to work with was trained plants !
What was he even doing at this job ?
“ And you ’re working on this now , or … ”
“ No , it ’s all done , ” said Vijay .
He chowed down on chicken .
“ Finished it before I went on this vacation .
Keith is talking to some guys in Boston in a few days .
He thinks we have a real shot at an investment now . ”
“ That ’s great ! ” said Keith ’s mother .
His father : “ We ’re so proud of you two . ”
Uh-oh .
What did that mean ?
Vijay tried his hand at damage control .
“ Yeah , it ’s really exciting .
Once things get a little less hectic I ’ll have some more time for a personal life .
Go out , meet some girls . ”
Despite his best effort , “ girls ” came out in exactly the weird tone “ plant ” had earlier .
Vijay winced , but Keith ’s parents did n’t notice , or had lots of practice pretending not to notice , or else Vijay had just been paranoid the whole time .
He pretended not to notice their lack of reaction .
What was with these people ?
Vijay had long felt his parents were secretly ashamed of him and Rukmini , even though technically they did the sorts of things that made parents proud .
Vijay had graduated a good school and was now a successful entrepreneur in the computer industry .
But he had passed up schools much higher in the newsweeklies ’ college rankings because ( it was true ) he did n’t like to work hard .
And the company he ’d helped found was a producer of toys and trivialities , hardly likely to become the next Muse or even be purchased by the existing Muse .
His sister was working towards her Ph.D. , but it was a Ph.D. in Gender and Linguistics , so it did n’t count .
Keith ’s family was oblivious to the shame in which their son had drenched them .
To them , Keith and Vijay embodied the American dream .
Sure , Keith was not so hot on the family tradition of heterosexuality , but he was the president of his own company !
It did n’t matter to Keith ’s parents that Weyo had only three employees , or that Keith spent half his time performing menial , meta - assembly - line tasks .
Their attitude towards the small stuff , and its sweating , made it easy for them to be proud of their son .
The next morning , Vijay woke up from a dream in which Keith had been Demoing the Selfish GAME to game industry big shots .
He did n’t remember how the dream went but he could do a good impression of Keith :
“ You people put more money into one game than I personally have seen in my entire life , and yet you put out nothing but bland , recombined crap !
With the Selfish GAME you can fire your prima donna programmers , and get right to the crapitude ! ”
Vijay had not really attended any of Keith ’s Demos , and was just going by what he ranted about afterwards .
“ I ’m at your parents ’ house , ” he told Keith , pulling on his socks .
“ They put me in your old room , which was weird , but I ’ll recover . ”
“ I hope they did n’t bother you . ”
“ No , they were great .
They did feed me chicken , but it ’s not a big deal . ”
Keith sucked his teeth .
“ Geez , I ’m sorry about that .
They must think you just do n’t eat red meat .
I ’m pretty sure they know chicken ’s not a vegetable . ”
“ Do n’t worry about it .
I had a fun time .
Hey , have you noticed anything weird about your dad ’s train layout ? ”
“ No , it ’s really well thought out , thematically consistent … ”
“ Also very creepy .
There are no people in it .
The railroad crossing barriers go up and down , but there are never any cars on the road . ”
“ My dad will tell you that what really looks creepy is people waiting at a train station , and the train stops and nothing happens .
That ’s horror movie quality right there : people who ca n’t move .
You ’re used to click - brick sculptures that use blocky figures .
Model railroads need to look realistic . ”
“ It looks weird . ”
“ If it makes you feel better , there ’s a schism within the model railroading community on this very topic . ”
“ You ’re kidding . ”
“ Well , between me and my dad .
I finally adopted a compromise position .
I put people in my layouts , but they ’re all lying dead on the ground .
It looks more natural that way . ”
Vijay snorted .
“ You ’re in a good mood . ”
“ I am .
Last night I came up with a much better way to fabricate splines .
And I ’ve been playing with V - squared and it ’s really something .
It ’s not easy to fool . ”
“ Um , ” said Vijay , trying to come close to the truth without going over , “ you know that I just made V - squared for you to Demo .
It ’s not intended for production use . ”
“ You worry too much , ” said Keith .
“ ‘ Our proprietary technology scans incoming files for infringing material before approving any piece for fabrication . ’
That ’s all I need .
We can do it up right once we get the money .
Where are you off to today ? ”
“ Little Rock , probably , and then Dallas tomorrow .
I ’m seeing this guy R. R. Venn .
He worked for Zymurgy and then Muse for a while . ”
“ You going to swing up to Chicago to see your folks ? ”
“ Maybe on the way back . ”
Vijay ’s revenge was swift and terrible .
“ Hey , you want to talk to anyone here , long as I ’ve got you on the line ? ”
“ No , just tell them I said hi . ”
For a few hours , the scenery let Vijay pretend he was driving Keith ’s father ’s scale recreation of Appalachia .
Abandoned Weyo - wood buildings flashed by , showing off high - resolution weathering that beat the pants off what you could do with molded plastic .
There was no other traffic , only the occasional train , roaring like a giant worm past a crossing .
The trains were empty ; Vijay was alone .
Nobody ever questioned Keith ’s father ’s choice of hobby , or wondered aloud on Internet fora whether he did n’t have something better to do with his time .
Mallory had made it illegal to look at trains through binoculars , but no one was going to outlaw train sets .
Model railroading was dying out on its own .

Folded Time , the underrated sequel to the overrated Folded Space , should have been the top - grossing game of 1983 .
It was a big - budget production of Zymurgy , the preeminent American videogame company .
It had stellar gameplay and excellent graphics for the time .
Most importantly , its name was easily confused with that of its successful predecessor .
But in 1983 , Zymurgy was falling apart .
Too much money was coming in for the company to handle , and though it was leaking back out in rivers , none was ending up in the pockets of the man responsible for earning most of it : Jake Michaelson , F.O.B. from Australia .
At this point in the videogame histories , be they written or made - for - TV , Vijay inserts a scene where the Jakemike storms into the boardroom screaming obscenities in a ridiculous Bruce Roopuncher accent , alligator - wrestles Zymurgy president Vercingetorix Lebec to the ground , and punches him like in Bad Town Misfits until royalty coins leap from his body .
In real life , Michaelson simply quit , taking most of the Zymurgy engineers with him and going off to invent the modern personal computer .
R. R. Venn and Alex Ohara joined the exodus and never saw a dollar of royalties for Folded Time .
Even if the whole venture had n’t been a programmer rip - off , in 1983 Zymurgy was in no condition to sell cabinets or ship the ones already sold .
It was too much drama for one little videogame to take .
No one ’s ever heard of Folded Time , and nobody plays it except videogame nuts like Vijay with maxed - out GAME collections .
“ Which is a big shame because in my opinion it is really the pinnacle of the unconstrained 2D chase genre , ” Vijay gushed .
R. R. Venn just gave a kind of purse - lipped hmm , not even a grunt but an exhalation .
Like the Buddha gave to groupies telling him that in their opinion he had arranged the optimal number of noble truths in just about the correct order .
To Bob Venn , Folded Time was a fact about the universe , nothing but a local maximum in million - dimensional ludic space .
Though Venn was content to be the public face of Folded Time , he and Ohara deserved only the credit allocated to the men who discover a new star or an interesting fact about cave formation .
Okay , now Vijay was projecting big time .
“ Do you ever talk to Alex Ohara ? ”
“ No , ” said R. R. Venn , who was n’t inclined to start now .
“ I think he ’s still in California . ”
“ I tried to find him for this project but he ’s not on the net .
How about Jake Michaelson ? ”
A sharp intake of breath .
Crud !
Most people who contact R. R. Venn are probably just trying to get to the Jakemike .
“ I ’m just … you know , I ’m going to be seeing him in a few days .
Just wondered if you wanted me to say hi for you . ”
“ No , thanks .
You said you had something else to show me ? ”
“ Right .
Sorry if I – right .
So far , I ’ve shown you a modified version of Folded Time , which I call Glaive from the Grave because it ’s really hard to name ten thousand pieces of software .
You ’ve seen how the Selfish GAME tears games apart and splices them back together .
But what you have n’t seen yet , what nobody has seen , is this other game that the Selfish GAME wo n’t let me play .
It starts off normal but after a few seconds it crashes . ”
“ That happened to me all the time programming those old chips , ” said R. R. Venn .
“ Your assembler ’s just buggy . ”
“ It ’s not buggy , ” said Vijay .
“ Watch for a bit . ”
Vijay loaded up Now You Do n’t ( Player Two ) and tried to play .
It was mostly Folded Time , combined with the best parts of the earlier Venn / Ohara collaborations : Secret Mission and Glaivar .
Folded Space gameplay was conspicuously absent : the Selfish GAME did n’t like that game any more than Vijay did .
Vijay had conjectured all of this from the miniscule windows of game he ’d get before his GAME session crashed .
It was the arcade owner ’s dream : a quarter buys you three seconds of play .
Four if you twist the spaceship the right way .
“ Sure looks buggy to me . ”
“ Now you try it . ”
R. R. Venn did , but he was rusty on the controls and before he could figure out how to even move the spaceship , his GAME session died too .
He smiled and held his hands up , pushing off responsibility for this broken software .
He ’s retired now ; this stuff belongs to a whole other phase of his life .
“ Try it again . ”
R. R. Venn tried again .
This time he twisted the spaceship the right way .
He twisted again , evading the first wave of insectoid pursuers .
The second wave he destroyed in a slicing maneuver more usually associated with the hell - blade of Glaivar the Uncouth than with hyperspace - capable fighter craft .
The third wave was n’t even hostile ;
Venn shot two before realizing his mistake and zooming ahead , collecting the insects behind him as a glittering string of trophies .
Venn ’s joystick - accustomed fingers slipped on the arrow keys , but he played the game as if he ’d known it all his life , an old champion brought back for one last fight .
He grinned like a kid , in symbiosis with the machine but always one step ahead .
Then gibberish blitted onto the screen and began to dance .
The game was over .
“ There are four or five more like that , ” said Vijay .
“ We can probably get to them all tonight . ”
“ I ’ll be damned , ” whispered Bob Venn , still smiling , fingers shaking .
“ It made that game for you , ” said Vijay .
“ The same thing happened with Brody Rosaen and Cliff Keilbach . ”
“ What does that mean , it made it for me ? ”
“ I ’ve thought about this a lot , ” said Vijay .
“ I ’m no good at writing games , so I made a tool to explore ludic space : the space you saw in your head when you designed Folded Time .
It explores by building and playing games , the way we build hypotheses and test them out in the real world .
“ For two years I ’ve talked to it by playing its games .
But I ’ve never made any games of my own , so it was like it was talking to someone who never has original thoughts .
I ’m Player One , the fast dumb guy .
The Selfish GAME got me to say all kinds of clever things , but they were just canned phrases I ’d picked up from your games .
“ But all of you from Zymurgy and Puddle Play and the other companies whose games I stole : you made the original seeds , the thoughts I do n’t know how to think , the other halves of the conversation .
You all are Player Two , the slow smart guy .
It knew you ’d speak the whole language , so it figured out how you see ludic space , and it built games only you would know how to play .
It tried to pressure me to evolve back into you , or get the operating system to swap me out for you , or whatever it thinks we aliens do . ”
“ You ’re anthropomorphizing a piece of software . ”
“ You can put it in quotes , or say that doing this helps it satisfy its fitness function , but I think the Selfish GAME is the kind of thing that has wants .
Maybe on the level of a dog or a cat .
It ’s not something that we can understand or communicate with , but it knows about us and it tells us about its universe . ”
“ Is that what it ’s doing now ? ”
The game - win screen still flashed its animated hieroglyphics .
Inscrutable multicolored bitmaps ( graphical representations of code ? ) danced and reproduced , and game sprites chased each other in complex patterns .
There were two pieces of English : the Zymurgy logo and PLAYER TWO .
“ The more I look at these screens , ” said Vijay , “ the more I seem to see patterns .
I ’ve got the whole play recorded , but let ’s take a couple screenshots . ”
The animations ran in a loop , but the loop was winding down .
The wiggling bitmaps lost their colors and settled into a steady state .
Exhausted sprites ran in circles .
“ I need more data , ” said Vijay .
“ I ’ve still got locked games to show Jake Michaelson , and anyone he ’s kept in contact with .
I guess I need to go to Japan to talk to whoever in the Uchiyama crowd is still around .
I ’ve got to figure this out . ”
The animation had now stopped completely .
The bitmaps and sprites turned a uniform blue , and the Now You Do n’t session finally crashed .
“ Yeah , what ’s that about ? ” said R. R. Venn .
“ It ’s obviously not part of the game . ”
“ Title screens and cut scenes , ” said Vijay .
“ That ’s its concession to the way we think . ”

Vijay drove over a bridge and he was in California ; that is , the place where consensus geography congrued with the rump California of his mind .
A place he and Keith had done their best to recreate in the Weyo office in Philly : somewhere where a person could make something .
The brazen , sputtering , increasingly illegal engine of the world .
It was a time of civil war .
Ever year , the north sent more delegates than anywhere else on earth to Katamari Pyromancy .
The Mallory - aligned south was a prime mover behind most of those ideas being illegal or unsalable in the first place .
Alice , Bob , and Mallory shorted every human value in the name of progress , but like every pantheon they pulled in opposing directions .
The engine was stalled .
Vijay had come to this conspiracy of a state to claim citizenship from that other great immigrant , Jacob Michaelson .
A captain of industry who ’d once sold phones that placed long distance calls for free .
Whose response to being robbed and cheated was to come up with yet another mind - blowing idea .
Who had , according to reliable sources , killed some sort of marsupial bear when he was only three .
Vijay had his fingers crossed driving through physical California , because around that time Keith was starting on his second series of Demoes .
Vijay took it as a good omen when he got an email from Keith right after entering mental California .
He pulled into a gas station and just wandered around for a while , enjoying the fresh air and the superposition of possible futures .
“ Hey , how did it go ? ”
“ This , ” said Keith , “ is amazing .
You know the V - squared ? ”
“ My glorious vacation has yet to cloud the memory .
Did it get them to shut up and give us money ? ”
“ It blew them away .
It derailed the Demo .
They kept me in there an hour past time .
They were downloading pictures and logos from the web so I could run them through V - squared . ”
Vijay fiddled with the phone cord , a habit many years in remission , but the tech had finally caught up .
“ Keith , I ’m feeling a strange emotion which I believe I can decompose into two parts .
Um , the first part is that this makes me very angry , and the second part is I do n’t believe you . ”
“ Let ’s take the second one .
I ’m living it .
I was just there and I ’m telling you it happened . ”
“ You were not supposed to go into depth .
It was just to get you past the Mallory question . ”
“ I ’m sitting on a verbal offer that ’s completely obscene , ” said Keith , “ because this is what they ’ve been looking for .
You know how Zeal was treating us , and all the other firms ?
It ’s not just us .
Their due diligence rejects anything consumer - facing .
Consumers are like a plague to these guys .
Half the Demoes they get , they ’ve got to raise their hands : what if someone uses this to share music , what if someone uploads a copyrighted picture , what if someone makes a photocopy on the damn photocopier ?
They ’re terrified of Mallory .
V - squared lets them spend money again . ”
“ Keith , V - squared does not work .
It cheats .
I only made it so I could go on vacation instead of arguing with you about impossible problems . ”
“ I just saw it work and so did a roomful of VCs .
You ’re outvoted . ”
“ And you ’re a lousy attacker .
You guys downloaded images from big - company websites , the ones you ’re most afraid will sue Weyo .
Am I right ? ”
“ So what ? ”
Vijay paced the sidewalk between his car and the convenience store .
“ Image recognition is too hard , so V - squared just finds the commonalities among its seed images .
It sees things like certain kinds of lighting and a design - by - committee style .
Someone whose amateur work looks ‘ professional ’ is going to trigger the net , and lame three - person - company logos are going to sail through .
Did you feed the Weyo logo into V - squared ? ”
“ That ’s our trademark . ”
“ It does n’t know that ! ”
“ You are so arrogant you ca n’t admit you solved a problem you do n’t like , ” said Keith .
“ How is this harder than that GAME hack you did ? ”
“ A video game has nothing to do with the outside world , ” said Vijay .
“ A trademark is a social construct .
Speaking of which , can I berate you about this later ?
I ’ve got to meet the Jakemike in an hour , and I ’m already agitated enough . ”
“ You ca n’t do that , ” said Keith .
“ Why the hell not ? ” Vijay grinned and waved at a woman who stared at him as she got into her car .
He tried to project the image of an overbearing executive berating an underling .
He was wearing day - old jeans and a LPRSY T - shirt .
“ The Selfish GAME is my project , ” he said , “ it ’s how I stay sane .
I ca n’t blow it up and now I ca n’t show it to anyone ? ”
“ You definitely ca n’t show it to famous people , ” said Keith .
“ We ca n’t violate the law like everyone else if we ’re selling a product for enforcing it .
So no downloaded music , no watching online videos ripped from TV , no game ROMs . ”
“ What happened to changing the rules ?
We created a new world where you can manufacture things without owning a factory , and now you want to … you ’re introducing the invasive species that ’s already killed off art and literature . ”
“ If V - squared ca n’t work , why are you so afraid it will ? ”
“ Because I ’m a goddamned paranoid , Keith ! ” More waving .
Hi !
“ I see the world in terms of threat models .
I make random calls to people I do n’t like so my other calls wo n’t look suspicious .
When we go out to dinner , I ’m nudging everybody into a triangle formation so we do n’t get surprise attacked .
I ca n’t sleep because there are ten ways a terrorist could kill everyone in Philly , and nobody does anything about it .
And now you and I have somehow been tricked into working for Mallory .
I ca n’t trust my own brain , Keith ! ”
There was a long encrypted silence .
Anyone tapping the line would have heard noise mathematically identical to the noise that preceded it .
Nobody knew Vijay was a goddamned paranoid except for Keith and a few gas station customers .
“ Vijay , buddy , ” said Keith .
“ I say ‘ buddy ’ as your actual buddy and not as your condescending manager .
Go ahead and show off to Jake Michaelson , and we ’ll figure out the ramifications later . ”
“ I ’ll make it easy for you , ” said Vijay .
“ I quit . ”
Now another silence .
Vijay decoded it and saw Keith scrunching his eyes shut , gritting his teeth .
“ All right , ” Keith said finally , careful to not make any sounds that were not English words .
“ I ’ll see if there ’s some way of buying your stock back at the new price . ”
“ Just like that ?
You ’re going ahead with this ? ”
“ I ca n’t let Artifactory take over the 3D printing market .
I have to do what ’s best for Weyo . ”
“ Weyo is an abstraction , not a person with needs .
Jesus did n’t die for Alice and Bob .
You and I are the people and we ’re the ones who will be held responsible for what we do . ”
“ Apart from the Jesus crack , ” said Keith , “ which I understand in context , this is not how you usually talk .
I know you ’re under stress , and that I ’ve contributed to it , but maybe you ’ve also experienced something on this vacation that you ca n’t make sense of .
The kind of thing that transcends normal experience , that I might refer to as mystical ? ”
Vijay , very slowly : “ I ’m going to say yes , with the stipulation that it does n’t mean I believe in God . ”
“ Okay .
I ’m not trying to proselytize you .
Can you tell me about it ? ”
Vijay tapped the flat of his fist against his upper lip .
He squinted through his windshield at the laptop case in the passenger seat .
“ No , ” he said , “ I do n’t think I can . ”

A single village in China is responsible for cranking out 60 % of the world 's paintings .
The overwhelming majority of the paintings are slavish reproductions of famous paintings .
The artists doing the work are very talented , however , and an organization called Regional asked some of the artists to paint themselves .
The results are incredible .
Dafen is a village surrounded by the thriving metropolis of Shenzhen , and the origin of most of the world 's reproduction oil paintings .
In the popular imagination Dafen 's artists produce anonymous works for unknown customers , operating no differently than a faceless factory churning out counterfeits , replicas and nothing close to what would be considered art .
Regional productively collaborated with the otherwise commoditized community in Dafen by asking selected individuals , some for the first time , to imagine themselves in their professional medium .
The final works show the technical , creative , and professional facets of the artists identities subsumed by the styles and relationships they maintain with specific famous artists .
The hybrid result of original subject with derivative style comments on originality , global cultural production and Regional 's cooperation with emerging enterprise forms that are internationalizing the village .

Salmon Population Crash Shuts Down West Coast Fishery
SEATTLE , Washington , April 10 , 2008 ( ENS ) -
The Pacific Fishery Management Council today closed the commercial and sport chinook fisheries off the coast of California and most of Oregon and will allow only a 9,000 fishery for hatchery coho only off of Central Oregon .
The council adopted the most restrictive salmon fishing quotes in the history of the West Coast in response to the unprecedented collapse of the Sacramento River fall chinook salmon population and the exceptionally poor status of coho salmon from Oregon and Washington .
The recommendation will be forwarded to the National Marine Fisheries Service for approval by May 1 , 2008 .
" This is a disaster for West Coast salmon fisheries , under any standard , " said council chairman Don Hansen .
" There will be a huge impact on the people who fish for a living , those who eat wild - caught king salmon , those who enjoy recreational fishing , and the businesses and coastal communities dependent on these fisheries . "
The council said in a statement that while it cannot explain why the fish are not returning , it is clear that overfishing did not cause the depressed condition , as the parent spawning populations were all above their escapement goal .
The National Marine Fisheries Service has suggested ocean temperature changes , and a resulting lack of upwelling , as a possible cause of the sudden decline .
Many biologists believe a combination of human - caused and natural factors will ultimately explain the collapse , including both marine conditions and freshwater factors such as in - stream water withdrawals , habitat alterations , dam operations , construction , pollution , and changes in hatchery operations .
The Council has requested a multi-agency task force led by the National Marine Fisheries Service ’s West Coast Science Centers to research about 50 potential causative factors and report back to the Council at the September meeting in Boise , Idaho .
The Sacramento River fall chinook stock is the driver of commercial and recreational salmon fisheries off California and most of Oregon , the council says .
" The reason for the sudden decline of Sacramento River fish is a mystery at this time , " said Council Executive Director Don McIsaac .
" The only thing that can be done in the short term is to cut back the commercial and recreational fishing seasons to protect the remaining fish . "
Small tributaries of the Sacramento River like this one are supposedly good salmon rearing habitat , but few salmon are expected there this year .

" The longer - term solution will involve a wide variety of people , agencies , and organizations , " said McIsaac .
" But for now , unfortunately , those involved in the salmon fisheries are paying the price . "
Salmon fisheries off California and Oregon typically have been large - involving seasons from May 1 to October 31 and average over 800,000 chinook caught per year from 2000 to 2005 .
But this year , although chinook quotas in the area north of Cape Falcon in northern Oregon are similar to 2007 and chinook stocks are generally more abundant , depressed natural coho stocks are constraining access of commercial fisheries to the chinook salmon , the council said .
Sport fisheries , many of which depend on coho salmon , are even more restricted .
Coho quotas are less than 20 percent of the 2007 season for non-Indian fisheries and about 50 percent of 2007 levels for treaty - Indian fisheries .
The closures south of Cape Falcon are due to a sudden , unprecedented decline in the number of Sacramento River fall chinook returning to the river this year .
The minimum conservation goal for Sacramento fall chinook is 122,000 - 180,000 spawning adult salmon , the number needed to return to the river to maintain the health of the run .
As recently as 2002 , adult salmon numbering about 775,000 returned to spawn .
This year , even with all ocean salmon fishing closures , the return of fall run chinook to the Sacramento is projected to be only 54,000 .
" The salmon fishing culture that has been a cornerstone of the coastal communities has reached a low ebb point in 2008 for the collective three West Coast states , " said Mark Cedergreen , council vice chairman .
" This was the responsible thing to do , but it will hurt . "
In California and Oregon south of Cape Falcon , where Sacramento fish stocks have the biggest impact , the commercial and recreational salmon fishery had an average economic value of $ 103 million per year between 1979 and 2004 .
The record low seasons are devastating news to beleaguered salmon fleets on the west coast .
California and Oregon ocean salmon fisheries are still recovering from a poor fishing season in 2005 and a disastrous one in 2006 , when Klamath River fall chinook returns were below their spawning escapement goal .

Nader / Gonzalez to Protest Oil Industry Price Gouging
Fed up with paying $ 70 to fill up your car with gasoline ?
What to do ?
If you are in corporate occupied territory ( read : our nation ’s capital ) next Tuesday , join with Ralph Nader and the Nader / Gonzalez team to protest oil industry speculation , manipulation , and conglomeration that is driving gasoline prices over $ 4 a gallon .
The protest will be held at noon on Tuesday , May 20 , 2008 at oil industry lobby headquarters ( American Petroleum Institute ) at 1220 L Street , NW , Washington , D.C. ( Corner of 13th and L Streets , NW )
We are also inviting the Obama , Clinton and McCain campaigns to join with us at this protest .
In recent years , the big five oil companies - ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco , ConocoPhillips , BP and Shell - have booked record profits - a big chunk of which result from oil industry market manipulation and anti-competitive practices .
( For example , oil companies have exploited their market position to intentionally restrict refining capacity by driving smaller , independent refiners out of business . )
Nader / Gonzalez would strictly regulate the oil industry - clamping down on speculators and enforcing the antitrust laws .
Nader / Gonzalez would also revoke federal subsidies to the oil industry , repeal multi-billion tax breaks and impose a windfall profits tax to fuel a transition to a solar energy economy .
So , if you are in the neighborhood next Tuesday , plan to join with us at noon .
If not , become a founding member of the Nader / Gonzalez Take Back Our Government from the Corporations Protest Fund .
The oil price gouging demonstration will be the second in a series of Nader / Gonzalez protests against the corporate takeover of our democracy .
Last week , Ralph Nader led a protest at the federal auto safety agency .
That agency is about to issue a weak federal roof crush standard that would deny rollover victims their rights to justice and compensation .
We ’ll be taking it to the streets of corporate occupied territory throughout the year .
Thank you for your support .
Together , we will make a difference .
Onward .

Russian Foreign Ministry reports are stating today the Prime Minister Putin ’s ‘ sudden ’ diplomatic trip to France was made at the behest of
China ’s President
Hu in order to ‘ warn ’ the European Union not to become involved with the US following what is widely expected to be a ‘ retaliatory strike ’ against the United States , and who the Chinese military has blamed for the catastrophic May 12th earthquake that has killed nearly 90,000 human beings .
Chinese and Russian Military scientists , these reports say , are concurring with Canadian researcher , and former Asia - Pacific Bureau Chief of Forbes Magazine , Benjamin Fulford , who in a very disturbing video released from his Japanese offices to the American public , details how the United States attacked China by the firing of a 90 Million Volt Shockwave from the Americans High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) facilities in Alaska .
So powerful was this Shockwave , Britain ’s Times Online News Service is reporting that the entire atmosphere over the Chinese earthquake zone became mysteriously changed 30 minutes prior to the 8.0 Magnitude Trembler :
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article3981225.ece
“ Can clouds predict earthquakes ?
YouTube has footage of strange multicoloured clouds seen just before the recent earthquake struck Sichuan province in China .
The first impression is of a rainbow smeared on to small scraps of clouds , a phenomenon best known in a circumzenithal halo .
This is created when sunlight shines through cirrus clouds full of tiny hexagonal ice crystals shaped like plates .
The crystals behave like glass prisms , splitting the light into a bow with the colours of the spectrum , often brighter than a rainbow .
But one puzzle is that the colours in the Chinese clouds were upside down from a normal circumzenithal halo – red pointing towards the horizon and blue towards the Sun , instead of the other way round . ”
Russian scientists are further speculating that the United States strike against China was ‘ exactly timed ’ to coincide with the
dangerous experiments ongoing at Large Hadron Collider for the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , and which we had previously reported on in our May 13th report titled “ CERN ‘ Nailed Heart Of Earth ’ With China Quake , Chilean Volcano ” .
Russian Military Analysts note that though China ’s Military has ordered is vast submarine fleet to ‘ disperse ’ throughout the Pacific Ocean , the Chinese ‘ attack ’ against the United States would , most likely , take a form of economic warfare instead of an actual clashing of forces .
More disturbing , however , in these reports is China ’s urging of both Syria and Turkey not to allow more water into mighty rivers of the Euphrates and Tigris , which the Iraqis are warning are running dry due to the severe drought in that war - torn Nation .
The importance of this latest move by China is the newly signed Defense Pact signed between Iran and Syria which would allow Chinese Military Forces permission to use Iranian territory to come to the aid of Syria .
It should be further noted that the Christian Bibles New Testament Book of Revelations ( Chapter 16 , Verse 12 ) prophesied that the Euphrates will dry up in preparation for the Battle of Armageddon and would be crossed by an Eastern Army of 200 million soldiers , of which in our World today only China is able to field and have the ability to reach by land alone .
Correction from Redsky
The above statement about The Book of Revelations is incorrect .
The Army of 200 million and Armageddon are two seperate events .
The army of 200 million appears in Revelation Chapter 9 Verse 13 - 18 ( The Sixth Trumpet ) and not as stated above .
The Army of 200 million is not the Chinese in fact it is not a literal army at all , it is a spiritual one .
For more information Click Here
Armageddon takes place at the valley of Megiddo in northern Israel and appears in Revelation Chapter 16 Verse 12 ( The Sixth Bowl ) .
Israel is attacked by the “ Kings of the east ” the Moslem states which are Iran , Syria , Iraq , Jordan , Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , Malaysia and Indonesia .
This is not the army of 200 million or the Chinese who have never been an invasive people .

France is plotting to create a Euro Army
Moves to create a European Army controlled from Brussels have been revealed .
France is pushing for a new dedicated military headquarters and more fighting formations .
The French take over the EU presidency next month and will use their six - month term to drive forward ambitious plans to develop Europe 's own military structures - a move which critics claim will undermine Nato by excluding the U.S .
Gordon Brown was forced to make a hurried denial , playing down the prospects of a Euro Army , as the fiercely divisive issue returned to the political agenda .
Critics in the UK are deeply suspicious of strengthening the EU 's military identity - fearing that the French see it as a way to challenge Washington 's world dominance .
Federalists , however , see a Euro Army as a key building - block of a future super - state .
French soldiers operate in Serbia , as part of a NATO peacekeeping force .
There have been new calls for an EU army to respond to crises in Europe .
As MEPs debated EU military policy yesterday , the chairman of the European Parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for the Union to develop more ' hard power ' military capability and spend more money on a European Army .
Jacek Saryusz - Wolski called for ' a common foreign and security policy , including a European army ' .
He said MEPs should in future have the final say on military missions under the EU flag - a move which would strip member states of a fundamental responsibility .
France , which along with Germany and Poland has spearheaded support for greater EU defence capability , has already indicated that the issue will feature heavily in its presidency , starting next month .

The French are expected to call on member countries to boost defence spending and commit more helicopters and aircraft .
The proposals , to be unveiled by President Nicolas Sarkozy , will urge the creation of more of the rapid reaction formations - each consisting of 1,500 troops from member countries - which take turns to be on stand - by for EU peacekeeping or humanitarian missions abroad , wearing the Eurocorps badge .
Enthusiasts for these ' EU Battle Groups ' see them as the most likely basis for a future European Army .
There are currently 15 , including one all - British formation , but the French are expected to push for a dramatic increase .
Opponents in Brussels responded by attacking current joint EU military efforts as ' impoverished and amateurish ' .
Andrew Duff , a Liberal Democrat MEP and member of the European Council on Foreign relations , said many member states ' armies were archaic and hamstrung by ' miserly ' military budgets , so talk of ' burden - sharing ' was often meaningless .
He said recent research showed only a fifth of the two million troops across EU countries were in a fit state to be deployed abroad .
Critics believe an EU Army would be crippled by deep divisions among allies and the failure of member states to match U.S. levels of defence spending .
The U.S. spends around 4 per cent of its GDP on defence , compared with under 3 per cent in Britain and France and even less in some EU states .
There are also fears that moves towards an EU army would undermine Nato and weaken Washington 's links with Europe on defence and security .
Tory defence spokesman Liam Fox said : ' The idea of a standing European military force under EU command or the creation of an EU defence budget is wishful but dangerous thinking .'
He added : ' This is another example of the EU getting involved in an area in which it has no business ' .
Downing Street sought to defuse the row .
Mr Brown 's spokesman said : ' The Prime Minister 's view is that there will not be a European Army .
It is important to remember that the European Parliament has no role in policy in this area . '
PORTAGE , Ind . – Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said this afternoon that recent comments by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright were “ offensive , ” “ outrageous , ” “ off base , ” and “ far out , ” and tweaked Senator Barack Obama for making clear his own condemnation of his former pastor ’s words on Tuesday – “ finally , ” she said .
In an interview to air tonight on Fox News ’s “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” Mrs. Clinton at first resists host Bill O’Reilly ’s bait to criticize Mr. Wright – but then engages fairly gleefully after Mr. O’Reilly asks what she thinks “ as an American citizen ” when “ you hear a fellow American citizen say that stuff about America ? ”
“ Well I take offense at it – I think it ’s offensive and outrageous , ” she said .
“ But it is part of an , you know , just an atmosphere we ’re in today where all kinds of things are being said , and people have to decide what they believe .
And I sure do n’t believe the United States government was behind AIDS . ”
Mr. O’Reilly said he was disturbed to “ see people jumping up and applauding when he says that , among other things , we ’re the moral equivalent of Al Qaeda . ”
Mrs. Clinton replied with the following :
“ Well Bill , that is part of the mosaic and diversity of America .
People are free to express their opinions , and the rest of us are free to agree or disagree .
And obviously on opinions like that – ”
“ It ’s hateful ! ” Mr. O’Reilly interrupted .
“ Well , you know , I happen to think that it is just totally off base .
It is just so far out it is hard to even understand and take seriously .
But what people are talking to me about is not that , I ’ve gotta tell you .
What I hear in all of these communities that I am in Indiana and North Carolina is what ’s happening in their lives , ” she said .
Mr. O’Reilly added a moment later that he felt “ sorry for Barack Obama on this one , ” asserting that “ his whole campaign has been derailed by some loony guy . ”
Then he asked if Mrs. Clinton felt sorry for Mr. Obama .
“ Well , I think he made his views clear , finally , that he disagreed .
And I think that ’s what he had to do , ” she said .
Mrs. Clinton has never been on Mr. O’Reilly ’s show , and is not frequent guest on Fox .
Yet both she and Mr. Obama are competing aggressively in Indiana and North Carolina for support from conservative Democrats , independents , male voters , blue - collar workers , and residents of traditionally Republican enclaves – demographic groups that watch Fox in good numbers .
The two states hold their primaries on Tuesday .
After taping the interview , Mrs. Clinton came to a union hall here for a rally , and shared a little of the interview with hundreds of cheering supporters .
When she said she had done the interview with Mr. O’Reilly , people applauded and a woman in the crowd shouted “ Go Hillary ! ” – prompting Mrs. Clinton to add , “ Hey , I ’m running for the toughest job in the world . ”
She also shared this exchange from the interview :
“ He said , ‘ hey , you ’re going to raise my taxes . ’
And I said , ‘ I sure am ’ ” – noting that her tax plan would raise taxes on people who earn more than $ 200,000 a year , but lower taxes for many of the middle - income workers who were in the union hall at the moment .
The crowd applauded boisterously then , too .
To restore liberty and bring the Republican Party back in line with defending this ideal .
A new form of cloning has been developed that is easier to carry out than the technique used to create
Dolly the sheep , raising fears that it may one day be used on human embryos to produce " designer " babies .
Scientists who used the procedure to create baby mice from the skin cells of adult animals have found it to be far more efficient than the Dolly technique , with fewer side effects , which makes it more acceptable for human use .
The mice were made by inserting skin cells of an adult animal into early embryos produced by in - vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
Some of the resulting offspring were partial clones but some were full clones – just like Dolly .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Unlike the Dolly technique , however , the procedure is so simple and efficient that it has raised fears that it will be seized on by IVF doctors to help infertile couples who are eager to have their own biological children .
One scientist said this weekend that a maverick attempt to perform the technique on humans is now too real to ignore .
" It 's unethical and unsafe , but someone may be doing it today , " said Robert Lanza , chief scientific officer of American biotechnology company Advanced Cell Technology .
" Cloning is n't here now , but with this new technique we have the technology that can actually produce a child .
If this was applied to humans it would be enormously important and troublesome , " said Dr Lanza , whose company has pioneered developments in stem cells and cell reprogramming .
" It raises the same issues as reproductive cloning and although the technology for reproductive cloning in humans does n't exist , with this breakthrough we now have a working technology whereby anyone , young or old , fertile or infertile , straight or gay can pass on their genes to a child by using just a few skin cells , " he said .
The technique involves the genetic reprogramming of skin cells so they revert to an embryonic - like state .
Last year , when the breakthrough was used on human skin cells for the first time , it was lauded by the Catholic Church and President George Bush as a morally acceptable way of producing embryonic stem cells without having to create or destroy human embryos .
However , the same technique has already been used in another way to reproduce offspring of laboratory mice that are either full clones or genetic " chimeras " of the adult mouse whose skin cells were reprogrammed .
The experiments on mice demonstrated that it is now possible in principle to take a human skin cell , reprogramme it back to its embryonic state and then insert it into an early human embryo .
The resulting child would share some of the genes of the person who supplied the skin tissue , as well as the genes of the embryo's two parents .

These offspring are chimeras – a genetic mix of two or more individuals – because some of their cells derive from the embryo and some from the skin cell .
Technically , such a child would have three biological parents .
Human chimeras occur naturally when two embryos fuse in the womb and such people are often normal and healthy .
Dr Lanza says there is no reason to believe that a human chimera created by the new technique would be unhealthy .
Furthermore , studies on mice have shown that it is possible to produce fully cloned offspring that are 100 per cent genetically identical to the adult .
This was achieved by using a type of defective mouse embryo with four sets of chromosomes instead of the normal two .
This " tetraploid " embryo only developed into the placenta of the foetus and when it was injected with a reprogrammed skin cell , the rest of the foetus developed from this single cell to become a full clone of the adult animal whose skin was used .
None of the scientists working on cell reprogramming to produce induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells – as the embryonic cells are known – plan to use it for human reproductive medicine .
Their main aim is to produce stem cells for the therapeutic treatment of conditions such as Parkinson's , Alzheimer 's and stroke .
However , Dr Lanza said that the mouse experiments his company had done demonstrated how easily the technology could be used to produce cloned or chimeric babies by inserting iPS cells into early human embryos .
This is not banned in many countries , where legislation has not kept pace with scientific developments .
In Britain , the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill going through Parliament does not mention the iPS technique , although experts believe that the new law should make it illegal because it involves genetic modification of cells that become part of the embryo .
" In addition to the great therapeutic promise demonstrated by this technology , the same technology opens a whole new can of worms , " Dr Lanza said .
" At this point there are no laws or regulations for this kind of thing and the bizarre thing is that the Catholic Church and other traditional stem - cell opponents think this technology is great when in reality it could in the end become one of their biggest nightmares , " he said .
" It is quite possible that the real legacy of this whole new programming technology is that it will be introducing the era of designer babies .
" So for instance if we had a few skin cells from Albert Einstein , or anyone else in the world , you could have a child that is say 10 per cent or 70 per cent Albert Einstein by just injecting a few of their cells into an embryo , " he said .
Even as Microsoft tries to shove Windows Vista down the collective and unwilling throat of computer users worldwide , the company is still perfecting the well - aged and well - loved Windows XP .
The latter of the two operating systems just received its third ( and evidently last ) service pack .
The collection of fixes and improvements includes the vast majority of security and performance updates , patches , and other stuff released in the two plus years SP2 was released .
It also includes a few new improvements .
There ’s little in SP3 that the user will actually see ; pretty much everything the service pack packs is background stuff .
Of course , with the release of a new service pack comes a huge , pressing question :
How does it compare to Windows Vista and its own recent update , Service Pack 1 , in the game performance department ?
Vista , of course , has been plagued by criticism that games run on it do n’t perform as well as they do in Windows XP , even though most of the problems were due to early graphics drivers and have gradually been worked out .
Come with us as we install XP SP3 and take it for a test drive , and more importantly compare it to Vista SP1 with a batch of performance tests .
Though DirectX 10 is Vista - only , many a gamer has sworn not to upgrade ; will XP SP3 cement their decision , or has Vista and its drivers matured enough to change a few minds ?

While the majority of the world rested easy after the intellegence assessment revealing that Iran had no nuclear weapons , nor had any plans of making them for more than 5 years , and many thinking an attack is far off into the future , it is my belief that the war had already started with a sale pending sign on it for the American people .
Reporting from Tehran on April 4 , Reuters quotes Mohsen Hakim , whose father , Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , leads the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , an ally of the Maliki US puppet government in Iraq : “ Tehran , by using its positive influence on the Iraqi nation , paved the way for the return of peace to Iraq and the new situation is the result of Iran ’s efforts . ”
However as thanks for the effort , Bush is on the brink of going Strangelove and has already made specific preparations and taking initial actions for the attack on Iran .
Naval activities had been building over the past four years , and according to Russian sources the United States and NATO has been quite ready to ransack Iran for some a while now , as opposed to misdated info which implied the build up was still in progress .
Advertisements
The invasion of Iran has already begun with a broken cease fire with major Shia militias in Iraq , attempting to root out and destroy the base of support for Iran , and the widespread and mysterious infection of wheat , a major staple in food supply in Iran , which some are attributing to possible biological attack .
The consequences of this pending attack , which is rumored to be a nuclear one , are beyond any reasonable comprehension .
Iranian ties with the likes of nuclear states such as Russia is particularly concerning , since the new Cold War basically began with the announcement of the defense missile shield by President Bush years ago and has become especially chilly with the U.S. insistence and backing of former Soviet states joining NATO and offering to warehouse such a system within its borders .
United States executive officials have warned Russia to remain neutral in the ordeal , however I find it hard to believe that Bush is looking for anything but a fight with the former ( and I use that phrase lightly ) communist country .
Well , it ’s a proven fact that fascists and communists do n’t get along very well .
The plan to attack Iran has been a likely goal of the Bush administration for some time .
With the framing of Afghanistan and Iraq on the pretext of going to war with them and build a military presence within the two countries , the Untied States has a perfect launching point against Iran , which resides directly in between .
Iran , is quite literally , a sitting duck and is perfectly surrounded from all angles .
The only real question is exactly how is he going to sell this to the American public , if not the world ?
Hitler made a case of invading Poland by dressing German political prisoners in full Polish army gear and shooting them just shy of a German military base near the Germany / Poland border , claiming invasion .
Considering the Reichstag - like procedure following the 9 - 11 tragedies , I would n’t put it past Bush to try something of the same magnitude .
Already false claims of Iranian threats against U.S. navy ships and obviously false claims of green zone attacks by Iran ( honestly , why would anybody with a gun to their head rush in just to provoke the one holding the gun ? ) by general Patraeus have been thrown about by the American media as absolute propaganda .
In short , an Iranian War is eminent , and despite what many experts might say , I am convinced that a full launch will occur before Bush leaves office , or even before the general election .
Many rumors have floated around as an attack coming as soon as this month , however that is yet to be seen .
This attack will set off one hell of a powder keg and will result in a full fledged World War between the west and the east .
China has the ace card against the United States , trillions of U.S. dollars and treasuries in reserve which could be used to collapse the U.S. economy almost immediately into Wiemar status , though it is questionable whether or not they will use the card with the very intricate trade ties the country has to the United States .
How it will all pan out has yet to be seen , though given the absolute criminality and evident insanity of the Bush Administration , as well as its obvious disenchantment with any living thing on the planet that is n’t an elitist , speak volumes of the likelihood that a war with Iran is unavoidable .

Did you know that there are 3,800 animal shelters in the United States , but only 1,500 shelters for abused women ?
Economist Allison Schrager is well aware of this fact , and she wrote about the puppies vs. people issue in More Intelligent Life .
You might be thinking that it's not an either animals or women issue , that it should be both , that we should support the humane treatment of any being .
But it turns out that for many philanthropists , it is either / or .
Schrager talks about a charity devoted to helping battered women , called the Retreat .
" The charity is located in East Hampton , a posh beach community , full of people who make philanthropy a part of their financial and social lives .
Yet she struggles to find donors , " Schrager notes .
" In response to her requests , [ the fundraising director ] often hears , ' Well , no one I would know would be a victim of domestic violence .
Besides , I already give money to the animal rescue charity . '
The animal rescue charity is one of the best endowed in the area . "

Perhaps , as Schrager points out , people are more willing to give money to animal organizations because they perceive animals as blameless .
Battered women ?
Not so much .
" Perhaps we prefer helping animals because we believe they have a greater need .
People often think a battered woman is free to leave her situation , while animals are physically prevented from leaving , " Schrager writes .
" Humans are easier to blame for their circumstances .
Because we do not grant animals the same freedoms , we also do not assign them the same level of responsibility for their situation . "
So is it wrong to give money to animals when you do n't give money to human causes ?
Is there a charity hierarchy that should be widely acknowledged ?

Does One Abused Woman = 100 Abused Puppies ?
[ More Intelligent Life via Newser ]
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking has documented a surge in Democratic voters ' support for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in recent days , swelling from a four percentage - point lead for Obama during the first part of May to a record 16 - point lead for him in polling from May 16 - 18 .
Prior to now , Obama 's largest lead over Clinton was 11 percentage points , achieved briefly in mid-April .
However , for most of the past month , Clinton and Obama have been fairly closely matched , with neither sustaining a significant lead for more than a few days .
It thus remains to be seen whether this improvement in Obama 's standing is a variation of the same pattern , or represents a turning point in the race .
Obama Swamps Clinton Among Young Voters and Others
The broadening of Obama 's appeal for the nomination seen in Gallup 's May 16 - 18 polling is fairly widespread , with the percentage favoring him increasing among most demographic categories of Democratic voters .
However , as a result , certain groups that were already highly supportive of Obama for the nomination -- men , 18 - to 29 - year - olds , postgrads , and upper - income Democrats -- are now overwhelmingly in his camp .
Obama is currently favored among these groups by a 2 - to - 1 margin , or better , over Clinton .
At the same time , support for Clinton among some of her traditionally stalwart support groups -- women , Easterners , whites , adults with no college education , and Hispanics -- has fallen below 50 % .
The only major demographic group still supporting Clinton to the tune of 51 % or more is women aged 50 and older .
This group 's preferences have changed little during May , at the same time that Clinton 's support among younger men ( those 18 to 49 ) has declined by nearly 10 points .
Bottom Line
After nearly 20 grueling weeks on the campaign trail since he shook up the Democratic primary race by winning the Iowa caucuses , Obama has finally stretched his lead over his chief rival into the teens .
Having previously captured nearly the maximum level of support from black voters , Obama 's latest gains have come from a broad spectrum of rank - and - file Democrats .
At least for now , he has expanded his position as the preferred candidate of men , young adults , and highly educated Democrats , and has erased Clinton 's advantages with most of her prior core constituency groups , including women , the less well - educated , and whites .
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results for May 1 - 13 , 2008 , are based on interviews with 5,474 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
The maximum margin of sampling error for samples of this size is ±1 percentage point .
The Democratic nomination results for May 16 - 18 , 2008 , are based on interviews with 1,261 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
The maximum margin of sampling error for samples of this size is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

I went to Tibet to explore this second viewpoint , hoping to catch a glimpse of the Tibet question through Chinese eyes .
Before coming to Tibet , I had spent two years as a volunteer English teacher at a small college in Sichuan , which made me particularly interested in meeting volunteer teachers like Mei Zhiyuan .
I also talked with other young government - sent workers and entrepreneurs who had come to seek their fortunes , and for four weeks that was my focus , as I spent time in Lhasa and other places where there are large numbers of Han settlers .
Of all the pieces that compose the Tibet question , this is by far the most explosive : the Dalai Lama has targeted Han migration as one of the greatest threats to Tibetan culture , and the sensitivity of the issue is evident in some statistics .
According to Beijing , Han make up only three percent of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region , whereas some Tibetan exiles claim that the figure is in fact over 50 percent and growing .
Tibetans see the influx of Han as yet another attempt to destroy their culture ; Chinese see the issue as Deng Xiaoping did in 1987 , when he said , " Tibet is sparsely populated .
The two million Tibetans are not enough to handle the task of developing such a huge region .
There is no harm in sending Han into Tibet to help ....
The key issues are what is best for Tibetans and how can Tibet develop at a fast pace , and move ahead in the four modernizations in China . "
Regardless of the accuracy of the official Chinese view , many of the government - sent Han workers in Tibet clearly see their role in terms of service .
They are perhaps the most important historical actors in terms of the Tibet question , and yet they are also the most - often overlooked .
Why did they come to Tibet ?
What do they think of the place , how are they changing it , and what do they see as their role ?
Gao Ming , a twenty - two - year - old English teacher , told me , " One aspect was that I knew we should be willing to go to the border regions , to the minority areas , to places that are jianku — difficult .
These are the parts of China that need help .
If I could have gone to Xinjiang , I would have , but I knew that Tibet was also a place that needed teachers .
That was the main reason .
Another aspect was that Tibet is a natural place — there 's no pollution here , and almost no people ; much of it is untouched .
So I wanted to see what it was like . "
Shi Mingzhi , a twenty - four - year - old physics teacher , said , " First , I 'd say it 's the same reason that you came here to travel — because it's an interesting place .
But I also wanted to come help build the country .
You know that all of the volunteers in this district are Party members , and if you 're a Party member , you should be willing to go to a jianku place to work .
So you could say that all of us had patriotic reasons for coming — perhaps that 's the biggest reason .
But I also came because it was a good opportunity , and the salary is higher than in the interior of China . "
The World from Berlin Can NATO Afford to Anger Russia ?
Should NATO expand to Russia 's southern flank ?
The small country of Georgia insists it should be offered membership , but Europe is n't so sure .
German commentators on Thursday argue that the trans -Atlantic alliance should avoid angering Russia .
Everything you are about to read is true .
Without any public consultation or debate , without once having made this a manifesto pledge , without ever having invited independent or critical opinion to scrutinise the implications , the British government is handing over large tracts of the school education system , along with tens of millions of our tax money , to groups of Anousics .
Anousics are people who variously believe in ghosts and alien visitations , in the dead coming to life , in magical occurrences , in forms of cannibalism , in obsessive rituals and incantations , in strange psychological observances and sexual perversions , in weird ancient myths , which they regard as true accounts of the origin and nature of the world , and in personified forms of evil and malevolence ; who traditionally employ and always threaten torture and execution for those who do not accept their theories , who to gain their ends sometimes engage in war , massacre and murder , and at other times use bribery , brainwashing , and techniques of preying on the poor , sick , depressed and traumatised .
They sometimes hide their true face behind masks of charitable works , and even encourage their recruits to think this is their real nature ; but their record is overwhelmingly against them otherwise .
Their chief means of recruitment , however , is proselytisation of the very young , knowing that once they have inserted the seeds of their views deeply in young minds , they will either be able to keep hold of those minds or reclaim them at opportune moments later .
It is this latter that is especially troubling , because the government 's active aid to Anousics in preying on children 's minds is shocking beyond belief , not only for the intrinsic wrong of the abuse involved in allowing people with such ghastly views and practices to enjoy open season on defenceless child minds , but because by this means the whole panoply of their views and practices is helped to survive and to continue troubling the world .
Now , as throughout history , organised Anousia has repeatedly been dangerous , destabilising , and persistently retrogressive , and as one of the most backward forces in today 's world it ought not to be supported from public funds in gaining access to children : yet our own government is actively promoting it .
Here are the facts ; these facts are in the public domain , and like the foregoing they are absolutely and horribly true .
One of the main Anousic organisations in England is in the process of becoming the largest sponsor of " academy schools " .
By next year it will have nearly trebled the number of academies it controls to over 30 , and is in discussion with the government to assume control of a further 54 .
Another Anousic organisation which currently runs just three academy schools is engaged in taking over a further 22 ; a third is due to assume control of 25 within the next couple of years .
Between them Anousic organisations already run one - quarter of all secondary schools in England , and this expansion will greatly increase the proportion .
How is this happening ?
With government carte blanche , with government money - that is : your and my tax money - and government help .
When academy schools were first invented as a form of " public private partnership " , sponsoring bodies were required to provide an initial £ 2 m donation , with funding thereafter to come mainly from government .
This requirement has now been waived so that Anousic organisations are simply given control of publicly - funded schools , for free .
One spokesman for an Anousic educational body , Steve Chalke , was quoted in the Financial Times last weekend as saying that the government has set " no ceiling and no floor " for how much Anousics have to provide to be allowed to take over or set up a school ; another Anousic organisation spokesman said , " We now have a more relaxed regime , where we are not obliged to provide an endowment . "
On whose say so ?
With what discussion ?
The figure of 25 % for the number of England 's secondary schools which " have an Anousic character " ( a slight paraphrase of Whitehall 's own phrase ) is Whitehall 's own published figure : it amounts to 700 schools and rising fast .
The proportion of primary schools run by Anousics is higher ; 4,470 primary schools are run by the main English Anousic organisation alone : 4,470 institutions for children aged 4 and upwards , to be inculcated into Anousic beliefs and practices !
There has been no public debate about the acceptability of the current situation , and none about the rapid expansion of government - funded Anousic control over such a large slice of the education system .
Assertions to the effect that Anousic - run schools are better than non-Anousic state schools , so that " middle - class parents can get a better education for their children for free " – " for free " means on your and my tax money , remember - have become a kind of mantra ; apart from the shocking fact of handing children to Anousic organisations for an education ( do they mean : indoctrination ?
but of course not !
- an Anousic school is surely not interested in producing future Anousics - what an idea ! ) this notion has been repeatedly challenged , but of course it is neither in Anousic nor government interests for this fact to be too widely known .
By the way : I use the word " Anousic " as a generic term for " religious " .
It is a neologism suggested by ancient Greek to connote " mindless " , " unreasoning " , " illogical " .
I grant that the systematicity and long - term thinking implicit in the cunning strategy of capturing young minds suggests the opposite of all three : rather , it is the content - and therefore the results - of what religion wishes to insert into those young minds that merits the epithets .
The three Anousic organisations mainly referred to in this article are the Church of England , the Baptists , and the United Learning Trust , but Muslim , Jewish and other religious organisations share in the tens of millions of our tax pounds to spread their word about ghosts , myths , obsessive rituals and incantations , distorted sexuality , prejudice ... and all the rest of the happy brew .
If the government were handing schools and money to astrologers , witch doctors , Scientologists , the Manson cult , and the like , to educate our children , we would be concerned , would we not ?
Yet the grounds of belief , the beliefs themselves , and the level of rationality of these groups do not differ one jot from any of the so - called " major religions " to whom the government is handing over schools and money like candy .
Where is the debate about this ?
On what grounds does the government think it can disburse our taxes to these ends without a single by - your - leave ?
That is the question : and a burning question it is .
All education should be secular .
But failing that , religious indoctrination - which in a free society will occur , because one cannot outlaw religion itself , though one should argue against it vigorously – should happen at the private expense of those who choose to inflict it on their children .
It should emphatically not be happening at public expense .

NIST physicist Till Rosenband adjusts the quantum logic clock , which derives its “ ticks ” from the natural vibrations of an aluminum ion ( electrically charged atom ) .
The aluminum ion is trapped together with one beryllium ion inside the copper - colored chamber in the foreground .

An atomic clock that uses an aluminum atom to apply the logic of computers to the peculiarities of the quantum world now rivals the world 's most accurate clock , based on a single mercury atom .
Both clocks are at least 10 times more accurate than the current U.S. time standard .
The measurements were made in a yearlong comparison of the two next - generation clocks , both designed and built at the Commerce Department 's National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) .
The clocks were compared with record precision , allowing scientists to measure the relative frequencies of the two clocks to 17 digits — the most accurate measurement of this type ever made .
The comparison produced the most precise results yet in the worldwide quest to determine whether some of the fundamental constants that describe the universe are changing slightly over time , a hot research question that may alter basic models of the cosmos .
The research is described in the March 6 issue of Science Express .
The aluminum and mercury clocks are both based on natural vibrations in ions ( electrically charged atoms ) and would neither gain nor lose one second in over 1 billion years — if they could run for such a long time — compared to about 80 million years for NIST - F1 , the U.S. time standard based on neutral cesium atoms .
The mercury clock was first demonstrated in 2000 and is now four times better than its last published evaluation in 2006 , thanks to ongoing improvements in the clock design and operation .
The mercury clock continues its reign as the world ’s most accurate for now , by a margin of 20 percent over the aluminum clock , but the designers say both experimental clocks could be improved further .
“ The aluminum clock is very accurate because it is insensitive to background magnetic and electric fields , and also to temperature , ” says Till Rosenband , the NIST physicist who built the clock and is the first author of the new paper .
“ It has the lowest known sensitivity of any atomic clock to temperature , which is one of the most difficult uncertainties to calibrate . ”
Both the aluminum clock and the mercury clock are based on ions vibrating at optical frequencies , which are 100,000 times higher than microwave frequencies used in NIST - F1 and other similar time standards around the world .
Because optical clocks divide time into smaller units , they can be far more precise than microwave standards .
NIST scientists have several other optical atomic clocks in development , including one based on thousands of neutral strontium atoms .
The strontium clock recently achieved twice the accuracy of NIST - F1 , but still trails the mercury and aluminum clocks .
Highly accurate clocks are used to synchronize telecommunications networks and deep - space communications , and for satellite navigation and positioning .
Next - generation clocks may also lead to new types of gravity sensors , which have potential applications in exploration for underground natural resources and fundamental studies of the Earth .
Laboratories around the world are developing optical clocks based on a variety of different designs and atoms ; it is not yet clear which design will emerge as the best candidate for the next international standard .
The new paper provides the first published evaluation of the operational quantum logic clock , so - named because it is based on the logical reasoning process used in quantum computers ( see sidebar below for details ) .
The clock is a spin - off of NIST research on quantum computers , which grew out of earlier atomic clock research .
Quantum computers , if they can be built , will be capable of solving certain types of complex problems that are impossible or prohibitively costly or time consuming to solve with today ’s technologies .
The NIST quantum logic clock uses two different kinds of ions , aluminum and beryllium , confined closely together in an electromagnetic trap and slowed by lasers to nearly “ absolute zero ” temperatures .
Aluminum is a stable source of clock ticks , but its properties cannot be detected easily with lasers .
The NIST scientists applied quantum computing methods to share information from the aluminum ion with the beryllium ion , a workhorse of their quantum computing research .
The scientists can detect the aluminum clock ’s ticks by observing light signals from the beryllium ion .
NIST ’s tandem ion approach is unique among the world ’s atomic clocks and has a key advantage : “ You can pick from a bigger selection of atoms , ” explains NIST physicist Jim Bergquist , who built the mercury clock .
“ And aluminum has a lot of good qualities — better than mercury ’s . ”
An optical clock can be evaluated precisely only by comparison to another clock of similar accuracy serving as a “ ruler . ” NIST scientists used the quantum logic clock to measure the mercury clock , and vice versa .
In addition , based on fluctuations in the frequencies of the two clocks relative to each other over time , NIST scientists were able to search for a possible change over time in a fundamental quantity called the fine - structure constant .
This quantity measures the strength of electromagnetic interactions in many areas of physics , from studies of atoms and molecules to astronomy .
Some evidence from astronomy has suggested the fine - structure constant may be changing very slowly over billions of years .
If such changes are real , scientists would have to dramatically change their theories of the fundamental nature of the universe .
The NIST measurements indicate that the value of the fine - structure constant is not changing by more than 1.6 quadrillionths of 1 percent per year , with an uncertainty of 2.3 quadrillionths of 1 percent per year ( a quadrillionth is a millionth of a billionth ) .
The result is small enough to be “ consistent with no change , ” according to the paper .
However , it is still possible that the fine - structure constant is changing at a rate smaller than anyone can yet detect .
The new NIST limit is approximately 10 times smaller than the best previous measurement of the possible present - day rate of change in the fine - structure constant .
The mercury clock is an especially useful tool for such tests because its frequency fluctuations are magnified by any changes in this constant .
Where the ‘ Quantum Logic Clock ’ Gets Its Name
The NIST quantum logic clock is so named because it borrows techniques that are key to quantum computers , which would solve problems using quantum mechanics , nature ’s instruction book for the smallest particles of matter and light .
Logic is reasoning that determines an action or result based on which one of different possible options is received as input .
In the NIST clock , the input options are two different quantum states , or internal energy levels , of an aluminum ion .
Information about this state is transferred to a beryllium ion , which , depending on the input , produces different signals that are easily detected .
NIST scientists use lasers to cool the two ions which are held 4 thousandths of a millimeter apart in an electromagnetic trap .
Aluminum is the larger of the two ions , while the beryllium emits light under the conditions of this experiment .
Scientists hit the ions with pulses from a “ clock laser ” within a narrow frequency range .
If the laser frequency is at the center of the frequency range , the precise “ resonance frequency ” of aluminum , this ion jumps to a higher energy level , or 1 in the binary language of computers .
Otherwise , the ion remains in the lower energy state , or 0 .
If there is no change in the aluminum ion , then another laser pulse causes both ions to begin rocking side to side in unison because of their physical proximity and the interaction of their electrical charges .
An additional laser pulse converts this motion into a change in the internal energy level of the beryllium ion .
This pulse reverses the direction of the ion ’s magnetic “ spin , ” and the beryllium goes dark , a signal that the aluminum remained in the 0 state .
On the other hand , if the aluminum ion jumps to the higher energy level , then the additional laser pulses fail to stimulate a shared rocking motion and have no effect on the beryllium ion , which keeps emitting light .
Scientists detect this light as a signal that the aluminum ion jumped from 0 to 1 .
The goal is to tune the clock laser to the exact frequency that prompts the aluminum to jump from 0 to 1 .
The actual measurement of the ticking of the clock is provided not by the ions but rather by the clock laser ’s precisely tuned center frequency , which is measured with a “ frequency comb , ” a tool for measuring very high optical frequencies , or colors of light .

Once a week , Daily Intel takes a peek at what your friends and neighbors are doing behind doors left slightly ajar .
Today , the Loner Guy Trying Not to Be a Loner : 27 , male , Times Square , straight , single , unemployed .
DAY ONE
2 p.m. : Made plans to see a show with a girl I know from improv class , W , whom I want to ask out .
It ’s an informal date but should provide for an opportunity to start gaining the confidence to officially ask her out .
3 p.m. : Thinking of W .
My last relationship that lasted more than a few dates was probably high school .
This is n’t to say I never meet girls and hook up , but it ’s rare and never anything that I wish to pursue for more than a night .
It ’s become quite apparent that I need to find a girlfriend .
I want someone to spend time with .
The last three years I ’ve basically been running solo .
4 p.m. : Show is in four hours .
Just came back from gym and am getting a little too excited for the non-date with her .
Decide to masturbate to get the poison out and make sure sex is n’t on my mind tonight .
6 p.m. : Send a text to her , asking what time we should meet and where .
No reply yet .
7 p.m. : Still no reply .
Show is at 8 p.m .
8 p.m. : Show started .
I ran into two platonic female friends there and join them .
W warned me that it was n’t for sure but said she ’d text me and play it by ear .
I hate NYC .
This never happened in New Hampshire , where I used to work in construction .
There was nothing to distract us at the last second .
If we made plans , we stuck to them .
Since getting here last September , I ’ve had people cancel or no - show on me countless times and it ’s never done in contempt .
Simply how NYC works , but I do n’t see myself ever getting used to it .
10 p.m. : Show is over and I ’m not happy .
My friend in Massachusetts is moving tomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m. I decide to leave tonight to help him out .
Do n’t feel like being in NYC anymore .
DAY TWO
Midnight : I finally get to my car in Harrison , New Jersey , and begin my trek to northeastern Massachusetts .
3 a.m. : Tank up on Route 84 .
Some random drunk girl comes up and gives me some story about her friend being arrested and towed owing to a DUI and now she ’s helpless .
I tell her it ’s not my way and enter the gas station to pay .
3:01 a.m. :
She is at my car again this time near tears simply asking for a ride a couple exits down 84 West .
I was traveling on 84 East .
This does n’t dissuade her and I fall for it and give her a ride .
“ I think it ’s exit 86 … yeah , I ’m pretty sure that ’s it . ”
3:05 a.m. : We ’re on 84 West .
The exits read 62 , 61 , 60 , 59 .
Being drunk did n’t improve her sense of direction .
3:10 a.m. : I tell her I ’m all done with this and try to drop her off , but exit 59 has no 24 - hour gas stations .
I turn back down 84 East .
3:15 a.m. :
When we reach exit 63 , the exit I picked her up at , her eyes light up .
She recognizes where she is .
Tells me to travel three more exits east .
At least I ’m going the direction I need to go .
3:20 a.m. :
She is excited to report that she is confident that her father lives at exit 66 .
3:30 a.m. : After some searching through a suburban area , we find her father ’s place .
She tells me to drive slowly and turn off my lights when we approach her father ’s house .
She ’s 24 and still fears her father ’s wrath .
I am a pussy , but I have had enough of her .
I bluntly tell her , “ No . Get out , ” and drive briskly away as soon as she gets out .
DAY THREE
7:30 a.m. : Wake up , move friend ’s shit .
5 p.m. : Done moving , we ’re just sitting around .
Gives me time to be angry at my failed non-date .
I just ca n’t get a break .
8 p.m. : Drive up to New Hampshire and visit a bar with a friend in Manchester .
10 p.m. :
We rank the girls in the bar in totally shameless fashion , critiquing every fault , despite acknowledging our many physical and psychological failures .
We both talk big games but make zero attempt at picking up girls .
We pretend it ’s because we ’re from out of town and it ’s a waste of time .
The ability to justify every failure and be continuously single go hand in hand .
Midnight : Another bar .
New Hampshire ’s bar scene is awful .
DAY FOUR
10 a.m. : Visit a Verizon store because rumor has it that one of the pretty , popular girls from high school works there .
We heard she ’s a train wreck .
She ’s not there .
8 p.m. : Back in NYC .
See a show with two female friends , one of whom is kinda cute .
W from Thursday is working at the theater .
We exchange some pleasantries , and she does n’t even mention missing the show .
Would a girl who likes a boy ever completely ignore him on a hang - out situation ?
No , but I refuse to admit I have no chance .
10 p.m. :
My two friends and I go to a quiet bar afterward and I ’m inundated by girl talk .
They discuss how the cute one has fallen in love with her old boyfriend and has been having sex with him all week despite being on her period .
This destroys my plans to attempt to hit on her .
Then they discuss the best way for the other to get a comedian to ask her out .
Midnight : Period talk wears them out , and I ’m stuck going back to my apartment alone .
I text some friends on my way back to the apartment trying to find any reason to not go home .
I ’m ignored .
2 a.m. : A girl that I have zero sexual interest in is being pretty blunt over text about wanting to hook up .
Such is my life .
I really , really do n’t want to masturbate tonight .
2:30 a.m. : Fantastic time .
I hate myself .
DAY FIVE
7 p.m. : Had an improv class with W. Class went badly .
10 p.m. :
The class goes out for drinks after .
W joins us , and on the way there I backhandedly ask W out .
I ask if she wants to see Bombardo , a popular independent improv troupe , this weekend .
She says she ’s busy and does n’t know who they are .
11 p.m. : W is being receptive to one of the other men in class .
He ’s making her laugh and she ’s calling him adorable .
He ’s discussing his failure with women .
She says that a lack of confidence conveyed when asking a girl out attracts her .
Up to this point I have worked very hard at seeming confident and not a loser .
This news seems bad .
11:20 p.m. :
She ’s grazing his hand .
11:45 p.m. : W and I leave to take the 1 train together .
She ’s crossing her legs away from me , and not being very receptive to the conversation .
At 42nd Street she asks if this is my stop .
It is n’t , but I get the message .
12:15 a.m. :
This is probably the most work I ’ve put into asking a girl out in a long time , and it was an epic failure .
The worst part is that the guy she was so receptive to is the same height as me and looks old and is n’t in good shape .
I continually use my height ( five foot six ) as the reason why no girls will go out with me .
It ’s apparent that I was shot down for me and nothing else .
I really , really liked this girl .
I was confident that we could have a strong relationship , more so than any other girl I ’ve met .
I failed .
Horribly .
3 a.m. : Still stings .
I simply do n’t know how to “ close ” on a relationship , either platonic or romantic .
DAY SIX
1 p.m. Ran some errands about 23rd Street .
A gorgeous blonde is Rollerblading in tight , white shorts .
This is n’t fair .
5 p.m .
Went to the gym and then came home and searched for videos of blonde girls .
I often masturbate after going to the gym .
It is n’t because of girls at the gym — it ’s a sausage party there .
No , I mostly do it because I just like to be efficient with my showers .
7 p.m. : Writing class on Christopher Street .
When I got to NYC from New Hampshire , my first “ I ’m not in New Hampshire anymore ” experience was when I noticed four S&M / leather sex shops on two blocks of Christopher Street and 10th Street .
How can there be enough business to support all these stores ?
10 p.m. :
It ’s becoming more and more apparent that I only signed up for this class because I had a thing for the teacher during the open house .
DAY SEVEN
5 p.m. : W just texted me asking me , yet again , where our improv group is meeting .
So her cell phone does work .
7 p.m.–10 p.m. : Improv is pretty rough for everyone .
I was stuck doing scenes with a crazy girl that everyone hates .
11:30 p.m. : Hang out with a guy friend .
He discusses this girl he met and he ’s been texting .
I offer my wingman services .
He will see if he can set something up .
TOTALS : Four acts of masturbation ; zero acts of intercourse ; zero acts of oral sex ; one crushingly failed act of asking out a girl .

Mountain View , California , May 20 , 2008 -- Silicon Valley janitors , mostly immigrants from Mexico and Central America , walked out of Cisco Systems and Yahoo buildings in the first day of a Bay Area - wide strike intended to force building service contractors to sign a new agreement with their union , Service Employees Local 1877 .
The union represents more than 6000 janitors in the San Francisco area , whose wages are not even half what the Economic Policy Institute says it takes to meet basic needs for a family of four , or $ 54,000 annually .
It takes more than 77 % of a Bay Area janitor 's wages to rent a one - bedroom apartment in San Jose .
LA / Orange County janitors just signed a new contract after a one - day strike , and now have to work only six months to become eligible for medical care .
In the Bay Area it takes 2.5 years .
Silicon Valley 's wealthy corporations could do the right thing , but are so far choosing to leave hardworking families struggling to make ends meet , said Mike Garcia , president of Local 1877 .

Flickr Photos Used by Virgin Mobile
Virgin Mobile seems to have just made a potentially big ‘ oopsie . ’
In a current outdoor advertising campaign , the giant media corporation grabbed a photo off flickr ( from user chewywong ) and slapped it onto a billboard .
That ’s not where the issue lies .
The photo was licensed under the creative commons and all that was required for use of the photo was the printing of a link back to the source material and Virgin complied with this license .
The problem lies in that the image featured an unreleased minor .
Using this photo without a model release opens up Virgin to a potential claim by the model .
Currently , the model and her family are investigating their legal options in a claim against Virgin .
They ’re not pleased about the use and probably wo n’t have a big problem finding a lawyer to pick up the case for them .
The usage was originally discovered by a flickr user ( sesh00 ) who hoped to inform a fellow user about the use of the photo .
He saw the billboard in Australia and took a photo which he posted here ( see that link for much of the commentary from the model and her family ) .
He has also posted this thread that discusses the situation .
Instead of paying a photographer and model to produce a shoot , Virgin looks like it may be paying even more both in terms of cash and in public opinion .

Humpback Tows Whale Researcher 's Boat in British Columbia
Duration : 05:10
A humpback whale lifted and towed a researcher ’s boat in Hartley Bay , British Columbia , on September 10 .
Whale researcher Nicole Gwyneth Robinson was attempting to photograph the whale before it moved under her boat .
In this video , the whale is seen moving around Robinson ’s boat before it blows water towards her .
“ Oh my gosh , He ’s pulling us , ” Robinson can be heard saying in this video when she watches the whale dragging the boat forward .
In a Facebook post , which featured the video , Robinson urged people to not get too close to whales in the wild .
“ If they come to you , wait till free to leave .
Keep motor off at all times until safe to leave , ” Robinson wrote .

Christian writes about his frustration with Django ’s release process .
There has not been a new release of Django for over a year , and the prevailing advice is to use trunk , the latest development code .
I sympathize with him .
We run Django 0.96 at Chesspark with plenty of patches .
We have our database patches that fix many inefficiencies in stock Django .
All but one of these patches are still , a year later , not integrated upstream .
Most of the patches have been accepted but are just sitting there .
Recently we added a backport of the streaming file uploads patch , which has also not been integrated into trunk .
No Releases Leads To Slower Development
Christian also notes that developers are reluctant to commit to trunk now for fear of breaking things for all the people that must depend on trunk to be stable .
Perhaps this is why contributing users like us have to wait over a year and continually fight to have our bugs remain open and our issues addressed .
There is no perfect software , and the whole point of web facing software is that it can be quickly iterated .
I understand that Django would like to get to the magic 1.0 release , but not making any interim releases is just making the whole process take longer , I fear .
Django Needs Better Maintainership
The bar is high in open source projects for good maintainership .
Just look at the Linux kernel for an example of this .
Keeping up with the community is a hard job , and that ’s why projects delegate responsibility to the community .
Here are my suggestions for improving things :
Stop waiting for perfect bug fixes and let improvements be incremental .
If the patch can potentially benefit other pieces of code then open new bugs for this and get the patch into the tree .
Improvement for some people is better than improvement for none .
Stop waiting for 1.0 and do regular releases .
Some of these releases may break things compared to previous releases .
This is fine .
We all know that Django is a young project and that it is in heavy development .
I would rather that the upgrade pain be a known quantity instead of in constant motion .
Take care of your community .
Communicate why bugs are n’t moving forward .
People who submit patches are relatively rare , and the project needs to educate these people so that future patches are better , and also treat them nicely so they do n’t get frustrated .
I spent a lot of time figuring out why Django was slow , fixing it , preparing patches , and working to get these patches applied .
Why must I continually fight people to keep the bug open and progressing ?
This is not very encouraging .
Delegate responsibility if you do n’t have the knowledge .
I know several people who ca n’t use Django because it does n’t support MS SQL Server .
People are working to address this problem , but are forced to work outside the core project since Django removed all the MSSQL stuff for lack of a maintainer .
Surely if there are two seperate projects for MSSQL on Google Code then there is someone interested in maintaining this part of DJango , even if that maintenance is in form of a rewrite .
Long Live Django
I really hope that Django can overcome these issues and be one of the projects that is so well run that other projects use it for inspiration .
It has a lot of utility and promise even at this early stage , which is why I have used it on three different websites and am building new ones on top of Django as well .
I also recommend Django to others .
These issues need to be addressed , and I hope the Django team does so .
It was a little embarassing to recommend Django to people and have those people come back to me with “ Django does n’t care about XYZ ” .
Surely they were wrong , I thought .
Looking into the issue , I can see why they think this .
When a project closes the door on useful contributions ( like MS SQL support ) , it is hard to take away any other message .
Please keep making Django better .
We ’ll be here trying to help .
UPDATE 06/12 : Please read the counterpart post as well : 5 Reasons To Love Django .
Right on cue , Nokia 's WiMAX - enabled N810 Internet Tablet has surfaced at CTIA 2008 , and yep , this critter is destined to go on sale here in the US of A this summer .
Beyond that , you 'll notice the familiar 4.13 - inch touchscreen , slide - out QWERTY keyboard and even a built - in webcam for video calls , Mozilla - powered browser , integrated GPS / media player , 2GB of internal memory and a microSD expansion slot .
Heck , Nokia even touts this thing 's ability to " access the Internet over WiFi or via conventional cellular data networks by pairing to a compatible mobile phone via Bluetooth technology . "
Also announced today is the freshly updated OS2008 , which includes an enhanced e-mail client , support for Chinese character rendering in the browser and RSS feeds and " Seamless Software Update functionality " to boot .
Needless to say , said OS will come standard on the currently unpriced Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition -- which is scheduled to land wherever WiMAX connectivity is available -- but existing N810 / N800 owners will also get the OS upgrade free of charge in Q2 .
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday dashed a bid by T - Mobile and AT&T to stave off a class - action lawsuit challenging the carriers ' policies against unlocking mobile phones .
The justices declined to review an October decision by the California Supreme Court that cleared the way for a lawsuit that attorneys claimed could represent " millions " of California customers .
In response to similar lawsuits , Verizon and Sprint , both CDMA carriers , have agreed to provide the software code to unlock cellphones after customers nationwide have completed their original contract , attorneys said .
" That was the compromise we ended up with to get the cases settled , " said California attorney Robert Bramson , one of the lawyers suing carriers T - Mobile and AT&T .
T- Mobile and AT&T fought the lawsuit all the way to the nation 's high court .
The two carriers , on the GSM network , are accused of unfair business practices by locking down their phones to their service plans .
Last year , Librarian of Congress James H. Billington listed cell phone unlocking as one of six new exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , or DMCA .
That change , however , left unclear whether carriers were responsible for unlocking the handsets .
The high court 's decision sets aside language in the terms - of - service agreement requiring aggrieved AT&T and T - Mobile customers to submit to binding arbitration instead of going to court .
The phone carriers urged the justices to require that their customers honor the contracts they had signed .
The lower courts had declared those contracts " unconscionable . "
The case the U.S. Supreme Court rejected on Tuesday , if successful , could force AT&T to unlock the coveted iPhone .
AT&T is Apple 's exclusive phone provider .
" They may be more unwilling than otherwise because the iPhone is such a big seller , " Bramson said .
The suits also prompted all four of the phone providers to reduce the fees charged to costumers who terminate a mobile phone contract before it expires .
Still , all four carriers face litigation to reduce those new , pro-rated fees even further .
AT&T 's plan , implemented Monday , is similar to the other carriers ' opt - out schedule .
Each month , an account holder 's normal $ 175 charge to back out of the two - year contract is reduced by $ 5 .
" Pro-rated is a step in the right direction , " said California attorney David Franklin , one of the lawyers suing the carriers .
Passed in 1998 as an anti-piracy measure , the DMCA makes it illegal to " circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access " to copyrighted material – in this case the firmware that locks a phone to a provider 's network .
The law tasks the U.S. Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress with investigating how the anti-circumvention provision could hurt legitimate users , and then carving out appropriate exemptions every three years .
The cell phone unlocking exemption covers cases where cell phone software locks are circumvented " for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting to a wireless telephone communication network . "

Everyone knows commercial airliners are little more than flying CO2 machines , and the airline industry is taking the first steps toward making them cleaner .
But far less attention has been paid to the environmental impacts of the airports where they land .
They are , in a word , a mess .
Officials from many of North Americas airports made the case this week at the Eco-Aviation Conference in Washington that they 're trying to clean up their acts .
To be fair , the task is daunting and there are some examples of innovation .
But overall , the report card is underwhelming .
It 's easy to see the size of the problem when you realize many airports are , essentially , small cities .
Dallas - Forth Worth International Airport , one of the nation 's largest , is a good example .
It has five terminals , six parking garages , a physical plant and a rental car complex .
The airport covers 18,000 acres - that 's about 28 square miles - and serves 60 million people a year .
The airport has enormous fleets of gas - powered tugs to move planes , tractors to move luggage and shuttles to move people .
All of that internal combustion creates a lot of C02 and a lot of ground - level ozone .
Run-off from the myriad chemicals that keep everything running smoothly sometimes find their way into groundwater supplies .
Airports are n't the only ones to blame .
Tens of millions of people pass through them , and every one of them leaves something behind .
The National Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that the average departing passenger leaves behind almost 1 1/2 pounds of trash - and that does n't include the stuff they leave behind on the planes .
So what are airports doing about it ?
An Airports Council International ( ACI ) survey of 78 airports that represent 60 percent of North American passenger traffic ( a skimpy sample , if you ask us ) praises them for " impressive work . "
Really ?
The survey ticks off a lot of stats that sound good but show much tangible progress .
Twenty - three of the airports surveyed have " environmental management systems " and 15 percent publish regular environmental reports ( gasp ! ) .
But many of them do n't have any benchmarks for measuring their eco-impact and fewer than half have conducted greenhouse gas inventories or developed metrics for measuring their ground pollution .
That said , there are some good things happening .
Nineteen of the airports sampled are buying renewable energy and another nine are generating it on their own .
Fifty - one have implemented solid waste management programs and 33 have the infrastructure to support clean vehicles .
There are some standouts : the new Terminal A at Boston Logan , with heat - reflecting roof and windows , low - flow faucets , waterless urinals , self - dimming lights and storm water filtration , is the nation 's first terminal to be a certified green building .
Kris Russel , the Senior Environmentalist at Dallas Fort Worth International , points out that while green certification is an admirable goal there are less extensive but highly effective ways to make airports greener .
Beyond reworking its lighting and HVAC systems , DFW 's central plant uses electric chillers and a thermal energy storage tank .
Airport buses now burn compressed natural gas obtained from an on -site CNG station .
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York has eliminated 90 percent of its chemical de-icers in favor of infrared technology that melts snow and ice off planes .
Airports also are partnering with airlines to green up their operations .
Continental , for example , is working with George Bush Interncontinental Airport in Houston to adopt electric ground equipment like airplane tugs .
The airline says it will cut emissions by such equipment as much as 75 percent .
Other solutions are surprisingly low - tech .
By consolidating rental car operations in a single facility , DFW was able to cut the size of its shuttle fleet in half .
LED signs in the parking garages direct people to open spots , reducing the time they spend circling the lot .
Airports like JFK and Dallas are taking the lead .
Others will follow eventually , and it's then that real progress will be seen .

Stanford Law School is dropping letter grades , a move intended to allow professors to be more experimental in the classroom and save student sanity in one of academia ’s most rigorous settings .
Stanford will switch to a system of honors , pass , restricted credit and no credit instead of A+ through F , said School of Law Dean Larry Kramer .
He hopes the shift will cut the stressful jockeying for status among classmates and encourage students to take more challenging courses .
“ It reduces the pursuit of grades as the chief concern of students – they ’re learning for the sake of learning , without choosing courses based on worries whether a professor is a tough grader or not , ” he said .
“ Students were too focused on grades , and choosing courses based on grades . ”
Without a traditional point system , professors are freed from uniformity such as giving the identical writing assignment to every student .
They can also assign more team projects .
Stanford is the second member of the legal “ holy trinity ” to simplify its grading system .
Yale switched years ago ; Harvard still holds to A to F. Boalt Law School at the University of California - Berkeley has also abandoned conventional grades .
Such reforms are a luxury of top schools , because students can trade on the name of the institution when applying for competitive jobs .
Judges and top firms hire eagerly and disproportionately from the top few schools , regardless of their grading structures .
But at lesser schools , students need high grades to land in the top percent of their class – if they hope to become a law professor at a top 20 school , to get a federal clerkships or be hired at a firm like Morrison & Foerster .
The reform is the latest in a series of reforms to Stanford ’s legal education , including skills - based seminars , new legal clinics and and the ability to combine a traditional law degree with other disciplines from business to bioengineering .
In an environment that is highly competitive , the change is n’t expected to send students packing for the beach .
Stanford Law students are lifetime high achievers .
And the same people who are now gunning for the A will aim for Honors under the new system .
But students welcomed the change to ease trials and tribulations of law school .
A tenth of a point can make the difference between an A - and B+ , creating great anxiety , they said .
Last fall , a first - year student sent a mass e-mail encouraging his classmates to take the entire semester pass / fail .
One - third complied .
“ Many felt that the old system , which forced grades to fit a bell curve distribution , created false distinctions between classmates , ” said Andrew Bruck , 24 , a member of the class of 2008 .
“ A simplified evaluation system will allow students to focus on what matters – learning the law – without the pressures and distractions created by numerical grades , ” he said .
Other students noted that it would allow them to focus their time and energy on classes they cared most about , and simply get a “ P ” – or “ pass ” – on a class they disliked .
Stanford faculty said that they will be free to offer more oral advocacy projects , or different writing assignments for different students .
It will be easier to put teams together because an entire team would not suffer if it included a weaker student , Kramer said .
“ We can do it because we ’re small and Stanford gets such amazing students , ” he said .
With an average class size of 12 students , “ faculty get to know their students , and their capabilities , very well .
Differences will show up , ” he said .
“ There are still opportunities for students to distinguish yourself academically , ” he said .
Veterans of Boalt and Yale predicted that Stanford students would still be welcomed into the legal world .
“ For many years now , Berkeley and Stanford students seeking high paid jobs with big law firms seem to have little difficulty getting offers , ” said Boalt professor Steve Sugarman .
“ At schools like ours , only a small share of positions seem to require being more or less in the top ten percent of the class . ”
Yale ’s Janet Conroy agreed , saying : “ I have seen no negative effect on the ability of our students to land clerkships or other employment .
The students who come here are so accomplished and self - motivated that they still work as hard as they would have if there were grades involved . ”
Although many of the details of the Stanford shift have yet to be worked out , the transition will likely take place next September .
There are other issues to be resolved , such as how to ease existing students into the new system , and how to award honors such as membership in the national law honor society Order of the Coif , which is limited to the top 10 percent of each class by grade point average .
“ I doubt that the change will make Stanford Law students any less competitive in the job market , ” said Bruck .
“ If anything , the new grading system will help the law school produce the kind of well - rounded , well - educated graduates that employers find appealing , ” he said .
BY PETER NOWAK — Bell Canada Inc. is calling on the courts to scrap mandated access by competitors to its network , a move that could jeopardize some smaller companies that sell phone and internet services .
The Montreal - based company on Wednesday filed a leave to appeal with the Federal Court of Canada to overturn a decision made by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission in early March on what the regulator considers essential services .
The CRTC on March 3 reiterated that third - party companies should continue to be able to rent telephone companies ' networks in order to provide their own customers with phone and internet services .
The regulator considered this network access as essential for smaller companies to offer their services , and for some of them to survive .
In its appeal , Bell said such regulation is no longer necessary now that there is enough competition in phone and internet markets .
In home phones , Bell is competing with a number of major cable companies , not to mention Voice over Internet Protocol providers and cellphone carriers .
On the internet side , Bell faces competition from cable companies .
Scrapping the access regulations would also bring the CRTC in line with the government 's stated policy direction , Bell 's chief of regulatory affairs Mirko Bibic told CBCNews.ca .
The government in 2006 told the CRTC that it should adopt a more hands - off approach and let market forces determine the telecommunications landscape as much as possible .
" We do n't think in the long run it 's going to lead to alternative network construction by competitors , which is not good for the telecom industry in Canada and consumers , " he said .
" We certainly do n't think it 's in keeping with the policy direction . "
Bibic said the decision to open Bell 's infrastructure 10 years ago was made in hopes that it would give smaller companies a base from which to build their own networks , but that has not happened .
Many of the firms that use Bell 's network have instead become dependent on it and have not invested in their own equipment .
" They have n't built much , " he said .
" The problem is , there 's no weaning off .
There 's an underlying and ongoing and indefinite reliance on access to incumbent networks . "
Getting rid of the regulations would not mean smaller players would cease getting access to Bell 's network , Bibic said .
Rather , that access could be commercially negotiated .
Bell 's move comes a week after it faced heavy criticism for extending its traffic - shaping policies to the companies that use its network .
Bell has for some time been slowing down the internet speeds of customers using certain applications , such as the file - sharing technology BitTorrent , and last week admitted to extending the practice to the smaller companies .
The move kicked into high gear the debate over whether regulation of the internet is needed in Canada , with an NDP MP and a labour union both calling for CRTC intervention .
Critics said Bell 's appeal of the essential services decision , if overturned , could dramatically lessen both phone and internet competition .
" This suggests it 's an all - out battle between Bell and a lot of the smaller players seeking to provide competition , " University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist told CBCNews.ca .
" This is a real cause for concern for consumers as well as the competitive environment in Canada . "
Geist and others have criticized Minister of Industry Jim Prentice for his silence on the issue .
Prentice was " disinterested " in the issue when it arose in question period in the House of Commons on Wednesday , he said .
CNN : Iran helped broker ceasefire in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane

It was reported on Sunday that Iranian officials had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the recent fighting between Iraq 's government and radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
Iran has close ties to both al - Sadr 's movement and Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , and representatives of two of the parties in Maliki 's coalition traveled to Iran to finalize the talks .
CNN 's Nic Robertson reported from Baghdad on Monday that the ceasefire appears to be holding and stores in Basra are reopening .
Robertson also explained that the recent violence represented conflict among Shi'ite factions , which was why the Iranians were able to act as brokers .
" There 's a broad alliance of Shia parties here in Iraq that have been sort of struggling and struggling to hold themselves together over the recent months , " Robertson stated .
" That alliance essentially broke down with this recent fighting , and it appears that Iran has wanted the Shias to remain united here , that they do n't want massive violence right on their own doorstep . "
" It also shows how weak the prime minister is here , " Robertson continued .
" He went to war against Moqtada al - Sadr 's militia , failed to defeat them ... decisively , and the Iranians have stepped in to help him save face as well . "
" The Iranians here are in a very strong position , influencing the government , " concluded Robertson .
" I think we can expect more of the same . "
The San Francisco Chronicle offered a somewhat more detailed explanation of the conflict between the Iraqi government and al - Sadr 's followers , noting that " Enmity has long festered between the two sides : one a ruling party that has struggled against the widespread perception that it gained power on the back of the U.S. occupation , the other a populist movement that has positioned itself as a critic of the new order . "
" Since U.S. - led forces ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003 , the members of the ruling coalition have been viewed by many Iraqis as isolated returning exiles , backed by Iran or the United States .
...
In contrast , the al - Sadr movement 's foundations are built upon the legacy of al - Sadr 's father , who challenged Hussein 's rule in sermons before being shot dead in 1999 .
Its voice - fiercely anti-American and staunchly nationalist - has emerged as one of the few alternatives for Iraqis . "
" The animosity also is rooted in a historic rivalry between the al - Sadr religious family , long seen as a champion of the underclass , and the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council 's senior leader , Abdul - Aziz al - Hakim , the son of a conservative grand ayatollah , whose family traditionally enjoyed the support of the country 's Shiite merchant class . "

Americans , in particular , have been enamored by boobies for fucking forever .
The more forbidden the fruit , especially when the “ fruit ” is a boobie , the more delicious .
Hell , when my great grandfather pulled into Staten Island in 1907 ( with his wife and children in tow ) he did n't remark on the Statue of Liberty as symbol of freedom and hope .
Fuck no .
He turned to his wife and said , “ Chick 's got a nice rack . ”
And guess what ?
His wife nodded in agreement .
However , America is one of the most sexually prude countries in the world .
Although this distinction occasionally has its benefits , such as limiting of the number of dudes who wear banana hammocks at the beach , it also has tremendous drawbacks , such as limiting the number of boobies Americans see on a per annum basis .
According to a recent scientific study ( conducted amongst my close friends ) , Americans see , on average , 1.7 boobies each year , and are reportedly “ fucking pissed off about it . ”
But the answer to seeing more boobies does not lie in wooing chicks , forming relationships , and catching glimpses of titty - tat in the middle of dark , late night boning sessions with " Everybody Loves Raymond " playing the background .
Quite the opposite , actually .
In order to reach a satisfactory level of boobie viewing , Americans need to take advantage of unsuspecting bystanders , drunk bitches with “ anorexia ” written on their foreheads , and basically any chick with boobs on her chest and arms attached to her shoulders ( scratch that – one arm will do ) .
Thus , I present you with the five essential tips to getting girls to flash in inappropriate situations .
5 . Do n't be a pussy .
If you want to see titty - tat , you 're going to have to man up and be aggressive .
Most chicks are n't going to let you glimpse their forbidden fruit if you give up after your first request , particularly if you 're not in a private setting .
Additionally , you have to be excruciatingly direct when telling these chicks what you want – your best candidates will often be wasted out of their minds .
Sometimes the call “ Flash ! ” is n't enough .
Sometimes you need to tell her explicitly that you want to see some titty - tat .
And sometimes , as I can speak from personal experience , you need to remind her where her shirt and arms are located because she 's so fucking ( and hilariously ) drunk .
4. Use Props .
In the same way that you 're supposed to bring a fruit cake to the house of new neighbors , you better bring along some props when you 're searching for girls to flash their boobies .
Of course , beaded necklaces are the tried and true prop , but anything that 's shiny , pretty , or even remotely unexpected will do the trick .
If you 're willing to paint your dong purple , for example , chicks will be lining up and flashing like no tomorrow .
Usually yelling out the words “ who wants something purple ? ! ” will bring at least a handful of chicks to your doorstep .
Depending upon your specific location , different props will be more appropriate than others .
In situations where there is a large crowd of non -drunk / non - cool bystanders , your best props will be the smallest ones possible .
Always – let me repeat ALWAYS – carry around a shiny nickel .
Although chicks are n't inherently fond of nickels , if you tell the that it 's a brand new “ shiny ” nickel , you will , at the very least , pique their curiosity .
3 . Peer pressure is cool .
Remember how the douchebag who taught alcohol education at your school said peer pressure was n't cool ?
Well , guess what ?
There 's a reason he 's only seen 2.8 boobies in his entire life , half of which belonged to himself ( Hey , I studied boobies in school , not math – just roll with me on this one . )
When seeking some boobie flashing , you 're best served by stirring up as much competition as possible .
Tell one chick that her boobies are n't as well - shaped as the chick standing next to her .
Tell another chick that you think she 's too afraid to flash and that if she does n't , you 'll send the boobie police to arrest her ( She 'll have to be wasted or a complete idiot to bite on this one ) .
Basically , do whatever necessary to make these chicks think that THEY are missing out by not flashing , rather than the other way around .
Sure , you may feel like an asshole in the morning , but at least you will be an asshole who saw boobies .
Some specific notes on implementing peer pressure :
At The Club – Spill a dark liquid on the candidate 's dress , and tell her that all of her friend 's are laughing at her stain .
Make it clear that if she does n't take off her shirt , she will probably lose all her friends .
And that would suck .
At Work –
If you 're the candidate 's boss , simply tell her that you will fire her if she does n't flash her boobies .
If you are n't her boss , explain that you will lie about her flashing her boobies in the office ( which will presumably get her fired ) if she does n't in fact flash her boobies .
Church –
Tell the candidate that Mary flashed God all the time , and that 's the only reason she got his attention in the first place – and subsequently knocked her up .
2 . Do n't rape her .
It 's one thing to be aggressive on a flash mission , but it's an entirely different beast when your aggression turns physical .
Rape , in short , is n't cool - with the obvious exception of those hot teachers who appear in the news every couple years for boning their 15 year old students .
( But then again , that 's probably not “ rape ” so much as , hm , I do n't know ?
“ A dream come true ? ” )
That said , when your flash candidate demonstrates a genuine desire to show you her boobies , but she 's too drunk to lift up her shirt , there 's nothing wrong with guiding her hands along the journey .
( OK , maybe there are many things wrong with it , but I promise not to judge you if you wo n't judge me . )
Certainly , this tip is the most contentious of the bunch , but often times , it will be the difference between seeing the forbidden fruit and only getting a faint smell of it .
Of course , you must be aware of your surroundings , and extra positive that no non-drunk / non - cool friends are watching .
On a related note , many a douchebag is in favor of turning a successful flash into some abbreviated boobie lickage .
While I am certainly an advocate of licking as many boobies in my lifetime as humanly / boobily possibly , licking boobie mid-flash falls a little bit too far on the “ rape ” side of the spectrum .
Additionally , odds are that another douchebag has licked that very same boobie earlier in the night , and essentially , you 'd be making out with a dude .
Which is fine , um , I guess ...
1 . Do n't feel guilty .
Look , if you 've read this far in the article , odds are you 're a tremendous asshole and / or are completely obsessed with boobies .
Either way , you just need to accept your fate and live these tips like they are your mantra – if not for me , if not for yourself , then do it for all those chicks out there that are just dying for some reason to show off their boobies .
Their boobies may occasionally be fat , they be saggy , or hell , they may even be downright disgusting .
But with these tips in mind , you will see more boobies than you can count and your life wo n't just be beautiful - it will be boobiful .
Now , my children , you are ready - go forth and yell “ flash thy titties ! ”
The devices were found in a McDonald 's outlet
Two fire bombs have been found in a baby - changing room in a fast food outlet , police have said .
The incendiary devices - one of which had partially exploded - were found in a McDonald 's restaurant in Cookstown , County Tyrone .
Police Inspector Sue Steen said the people who had left the devices in the room has shown " a callous disregard for human life " .
" That room was in a restaurant used by families and children , " she said .
" It does n't bear thinking about what might have happened if the restaurant had been filled with people , or someone was in the room with a baby when they went off , " she said .
" It is not enough to say that those who planted the devices have nothing to offer the people of Northern Ireland .
" They do - but it is a return to a past of injury , death and destruction , nothing else .
They must be caught and brought before the courts . "
Staff in McDonald 's found the devices on Wednesday , sparking a security alert on Sweep Road , causing major traffic disruption .
Police said that very little damage was caused in the incident .
Police are investigating whether the devices are linked to a similar attack on a toy store in the town two weeks ago and have appealed for information .
A partially exploded device was found in the Toymaster store on Dungannon Road on 9 May .
It had been hidden in a fast food container .
High number of COVID - 19 outbreaks linked to grocery stores
The highest number of reported COVID - 19 outbreaks between July and September stemmed from grocery stores , according to Riverside County officials .

WASHINGTON  General David H. Petraeus , the commander of American forces in Iraq , and Ryan C. Crocker , the American Ambassador to Iraq , faced a new round of deep congressional skepticism today , not only about progress in the war and the prospects for eventual withdrawal , but also about whether the nation ’s involvement in Iraq had made it more vulnerable on other fronts .
The general and the ambassador carried their message of “ fragile and reversible ” progress in the war to the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday morning and the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon , the day after they testified before the corresponding committees in the Senate .
Repeating the opening statements they made to the Senate panels , the two men once again yielded little fresh information about when the American military presence in Iraq could be reduced beyond the roughly 140,000 troops who will be left when the “ surge ” of about 30,000 extra troops sent to the country in 2007 winds down again in July .
Representative Ike Skelton , Democrat of Missouri and the chairman of the Armed Services committee , said in opening the first hearing on Wednesday that he saw far too few signs of real progress in Iraq , and warned that the continuing war ’s strains on the American military were diverting the country from attending to other threats , starting with what intelligence reports say is a terrorist resurgence along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
“ The effort in Iraq is putting at risk our ability to decisively defeat those most likely to attack us , ” he said .
Mr. Skelton said that while the “ surge ” had temporarily lowered the amount of violence in Iraq , Iraqis had failed to “ step up ” to take advantage of the improved security .
And he said he feared that officials in Baghdad would feel no sense of urgency to pursue sectarian reconciliation and achieve full autonomy until “ we take the training wheels off and let the Iraqis begin to stand on their own two feet . ”

These days most well read sports nutrition literature goes a little something like this : vegetables , fruit , complex carbohydrates and lean sources of protein such as chicken breast , fish and egg whites .
I am sure you are familiar with this line of thought ?
But what happens if you choose to omit one , two or all three of these last foods out ?
What is there left to eat !?
In a protein crazed world these three women have done just that .
They have defied the odds and not only lived , but thrived on a vegetarian diet .
These dedicated athletes show us how it is done their way and expel the myths that vegetarianism is all about washed out hippies and lentil stew .
Kristin Reisinger /// The Pesco-Vegetarian
Educated and determined to make a stand in the veggie world , 32 year old Kristin gave up a career in television and media to dedicate her life to fitness and nutrition .
Kristin started off her vegetarian lifestyle as a vegan for several years and is currently living on a pesco- vegetarian diet ( which includes a small amount of fish and minimal dairy products . )
However in her heart she knows that veganism is the best diet for her and plans to one day make the switch back .
It has been nine years since this figure competitor and personal trainer gave up eating red meat .
" I have experimented with all types of vegetarian diets " she mentions " and have learned through this experimentation that nutrition plays an integral role in one 's well - being . "
Once a sufferer of migraine headaches , her bouts have been a lot less frequent since the dietary change .
It was an ex boyfriend ( an Iron man tri-athlete and strict vegan ) who introduced Kristin to the book ' Diet For A New America ' by John Robbins which prompted the transition .
Kristin always knew she wanted to compete but just was n't sure where to start .
" Fitness America was too pageant -y for my blood , fitness shows involved too much gymnastics , and bodybuilding was out of the question .
I happened upon the Galaxy event in a magazine and knew right away that this was the competition for me .
Miss America meets American Gladiators ... excellent ! "
Not only dedicated to figure competing last year she also tried her hand at the Brooklyn half marathon and made it through with a time of two hours and thirteen minutes .
Although Kristin feels that her diet supports nearly everything she does , one of the key benefits she has noticed on a vegetarian diet when it comes to training is the fact that because she eats so clean and healthfully preparing for competition is much easier because she remains pretty lean all - year round .
On season , Kristin is fairly regimented with her diet , being sure to eat lots of fresh vegetables , clean complex carbs , vegetarian protein ( such as kidney beans and tofu ) , egg whites and a small amount of tuna .
However , " when I 'm not getting ready for a show my diet can consist of almost anything " she points out .
" I really like experimenting with vegan and Indian cooking so that 's pretty common at meal times . "
Kristin trains smart to achieve her results working out with weights four times a week , cardio is done for 30 - 60 minutes five days a week and occasionally she will take a day off .
" Lately I 've gotten into a lot of plyometric training with a friend who does obstacle course competitions and this has been terrific for lower body development .
I also spend a lot of time rock climbing outdoors as well as at a climbing gym which has been terrific for upper body training . "
Despite common misperception Kristin finds plenty of energy in her pesco-vegetarian diet to get her successfully through each day " I would like to expel the myth that a vegetarian diet results in no energy and that you will become skinny and gaunt .
Like anything else in life , you need to learn how to become vegetarian properly .
You can't live on gummy bears and soda and expect to feel great , " she says .
Although she does not go around trying to actively convert anyone to vegetarianism she adds " when the benefits are so great from a vegetarian - based diet and the goal ultimately is fitness and health , how could you not give it a chance ? "

Katie Coryell /// The Vegan
Full of energy and with a keen zest for life , 28 year old Katie has been a pro surfer since 2004 .
Katie took the slow road to becoming vegan , gradually eliminating one food group at a time .
Now after three years of living successfully on such a diet she finds the biggest challenge , in her words , " is eating enough ! "
Environmental sustainability , animal rights , and health concerns are just a few of the reasons why Katie chooses to follow a vegan diet .
Katie has been surfing since 1996 and under the encouragement of her first teacher ( a local woman who had been surfing for 20 years ) she entered her first amateur competition and much to her surprise she won .
From then on Katie has continued to ride the waves of success .
Because surfing is something Katie does year round it seems she is always on the go .
When talking about her training she explains " my schedule changes depending on where I am and what time of year it is . "
When she is at home in the winter Katie has to constantly challenge herself to find new ways to stay in shape .
This usually involves swimming , running , cycling and yoga .
Unfortunately , she says , " surfing is only two - three days a week depending on the conditions . "
In the summer however Katie is in the water a lot more and alongside her surfing and early morning runs she also finds the time to teach surf lessons up to four hours a day six days a week .
It 's on the surfing trips when Katie really gets to indulge in her passion as surfing takes up most of the day .
Katie can be in the water for as much as five hours at a time " I break long enough to eat and reapply sunscreen " she mentions enthusiastically .
After adopting a vegan diet Katie lost some excess weight and notes that being lighter has helped her generate more speed in surfing .
Katie also thinks that her overall fitness level has improved because of her diet because " it is more nutritionally complete than it was before I was vegan . "
She feels that her vegan diet is a very positive way to fuel her body .
Although she travels a lot , Katie finds that living on a vegan diet really helps to counteract jetlag .
The mental discipline it takes to follow a vegan diet has also taught her to be more focused , which is especially helpful during a competition .
The day for Katie normally starts off with a smoothie and varies from there on depending on whether she is at home or on the road mainly because she often loses the ability to cook for herself when traveling .
Katie is not too strict with her diet ( obvious vegan guidelines aside ) and always tries to incorporate lots of fresh fruit and vegetables .
She eats pretty simply when traveling but admits to indulging in veggie takeouts when in the US .
This vegan lifestyle means a lot to Katie and amongst lessons of tolerance and compassion she thinks that that " it is a way to express your desire to make a change in this world by making a change in your own life . "

Tonya Kay /// The Raw Fooder
Passion and enthusiasm are the two words that come to mind as I read through Tonya 's interview responses .
A pro dancer since the age of 15 , Tonya believes " we are what we eat and I 'd rather be a sexy young coconut than empty puffy pasta - even if it is whole wheat ! "
Growing up in a small farming community and being exposed to the ' slaughterhouse rules ' profoundly affected Tonya and at the age of eight , " vegetarianism became my default lifestyle " she explains .
Many things have changed since that day but Tonya 's conviction in the diet has stayed the same .
Now a raw vegan , at the age of 28 , Tonya feels the best she ever has in her life .
She has an endless store of energy and her once problem skin " simply glows " and as an athlete " my bodyrecovers in half the time it used to from strenuous activity or injury . "
Tonya 's training schedule is anything but ordinary .
" As a professional dancer , it is important to keep the body ready for movements that push your coordination , flexibility and strength in a variety of unpredictable motions . "
A variety of exercises are required to keep Tonya in tip top condition and to keep her body " ever- ready . "
Some such activities include ; weight lifting , bikram yoga , walking , cycling and of course burning it up on the dance floor at the local club .
" Anyway you look at it though , I train an average of three hours a day five days a week taking off an entire seven days every sixth week or so . "
As a Raw Vegan Tonya 's diet is based around in season , local , organic and uncooked produce and as a result it varies a lot from day to day , season to season , city to city .
" After 20 years of being vegetarian and ten years vegan , I thought I was healthy .
That was until I went raw , it has been three years now and the difference is profound ! "
During the off - season ( or when injured ) Tonya likes to use the time to cleanse as she feels it better assists her body in the healing process .
She loves the feeling of personal integrity that the raw food lifestyle brings .
This new way of eating is also offering relief from her once medicated bi-polar life .
When asked why she has chosen this lifestyle she replies eagerly " to find out how good life can get ! "
Tonya excels on her raw vegan lifestyle and would like us to know that this lifestyle is not difficult " I have been traveling for five years now , without a home and a kitchen .
I have thrived on this diet in every city in the nation and let me tell you , there is nothing easier or more fun ! "

Clockwise from top left : Irfan Raja , Awaab Iqbal , Aitzaz Zafar , Akbar Butt , Usman Malik
Freeing the men , the Lord Chief Justice said there was no proof of terrorist intent .
The lawyer for one said they had been jailed for a " thought crime " .
A jury convicted them in 2007 after hearing the men , of Bradford University and Ilford , London , became obsessed with jihadi websites and literature .
The Home Office said it would study the judgement carefully .
' Serious threat '
It said it understood the Crown Prosecution Service was considering whether to appeal against the ruling , which it must do within seven days .
It added that the threat of terrorism remained serious and real and the government was committed to ensuring it had the strongest possible anti-terrorism legal framework .
Irfan Raja , Awaab Iqbal , Aitzaz Zafar , Usman Malik and Akbar Butt were jailed for between two and three years each by the Old Bailey for downloading and sharing extremist terrorism - related material , in what was one of the first cases of its kind .
But at the Court of Appeal , Lord Phillips said that while the men had downloaded such material , he doubted if there was evidence this was in relation to planning terrorist acts .
He said the prosecution had attempted to use the law for a purpose for which it was not intended .
' Huge implications '
Lawyers for the men say the decision to restrict how the law on extremist literature works has huge implications for counter terrorism prosecutions .
Critics inside the Muslim community and civil liberty campaigners say section 57 of the 2000 Terrorism
Act has been used as a blunt instrument to prosecute young Muslim men where there is no proof of genuine links to terrorism .
The BBC understands there have been three other convictions under this legislation - more cases are expected before the courts this year .
Imran Khan , solicitor for Mr Zafar , said the five had been prosecuted for " thought crime " and that the ruling would have an significant impact .
It must go out to other young people that it is a dangerous area , and they have to keep themselves far , far away from visiting these websites
Dr Ghayasudin Siddiqui
He told BBC News : " Young Muslim men before this judgement could have been prosecuted simply for simply looking at any material on the basis that it might be connected in some way to terrorist purposes . "
He said section 57 of the 2000 Terrorism
Act had been written in such wide terms that " effectively , anybody could have been caught in it " but prosecutors would now have to prove such material was intended for terrorist purposes .
' Unknown students '
In a statement released through his solicitors , Mr Malik said he had always maintained his innocence .
" It is a great thing to live in a country where the Lord Chief Justice takes the time from hearing important cases to see if a group of unknown students have been fairly convicted for reading the wrong kind of literature , " he said .
" As I said when I was arrested , I do not , have not and will not support terrorism in any form against innocent people .
" My prosecution was a test case under the 2000 Terrorism Act .
Today 's decision means no first year student can ever be prosecuted again under this Act for possessing extremist literature . "
He later told Channel 4 News : " I 'm very happy , it 's been two long years .
My case started in March 2006 and I 'm glad that it is finally over . "
' Freedom of expression '
His father , Abdul Malik , said the ruling was " a victory for common sense and justice " .
He told Channel 4 News : " Young students who are inquisitive and exploring ideas of things should not be prosecuted in that way .
There should be a freedom of expression and freedom of thought . "
Mr Malik 's solicitor , Saghir Hussein , said it was a " landmark judgement " , with implications for other cases , including those alleging glorification of terrorism .
Akbar Butt said he was " just happy to be out " .
He told BBC News : " I 'm thankful to be here and happy with the decision . "
Zahid Iqbal , father of Awaab Iqbal , said he was feeling " great " after the decision .
" Justice has been done .
It 's restored my faith in the justice system , " he said .
Asked if he had any advice for other young Muslim men who were looking at similar material , he said : " I do n't think these boys did anything wrong .
It was just propaganda they were looking at .
They had no links to terrorism - everybody looks at websites . "
' Knee - jerk terror laws '
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the government 's " knee - jerk drafting of new terrorism offences " had led to confusion on the part of prosecutors .
He said : " Ministers need to be more cautious when drafting new offences and more effective in enforcing old ones . "
Individuals who write poetry , read blogs or download material from the internet are being targeted because of their ethnicity or religious affiliation
Massoud Shadjareh
Justice Secretary Jack Straw said it would not be appropriate for him to comment on the decision the Court of Appeal had made after " very careful consideration " .
Muslim Parliament of Great Britain leader Dr Ghayasudin Siddiqui told BBC Radio 5
Live he welcomed the ruling but hoped that the students ' experiences would serve as a warning to other young Muslims .
He said : " It must go out to other young people that it is a dangerous area and they have to keep themselves far , far away from visiting these websites . "
' Thought crime '
Inayat Bunglawala , assistant secretary - general of the Muslim Council of Britain , said the Lord Chief Justice had been " right " to quash the convictions .
He said : " If there is no actual terror plot uncovered by the police then we do not believe we should be convicting people for what is effectively a thought crime . "
The Islamic Human Rights Commission said it hoped Thursday 's judgement would stop the " criminalisation of Muslim youth for downloading and reading material that is widely available to everyone " .
Chairman Massoud Shadjareh said : " Our anti terror strategy should target and bring to account those who plan criminal acts of terrorism .
Instead individuals who write poetry , read blogs or download material from the internet are being targeted because of their ethnicity or religious affiliation . "
The Miami Herald has the audio of Olidia Kerr Day 's call to 911 while she was fleeing her homicidal ex-boyfriend .
Day made it to the Plantation police station where she was gunned down in the parking lot .
The call is just about as chilling as anything I 've ever heard ; makes your heart bleed .
And it also makes you angry .
Especially when you read this quote from Plantation police spokesman Phil Toman about the dispatcher 's performance : " As far as I 've heard , she did fine . "
That 's an insult to all the people of Plantation .
But before I go on I want to say the obvious : Day 's death is n't the dispatchers ' fault ( there were actually two , one from Sunrise and one from Plantation ) .
That blame falls squarely on her ex-boyfriend , Carlos Cevallos , who shot himself after killing Day .
I 'm not sure anything could have been done to stop Cevallos .
The dispatchers likely were faced with an impossible situation and they tried to do the right thing .
But the truth is they performed miserably and they did n't help Day at all .
The first thing Day says on the tape is for them to listen to her .
But the initial Sunrise dispatcher did n't listen .
Instead , he repeatedly cut her off and asked for her address , which was meaningless at the time .
When he finally realized she was trying to get to the Plantation police station , he called Plantation and got the second dispatcher on the line .
The two dispatchers exchange information while Day screams for them to hurry .
They still are n't listening .
" Tell someone to intercept me on Fifth Street ! " she screams .
That 's where the police station is .
" Okay , what 's the problem ma'am ? " asks the Plantation dispatcher .
Back to square one .
She tells him that she 's being chased by someone who is going to kill her .
" How do you know him ? "
" Please !
He 's going to kill me dead ! "
" Ma'am do you know him ? "
Who cares ?
This is clearly a life - or - death emergency and she 's trying to get the background story .
It 's like asking someone whose car has plunged into a canal how they got in there instead of just telling them how to get out alive .
I 'm not an expert on what to do in Day 's situation , but you would hope to get better instruction from the police .
As one of Day 's relatives tells the Herald , they might have told her to keep driving and stay in her car .
When the dispatcher hears ( if she was listening at all ) that someone was chasing the woman with a gun near the police department , she should have immediately sent some officers to the lot .
That would seem obvious .
But none of that happened .
Nothing happened at all .
" Listen , stop yelling , " says the Plantation dispatcher after trying to get her location , " because I can't help you when you 're yelling . "
" I 'm stuck now , I 'm stuck now !
He 's going to shoot me ! "
Those are Day 's last words on the tape .
She was in the police department parking lot at that point .
And Cevallos soon shot her .
Now here we are almost two weeks later and Toman says the dispatcher did " fine " ?
That may be the scariest part of all of this .
I 'm sure this tape will be used in law enforcement instruction classes in the future -- but it looks like Plantation police are n't going to learn anything at all .
The nation 's premier particle physics laboratory — Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) in Batavia , Ill . — just got a new lease on life .
The U.S. Senate yesterday passed legislation that provides $ 400 million for science programs , including $ 62.5 million to the Office of Science in the Department of Energy ( DOE ) , which oversees Fermilab .
The measure , passed by the House last week , now goes to President Bush , who has indicated he will sign it .
Fermilab says the infusion will likely prevent layoffs in the works since December , when Congress slashed the lab 's 2008 budget from the $ 372 million requested by the DOE to $ 320 million , down $ 20 million from 2007 .
To keep alive the lab 's hunt for the elusive Higgs boson — the long - awaited source of all mass in the universe — staff were forced to take mandatory work furloughs of one week a month , and lab officials planned to lay off approximately 140 employees .
The furloughs ended in May after an anonymous donation of $ 5 million .
Today was the deadline for staff to decide whether to accept the lab 's buyout offer before layoffs begin .
Fermilab Director Pier Oddone said in a statement that between those opting for the buyout and the additional funding , " I expect to announce the end of involuntary layoffs at the laboratory . "
" It 's been such a long road that until all the 't 's are crossed and the 'i's are dotted , I do n't think anyone 's breathed out yet , " Judy Jackson , a spokesperson for the laboratory , said .
" People are really very , very pleased , " she added .
Fermilab said the added funds may allow researchers to begin new work on neutrinos , a type of subatomic particle that will become the lab 's main line of research in coming years after its
Higgs hunt ends .
Half of the 26 candidates who are standing on 10 July are independents
A total of 26 candidates - half of them independents - will contest the by -election sparked by the resignation of senior Tory David Davis as an MP .

news “ Here We Are. Let ’s Take The Gardiner ”
Photo by TObike from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
It ’s been a busy day for the Gardiner .
First , Waterfront Toronto announced plans to dismantle a section of the expressway from Jarvis to the Don Valley Parkway , with David Miller formally scrapping the planned Front Street Extension .
And then , late Friday afternoon , more than two hundred cyclists rolled up the Jarvis Street ramp to slowly and steadily ( and illegally ) take the entire westbound expressway over .
The cyclists were part of Critical Mass , the huge group cycle that takes place on the last Friday of every month in Toronto and around the world .
According to Martin Reis , who was in the pack , the decision to ascend the ramp onto the Gardiner Expressway was spontaneous ( even though it bears some resemblance to a similar but much smaller Los Angeles freeway ride from two weeks ago ) , and was not intended to be a huge statement : as Reis put it , the groupthink was more along the lines of “ Here we are .
Let ’s take the Gardiner . ”
The cyclists started off in the merging lane , then gradually took over the rest of the lanes , controlling all of them by about the time they reached York Street .
“ We basically became like one giant automobile , ” Reis says .
Fellow participant Nick Syperek told Torontoist that “ it was exhilarating to see Toronto from that angle . ”
Reis saw no confrontations between cyclists and motorists , characterizing the entire thing as “ very very civilized , [ and ] very peaceful . ”
About twenty minutes after their trip began , police officers funneled the cyclists off the expressway and onto the Dunn Avenue off - ramp .
( The Star says they rode all the way from Jameson Avenue to Dunn , which is a 200 metre trip and would have been a little less fun than the 7 kilometres west from Jarvis to Dunn . )
The Star also reported that one man was arrested — according to Reis , it was a younger man who refused to follow police orders and seemed to have tried to get past the cop cars ( Reis has heard rumours that that man has since been fined and released ) .
At least two more participants — including Angela Bischoff , Tooker Gomberg ’s widow — confronted police officers and were ticketed .
But no matter .
Today was , Reis happily pointed out to us , participant Derek Chadbourne ’s birthday .
Chadbourne runs The Bike Joint on Harbord , and was ecstatically pronouncing the impromptu Gardiner trip the best birthday present he could ’ve gotten .

Join Me in Calling on President Bush to Respect Congress ’ Exclusive Power to Declare War
Dear Democratic Colleague :
As we mark five years of war in Iraq , I have become increasingly concerned that the President may possibly take unilateral , preemptive military action against Iran .
During the last seven years , the Bush Administration has exercised unprecedented assertions of Executive Branch power and shown an unparalleled aversion to the checks and balances put in place by the Constitution ’s framers .
The letter that follows asks President Bush to seek congressional authorization before launching any possible military strike against Iran and affirms Senator Biden ’s statement last year that impeachment proceedings should be considered if the President fails to do so .
I hope that you will join me in calling on the President to respect Congress ’ exclusive power to declare war .
To sign the letter below , please contact the Judiciary Committee staff at 225-3951 .
Sincerely ,
John Conyers , Jr.
Chairman
____________
May 8 , 2008
The Honorable George W. Bush
President of the United States
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. President :
We are writing to register our strong opposition to possible unilateral , preemptive military action against other nations by the Executive Branch without Congressional authorization .
As you know , Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power “ to declare war , ” to lay and collect taxes to “ provide for the common defense ” and general welfare of the United States , to “ raise and support armies , ” to “ provide and maintain a navy , ” to “ make rules for the regulation for the land and naval forces , ” to “ provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions , ” to “ provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , ” and to “ make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution ... all ... powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States . ”
Congress is also given exclusive power over the purse .
The Constitution says , “ No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law . ”
By contrast , the sole war powers granted to the Executive Branch through the President can be found in Article II , Section 2 , which states , “ The President shall be the Commander - in - Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the Militia of the several States , when called into actual Service of the United States . ”
Nothing in the history of the “ Commander - in - Chief ” clause suggests that the authors of the provision intended it to grant the Executive Branch the authority to engage U.S. forces in military action whenever and wherever it sees fit without any prior authorization from Congress .
In our view , the founders of our country intended this power to allow the President to repel sudden attacks and immediate threats , not to unilaterally launch , without congressional approval , preemptive military actions against foreign countries .
As former Republican Representative Mickey Edwards recently wrote , “ [t ] he decision to go to war ... is the single most difficult choice any public official can be called upon to make .
That is precisely why the nation ’s Founders , aware of the deadly wars of Europe , deliberately withheld from the executive branch the power to engage in war unless such action was expressly approved by the people themselves , through their representatives in Congress . ”
1
Members of Congress , including the signatories of this letter , have previously expressed concern about this issue .
On April 25 , 2006 , sixty - two Members of Congress joined in a bipartisan letter that called on you to seek congressional approval before making any preemptive military strikes against Iran .
2 Fifty - seven Members of Congress have co-sponsored H. Con. Res. 33 , which expresses the sense of Congress that the President should not initiate military action against Iran without first obtaining authorization from Congress .
3
Our concerns in this area have been heightened by more recent events .
The resignation in mid-March of Admiral William J. “ Fox ” Fallon from the head of U.S. Central Command , which was reportedly linked to a magazine article that portrayed him as the only person who might stop your Administration from waging preemptive war against Iran , 4 has renewed widespread concerns that your Administration is unilaterally planning for military action against that country .
This is despite the fact that the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate concluded that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003 , a stark reversal of previous Administration assessments .
5
As we and others have continued to review troubling legal memoranda and other materials from your Administration asserting the power of the President to take unilateral action , moreover , our concerns have increased still further .
For example , although federal law is clear that proceeding under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) “ shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ” can be conducted within the U.S. for foreign intelligence purposes , 18 U.S.C. 2511 ( 2 ) ( f ) , the Justice Department has asserted that the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping in violation of FISA is “ supported by the President ’s well - recognized inherent constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and sole organ for the Nation in foreign affairs ” .
6
As one legal expert has explained , your Administration ’s “ preventive paradigm ” has asserted “ unchecked unilateral power ” by the Executive Branch and violated “ universal prohibitions on torture , disappearance , and the like . ”
7
Late last year , Senator Joseph Biden stated unequivocally that “ the president has no authority to unilaterally attack Iran , and if he does , as Foreign Relations Committee chairman , I will move to impeach ” the president .
8
We agree with Senator Biden , and it is our view that if you do not obtain the constitutionally required congressional authorization before launching preemptive military strikes against Iran or any other nation , impeachment proceedings should be pursued .
Because of these concerns , we request the opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss these matters .
As we have recently marked the fifth year since the invasion of Iraq , and the grim milestone of 4,000 U.S. deaths in Iraq , your Administration should not unilaterally involve this country in yet another military conflict that promises high costs to American blood and treasure .

ROCKVILLE CENTRE , N.Y. 
The “ Downtown ” that Petula Clark evoked in her 1964 pop song of that name ( where “ you can forget all your troubles , forget all your cares ” ) never made much sense to anyone who worked or lived in an actual downtown .
It was a song for people who did not .
So , blaring from the public address speakers to open a recent meeting here , Ms. Clark ’s hit was probably the perfect score for a conference of suburban officials and planners promoting the idea that Creating Cool Downtowns , the conference title , was the future of the suburbs of New York .
“ Young people are moving to Manhattan .
They are moving to Brooklyn , ” said Thomas R. Suozzi , the Nassau County executive and organizer of the conference , which was held on Friday in the parish center of St. Agnes Cathedral .
“ Why are n’t they moving here ? ” he asked .
Why young people flee the suburbs was the underlying question of the day .
But there has never been much mystery about it :
There is nowhere to live ; not enough to do ; and not enough young adults around to improvise the kind of neighborhood scene born every few years in the big city .
A company ’s termination of a female worker ’s employment for missing work in violation of an attendance policy is illegal discrimination if the termination decision is sufficiently related to the woman ’s exercise of her right to an abortion .
On May 30 , 2008 , the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision in Jane Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus , Inc. , and held that :
Clearly , the plain language of the [ Pregnancy Discrimination Act ] , together with the legislative history , and the EEOC guidelines , support a conclusion that an employer may not discriminate against a woman employee because she has exercised her right to have an abortion .
We now hold that the [ PDA ’s ] term “ related medical conditions ” includes an abortion .
The Third Circuit reversed a district court ’s decision , which granted summary judgment in favor of a company that operated a business insuring used cars .
The Third Circuit found that there were issues of fact that must be resolved by a jury , not a judge .
The decision also noted the following items unique to a pregnancy discrimination case :
There are three elements to a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination to be proven by an employee :
She is or was pregnant and her employer knew she was pregnant
She was qualified for her job ;
She suffered an adverse employment action ; and A nexus exists between the pregnancy and the adverse employment action that suggests unlawful discrimination .
The legal analysis for pregnancy discrimination claims follows the rubric set forth for Title VII discrimination claims .
Set forth below is a brief overview of the analysis as discussed in Jane Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus , Inc .
Employee ’s Prima Facie Case :
A nexus can be demonstrated by showing that the pregnant employee was treated less favorably that similarly situated non-pregnant employees .
Anemployer ’s more favorable treatment of temporarily disabled non-pregnant workers raises an inference of discrimination .
A discriminatory motive can be demonstrated by remarks by a company decision maker critical of pregnancy or abortion and by the temporal proximity between the abortion and the employee ’s separation from employment .
Employer ’s Burden of Production :
An employer may defend a discrimination claim by producinga legitimate nondiscriminatory business reason for an employee ’s termination .
For example , in Jane Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus , Inc. , the employer ’s justification for the employee ’s termination was job abandonment for failing to call in under its absenteeism policy .
Employee ’s Burden to Prove Pretext :
The employee must then show the justification is a mere pretext for discrimination by evidence that either casts doubt upon the employer ’s reason as fabricated or shows that discrimination was the employer ’s true motivation .
The evidence of record in Jane Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus , Inc. , created a material issue of fact regarding whether C.A.R.S. ’s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual .
Social views aside , it appears that in the Third Circuit an abortion is now a recognized activity , covered under the PDA , for which an employee cannot be treated differently in the terms and conditions of her employment .
Irrespective of an employer ’s social views , employers must now recognize the differing treatment of employees who have undergone an abortion presents the possibility for claims under the PDA , and most likely the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act .

American citizens
In 2002 , the Pentagon announced that it was considering spreading false propaganda in the foreign press .
However , the military has spread propaganda within the U.S. in an operation so aggressive that one participant , a military analyst , called it " psyops on steroids "
For many years , the government has claimed that it was only spying on foreigners .
But it is now clear that the government is massively spying on American citizen 's home and cellphone calls , email and internet usage , credit card and other financial transactions , and just about every other facet of our personal lives .
The Patriot Act is supposed to be aimed at stopping America - hating terrorists .
Instead , it is being used to prosecute acts having nothing to do with terrorism , and to harass normal , law - abiding Americans
Can anyone see a pattern here ?
Given the above , should we believe that the following programs will just be limited to foreigners ?
The Pentagon is running an artificial intelligence program to see how people will react to propaganda and to government - inflicted terror .
The program is called Sentient World Simulation :
" U.S defense , intel and homeland security officials are constructing a parallel world , on a computer , which the agencies will use to test propaganda messages and military strategies .
Called the Sentient World Simulation , the program uses AI routines based upon the psychological theories of Marty Seligman , among others .
( Seligman introduced the theory of ' learned helplessness ' in the 1960s , after shocking beagles until they cowered , urinating , on the bottom of their cages . )
Yank a country 's water supply .
Stage a military coup .
SWS will tell you what happens next .
The sim will feature an AR avatar for each person in the real world , based upon data collected about us from government records and the internet . "
And as former former Congressman Dan Hamburg and others have pointed out :
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees . "
But many people have pointed out that the laws governing the program are so vague that they could lead to the imprisonment of American citizens for simply speaking out against the government ( see also this )

Thing I 've always been curious about :
How much do shit film adaptations hurt the games ?
Granted , I doubt the Super Mario Bros. movie turned people off from the Nintendo games .
But still !
As more and more game movies are made and as the game industry continues to eclipse the film industry , publishers should realize one thing :
They need you more than you need them .

Update
It 's official .
Sprint and ClearWire are combining their WiMAX business to form a new joint venture .
Sprint will have 51 percent ownership , ClearWire 27 percent , and new investors Intel Capital , Time Warner Cable , Bright House , Google , and Comcast will own 22 percent .
That 22 percent stake cost $ 3.2 billion .
Sprint and ClearWire 's investment will consist primarily of their spectrum holdings .
The new company will keep the ClearWire name , and will own enough spectrum to blanket the US with WiMAX , with an eye towards serving half the US population in 2010 .
Original story follows
Sprint is a step closer to fulfilling its plans to blanket the nation in wireless broadband signals , with the help of WiMax specialist ClearWire and a consortium of big - time financial backers .
The Wall Street Journal 's usual insider sources report ( subscription ) that Clearwire has agreed to merge with Sprint 's wireless broadband division in a new , as yet unnamed , joint venture .
The deal has financial support in the form of $ 1.05 billion from cable giant Comcast , $ 1 billion from chip champ Intel , $ 650 million from Time Warner Cable and its subsidiaries , and $ 500 million from search Brobdingnagian Google .
That 's a grand total of $ 3.2 billion of outside investments , plus whatever cash Clearwire and Sprint might bring to the table .
Do n't expect Sprint itself to bring a fat dowry , though .
The company has about $ 2.4 billion in cash equivalents , but also a staggering $ 20.5 billion debt load .
Sprint is trying to sell off its Nextel unit , which was acquired for $ 35 billion in 2005 , but reports on that effort say that Nextel is only worth about $ 5 billion today .
And ClearWire is in a similar situation of more debt than cash , albeit on a much smaller scale .
So the new WiMax venture would start to build out its infrastructure with mostly other people 's money .
That will probably work — once the wheels start rolling , even a full - on bankruptcy would most likely only transfer control of the network to the debt holders or some rich , daring acquirer .
Touted as a viable wireless broadband alternative , WiMAX has lurched out of the gate so far .
Sprint had planned to launch its Xohm WiMAX network by now , but public availability is on hold as Sprint attempts to work out some serious backhaul issues .
Lurking on the horizon is LTE , the 4G wireless tech favored by rivals AT&T and Verizon .
Fortunately for Sprint , LTE is still in development and the first commercial deployments are at least two years out .
Still , WiMAX is approaching put - up - or - shut - up territory in the US , and the Sprint - ClearWire joint venture may be enough to push it from its perpetual Real Soon Now™ state and into reality .
High - speed wireless broadband is music to our ears , and someone will eventually figure out how to do it profitably and do it well .
SprintWire is off to a good start .
Do n't get bogged down on detail - always strive to see the big picture .

John Meriweather started LTCM , a hedge fund , in 1993 , upon being ' asked to leave ' his position as the head of fixed income at Salomon Brothers in 1991 due to Salomon 's treasury auction rigging scandal .
Fixed Income in the 80's and Solly in particular was one of the most prestigious banks involved in fixed income ( and trading in general ) , so despite the scandal Meriweather preserved a great deal of credibility on the street .
Meriweather then teamed up with Nobel Prize Winners Robert Merton ( from Black - Scholes - Merton theory , not to be confused with Morton from Heath - Jarrow - Morton model ) and Myron Scholes ( from Black - Scholes - Merton ) .
Banking on their enormous reputation LTCM was able to become higly leveraged , and put on interest rate swaps for no initial margin over the market rate .
In this way they could take advantage of betting on small spreads in the fixed income market ( like between mortgage - backed and highly rated corporate bonds ) , using their elaborate , technically sound models to detect the arbitrage .
Using its ability to write swaps , they could also take advantage of liquidity price differences .
In its first two years it returned 43 % and 41 % respectively , and finished with 7 billion in capital .
Now that they were making all of this profit , the huge investment banks wanted to buy in as well .
UBS , for example , bought in for nearly $ 1 Billion USD .
Mistake number 1 : In order to capitalize on market inefficiencies you must never become so big your actions become the market .
LTCM did not reduce its positions relative to the capital reduction , so the leverage did not decrease .
Mistake number 2 : The probability that a given equity will reach a certain price is 100 % , assuming that it is a random walk .
However , in real life , not in models , if it goes under a certain amount , and you are leveraged enough , your lenders are going to demand more on margin .
If you do n't have that much cash available , you 're fucked .
You have to sell out more assets to cover the margin .
Mistake number 3 : Russian bonds .
Here , the issue is risk inherent in your model .
LTCM had taken a significant position on Russian bonds , because their models told them that they were mispriced .
However , it did not take into account liquidity risk at all ( i.e , Who is going to trade with you ?
To make a transaction in the financial markets , you need need a buyer and a seller ) .
So , in 1998 Russia melts down .
LTCM had taken positions betting that the spread between US governments and Russian bonds would converge ; obviously when Russia declares a moratorium on debt , investors jump out of Russia and invest in the stable US , increasing the US - Russia spread .
LTCM starts losing money ; then LTCM 's counterparties ( Mistake # 2 ) start calling for more on margin .
Meriweather still believed that this was temporary .
He focused on that random walk - based model and thought that all they needed was some capital to ride them through .
After all , probability theory says that they will make it all back ( It just does n't say when ) .
Meriweather then sent out an urgent call for more capital , from such investors like Soros , Warren Buffet , Jon Corzine ( Goldman Sachs ) , but the money was not coming .
One reason might have been from Mistake # 1 ; these huge institutional investors could have been making a lot of money trading against LTCM 's portfolio .
LTCM lost 2.1 Billion USD that August .
Now nobody wanted to lend to LTCM to cover these margins , as the risk was too great ; if LTCM collapsed the outcome could be disastrous .
If LTCM collapsed , it would then cause a mass close - out in all of the OTC derivatives markets , investment banks pulling out of LTCM would have to rebalance Basel - required hedges , and the market would move against them , shooting market prices for all derivatives , fixed income , and equities down .
This would cause a panic that might cripple the world 's markets .
The Federal Reserve then caught wind of the risk and rushed to do something : Alan Greenspan as Chairman and Peter Fischer from the NY Fed gathered bankers in an emergency meeting from Bankers Trust , Barclays , Bear Stearns , Chase , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan , Lehman Brothers , Morgan Stanley , Credit Agricole , Banque Paribas , UBS Warburg , Salomon Smith Barney , and Societe Generale to contribute nearly 300 m each in order to bail out LTCM in a window of about 2 days ; two days to save the entire global financial system .
If the financial system failed worldwide , then governments would fall , businesses would collapse , people would have lost their jobs , their savings .
After this debacle people began investigating how one institution could cause so much havoc ; which is somewhat addressed in the Basel II Financial Accords .

Humans started wearing shoes about 40,000 years ago , much earlier than previously thought , new anthropological research suggests .
As any good clothes horse knows , the right outfit speaks volumes about the person wearing it .
Now , anthropologists are tapping into that knowledge base , looking for the physical changes caused by wearing shoes to figure out when footwear first became fashionable .
Turns out , clothes really do make the man ( and the woman ) , at least when it comes to feet .
That 's because wearing shoes changes the way humans walk and how their bodies distribute weight .
If you wear shoes regularly , as most modern humans do , those changes end up reflected in your bones and ligaments .
Susan Cachel , an anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey , said science has known about the way wearing shoes affects feet since the early 20th century .
Researchers have found several differences between feet that regularly wear shoes and those that do n't .
For instance , wearing tight shoes can lead to bunions , which are painful enlargements of the bone or tissue in the big toe , she said .
People who do n't wear shoes have wider feet and bigger gaps between their big toe and the other four .
And women who spend a lot of time in high heels wind up with smaller calf muscles .
Erik Trinkaus , an anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis , was the first person to apply this understanding of how fashion alters physical bodies to anthropology .
He found a point in human history where the size of toe bones began to shrink .
Combining that data with knowledge of how shoes change the way people walk , Trinkaus reasoned that smaller toe bones meant people had started wearing shoes .
While the oldest surviving shoes are only about 10,000 years old , Trinkaus ' discovery pushed the adoption of footwear back to almost 30,000 years ago .
He published that research in 2005 .
Now , thanks to analysis set to be published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science , Trinkaus has found that humans were probably wearing shoes even earlier , about 40,000 years ago .
Through thick and thin
Trinkaus ' theory is based on a simple fact :
Bone size is n't set in stone .
" Bone , at least to a certain extent , responds during a person 's lifetime to the mechanical stresses placed on it , " said Tim Weaver , a University of California , Davis , anthropologist .
" If you work out at the gym , not only will your muscles get bigger , your bones will become thicker . "
For most of their history , humans had big , thick toe bones .
Trinkaus said this was because they were doing more walking , climbing and carrying than we do today .
In fact , he said , all their leg bones were bigger as well , for the same reasons .
This is true for both Neanderthals and the earliest modern humans .
But , around 40,000 years ago , that began to change .
Trinkaus noticed that skeletons from this time period still had strong , thick leg bones , but their toes had suddenly gotten smaller .
" They had wimpy toes , " he said .
" I tried to figure out what would take away stresses on the toes , but not the legs , and the answer was shoes . "
First shoes , first tailors
While Weaver agrees with Trinkaus ' theory , Cachel does n't buy it .
She pointed out that , not long after the time period Trinkaus looked at , humans apparently stopped being so active and all their limb bones , not just the toes , started to shrink .
" If the footbones are smaller , this probably reflects less walking and physical activity , rather than the invention of supportive footware , " Cachel said .
Both Weaver and Cachel think that it would make sense for shoes to hit it big around the time Trinkaus thinks they did .
Around 40,000 and 30,000 years ago , human culture went through a growth spurt .
" The archaeological record shows may changes , including the types of tools people were making and the first definite artwork , and the oldest needles for making clothing appear shortly afterward , " Weaver said .
And Cachel said this was probably the time period where a population boom allowed for the first divisions of labor , meaning that , for the the first time , somebody could dedicate all their time to making better , more decorated clothing .
" It seems reasonable that there were changes in footwear around this time too , " Weaver said , " But before Erik Trinkaus ' study we did n't have any direct evidence . "
To Use Photoshop or Lightroom , That Is the Question
If you only had to use one for the rest of your life , will you choose Photoshop or Lightroom ?
If you ca n’t decide yet , this is a great opportunity to learn more about them .
Keep reading to find out more about the differences between Photoshop vs Lightroom .
It ’s hard to believe that fifty years ago , some people still used black and white photos .
They could n’t even edit the photos they took .
Today , it ’s rare to find a person who does n’t know how to manipulate their photos to some degree .
Photo - editing and touch - ups are so common now that we have apps for them on our mobile phones .
One of the most popular apps right now is FaceApp , with over 100 million downloads from Google Play .
If you want more control and a professional look , a good pick is between Photoshop and Lightroom .
Read more on the two options below .
1. What Is Photoshop and What Is Lightroom ?
Before we get to the Adobe Photoshop vs. Adobe Lightroom debate , let ’s get some background info on them .
Adobe Inc. created both the Lightroom and Photoshop software .
Both are the top choices of image editing tools for their quality .
Yet , there is also a world of difference between them .
Photoshop became the industry standard in graphic editing and digital art .
It ’s the go - to software for many graphic designers , architects , photographers , and publishers .
One reason is that Photoshop has been around longer than Lightroom .
Photoshop ’s initial release was in 1990 while Lightroom got released in 2007 .
That is also why people think of Photoshop when they hear the words “ photo editing ” .
Lightroom is also a photo - editing tool , but its focus is on other tasks .
It has a subset of Photoshop ’s features , but also extra features that are unique to it .
It ’s also a photo management tool , which we ’ll discuss more later .
2. What You Can Do With Photoshop
Let ’s begin with the more popular of the two , Photoshop .
As we mentioned , for many people , Photoshop is already synonymous with photo - editing .
Because of its history and development , it ’s the best choice for advanced photo editing .
Photoshop is rich with all sorts of photo - editing tools .
It also uses layer - based editing , which simplifies combining or editing images .
It also allows you to edit an image down to each pixel .
With it , you can make your skin look smoother for your new profile photo .
You can make a subject look taller , younger , or bulkier .
You can even add makeup on a person ’s portrait post - shoot .
Landscape photographers can stitch images into a single panorama with Photoshop .
You can also create fantasy landscapes using stock photography and a little imagination .
You can even create 3D effects , animations or GIFs , and photorealistic mockups with it .
As they like to say , that is the power of Photoshop .
3. What You Can Do With Lightroom
Now , let ’s look at the potentials of Adobe Lightroom .
It does n’t have advanced tools like Photoshop , but Lightroom has a photo management feature .
That means Lightroom is both a photo editing and a photo management program .
Learning how to use and master Lightroom is easier , especially for beginners .
Its simpler interface is one reason for it .
Another one is its automated options .
As a Lightroom user , you can apply edits across a selection of photos at the same time .
The secret to simultaneous photo - editing is using presets .
You can check this guide here to learn how to install Lightroom a preset .
Lightroom also has the advantage of non-destructive editing .
That means you ’ll never lose or replace the original images with the edited ones .
It also keeps a record of all changes , making it easy to revert to an earlier edit that you want to go back to .
4. Cons : Photoshop vs Lightroom
A Photoshop vs Lightroom comparison guide is n’t complete without the cons of each one .
While Photoshop is great for beginners , it can get overwhelming .
The diversity of tools can confuse a new user .
This gives Photoshop a steep learning curve .
Unlike Lightroom , Photoshop ca n’t manage photos for you .
It ca n’t read the metadata of images and organize them .
This also means sorting and looking for specific photos will be more difficult if you only use Photoshop .
We mentioned that Lightroom does n’t have a Save button because it records all edits in a catalog .
Photoshop does n’t have this feature .
You ’ll have to make it a habit to press Ctrl +
S or Cmd +
S often to save your work .
Now , let ’s focus on what Lightroom ca n’t do .
Because it has simpler tools , you do n’t get full control of the image - editing .
It also loses the other functions like creating animated photos .
We say Lightroom is easier to grasp , but you can also do complex image editing on it .
However , diving straight into Lightroom can teach you only a few tricks .
If you want to get the best use out of Lightroom , you may need to take some training .
5 . When It ’s Best to Use Lightroom and Photoshop
Now , you may have the question of is Photoshop or Lightroom the better choice .
Or is Lightroom better than Photoshop vice versa ?
The answer will depend on your goal and your preferences .
For example , your goal is to create magnificent photo manipulations from scratch .
Because Photoshop has all the tools you ’ll need , it ’s the smart pick .
If you only need to do minimal editing over a lot of photos , Lightroom is the better choice .
Understand your goals before you decide on a photo - editing program .
You do n’t want to misuse one or the other and end up getting frustrated .
Better yet , use them together since they complement each other well .
Pick the Photo Editing Software That Suits Your Needs
Photography is one of the most useful hobbies a person can have .
It ’s a great way to express your reality , connect with others , or display your creativity .
However , you ca n’t always rely on timing and practical effects to capture what you want to show .
We hope that this guide on the two Adobe photo - editing programs helps you .
That ends our guide on Photoshop vs Lightroom .

Every year , hundreds of thousands of Americans volunteer to take part in medical research studies , from simple health surveys to detailed analyses of their DNA or tests of experimental medicines .
But what happens after their participation is over ?
In many cases , volunteers wo n't ever hear from the researchers about what the study revealed .
But other studies make a special effort to keep volunteers informed , via newsletters or Web sites .
A new review of the issue , published recently in the journal Public Library of Science Medicine , suggests that participants ' desire to know the results of studies outweighs concerns by some bioethicists about the potential negative psychological consequences of sharing some results .
Even when it 's bad news , most study volunteers want to know .
So , should all medical researchers make an effort to communicate about their results with the volunteers who are so vital to their research ?
If they try to do so , what hurdles -- ethical , privacy - related , financial or logistical -- might complicate their efforts ?
Could sharing clinical research results with some volunteers actually upset them ?
Such questions are addressed in the new paper , which was written by University of Michigan medical student David Shalowitz and Franklin Miller , Ph.D. , of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health .
The research was funded by a grant from the U - M President 's Initiative for Ethics in Public Life .
The paper reviews the landscape of knowledge on this issue , including commentaries on the potential positive and negative impacts of sharing results , and data from studies that evaluated the desires and reactions of research volunteers in specific clinical trials .
advertisement
All in all , the article says , better data are needed on the ins and outs of sharing study results with research volunteers .
" It 's a mixed bag , " says lead author Shalowitz .
" We found overwhelmingly that participants do want access to aggregate study results , and that to a lesser extent they want to know their individual results if they have relevance to their lives . "
For instance , volunteers in a study looking for genes related to a particular disease might appreciate the opportunity to find out what their individual genetic test revealed .
And they may be interested in learning what the entire study found .
But other people in the same study might not want to know their individual results , for fear of finding out that they have a higher risk of developing a particular disease .
One of the biggest hurdles that the authors found in both commentaries and studies of this issue , Shalowitz says , was the cost of contacting research volunteers and presenting trial results to them .
advertisement
Presenting aggregate results in layman 's language is not as difficult , he notes , as preparing individual reports for each volunteer , which can be very labor - intensive in a large study with hundreds or thousands of participants .
Then there 's the ethical issue of whether and how to offer participants a way to communicate with the researchers about what they 've been told -- for instance , by phone or e-mail if they 're concerned about their individual test results .
And , for those who simply do n't want to know their individual results or even the aggregate results , a system for opting out is needed .
These considerations might be addressed if researchers consider participant communications during the earliest planning of their study , including the funding request , Shalowitz says .
If the NIH and local Institutional Review Boards were to demand a plan for such communications as part of each study proposal , and perhaps provide staff who could facilitate such efforts , it would help researchers greatly , he adds .
In the end , the authors say , more research on the best approaches for contacting research volunteers , and the actual responses of volunteers to this issue , is needed .
" There 's a need to develop a standard way of measuring these domains , so that systematic evaluations can be done , " says Shalowitz .
" We also need better evaluations of the best ways to communicate data to research participants .
We need to change the current situation in which claims are being made about the benefits and risks of sharing results without data to back them up . "
Turns out 6 years prior to 9/11 in light of the first WTC attack ( assisted by FBI , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imtps0MQqk), the laptop of Ramzi Yousef found information uncovered information about using planes as weapons and flying them into buildings , specifically the CIA headquarters .
So Bush 's comments about no one in our government at least , and the prior ( Clinton ) government , could envision using planes as weapons on such a massive scale , reiterated by Condi Rice several times is false .
This in addition to the August 6th PDB and not the plans years earlier .
Here 's a video clip of the mention of the planes being used as weapons into the CIA .
Just some other thoughts , just how effective would a hijack be ?
2 months before 9/11 , an order was issued to rescind a 40 year rule for the ability for pilots to be armed .
http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27647
But whether the pilots were armed would have little effect since pilots are required to be strapped in to their seat , and could simply put the plane in a steep dive or elevation that would throw the hijackers against the wall or the ceiling , but what would certainly through them of their feet .
The little things that are rarely talked about need to be .

Yesterday 's post concluded :
To form accurate beliefs about something , you really do have to observe it .
It 's a very physical , very real process : any rational mind does " work " in the thermodynamic sense , not just the sense of mental effort ...
So unless you can tell me which specific step in your argument violates the laws of physics by giving you true knowledge of the unseen , do n't expect me to believe that a big , elaborate clever argument can do it either .
One of the chief morals of the mathematical analogy between thermodynamics and cognition is that the constraints of probability are inescapable ; probability may be a " subjective state of belief " , but the laws of probability are harder than steel .
People learn under the traditional school regimen that the teacher tells you certain things , and you must believe them and recite them back ; but if a mere student suggests a belief , you do not have to obey it .
They map the domain of belief onto the domain of authority , and think that a certain belief is like an order that must be obeyed , but a probabilistic belief is like a mere suggestion .
They look at a lottery ticket , and say , " But you can't prove I wo n't win , right ? "
Meaning : " You may have calculated a low probability of winning , but since it is a probability , it 's just a suggestion , and I am allowed to believe what I want . "
Here 's a little experiment : Smash an egg on the floor .
The rule that says that the egg wo n't spontaneously reform and leap back into your hand is merely probabilistic .
A suggestion , if you will .
The laws of thermodynamics are probabilistic , so they can't really be laws , the way that " Thou shalt not murder " is a law ... right ?
So why not just ignore the suggestion ?
Then the egg will unscramble itself ... right ?
It may help to think of it this way - if you still have some lingering intuition that uncertain beliefs are not authoritative :
In reality , there may be a very small chance that the egg spontaneously reforms .
But you can not expect it to reform .
You must expect it to smash .
Your mandatory belief is that the egg 's probability of spontaneous reformation is ~0 .
Probabilities are not certainties , but the laws of probability are theorems .
If you doubt this , try dropping an egg on the floor a few decillion times , ignoring the thermodynamic suggestion and expecting it to spontaneously reassemble , and see what happens .
Probabilities may be subjective states of belief , but the laws governing them are stronger by far than steel .
I once knew a fellow who was convinced that his system of wheels and gears would produce reactionless thrust , and he had an Excel spreadsheet that would prove this - which of course he could n't show us because he was still developing the system .
In classical mechanics , violating Conservation of Momentum is provably impossible .
So any Excel spreadsheet calculated according to the rules of classical mechanics must necessarily show that no reactionless thrust exists - unless your machine is complicated enough that you have made a mistake in the calculations .
And similarly , when half - trained or tenth - trained rationalists abandon their art and try to believe without evidence just this once , they often build vast edifices of justification , confusing themselves just enough to conceal the magical steps .
It can be quite a pain to nail down where the magic occurs - their structure of argument tends to morph and squirm away as you interrogate them .
But there 's always some step where a tiny probability turns into a large one - where they try to believe without evidence - where they step into the unknown , thinking , " No one can prove me wrong " .
Their foot naturally lands on thin air , for there is far more thin air than ground in the realms of Possibility .
Ah , but there is an ( exponentially tiny ) amount of ground in Possibility , and you do have an ( exponentially tiny ) probability of hitting it by luck , so maybe this time , your foot will land in the right place !
It is merely a probability , so it must be merely a suggestion .
The exact state of a glass of boiling - hot water may be unknown to you - indeed , your ignorance of its exact state is what makes the molecules ' kinetic energy " heat " , rather than work waiting to be extracted like the momentum of a spinning flywheel .
So the water might cool down your hand instead of heating it up , with probability ~0 .
Decide to ignore the laws of thermodynamics and stick your hand in anyway , and you 'll get burned .
" But you do n't know that ! "
I do n't know it with certainty , but it is mandatory that I expect it to happen .
Probabilities are not logical truths , but the laws of probability are .
" But what if I guess the state of the boiling water , and I happen to guess correctly ? "
Your chance of guessing correctly by luck , is even less than the chance of the boiling water cooling your hand by luck .
" But you can't prove I wo n't guess correctly . "
I can ( indeed , must ) assign extremely low probability to it .
" That 's not the same as certainty , though . "
Hey , maybe if you add enough wheels and gears to your argument , it 'll turn warm water into electricity and ice cubes !
Or , rather , you will no longer see why this could n't be the case .
" Right !
I can't see why could n't be the case !
So maybe it is ! "
Another gear ?
That just makes your machine even less efficient .
It was n't a perpetual motion machine before , and each extra gear you add makes it even less efficient than that .
Each extra detail in your argument necessarily decreases the joint probability .
The probability that you 've violated the Second Law of Thermodynamics without knowing exactly how , by guessing the exact state of boiling water without evidence , so that you can stick your finger in without getting burned , is , necessarily , even less than the probability of sticking in your finger into boiling water without getting burned .
I say all this , because people really do construct these huge edifices of argument in the course of believing without evidence .
One must learn to see this as analogous to all the wheels and gears that fellow added onto his reactionless drive , until he finally collected enough complications to make a mistake in his Excel spreadsheet .

The hot - button issue of retroactive immunity for telecom companies in cahoots with illegal Bush administration surveillance programs is close to reaching its inevitable dénouement .
But what ’s gotten little media play throughout the endless months of " debate " are the huge piles of cash that have changed hands to influence congressional Democrats and Republicans .
According to Glenn Greenwald :
Just in the first three months of 2008 , recent lobbyist disclosure statements reveal that AT&T spent $ 5.2 million in lobbyist fees ( putting it well ahead of its 2007 pace , when it spent just over $ 17 million ) .
In the first quarter of 2008 , Verizon spent $ 4.8 million on lobbyist fees , while Comcast spent $ 2.6 million .
So in the first three months of this year , those three telecoms –which would be among the biggest beneficiaries of telecom amnesty ( right after the White House ) –spent a combined total of almost $ 13 million on lobbyists .
They ’re on pace to spend more than $ 50 million on lobbying this year–just those three companies .
( " How Telecoms Are Attempting to Buy Amnesty from Congress , " Salon , May 24 , 2008 )
No matter how you squeeze it , that ’s a lot of corporatist " juice " flowing into campaign coffers .
Until , that is , you consider that " outsourced " government contracts are worth tens of billions of dollars annually to enterprising telecom companies for communications and IT services to a gaggle of shadowy intelligence agencies fighting to " keep America safe " – from lower quarterly earnings !
Ranging from the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , not to mention low profile " partners " such as the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) or the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) –$ 50 million is chump change .
And what are these corporate pirates seeking from Congress ?
Why " get - out - of - jail - free - cards , " of course !
Behind closed doors , House and Senate negotiators are " are closing in on a deal " with the White House over illegal government domestic spying , The Wall Street Journal reported Friday .
Touted as a " compromise " and a " major breakthrough " by both Democrats and Republicans , the deal would " would kick the issue to a secret national - security court .
Earlier versions of the legislation wanted to grant telecom companies blanket retroactive immunity from lawsuits , " Siobhan Gorman avers .
However , according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties group representing plaintiffs in Hepting vs. AT&T , brought by AT&T customers in the wake of revelations of massive domestic spying by the Bush administration and their " private " partners in the telecom industry , the congressional " compromise " is a monumental fraud :
" The purported immunity ‘ compromise ’ announced on Thursday by Senator Bond is a pure sham that ’s even worse than the original immunity provision passed by the Senate , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" The stacked - deck immunity determination to be made by the court apparently still does n’t include any meaningful review of the telecoms ’ conduct or the legality of their cooperation with the NSA , simply a review of whether the companies got a piece of paper saying that the president authorized the surveillance .
And the deck would be stacked even more by the proposed transfer to the FISA court –the most conservative and secretive federal court in the nation .
Bottom line : it ’s still immunity , and this so - called compromise concedes nothing . "
( " EFF Blasts New ‘ Compromise ’ Offer on Teleco Immunity , " Electronic Frontier Foundation , Press Release , May 23 , 2008 )
Some " compromise " !
According to the Federation of American Scientists , the FISA court ,
… is responsible for reviewing and approving government applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for domestic electronic surveillance and physical search of suspected foreign intelligence agents or terrorists .
But it does more than that .
The Court also reinterprets the terms of the Act in an undisclosed fashion , producing in effect a body of " secret law , " a matter discussed at an April 30 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" The FISC has in fact issued … legally significant decisions that remain classified and have not been released to the public , " observed Judge John D. Bates , a member of the FIS Court , when he denied an ACLU motion for disclosure of portions of those decisions last December .
( " Intel Surveillance Court Gets Two New Judges , " Federation of American Scientists , Secrecy News , May 23 , 2008 )
During the April 30 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing referenced above , John P. Elwood , a DoJ official " disclosed a previously unpublicized method to cloak government activities , " according to The New York Times .
In keeping with the Bush administration ’s penchant for lawless behavior , Elwood acknowledged that the executive branch believed that " the president could ignore or modify existing executive orders that he or other presidents have issued without disclosing the new interpretation , " Times ’ reporters Scott Shane and David Johnson wrote .
Conceding nothing that would dispel fears that the administration is operating on the basis of " secret law " beyond the purview of the courts or Congress , the state ’s " legal stance would let it secretly operate programs that are at odds with public executive orders that to all appearance remain in force , " the Times reported .
Demonstrating profound contempt for classification rules , Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , said the administration ’s contention that it can " selectively modify " executive orders " turns The Federal Register into a screen of falsehoods behind whose phony regulations lawless programs can operate in secret . "
In other words , following dictums laid down by French monarch , the " sun king " Louis XIV , the law is whatever our decider - president and his minions say it is .
While warrantless wiretapping and the subversion of law is bad enough , the question inevitably arises : what other programs are being hidden from the American people ?
Investigative journalist Christopher Ketcham believes that a " highly classified program with sinister implications " may lie at the heart of Bush administration ’s refusal to back - down on telecom immunity .
Through an as yet - undisclosed " black program , " the administration may be " compiling a secret enemies list of citizens who could face detention under martial law . "
According to Ketcham , recounting Acting Attorney General James Comey ’s now infamous 2004 tussle with the White House , and the bureaucrat ’s refusal to reauthorize Bush ’s illegal programs , Ketcham writes ,
Yet in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee , he described how he had grown increasingly uneasy reviewing the Bush administration ’s various domestic surveillance and spying programs .
Much of his testimony centered on an operation so clandestine he was n’t allowed to name it or even describe what it did .
( " The Last Roundup , " Radar , May / June 2008 )
Welcome ( once again ) to the bizarro world of " Continuity of Government " whose illegally - beating dark heart may dwell in what intelligence insiders have called the ultra - top secret " Main Core " database .
Some months after The New York Times revealed in December 2005 that the Bush administration had illegally spied on Americans through its so - called " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " USA TODAY reported ,
With access to records of billions of domestic calls , the NSA has gained a secret window into the communications habits of millions of Americans .
Customers ’ names , street addresses and other personal information are not being handed over as part of NSA ’s domestic program , the sources said .
But the phone numbers the NSA collects can easily be cross-checked with other databases to obtain that information .
( Leslie Cauley , " NSA has massive database of Americans ’ phone calls , " USA TODAY , May 11 , 2006 ) [ emphasis added ]
Keep in mind that AT&T , Verizon and BellSouth , the nation ’s three largest telecommunication providers , are well - positioned to serve as the state ’s " outsourced " eyes - and - ears .
Collectively , the three carriers provide an array of services : local and long - distance calling , wireless and high - speed broadband internet access , as well as video and cable services .
Once communications information has been " fused " with records gleaned from commercially - available databases–sold , of course , to the state as a " patriotic " duty –NSA " partners " such as Booz Allen Hamilton , IBM , Lockheed Martin , Raytheon , CACI and L - 3 , can then analyze data such as medical histories , travel itineraries , shopping habits , political affiliations , subscription lists , DVD rentals , etc .
In a nanosecond , a unique profile of an individual ’s " transactional " life has thus been created .
This however , is not without risk to offending spies and data - miners .
And given the nature of financial penalties under section 222 of the Communications
Act , telecom executives have every reason to sweat .
The FCC " can levy fines up to $ 130,000 per day per violation , with a cap of $ 1.325 million per violation .
The FCC has no hard definition of ‘ violation . ’
In practice , that means a single ‘ violation ’ could cover one customer or 1 million , " Cauley reported .
But the Bush administration ’s so - called " Terrorist Surveillance Program " may very well be a smokescreen for collecting political data on millions of Americans , a secret " enemies list " far more dangerous to a democratic society than anything conceived by the team of " national security " paranoids assembled by Richard Nixon .
Ketcham reports ,
According to a senior government official who served with high - level security clearances in five administrations , " There exists a database of Americans , who , often for the slightest and most trivial reason , are considered unfriendly , and who , in a time of panic , might be incarcerated .
The database can identify and locate perceived ‘ enemies of the state ’ almost instantaneously . "
He and other sources tell Radar that the database is sometimes referred to by the code name Main Core .
One knowledgeable source claims that 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially suspect .
In the event of a national emergency , these people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention . …
A host of publicly disclosed programs , sources say , now supply data to Main Core .
Most notable are the NSA domestic surveillance programs , initiated in the wake of 9/11 , typically referred to in press reports as " warrantless wiretapping . "
In March , a front - page article in the Wall Street Journal shed further light onto the extraordinarily invasive scope of the NSA efforts : According to the Journal , the government can now electronically monitor " huge volumes of records of domestic e-mails and Internet searches , as well as bank transfers , credit card transactions , travel , and telephone records . "
Authorities employ " sophisticated software programs " to sift through the data , searching for " suspicious patterns . "
In effect , the program is a mass catalog of the private lives of Americans .
And it ’s notable that the article hints at the possibility of programs like Main Core .
" The [ NSA ] effort also ties into data from an ad - hoc collection of so - called black programs whose existence is undisclosed , " the Journal reported , quoting unnamed officials .
" Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11 attacks but have since been given greater reach . "
As disturbing as Ketcham ’s report is , consider this : the ACLU ’s " Watch List Counter " documents that the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center currently lists ( as of 5/26/08 ) 975,883 (! ) individuals as potential " threats " to " national security . "
What are the criteria for inclusion ?
No one knows and the FBI and DHS are n’t saying .
It is of course absurd to believe there are nearly a million U.S. sympathizers of the Afghan - Arab database of disposable intelligence assets , aka al - Qaeda , roaming the streets of American cities .
However , if history is any guide to present state surveillance activities , a database like Main Core , if it exists , would include dissidents and activists of all stripes , ranging from socialists and communists , anarchists , tax protestors , gun owners , lawyers and professors , " illegal " migrants , publishers and journalists , or just plain folk caught in the government ’s data driftnet .
But over and above the question of telecom immunity for law - breaking communication corporations looms the issue of intelligence outsourcing as a lucrative business arrangement with the state , the ubiquitous " public - private partnership " in political repression that affect all our lives .
As investigative journalist Tim Shorrock documents ,
A second form of cooperation that few Americans are aware of concern the role of the telecom giants as contractors for the Intelligence Community .
As commercial communications and encryption technologies advanced in the years leading up to 2001 , AT&T , Verizon and the other major carriers were hired by the government to build classified communications networks for the NSA and Pentagon .
That alliance spawned new institutions where the government could carry out a dialogue with these companies .
Many industry executives , for example , hold leading positions in a secretive agency called the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee , a group of business leaders who meet regularly with President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and senior officials in the Intelligence Community to discuss critical issues affecting the national telecommunications system . …
That broad alliance between the NSA and the government on one hand and the telecommunications and IT industries on the other is the fundamental issue at stake in the national debate that erupted around FISA in 2007 and 2008 .
That debate was about far more than a few telecom companies cooperating with the government .
( Spies for Hire : The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing , New York : Simon & Schuster , 2008 , pp. 307 , 308 )
In this context , the political economy of telecom immunity should be considered a shield for government " black " programs that could be quickly rolled - out during a " national emergency . "
That congressional leaders –Democrats and Republicans –would grant their corporate benefactors nearly unlimited power to spy on Americans , or worse , is an indication that elite consensus has been reached in favor of maintaining an all - encompassing surveillance state .

Keeping the streets safe
Posted Wednesday , March 19 , 2008 1:02 am
Wednesday , March 19
BENNINGTON  Dozens of motorists looked to their rearview mirrors Monday night to see the flashing , blue lights of local police .
After being pulled over , most understood why and some wereeven pleased to have been stopped .
Others , unfortunately , were arrestedand brought to the police station for booking .
Local , county , state police
As local residents celebrated St. Patrick 's Day Monday night , at least five police officers  from the Bennington Police Department , the Vermont State Police and a deputy with the Washington County Sheriff 's Department  were busy participating in a " saturation patrol " to seek out people driving under the influence of alcohol .
" We know that on St. Patrick 's Day it 's not going to be dumb luck that finds us an impaired driver , " saidLt .
Paul Doucette of the BPD .
The patrols , often instituted on or around holidays , are intended to provide time for officers to look solely for impaired drivers on the roads .
The program is funded through local , state and federal grants obtained mainly through the Governor 's Highway Safety program , Doucette said .
A total of 74 vehicles were stopped Monday night in Bennington and North Bennington , Doucette said .
Not a single person was found to be driving while impaired , though , which Doucette said was a credit to the efforts of law enforcement officials .
He said the proportion of crashes involving alcohol has declined in Bennington County , according to Doucette .

" It is my opinion that our highway safety efforts are working .
To encounter 74 vehicles and not find a single impaired operator is outstanding , " he said .
During the saturation patrols officers look for motor vehicle violations or other problems that would allow for a traffic stop such as broken headlights or taillights or uninspected vehicles .
Some might say having police look for a reason to stop a vehicle is wrong .
But Doucette and other law enforcement officials around the country disagree .

" The goal of this program is not about traffic tickets .
It 's about education and impaired drivers , " he said .
In fact , most of the drivers stopped Monday night were simply told of a broken light , to use their turn signal or given other reminders .
Officers explained that they were looking for impaired drivers and the motorists were on their way .
A few , of course , were not as lucky .
Doucette ticketed one woman because her young child was not in a proper safety seat , and department procedure is to always issue a ticket for such a violation .
Doucette offered the woman a free booster seat , which he helped her install at the police station .

Some motorists experienced tougher consequences .
Police arrested three people for possession of marijuana , and four minors were charged with possession of alcohol .
A group of three minors traveling in a pickup were stopped for motor vehicle violation .
But police soon saw containers of alcohol , which led to finding marijuana , smoking paraphernalia and more than $ 1,000 in cash .
Two of the people in the truck were arrested and transported back to the station , where their photographs and fingerprints were captured with digital technology .
Later , just before midnight , four minors were traveling on Northside Drive when they were stopped .
Three of the four minors were found to have been drinking after a roadside alcosensor tests was administered .
The driver was found to be sober .
One passenger was also arrested for possession of marijuana .
Bennington Police Sgt. Camillo Grande said police often look for specific things to identify impaired drivers .
A motorist who forgets to use a turn signal or stops well into an intersection at a stop sign or red light is a good indication , he said .
A swerving car could also be the result of an impaired driver , but it can be tricky to tell on Vermont roads , Grande said .
" We live in Vermont .
We 've got potholes everywhere .
As a police officer you 've got to use a bit of discretion , " he said .
Grande said police try to cover all areas of town during the patrols to ensure the safety of all residents and prevent impaired motorists from avoiding police .
" I just travel all over the place .
There is n't any specific place I hit .
I 've learned over the years that it does n't matter where you hit .
Eventually , people need to filter out of the commercial areas and go to the residential areas , " he said .
Police will not adopt a tougher approach to cases of simple possession of cannabis when ministers upgrade the legal status of the drug to class B , the Guardian can disclose .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) confirmed last night that the current policy of " confiscate and warn " would continue , despite Gordon Brown 's determination to reclassify the drug in an attempt to " send a tough message " to young people about its use .
Chief constables are debating whether or not fixed penalty fines should be available alongside cannabis warnings .
But the basic approach of saving police time by not making an arrest and taking the offender to the police station to be charged , introduced four years ago , will remain .
Before cannabis was downgraded to class C in 2004 , 58 % of possession cases formally dealt with by police ended in arrest and formal caution , while 42 % were taken to court .
Campaigners for drug law reform last night questioned the relevance of the drug classification system , which dates back to 1971 , and its ability to send a message .
Roger Howard , chief executive of the UK Drug Policy Commission , and a former government drugs adviser , said : " There will be no new powers or resources for policing if cannabis is made class B , and cannabis warnings can still be issued instead of arrest . "
He said this underlined the muddle at the heart of government over the purpose of a drug classification system which was unlikely ever to be able to " send a message to young people " .
Since cannabis had moved from class B to class C , the number of schoolchildren who think it is fine to try cannabis had halved , he said .
It is expected that Acpo guidance to police officers will use different language from existing guidelines to stress the discretion that is available to constables to take more robust action in cases involving repeat offenders or aggravating factors such as disorder or evidence of organised crime .
An Acpo spokesman said last night : " The key will be the discretion for officers to strike the right balance .
We do not want to criminalise young people who are experimenting . "
However , he stressed that cases involving " aggravating factors " were more likely to see an arrest and prosecution .
When the police announced their support for regrading cannabis as a class B drug this year , Simon Byrne , Merseyside 's assistant chief constable and the Acpo lead on policing cannabis , entered a little - noticed but crucial caveat to the police position .
He said that since cannabis had been downgraded there had been growing concerns over increased potency , the rise of " homegrown " cannabis farms and a perception that its legal status meant it was seen as a low policing priority .
But he added that the police had supported the decision to downgrade the drug four years ago because of " the disproportionate time spent by frontline police officers in dealing with offenders in possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use .
Should the decision be taken to reclassify cannabis to a class B , Acpo believes the service should retain this flexibility in dealing with instances of possession on the street , including the discretion to issue warnings in appropriate circumstances " .
The 2005 Serious and Organised Crime and Policing
Act introduced new criteria for making an arrest which emphasised that it had to be necessary because , for example , the officer doubted whether he had been given a real name or a valid address by the offender .
The number of cannabis warnings issued has spiralled to more than 100,000 since its legal status was downgraded ; that forms an important part of the ability of the police to meet their national target for the number of offences brought to justice .
In legal terms , the move back to class B means the maximum prison sentence for possession will be increased from two to five years .
( Adds details on suspects , new background paras 9 , 18 - 20 )
STOCKHOLM , May 21 ( Reuters ) - Swedish police detained two men on suspicion of planning to sabotage a nuclear power station on Wednesday after one of them was discovered entering it with small amounts of a highly explosive material .
" Two men who were taken in for questioning this morning have now been detained on suspicion of preparing for sabotage , " said Kalmar County Police spokesman Sven - Erik Karlsson .
Police were alerted shortly before 8 a.m. by the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant on the southeast coast of Sweden .
Initially , police only said they were interrogating one man .
" They told us a welder who was going to perform a job there had been stopped in a random security check .
He had been carrying small amounts of the highly explosive material TATP , " Karlsson said .
TATP , or triacetone triperoxide , is extremely unstable , especially when subjected to heat , friction and shock .
The compound can be prepared in a home laboratory from easily available household chemicals .
It has been used by suicide bombers in Israel and by Richard Reid , the thwarted British " shoebomber " who attempted to blow up a transatlantic airliner in 2001 .
Police did not initially treat the men as criminal suspects .
" They were only being questioned in order to gather information , " Karlsson said .
He said both were contract workers and one of them was previously known to police .
He had no other details other than the years in which they were born , 1955 and 1962 .
SUSPECT BAG
Police sealed off a 300 - meter ( 330 - yard ) area around the substance and called in explosives technicians from Malmo , the nearest large city .
Oskarshamn , jointly owned by Germany's E.ON
EONG.DE
and Finland 's Fortum
FUM1V.HE
, said in a statement on its
Web site that it believed the reactor 's safety was never threatened .
An E.ON spokesman said the material had been found on or inside the first man 's bag .
" What has happened is that a guy , a contractor , this morning came to the security check with a bag on which , or in which , there were traces of explosives , " E.ON spokesman Johan Aspegren said .
An official at the plant said the men had been at one of the plant 's three reactors , which had been shut for maintenance .
Professor Hans Michels , an explosives expert at Imperial College London , said TATP was mainly used as an initiator or " trigger explosive " to detonate a larger main charge .
He said four men who tried unsuccessfully to set off bombs on London transport in July 2005 had used detonators with 5 - 10 grams ( 0.18 to 0.35 oz ) of TATP but failed to ignite the main charge of their devices .
Michels said TATP could also be used as a main charge , in which case he estimated that more than 100 grams ( 3.5 oz ) of it would be needed to blow a hole in a heavy structure with an inch ( 2.5 cm ) or more of high - quality steel .
" Normal explosive experts shun ( TATP ) because it 's very unstable , it 's dangerous and it's not very pure .
It tends to decompose , " Michels said .
An experienced British investigator , who asked not to be named , said it was possible for small traces of household products such as hair bleach to trigger positive readings when picked up by explosive - screening devices .
Hair bleach commonly contains hydrogen peroxide , an ingredient in TATP .
Oskarshamn is one of three nuclear plants in Sweden that meet half the country 's power needs .
Sweden 's nuclear industry has been hit by a series of mishaps in recent years , prompting the United Nations nuclear watchdog to call for safety measures .
The Swedish nuclear regulator said there has never been an incident involving sabotage of a Swedish nuclear plant , although last year a bomb threat was received at one facility and turned out to be false .
TV shows are by far the most wanted files via BitTorrent , and according to some , it 's fast becoming the modern day TiVo .
But what are all those people downloading ?
Let 's find out , and take a look at this weeks " Most pirated TV - episodes " chart .
Nearly 50 % of all the people who use BitTorrent at any given point in time do so to download a TV show , with popular series such as “ Lost ” getting close to 10 million downloads per episode .
These figures are getting awfully close to the viewer count on TV as reported by Nielsen , and they are still rising .
People are getting used to on - demand content .
They simply want to watch their favorite shows whenever they want , wherever they want .
To give some more insight into this growing phenomenon , and because Nielsen is not counting BitTorrent downloads , we decided to start a weekly report of the most downloaded TV shows on BitTorrent .
The data is collected by TorrentFreak from a representative sample of BitTorrent sites .
The timing is a bit unfortunate , since popular shows like Desperate Housewives , House and Greys Anatomy just had their season finale last week , but we are aiming to publish an updated list every week from now on .
Top Downloads May 25 – June 01
To give an impression of how many downloads these shows can get , here is the list of the most downloaded TV episodes in 2007 .
The number of downloads reported here is for Mininova only , so these could easily quadruple if all large BitTorrent sites were taken into account .
Top Downloads 2007
The increasing popularity of these series on BitTorrent and other filesharing networks is a signal that customers want something that they ca n’t get somewhere else .
It is all about availability .
This is not a threat to TV studios , but rather an opportunity .

Mark Shuttleworth was the second ' space tourist '
The public perception of open source software is changing fast , said Mark Shuttleworth , who leads distribution of the Ubuntu operating system ( OS ) .
A new version of Ubuntu , a version of the Linux OS , is released on Thursday .
Mr Shuttleworth said the success of the Asus Eee PC and the work of the One Laptop Per Child programme had driven awareness of open source .
" There has been a sea change in the way people think of Linux , which is very healthy , " he said .
" We have seen a real shift in the last six months from folks seeing open source as either a super - specialist thing for people who run data centres or as an enthusiast thing , to something which is energising a lot of the straight commercial PC industry , " said Mr Shuttleworth .
Platform development
He manages Canonical software , which is the primary sponsor of distribution for Ubuntu , and a key element in the platform 's development .
He is also well - known for being the second - ever , self - funded space tourist , travelling to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz spacecraft in 2002 .
If people think of their daily experience as a sit down on the web , we know that people can have very compelling experience on Linux
Mark Shuttleworth
Mr Shuttleworth said ordinary consumers were beginning to turn to Ubuntu , and to Linux more generally , to improve their daily computing experience .
" If people think of computing as going to a PC , sitting down and starting Word , then the traditional view , of using Windows and Office , will persist .
" But if people think of their daily experience as a sit down on the web , we know that people can have a very compelling experience on Linux .
" In fact , we know it is a better web experience because they can do it without spyware , without viruses . "
Mr Shuttleworth said he believed there were about eight to nine million users of Ubuntu worldwide .
" Most of the growth in users is from people buying a device that comes with Ubuntu shipped or wanting something for a second or older computer and are looking to tech - savvy friends for guidance , " he said .
' Most significant '
He described the latest version of Ubuntu , dubbed Hardy Heron , as " perhaps our most significant ever " .
The version will have three years of " long term support " from Canonical , which Mr Shuttleworth believes will make it more attractive for large - scale roll - outs of machines powered by the operating system .

He said the French police force was currently deploying 50,000 Ubuntu - powered machines , while Spanish education authorities were rolling out 500,000 desktops with the OS .
Hardy Heron also has improved support for multimedia , including photo editing , music sharing and video playback , he said .
The version has also been designed to make installation simpler and give users the chance to try the OS without making radical alterations to their current computer set - up .
" This is the first version that you can install under Windows .
" Instead of re-partitioning your hard drive and taking some fairly risky steps , effectively you can now install under Windows without modifying your system . "
Ubuntu can be installed on PC and Mac machines and is one of a number of versions of Linux .
Mr Shuttleworth said : " It 's a favourite version of Linux both for specialists and one that specialists would recommend to a cousin , aunt or uncle who want to have a stable desktop internet experience .
" There are other versions of Linux that are better for a particular purpose - but Ubuntu strives to be a general platform that is secure and self - maintained . "

The IRS Battles Homeland Security — America Wins
by Greg Perry by Greg Perry
DIGG THIS
Usually when two groups fight , Americans begin the ritual of rooting for their favorite teams .
Offices start friendly betting pools , kids paint their faces , and eBay sees brisk ticket sales .
In every case one set of fans goes home disillusioned , dejected , and despondent .
Not so here !
KLBJ Radio ran a story this week about Austin , Texas IRS Workers clashing with Homeland Security Police .
Oh if only they had sold tickets to that one !
Those of you who despise the IRS and those of you who despise Homeland Security — which basically means all Americans — would have paid the more than $ 4 per gallon to drive to that match , you know you would have .
The great thing about this Fiduciary Family Feud is that no matter who loses America wins !
The IRS loses , super !
Homeland Security gets clobbered , no problem .
What if both departments come away scathed ?
It ’s a tie , America wins , score one for the Gipper !
The Meaning of the Match
The clash began with Austin IRS employees who were represented by the Treasury Employees Union .
By the way have you noticed that you no longer make your checks out to the Internal Revenue Service ?
The IRS angered and destroyed so many livelihoods over its first 90 or so years that they felt a name change would keep you at bay just a little longer before you completely revolted .
That ’s why a few years ago they began requiring that you make your checks out to the much friendlier sounding Department of the Treasury .
It was the Treasury ’s union that began protesting Tuesday about unfair labor practices .
There are so many aspects of this story which are juicy that writing about it is like shooting fish in a barrel .
For example , one of their gripes is if they got stuck in traffic they were fined for being late .
Hello IRS employees !
Heard of April 15th ?
How about a compromise where your employers let you come to work late once in a while and every 3 or 4 years you let us get our taxes mailed a little late without interest and fines ?
The IRS employees say they have other gripes too .
Well , welcome to the club .
Homeland Secures the IRS
About ten minutes after the IRS employees began their protest Homeland Security Police arrived and ordered the protesters to leave .
Come on , you love this story , right ?
Where is the poor IRS workers ’ right to congregate and protest ?
Where is their freedom of speech ?
Oops ; those police have guns do n’t they ?
For years we ’ve been saying that the Second Amendment makes the First Amendment possible .
He who has the gun gets to keep his printing press and all that .
When it ’s only the police who have guns it ’s called a Police State .
The IRS workers faced a Police State this week .
They lost .
( You can see them lose by playing this video . )
It gets better — the IRS is told they must have a permit to be there !
Gee , sometimes regulations can stranglehold people just trying to survive ca n’t they Mr. and Mrs. IRS Worker ?
An IRS Worker is seen carrying a sign that reads , " Empower — Not Raw Power ! "
Not raw power ?
If there were a better definition of the Internal Revenue Service than " raw power " I am speechless to come up with one .
I ’ll leave the following for you to write your own funny cynicism : an IRS Worker is actually holding a sign that reads , " Support Family Values ! "
Here ’s an even easier one : " IRS Not Family Friendly " !
Could n’t you think of hundreds of reactions to seeing an actual IRS Worker carrying such a sign ?
A Solution to Our National Debt is Right In Front of Us
Let ’s make this an annual event .
Every May 27th , all across the nation , employees of the IRS and Homeland Security could meet in parking lots and have a rumble !
I bet Wal - Mart would let them use its parking lots and restrooms because we ’d buy our pop , beer , dogs , and chips there for the tailgate parties .
If they ’d sell tickets for the events there ’d be enough income to run our country and even all our wars which is nice because without all those IRS Workers at their collections desks there would n’t be a lot of taxpaying going on .
Even better , HBO could offer a cut of pay - per - view sales to pay down the national debt for the exclusive right to televise the events .

Aha !
Eureka !
Bingo !
" By George , I think she 's got it ! "
Everyone knows what it 's like to finally figure out a seemingly impossible problem .
But what on Earth is happening in the brain while we 're driving toward mental pay dirt ?
Researchers eager to find out have long been on the hunt , knowing that such information could one day provide priceless clues in uncovering and fixing faulty neural systems believed to be behind some mental illnesses and learning disabilities .
Researchers at Goldsmiths , University of London report in the journal PLoS ONE that they monitored action in the brains of 21 volunteers with electroencephalography ( EEG ) as they tackled verbal problems in an attempt to uncover what goes through the mind — literally — in order to observe what happens in the brain during an " aha ! " moment of problem solving .
" This insight is at the core of human intelligence … this is a key cognitive function that the human can boast to have , " says Joydeep Bhattacharya , an assistant professor in Goldsmiths 's psychology department .
" We 're interested [ in finding out ] whether — there is a sudden change that takes place or something that changes gradually [ that ] we 're not consciously aware of , " he says .
The researchers believed they could pin down brain signals that would enable them to predict whether a person could solve a particular problem or not .
In many cases , the subjects hit a wall , or what researchers refer to as a " mental impasse . "
If the participants arrived at this point , they could press a button for a clue to help them untangle a problem .
Bhattacharya says blocks correlated with strong gamma rhythms ( a pattern of brain wave activity associated with selective attention ) in the parietal cortex , a region in the upper rear of the brain that has been implicated in integrating information coming from the senses .
The research team noticed an interesting phenomenon taking place in the brains of participants given hints :
The clues were less likely to help if subjects had an especially high gamma rhythm pattern .
The reason , Bhattacharya speculates , is that these participants were , in essence , locked into an inflexible way of thinking and less able to free their minds , and thereby unable to restructure the problem before them .
" If there 's excessive attention , it somehow creates mental fixation , " he notes .
" Your brain is not in a receptive condition . "
At the end of each trial , subjects reported whether or not they had a strong " Aha ! " moment .
Interestingly , researchers found that subjects who were aware that they had found a new way to tackle the problem ( and so , had consciously restructured their thinking ) were less likely to feel as if they 'd had eureka moment compared to more clueless candidates .
" People experience the " Aha ! " feeling when they are not consciously monitoring what they are thinking , " Bhattacharya says , adding that the sentiment is more of an emotional experience he likens to relief .
" If you 're applying your conscious brain information processing ability , then you 're alpha . "
( Alpha brain rhythms are associated with a relaxed and open mind ; volunteers who unwittingly solved problems showed more robust alpha rhythms than those who knowingly adjusted their thinking to come up with the answer . )
He says the findings indicate that it 's better to tackle problems with an open mind than by concentrating too hard on them .
In the future , Bhattacharya says , his team will attempt to predict in real - time whether a stumped subject will be able to solve a vexing problem and , also , whether they can manipulate brain rhythms to aid in finding a solution .
The second probe into problem - solving focused on the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , a region in the front of the brain tied to functions such as decision making , conflict monitoring and reward feedback .
A team at the University of Lyon 's Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute in Bron , France reports in Neuron that it verified that the ACC helps detect errors during problem solving ( as previously discovered ) , but also that it does so by acting more as a general guide , monitoring and scoring the steps involved in problem solving , pointing out miscalculations as well as success .
The team discovered this by recording electrical activity in the brains of two male rhesus monkeys as they tried to determine which targets on a screen would result in a tasty drink of juice .
" When you 're trying to solve a problem , you need to search ; when you discover the solution , you need to stop searching , " says study co-author Emmanuel Procyk , coordinator of the Institute 's Department of Integrative Neurobiology .
" We need brain areas to do that . "
He says that researchers observed increased neuronal activity in the animals ' ACCs when they began searching .
When the monkeys hit the jackpot , there was still heightened activity in the ACC ( though only a selective population of nerve cells remained hopped up ) , indicating that the region is responsible for more than simply alerting the rest of the brain when errors are made .
Once the monkeys got the hang of it — and routinely pressed the correct target — ACC activity slowed .
" What we think based on this experiment and other experiments , " Procyk says , " is that this structure is very important in valuing things . "
It essentially scores each of the monkey 's behaviors as successful or not successful .
" It is an area , " he adds , " that will help to decide when to shift from the functioning that goes on when [ the brain is ] learning to when the learning [ is ] done . "
Procyk says that if this system is compromised , it could have implications for issues such as drug dependency .
If the ACC is functioning abnormally , he says , it could overvalue drugs , leading to addiction .
( Other studies have shown that an impaired cingulate cortex can result in maladaptive social behavior and disrupted cognitive abilities . )
Alas , the ultimate " Aha ! " moment for researchers probing problem solving is likely is far off , but at least the latest research may help them avoid an impasse .
This is one of the most mysterious places of Russian North .
Those stone idols attract tourists from all the Russia .
They stand alone on the wide plateau with no any stones or mountains around .
Who built them ?
What for ?
Those questions have no answers .

AUTHORS  CAVEAT :
This conference paper presents controversial evidence that is only part of a larger scholarly work on the subject .
Assertions and conclusions made here rely on contained as well as uncited evidence not currently archived for many scholars .
Eventually such data will be .
For obvious reasons of length this work - in - progress does not refer to all existing data in its endnotes .
Our purpose is to shed new light on a highly visible , late twentieth century counter social movement with ostensibly humanitarian intentions , to extend sociological / historical understanding of the cult - anticult controversy that has preoccupied the attention of many scholars , and to encourage criminologists  further interest in matters usually taken up by sociologists of religion .
The second two levels are known in sociology as types of elite deviance [ 3 ] , and that constitutes the thrust of our argument : CAN was a corporate criminal scheme involving ( at times in its referred deprogrammings ) illegal drug usage , conspiring to violate civil liberties , and sexual assault / harassment in the name of " counseling . "
In this paper we do not rehash the Scott case , which was entangled in legal minutiae and appeals , nor do we chronicle the last days of CAN as it struggled frantically with a bankruptcy court to prevent its records and files from becoming public [ see Document 4 ] .
Instead , based primarily on the latter sources we present new evidence that CAN indeed illustrated the three levels of malfeasance recognized by criminologists :
Finally , the court notes each of the defendants  seeming incapability of appreciating the maliciousness of their conduct towards Mr. Scott .
Rather , throughout the entire course of this litigation , they have attempted to portray themselves as victims of Mr. Scotts counsels alleged agenda .
Thus , the large award given by the jury against both CAN and Mr. Ross seems reasonably necessary to enforce the jurys determination on the oppressiveness of the defendants  actions and deter similar conduct in the future . [ 2 ]
In a curt note to the defendants who tried to appeal the verdict [ Document 3 ] , including self - proclaimed Bible - based " cult expert " Rick Ross , who had thoroughly botched the Jason Scott deprogramming , United States District Judge John C. Coughenour concluded :
The jury was quite clear in its decision [ see Document 2 ] to award compensatory and punitive damages to Scott . [ 1 ] CANs primary activity , this case and others have revealed , was to provide false and / or inflammatory opinion in the guise of " information " about minority religions to the media and other inquires .
All or virtually all such " information " was derogatory , consistent with CANs goals of " educating " the public that various new religious movements ( NRMs ) are " destructive cults , " that all of the members thereof are " cult victims , " are " brainwashed , " and are therefore at risk , possibly needing " rescue . "
The jurys decision , under the definitions provided in Washington law , was that CAN was truly an organized hate campaign .
CAN described its activities in a euphemistic manner to make its activities seem less outrageous from a civil liberties perspective .
The reason CAN ever became involved in the Scott lawsuit was that , consistent with its organizational pattern , it served as a conduit for referrals to coercive deprogrammers ( later termed by CAN " exit counselors " ) who would , for a fee , abduct and during detention harangue family members into religious apostasy .
On October 23 , 1996 at 9:30 AM the Cult Awareness Network ( CAN ) , a Chicago - based national anticult organization claiming to be purely a tax - exempt informational clearinghouse on new religions , closed its doors amid bankruptcy proceedings and its assets were auctioned off [ see Document 1 : Sale of CAN name ] .
The precipitating , but not lone , event that hastened its demise was a civil suit brought against both CAN and a trio of coercive deprogrammers who unsuccessfully tried to remove a legal adult , Mr. Jason Scott , from a United Pentecostal congregation .
Scott was violently abducted , physically abused , and forcibly detained at a remote Washington State location for almost a week .
While CAN was meanwhile suffering many other lawsuits for alleged deprivation of the civil rights of members of minority religions , the Scott case became its Waterloo .
These are the sources of the generalizations presented here , with select endnotes following our text .
A more extensive analysis is underway and is planned for publication [ 5 ] . ( See Appendix D )
One of us ( Darnell ) manages a multimillion dollar credit union and has the necessary acumen to decipher organizational financial records ( ledgers , disbursements , audits , etc. ) .
This expertise became important when in the late 1990s we obtained , following a purchase from CANs bankruptcy trustee [ see Document 5 ] , access to approximately 400 boxes of records once owned by CAN .
Of these , 32 boxes include CANs financial records , from canceled checks to deposit slips to internal and external audits .
While we have substantial evidence that some records were deliberately destroyed before the court seized the documents , enough remain to point to financial irregularities in CAN [ see also Document 6 : Samples of redacted Board minutes ] .
One of us ( Shupe ) has followed the anticult movement ( ACM ) since the mid-1970s ( its literature , its leadership , its various organizational structures ) , backtracked through interviews and documents to its inception and founders in the early 1970s , and monitored its development both in the United States and abroad .
He has analyzed the ACM repeatedly during the past quarter century and even solicited self - analyses of their participation by ACM activists . [ 4 ]
So it was for CAN until its bankruptcy in 1996 .
CAN was a literal offshoot of the earlier tax - exempt Citizens Freedom Foundation - Information Services [ see Document 8 ] , itself another development from the even earlier Citizens Freedom Foundation ( CFF ) which was at one time the nations largest ACM group .
CAN proclaimed itself to be an informational clearing house for facts about NRMs .
At the same time it was aggressive in promoting a " mind control " model of NRM membership though its representatives ( at least publicly ) righteously denied any involvement in coercive deprogrammings .
In the remainder of this paper we turn to evidence ( in admittedly abbreviated conference paper form ) suggesting a rather different evaluation of CANs operations and purposes .
... the hate movement in the United States has taken on a new , modern face .
The strength of the contemporary hate movement is grounded in its ability to repackage its message in ways that make it more palatable , and in its ability to exploit the points of intersection between itself and prevailing ideological canons .
In short , the hate movement is attempting to move itself into the mainstream of United States culture and politics . [ 10 ]
The extent to which either CAN or its " sister " social movement organization , the American Family Foundation , have been " hate groups " as defined either by Washington state law or by the racial / ethnic criteria in sociology is open to debate . [ 9 ] [ see also Document 7 : sample of CANs literature ] ( AFF began in the late 1970s as a local chapter of CAN . )
Certainly both ACM groups have presented slanted , stereotypical images and language that has inflamed persons to perform extreme actions .
Certainly also both CAN and AFF have at least promoted a professional veneer which , at the popular level , appears more scientific than hateful .
This apparent " normalization " of their ire against NRMs is a modern trend for hate groups , according to one author :
Elsewhere one of us has presented a detailed historical / organizational analysis of the ACM up to the end of the 1970s . [ 6 ]
The chronicle is basically one of regional grassroots " mom- and - pop " groups  struggles to ( 1 ) acquire sufficient financial stability to allow them to spread their message of " destructive cults " subverting American society , ( 2 ) maintain a shifting membership base together long enough to lobby , publicize , and mobilize opposition to NRMs , and ( 3 ) establish a national unified organizational prominence with political clout .
There were a number of false ( i.e. , unsuccessful ) starts , but by the mid-1980s there were two prominent national - level groups -- the Cult Awareness Network and the American Family Foundation . [ 7 ]
In the beginning ( i.e. , the early 1970s ) most ACM groups  membership consisted of senior family members distraught at their offsprings / junior relatives  deviant religious choices .
Over time , however , the mantle of ACM activism and leadership passed to degreed behavioral science moral entrepreneurs who made ACM involvement an important , and sometimes lucrative , part of their careers . [ 8 ]
Finally , like Vaughn , Sweeney quit CFF in disgust .
Recalling the circumstances of his resignation , he made mention of another disturbing pattern in CFF - endorsed activities : " Many deprogrammers had sex with their victims and used drugs during the deprogrammings . " [ 20 ] ( More on these actions later . )
On the surface CFF is not involved in deprogramming .
Yet if you eliminated every CFF member who had been involved in deprogramming or rehab or rescue work you and I would be the only CFF members left . "
Sweeney once had a plan to ride herd on the deprogrammers  worst excesses and simultaneously gain legitimacy for the practice .
He wanted to establish an accredited deprogramming facility accepted in both legal and medical worlds , " a facility so renowned that no judge would hesitate issuing an order to have a cultist remanded to that center for a number of weeks .
... At least we would make deprogramming and rehab so legitimate that Blue Cross would pick up the bulk of the tab . " [ 19 ] Jokingly , he wrote in a letter to a CFF friend named Allan ( n.d. ) :
We have to continue to stress pre-education as the best antidote to destructive cults .
We can not get in bed with the deprogrammers UNLESS we control the actions of these deprogrammers . [ 18 ]
That problem continued .
Sweeney was dissuaded by CFFs lawyer ( who must have had some idea of how rapaciously some deprogrammers were behaving ) from pursuing an ethical code of behavior for deprogrammers .
Sweeney got no further on this count that did Vaughn several years later .
The CFF board also rejected the idea .
However , Sweeney reports he was greatly disturbed by what he styled ( his words ) " Quick Pay " methods and maintained that CFF " should not support the money grabbing , amateur kooks that claim to want to help parents but end up ripping them off for thousands of dollars . " [ 17 ]
Scarcely a week goes by without some parent calling and complaining about a deprogrammer .
They did not counsel .
They did not show up .
They overcharged .
etc. etc. etc. CFF -IS is an educational foundation .
We try to help parents and still educate the public .
Deprogramming is not one of our services .
Yet we all realize that we are involved in this area of great concern to our members .
So like it or not , a problem with deprogramming is a CFF - IS problem . [ 16 ] [ see Document 14 ]
In fact , as early as 1980 CFF - IS was troubled internally by its relationship to deprogrammers .
Wrote former executive director John Sweeney to several ACM activists :
After serving a year and a half of his two - year term on CFFs board , Vaughn resigned in frustration : " I concluded that anyone who went against the inner clique agreements within CAN would be shunned or ostracized . " [ 15 ]
Vaughn persisted in raising such issues , was warned by a CFF - CAN member that his membership on the board was really a " set up " ( his words ) , and was advised by this person : " After several discussions , she warned me that my life could be in danger if I continued to pursue my investigations into the activities of the board . " [ 14 ]
This warning was given to him twice .
I recall that on several occasions at our annual conferences , would see persons who I knew were active involuntary deprogrammers meeting in small groups with other board members and affiliates .
These meetings usually took place during the breaks at the conferences , and were often held at a corner table in the lounge at whatever hotel were using .
It appeared to me that these activities were deprogrammings of some type being planned .
I concluded that the rest of the board members chose to ignore this activity , or pretend that it wasnt happening , because it was a legally and ethically sensitive issue . [ 13 ]
Vaughn also observed the familiarity with which known coercive deprogrammers " made the rounds " of CFF - CAN conventions , speaking and advertising their services :
At the July 16 - 17 , 1984 New York City board meeting , I got the subject of ethics in counseling put on the agenda .
Although I was not fully appraised of CFF - CANs activities , I had heard and seen enough to realize that CFF - CAN was connected to involuntary deprogrammers , and that this issue need to be dealt with .
I began the discussion by talking about deprogrammers who were taking large amounts of money from the families of cult members , and using violent methods to accomplish the deprogrammings .
I told the board that I felt this was very wrong and that we needed to do something about it .
After I completed my comments , only I --- H ---- made a comment that supported my position .
The rest of the board remained silent .
I was aware of deprogrammings , both voluntary and involuntary , that were taking place across the country .
I knew the other board members were also aware of these matters .
As far as I was aware , there were never any " official " discussions about these issues at prior board meetings .
This upset me greatly , and I felt it was a further indicator that there were things going on within the board that I did not know of . [ 12 ]
Vaughn found his fellow board members turned deaf ears to his unease , and he began to feel cut off from the decisions made by the organizational leadership .
He was disturbed by CFFs apparent right - wing partisanship and the casual , even irresponsible spending of scarce monies .
He also made the board itself uneasy [ see Document 13 ] when he brought up the subject of some sort of ethical rein to hold deprogrammers accountable :
I was involved in many discussions with other board members about the name change [ to CAN ] .
I believe the general consensus of the board was to change the name to avoid negative references to the organization caused by the arrest of deprogrammers , such as Ted Patrick .
Patrick had been affiliated with CFF since it was first started . [ 11 ]
Kent E. Vaughn , a member of the CFF board of directors from 1983 - 84 and certainly no " cult apologist " ( having two adult daughters involved with The Way International ) , recalls gaining a definite sense that CFF ( shortly before it became CAN in the mid-1980s ) had a Janus - like public persona very different from its real operations [ see Document 13 ] .
He was made particularly uneasy by deprogrammers  regular contact with CFF officers :
CFF and CFF - IS had close but at times ambivalent relations to deprogrammers .
Early CFF brochures [ see Document 12 ] admired the coercive practice as a necessary , even heroic evil and endorsed it : later CFF and CAN disassociated the organizations from deprogramming at least on paper .
Both groups , however , served as conduits for referrals to deprogrammers .
It is worth examining several pieces of information on CANs predecessor , CFF , and the brief period of CFFs transition into CAN since any changes made were plainly cosmetic and , more importantly , CAN continued CFF corporate crime policy of facilitating and even encouraging street crime ( coercive deprogrammings ) .
Examples of deprogramming , some given national attention and others more local , are legion .
We certainly do not have the space here to provide legal , media , and anecdotal - narrative data on even a modest fraction of such cases .
However , to give readers a flavor of several well known cases , we provide a sampler of six deprogrammings in Appendix A .
Deprogramming ( referring to the pseudo - therapy in which the member of an unpopular or controversial religion is abducted , involuntarily detained , and repeatedly demeaned / harangued / harassed / threatened by individuals , usually paid by that persons family , until that person recants the faith system ) has become a term in popular culture .
Recently , given the unsavory reputations of many deprogrammers [ see Document 9 ; see also Document 10 on Ted Patricks criminal conviction , and Document 11 on Rick Ross and his criminal convictions ] , they have adopted new euphemisms for their roles , such as " interventionists " and " exit counselors . "
Unfortunately these terms muddy the water .
Such terms may legitimately apply to voluntary discussions among NRM members and their families guided by a trained counselor or simply become a linguistic dodge used by coercive deprogrammers .
But the presupposition is still there in the new terminology : the purpose of the activity is to " exit " members from their associations in non-approved religions and which affiliations call for intervention , exit , or deprogramming , not tolerance or acceptance .
The remainder of this paper examines several areas of CAN practice and policies , based on testimonies of its own operatives as well as other sources , to support the contention that CAN regularly and knowingly participated in criminal activities .
Regular Referrals of Inquiries to Coercive Deprogrammers
Much has been made in depositions and court appearances by CAN officials that the organization in no way promoted coercive deprogrammings .
Pious denials and rather apparent dodging of the issue seem to have been the standard strategy when confronted under oath by attorneys suspecting otherwise .
Consider , for example , the circumlocution provided by Cynthia Kisser , last executive director of CAN , in a 1994 deposition while being questioned :
Q. Have you , in the context of your work for CAN , havent you met with and worked with persons that were convicted of crimes ?
A. Not that I recall , no .
Q.Rick Ross ?
[ Ross is a convicted jewel thief and violent deprogrammer . ]
A.I never met him in my capacity as any kind of a CAN person .
Q. Youve never talked to Rick Ross in your capacity as Executive Director of CAN ?
A.I have talked to him as opposed to meet with him in my function as a CAN official .
There is a major difference here in the shading of the words which ---
Q.? Well ---?
A.--- which I detect in your question , counselor .
Q.No , there is nt a major difference .
The major difference is a semantic attempt to evade answering the question .
Mr. Beal [ Kissers attorney ] : Mr. Moxon , if you will ask straightforward and simple questions --- Mr. Moxon :
What I want is for her to give a straightforward and simple answer .
What s happening here is gross evasion .
Mr. Beal :
That s absolutely untrue .
Mr. Moxon :
What were going to do is seek our costs and fees from this waste of time and destruction of the courts time .
The witness has been doing it throughout this deposition .
[ The deposition continued after attorneys  discussion . ]
Mr. Beal :
Be our guest .
Q.Have you ever communicated with Rick Ross in the context of your position as the Executive Director of CAN ?
A : Yes , I have communicated with Mr. Rick Ross in my capacity as a CAN employee , yes .
Q. What other persons who have been convicted of crimes have you communicated with in the context of your position at CAN
[ Kisser then continued to meander around such questions but finally and grudgingly admitted she had communicated with ex-con Rick Ross and Galen Kelly ( a private investigator - turned coercive deprogrammer ) and that they had been frequent attenders at annual CAN conventions . ]
Q. Are you saying you never associated with persons who have been convicted of crimes ?
A.Taken " association " in the broadest term , no that is not what I am saying .
The broadest possible construction of it , yes .
I m quite sure that I have .
Q. You have done so in your role as Executive Director of CAN , right ?
[ The attorney then went on to read to Kisser a Whos Who list of coercive deprogrammers and she responded affirmatively to having dealt with each of them , such as Mark Blocksom , Newbold Smith , Donald Moore , Robert Points , Rick Ross , Galen Kelly , Joe Szimhart , Mary Alice Chrnalogar , Robert Brandyberry , Jerry Flanagan , Joey DeSanctis , and Cliff Daniels . ] [ 21 ] [ see Document 15 ]
Kissers reticence in acknowledging that CAN served as an active referral agency for professional deprogrammers is perhaps not surprising but certainly disingenuous .
For example , in deprogrammer Rick Rosss own self - promoting resume [ Document 16 ] mailed out to various prospective client sources , Ross offers a blurb of praise from her as follows :
He is very knowledgeable about cults .
His name is among the half dozen best deprogrammers in the country . [ 22 ]
Consider another example of defining away the coercion of deprogramming and denial under oath by Priscilla Coates , former executive director of the Citizens Freedom Foundation and former head of the Cult Awareness Network , Los Angeles affiliate :
Q. What is involuntary deprogramming as you understand it ?
A.To the best of my understanding , when the family decides that there is no other way to talk to the person but by keeping them at a location until they have heard the correct information about the group .
Q. Through the use of force ?
A.No .
Q.How do you keep someone against their will without force ?
A. You lock the door . [ 23 ]
Below are other representative data on a CAN - deprogramming connection :
Rick Ross , writing to Priscilla Coates in 1988 [ Document 17/18 ] , referred to deprogramming referrals from CAN helping to underwrite the costs of writing a book .
He estimated that it was necessary for him to complete about two more exit counseling cases that year to support his project .
He said a couple of cases right then would be helpful .
He asked if she knew of anything .
He remarked that Cynthia Kisser in Chicago had given him a couple of referrals but they did not come through .
They were just ambivalent families who really couldnt make up their minds , he said in disgust . [ 24 ]
A private investigator who interviewed deprogrammer Robert Brandyberry by telephone reports :
Brandyberry admitted he was a former " deprogrammer " who had worked very closely as a deprogrammer with the Cult Awareness Network ( CAN ) between 1980 and 1989 .
Brandyberry stated that during this time , he also provided CAN with educational materials , gave lectures at CAN meetings , and volunteered his time for CAN related projects .
Brandyberry stated that he deprogrammed approximately five hundred persons between 1980 and 1989 .
Of these deprogrammings he conducted approximately one hundred fifty illegally .
Specifically , Brandyberry stated that it was necessary for him to kidnap and falsely imprison these deprogramming victims during their " involuntary deprogrammings . "
Brandyberry also stated that of these approximately one hundred fifty kidnappings and false imprisonments , CAN officials had directly referred him to about seventy - five to eight - five percent of the persons who had paid him money to conduct these illegal deprogrammings .
Brandyberry stated that CANs referral policy for illegal deprogramming was very common knowledge by the employees in the national offices of the Cult Awareness Network during the entire time he was a deprogrammer . [ 25 ] [ see Document 19 ]
Dr. Lowell D. Streiker , an author and counselor with a PhD. in religion from Princeton University , is the founder and former director of the Freedom Counseling Center in Burlingame , California .
The FCC is a non-profit organization that counsels families with members in non-traditional religions .
Dr. Streiker is no knee - jerk " cult apologist " nor is he an " anti-cult apologist . "
He is , however , familiar with the CAN - deprogramming connection :
In my years as a counselor , I have become well acquainted with the so - called " anti-cult " network , which is a loose - knit confederation of parents  groups , deprogrammers , dissatisfied former group members , cult - concerned mental health professionals , attorneys , and evangelical religious propagandists .
A major element in the anti-cult network is the " Cult Awareness Network " ( C.A.N. ) ...
The official policy of the national CAN on deprogramming states that CAN is opposed to kidnapping .
Yet CAN executive directors and presidents have regularly referred numbers of the public to individuals known as " deprogrammers . " ... As a counselor of families disturbed by so - called cults and an opponent of forcible deprogrammings , I could estimate that eighty percent of all deprogrammings that have been reported to me were set up by CAN national headquarters , or its chapters .
Approximately two - thirds of those actively involved in CAN are vehemently in favor of coercive deprogramming and most of them have used the services of such big name deprogrammers as Ted Patrick , Joe Alexander , Jr. , Galen Kelly , Cliff Daniels , Mark Blocksom , and Joe Szimhart .
In his sworn statement [ Document 20 ]
Streiker provides a number of examples of CAN - arranged deprogrammings of which he is personally aware .
His conclusion :
Ive become very disgusted with CAN , having personally had to clean up the wreckage that was left by their deprogrammers which went sour over the years .
Seven highly distraught and depressed deprogramming victims have [ even ] been referred to me by various CAN members . [ 26 ]
In a sworn statement [ Document 21 ] retired deprogrammer Mark Blocksom affirmed :
I became very active in my deprogramming activities during the early 1980s .
The standard method by which referrals for involuntary deprogramming was via phone calls to the " good old boy " network ( CFF , and later , CAN members or affiliates ) , who would then refer the called to a non-CFF / non - CAN person ( usually a family member of a prior successful case ) , who would then call me and arrange the deprogramming .
This " cut out " system was created to insulate CFF / CAN from legal liabilities .
It was an " unwritten " guideline that the deprogrammers did not ever directly affiliate themselves with CFF or CAN for reason of legal repercussions if a deprogramming failed / or received some bad press coverage .
... On at least two occasions , I used the farm house of Priscilla Coates in upstate New York as a safe house to complete the deprogramming .
At this time , Coates was the Executive Director of CFF / CAN . ... Cynthia Kisser , who is now the national director of CAN , assisted me on at least 2 kidnapping type deprogrammings involving members of The Way International .
Both Kisser and Coates were involved in giving me referrals for involuntary deprogrammings prior to the actual formation of CAN , while the organization was still more " loose - knit , " operating as CFF .
They were both in my opinion fully aware that the parents they sent to me as referrals were planning to have their children / family member kidnapped or unlawfully detained .
Many of us in the deprogramming field would frequently attend the CFF / CAN conferences and conventions , both regional and national .
At these conventions we would speak to parents and other attendees , for the purpose of soliciting deprogramming business , or at least making our availability known in anti-cult circles .
Many of us involved in deprogramming were actually guest speakers , or served on discussion panels where deprogramming was discussed .
I was a speaker on " exit counseling " at the 1985 CAN convention .
This was a play on words , as it was well known that most of my deprogrammings were involuntary .
Kisser never took any actions to dissuade me from continuing kidnapping type deprogrammings .
She was aware that I specialized in that type of deprogramming , and it was tacitly understood that if she referred a case to me , that a kidnapping could , and probably would occur .
I believe that CAN maintained a referral list of deprogrammers , and I was on the list . [ 27 ]
Even Joe Szimhart , a prolific coercive deprogrammer in the 1990s , who once described himself at a national sociological meeting as merely a part time counselor and artist , publicly admitted that most of the several dozen deprogrammings he had performed were the result of CAN referrals . [ 28 ]
Finally , as one more piece of evidence illustrating the CAN deprogramming referral connection , Marty Butz , a staff member at CAN during the early 1990s , under oath estimated he had personally made approximately 400 - 500 deprogramming referrals for persons who called CAN [ see Document 22 ] .
And he referred one NRM member who called CAN pretending to be ignorant of a given NRM but inquiring about it to a woman who said she could provide a list of deprogrammers ( including the " classic rescuers " : Joe Szimhart , Dave Clark , Randall Burkey , Steve Hassan , Rick Ross , and Carol Giambalvo ) and their expected fees ( $ 2,000 - $ 10,000 ) [ 29 ]
In short , based on a triangulation of sources there is little room for conjecture that deprogramming referrals were part of regular CAN policy , and , since many of these abductions were patently illegal and potentially harmful , CAN was therefore a hub of street crime involvement .
Indiscriminate Labeling / Publicizing NRMs and Other Groups as Destructive Cults
It is now known that when Kathy Tonkin , mother of three United Pentecostal sons for whom she sought deprogrammings , contacted CAN ( see Case 6 , Appendix A ) [ see Document 23 ] , neither the ultimate chief deprogrammer ( " Bible - based expert " ) Rick Ross nor anyone at CAN had ever heard of the Tabernacle Life Church .
This turned out to be a matter of irrelevance since CAN cast an enormously wide net to monitor possible " cults " and in entrepreneurial fashion assumed most groups inquired about were ones justifying " interventions " for families .
The array of alleged " cults " expanded exponentially as the ACM and CAN continued into the 1990s .
J. Gordon Melton , director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion , estimates that while the ACM was mostly concerned with about fifteen NRM -- and of those , only five consistently over the year -- as many as 75 to 100 received some attention . [ 30 ]
In fact , the array demonstrated an increasing inclusiveness over the years .
As deprogrammed ex-Unificationist Gary M. Scharf told two journalists in a post - Jonestown interview , trying to draw an analogy between the Unification Church and the Peoples Temple for suicide potential : " Whenever you re dealing with religious categories like resurrection and birth , you begin to blur categories between life and death . " [ 31 ]
Such reasoning expanded considerably the number of groups of which to keep track .
It bred distrust and guaranteed a growth industry of anticultists in the American religious marketplace .
Traditional groups , such as the Christian Scientists and Mormons , over which evangelical counter - cult watchers had fretted for years , were of course invited to sit at the secular anticultists  table of lists .
So were variations of the Buddhist , Islamic , and Hindu world religions .
The game of identifying cults took on the nature of a binge , and at times ranged from the silly to the absurd .
Momentum only increased from the 1970s into the 1990s .
For example , taking his own home - spun wisdom to heart ( i.e. , " The Bible will drive you crazy if you take it literally " ) , deprogrammer Ted Patrick went on in a free - wheeling Playboy interview [ see Document 24 ] to claim that evangelist Ruth Carter Stapleton , president Jimmy Carters sister , was " one of the biggest cult leaders in the nation , " albeit a " good cult leader . "
The Rev. Billy Graham was thrown in for good measure . [ 32 ]
The net kept widening .
Observed two sociologists : " At the end of the decade of the 1970s there were even indications that the ACM might take on television evangelists as well . " [ 33 ]
Then came an alleged satanic underground network , and even quasi- religious corporations , such as Amway and Mary Kay , were accused of exhibiting cultic tendencies . [ 34 ]
There seemed to have been an unspoken agreement among ACM participants , exemplified by CAN , to wit : " Ill consider your group a cult if youll do the same for mine . "
Deprogrammers  parallel understanding seemed to be : " Any group referred to us , or disturbing to someone , requires intervention . "
The result was an open season on not just NRMs but on any organization that smacked of enthusiastically accepted discipline , self - mastery , self - improvement , self - refection , and deeply held spiritual beliefs .
But the net widened still .
By the mid-1990s , the high point of CAN , files were kept on a total of 1505 groups : from Amway , the Amish , and the Anti-Reformation League ; to chiropractic , Roman Catholics , and Campus Crusade for Christ ; from the makers of the board game Dungeons and Dragons to the Democratic Workers Party ; to the First Baptist Church of Hammond , Indiana ( Americas largest Protestant congregation ) and the Full Gospel Business Mens Fellowship International to the San Francisco rock band The Grateful Dead ; on to the Inter - Varsity Christian Fellowship and the International Workers Party ; to Klanwatch , the Ku Klux Klan , Lutherans , Mormons , Shirley MacLaine and the National Association of Evangelicals ; on to the Oklahoma City bombings and Opus Dei ; then to the Order of the Solar Temple , Protestants , Peoples Temple , Promise Keepers , and Jim / Tammy Faye Bakkers  PTL Club ; to the Rockford Institute , the Rutherford Institute , and the Rajneeshees ; to Soka Gakkai , Scientology , and Santeria ; to Teen magazine , Transcendental Meditation , and the charismatic Toronto Blessing ; to Urantia and the United Pentecostal Church ; from the Worldwide Church of God and the Wycliffe Bible Society to Women Aglow and Youth for Christ .
( See Appendix B. ) [ See also Document 25 ]
If , as religious historian Philip Jenkins argues eloquently in Mystics and Messiahs .
" Extreme and bizarre religious ideas are so commonplace in American history that it is difficult to speak of them as fringe at all , " and that the existence of NRMs is a " persistent theme of American religion , " then CAN was oblivious to this fact . [ 35 ]
In reality , CAN was informed by few if any knowledgeable historical , sociological , theological , or psychological experts
Slanted information on NRMs was CAN dissemination policy .
Several deposed testimonies from CAN leaders illustrate this tendency .
For example , CAN employee Marty Butz revealed :
A.People do contact CAN with their concerns .
Q. And you give them derogatory information about cults , correct ?
A.I dont think " derogatory " is a fair term .
Q. Well , is nt it a CAN practice to only give derogatory information and not positive information about groups that you consider to be cults ?
A.We give a lot of information thats responsive to the concerns of the individuals .
Q. Well , see , that doesnt answer my question .
My question is : Isnt it a CAN policy to give derogatory information and specifically not to give positive information about groups that CAN deems cults ?
A. Our focus deals with the critical or controversial aspects of these organizations that people have concerns about .
Q. Well , you never provide positive information .
You dont ever seek out positive information to give people about groups you consider to be cults .
[ Butz admitted this was true after some verbal meandering . ] [ 36 ] [ see Document 26 ]
CANs Cynthia Kisser ( in tortuous prose ) [ see Document 27 ] admitted that CANs policy was to never disseminate information in requested mailed packets about any NRM that could be considered non-threatening or non-destructive :
It s a general policy for any packet , not necessarily just [ on ]
Scientology ... that the information in the packet is information other than that which is provided by the groups [ themselves ] , since that information presumably is readily available to anybody from the group itself .
And so the purpose of this is to provide information thats in the public domain but not already published by the group , you know . [ 37 ]
Kissers and CANs approach in defining " cults " was laissez - faire , which is to say that they let any inquiries from distraught / worried family members define what was a " destructive cult , " broadening their definitional umbrella .
There was no hesitation about establishing " balance " in CAN information , even if the standards seem inconsistent in the same breath , according to the former President of CANs Board of Directors :
Most of the information that we receive about groups - actually if we do receive information that has positive information about that group , as well as negative , we dont try to withhold the positive information ...
But we dont endeavor to balance the positive with the negative ...
I think that our purpose is to collect information that s been written about an organization .
There is plenty of --- as counsel said , theres plenty of positive information that usually people have seen on the organization .
They havent had access to a balanced view of it .
And its our job to provide information that gives [ a ] more critical view of the group . [ 38 ] [ see Document 28 ]
CANs indiscriminate approach to defining and acting against NRMs can be illustrated twice .
We provide anecdotal evidence of the rather cavalier attempts to identify " destructive cults " and / or their practices .
First , in a deposition by CANs executive director Cynthia Kisser in which she attempts to deal with the implications of an inclusive definition of cult :
Q. What s your definition of cult ?
A.Just of a cult ?
Q.Yes .
A.It s -- a cult is an organization -- an organization can be large or small ; size is not the determinant -- that has expressive devotion to a leader , principle or idea .
Q.Is the Catholic Church a cult ?
A.Under that broad definition , yes .
Q.Is the Democratic Party a cult ?
A.Under this definition of cult above , yes . [ 39 ] [ see Document 29 ]
Second , in an unpublished manuscript draft deprogrammer Rick Ross interprets charismatic glossolalia as an alleged link to " mind control " :
It seems obvious that the " gift " of tongues is a facet of fundamentalist mind control .
It is dehabilitating [ sic there is no such word . ] and have [ sic ] severe side effects .
Disassociative behavior and premature senility have become repeated symptoms . [ 40 ]
The most interesting aspect of Ross interpretation is that he has little clue as to the difference between a fundamentalist Christian and a charismatic Christian .
Likewise , Cynthia Kisser agreed about glossolalia in analyzing the Christian sect called The Way International : " The Ways practice of speaking in tongues " is " classic hypnosis . " [ 41 ]
But then these sorts of confusions and misunderstandings were mere nuances of little import to deprogrammers and ultimately to CAN .
Use of Sexual Abuse and Illegal Drugs by Deprogrammers During " Rescues "
Coercive deprogrammers  use of illegal drugs and sexual tactics involved during their confinement of adult citizens has never been discussed in the mainline social science literature on the ACM . [ 42 ]
If anything , the notorious Riethmuller deprogramming - sexual assault case ( Appendix A , Case No. 2 ) [ 43 ] has been seen as an anomaly .
By several sources of evidence , however , including both notarized anecdotes and depositional material , we maintain that sexual deviance and drug use were an ancillary , but not infrequent , accompaniment of numerous coercive deprogrammings .
Previously in this paper we cited former CFF executive director John Sweeney as complaining about non-accountable , free - wheeling deprogrammers : " Many deprogrammers had sex with their victims and used drugs during the deprogrammings . "
Focusing on an illustrative ( but admittedly truncated ) set of cases here ( an expanded set to be presented elsewhere see endnote No. 7 ) , we find empirical support for a similar pattern of abuse continuing from CFF into the CAN organization and tolerance of it at the highest echelons .
Drug use here means consumption / ingestion during the course of a coercive deprogramming of illegal substances ( ex. , cocaine ) and alcohol .
Sexual tactics refer to two types : ( 1 ) forced sexual intercourse , or rape ( of men and women ) ; and ( 2 ) sexual demeaning or intimidation of a person or refusal to permit reasonable hygienic care .
Since sometimes the drug use and sexual abuse occurred together , we make no attempt to separate them out in the following illustrative testimonies :
Jennifer Jacobs swore in a legal declaration [ see Document 30 ] that in 1987 at the start of her deprogramming she was unwillfully abducted by three men who " smelled of sweat and alcohol . "
During her eleven - day confinement she relates how
throughout the time of my captivity [ former deprogrammer Mark ]
Blocksom and the other security guards used cocaine heavily .
The cocaine made Blocksom become enraged and violent .
More than once , the other men had to physically restrain him to keep him from beating me up .
[ Deprogrammer Joe ]
Szimhart saw them using cocaine but did not appear to object . [ 44 ]
Forbidding privacy for personal hygienic and elimination needs appears to have been standard deprogramming practices for many men and women :
In Appendix A , Case No. 3 [ see also Document 31 ] , Karen Lever testified under oath that during eight days  confinement she decided to refuse to take a shower because she was not allowed privacy from the continuous stares of her male abductors .
Jason Scott ( Appendix A , Case No. 6 ) appears to have been deliberately fed poor , greasy food that caused him to develop stomach cramps and diarrhea , but two of the male deprogrammers insisted on accompanying him each time to the nailed - open bathroom [ see Document 32 ] .
This humiliating violation of privacy is often encountered in deprogramming survivor accounts .
Arthur Roselle , a former member of the Unification Church and now a respected member of the banking industry , told in a sworn declaration of his treatment by deprogrammer Steve Hassan :
During the first three days , I was always escorted to the bathroom while my hands were still bound and tied .
I was not washed or shaved .
With help I was able to urinate in a pot .
Due to the embarrassment of being watched at all times , I did not allow myself to defecate . [ 45 ] [ see Document 33 ]
Another of deprogrammer - turned - " exit counselor " Steve Hassans " clients " was Claire Kelley , who was confined to one room in a New Hampshire log cabin for three days .
A guard was placed outside the bedroom door to prevent her escape , and a guard inside the room at all times escorted her to the bathroom . [ 46 ] [ see Document 34 ]
During the five - day abortive coercive deprogramming of Henry Kuegel , a member of the Church Universal and Triumphant , deprogrammers Mary Alice Chrnalogar , Galen Kelly , and Rory Ingalls ( among others present ) displayed the usual " commode insensitivity " and mocked Kuegels sexuality :
Food didnt sit well .
One of the guards followed me to the open air bathroom ...
Once [ his girlfriend ] and Rory came down [ to the basement where he was kept ] and decided to mock my churchs belief in celibacy before marriage .
Rubbing the girlfriends arm , Rory contemptuously declared , " In the Church , you men dont have genitals ! " [ 47 ] [ see Document 35 ]
An admittedly gross but illustrative example of demeaning sexual callousness that can only be labeled deliberately harassing occurred in the deprogramming fiasco involving Debra Dobkowski [ see Document 36 ] .
Succinctly described : in 1992 former Loudin County ( VA ) sheriffs deputy Daniel L. Moore , Phil and Michele Bruschansky , and private investigator Galen Kelly were hired by Washington , DC .
resident Beth Bruckerts parents to abduct and deprogram her because she was allegedly a member of the apocalyptic , eastern mystic Circle of Friends cult . [ 48 ]
However , they abducted the wrong woman , Bruckerts roomate Debra Dobkowski .
Dobkowski recalls :
As the two men walked towards me [ in a parking lot outside her place of employment late at night ] , the stocky one started to talk as if to ask me a question .
I immediately went to slam the hatch to the car and run to get in the car .
... They both grabbed me and threw me to the hood of the car .
The taller one had hold of my legs , which he spread wide apart , at this point I thought I was going to be raped .
I felt his crouch [ sic ] up against mine .
... I had been thrown into the van , through a side sliding door .
In addition to the two men , there were two women in the van .
... I screamed not to touch me , let me sit myself , to get hands off me . [ 49 ]
There were the usual promises of gentle treatment in exchange for cooperation :
[ During the drive to Bruckerts parents  home ]
I indicated that that very evening , I had just gotten my period , that I had not had tampons with me and so I was a bloody mess and the longer time went by the bloodier and messier I would become .
Kelly indicated that he could not do anything about that .
He motioned to the woman in the back .
She said she had tampons in her car at the place where we were going and she would get me some when we arrived .
They arrived at the Bruckert residence and the mother informed them they had abducted the wrong woman .
Meanwhile , while the confused deprogrammers debated what to do , Dobkowski recalls :
One more time I requested tampons so I could address the bloody mess problem .
Kelly allowed the woman in the back to get me some tampons .
She left the van for about five to ten minutes and then returned with about 5 - 6 slender tampons .
I begged them at this point to let me out but Kelly would not allow me to leave the van to use the tampons .
We then proceeded to start to drive again .
I was told they were driving me back to where they had picked me up .
A young woman mistakenly abducted by vigilante pseudo - therapists , faced with the indignity of having to sit for hours in her own menses -- this street crime had one more element .
When the deprogrammers abruptly pushed out Ms. Dobkowski into the empty parking lot after two o- clock in the morning , she checked her two handbags which the deprogrammers had initially taken from her and found they had stolen about $ 175 in cash .
Anecdotes of inebriated " counselors " and " guards , " some holding down their female " clients " by the thighs under their dresses , whispering threats and / or assurances , lips to ears , and so forth , became legion .
Sexual assault and harassment became commonplace under CAN .
Dr. Lowell D. Streiker , counselor and author cited earlier , recalled :
One of the deprogrammers that CAN frequently referred members of the public to was Cliff Daniels ...
I have personal knowledge of Cliff Daniels violent deprogrammings .
In 1981 I consulted with a client named Dorothy Mitchell , who had family members in the River of Life Ministry .
In the course of counseling Ms. Mitchell , I had the occasion to speak to Daniels , who was involved in deprogrammings at this time with other members of the River of Life Ministry .
Daniels volunteered to me the information that he had used illegal drugs while involved in deprogrammings and that he had had sex with one of his deprogramming victims . [ 50 ] [ see Document 37 ]
Other female deprogrammees told Streiker that Daniels had tried " repeatedly and persistently , to seduce them . "
It was apparent that Daniels tried to use sexual intercourse as a " test " to see whether the women were completely " out of the cult . "
[ Streikers words . ]
If the women continued to resist his advances , he accused them of not really having been deprogrammed . [ 51 ]
A male , Jason Scott ( Appendix A , Case No. 6 ) only had to feign a change of attitudes to dupe his male deprogrammers ; some women , it appears , had to go the more extreme route to ultimately accomplish the same end .
We do not list here other anecdotes traveling within the ACM subculture of male rapes and homosexual deprogramming behavior .
Ultimately , individual anecdotes of maverick deprogrammers are one thing .
The CAN " home office " s posture toward use of sex and related tactics in deprogrammings is another .
In CANs case this attitude appears to have been a pragmatic one , indeed .
In a deposition , CANs final executive director Cynthia Kisser was directly asked about sex in deprogrammings by an attorney .
She provided a telling response :
Q. Thats all I am asking simply
You dont consider sexual assault during deprogramming to be sexual perversion , is that right ?
A. That is not my understanding of what sexual perversion is , no .
Q.Would you consider it sexual perversion for a deprogrammer who was hired to change the belief of someone who is alleged to be a lesbian to do so by showing her how a quote , " a real man does it , " would you consider that to be sexual perversion ?
A. Well , if they are having regular intercourse , man to woman , then it cant be perversion .
It might be rape , assault or something else , but it doesnt sound like perversion to me .
Q. Rape is nt perversion to you ?
A. Rape is a criminal act , but perversion means something different than just a criminal act .
Q.Ms. Kisser , do you consider rape to be a sexual perversion or not ?
A.As I understand sexual perversion , that would not fit the definition of sexual perversion . [ 52 ] [ see Document 38 ]
Thus , a helpless man or woman detained against his / her will who had been sexually assaulted in whatever manner had not experienced any sort of perverse act according to CANs head .
Trained sex therapists who use surrogate partners in legitimate therapy for clients with sexual dysfunctions are controversial , still relatively rare , but at least professionally accountable .
The less - than - accountable deprogrammers and exit counselors , almost none of whom has ever had former credentials in any accredited therapeutic practice , found a blind eye turned toward their " rescue " methodologies in the " insider " subculture of CAN .
Deprogrammer Kickbacks and Money - Laundering : The Inner Sanctum of NARDEC
Journalist Nora Hamerman , in writing about the Dobkowski deprogramming fiasco , referred to CAN as " a clearinghouse for kidnap - for - hire rings . "
This is an apt description .
There was a corporate crime basis for CANs continuance and funding , as we suggested earlier . [ 53 ]
Various background informant sources speak to a deprogrammer kickback / money laundering scheme by which deprogrammers received continued referrals from CAN in exchange for " repayments " or donations ( i.e. , commissions ) funneled back to national CAN headquarters .
In one newspaper article former deprogrammer Jonathon Nordquist " alleges that with each referral to a deprogrammer , a kick - back is sent to CAN in the form of a donation to ensure that the referrals continue . " [ 54 ]
If so , such claims would establish a financial symbiosis between CAN and coercive deprogrammers .
John M. Sweeney , Jr. , past head of CFF as it turned into CAN during the early - to - mid 1980s , recounting how deprogrammers charged thousands of dollars per case , testified :
Because of the large amounts of money they make due to referrals received from CFF members , deprogrammers usually kick - back money to the CFF member who gave the referral ...
The kick - backs would either be in cash or would be in the form of a tax deductible " donation " to the CFF .
... Adrian Greek , who was the national chairman of CFF at the time that I was its national director , had an adult daughter in the Unification Church .
Mr. Greek was very cheap and didnt want to pay money to have a deprogramming .
He then attempted to get a deprogrammer to deprogram his daughter in exchange for Mr. Greeks future referrals of clients to the deprogrammer . [ 55 ]
Deprogrammer Mark Blocksom ( endnote 27 ) alludes indirectly to this reciprocity , and deprogrammer Rick Ross ( endnote 24 ) seems to assume it .
CANs last executive director , Cynthia Kisser , in her weave - and - dodge responses under legal examination , is vague but suggestive of such a corporate policy :
Q. Whether CAN National during the period of 1987 to 1989 to your knowledge received donations , pleads , or funds of any sort from deprogrammers ?
A.I would say given the definition I gave of deprogramming , yes , they very well could have .
Q.To your knowledge from 1987 to 1989 have any families who to your knowledge hired deprogrammers subsequent to referrals from CAN made any donations to CAN National ?
A.I would have no way of knowing on a first name basis , if that was their reason for giving .
Q.So , to your knowledge some families have given , but you dont know what their reasons were ?
A.Thousands of people have given .
I dont know what their reason may have been .
Q. Well , to your knowledge have families who in fact hired deprogrammers and made that known to you , made donations to CAN ?
A.I dont know if specifically between  87 and  89 there were families who had hired deprogrammers who did also give money to CAN during that time period .
I just do not know .
It s possible they could have . [ 56 ] [ see Document 39 ]
The attorney was chipping away at the possibility that deprogrammers " discounted " the price of a deprogramming if the families ( not the deprogrammers ) made the donation directly to CAN .
That this practice existed appears likely .
Notes on donor index cards for NARDEC contributions ( see below on NARDEC ) in CAN desk rolodex files comment frequently on donors  family members  present or past membership in NRMs ( e.g. , COG , CUT , UC , HK , BCC , Alamo ) and sometimes if the deprogrammings referred were successful or unsuccessful ( and conducted by which deprogrammer - see CAN Box 249 " Rolodexes ) .
However , a more direct answer can be found in other testimony and in CAN records themselves .
In a deposition CAN staff member Marty Butz , who admitted to have made around 500 deprogramming referrals , was asked in a deposition :
Q.Have any of the people that you made referrals to for deprogramming since youve been in CAN made any donations to CAN , any monetary donations ?
A.I know that [ deprogrammer ] Carol Giambalvo has been a Nardeck [ sic ] member .
That s the only extent of my knowledge of any contributions going CANs way .
Q. What does " Nardeck " mean ?
A.I do nt know .
I dont know what Nardeck represents .
Q.Nardeck members are people that make substantial monetary contributions to CAN is nt that correct ?
A. Yes .
[ Butz suddenly remembers . ]
Q. Theres athats kind of the select people that are the primary financial supporters of CAN ?
A.I believe what it is is a commitment for three years donating a thousand dollars .
Q.A year ?
A.I cant say thats where CANs primary support comes from .
Q.How much money has Miss Giambalvo donated to CAN since youve been involved in CAN ?
A.I have no idea .
Q.At least $ 3,000 ?
A. If shes been a Nardeck member more than once , quite possibly more than $ 3,000
Q. Shes the person youve made the largest number of deprogramming referrals to , correct ?
A. Yes . [ 57 ] [ see Document 40 ]
The court recorder had the subgroup of CAN spelled incorrectly : not Nardeck , but rather NARDEC : National Resource Development and Economic Council .
This was the heart of deprogrammers  money - laundering operation and a key area of financial support for CAN .
Its referral - in - exchange - for - a - kickback - of - deprogramming - fees is why CAN deprogrammer Rick Ross , in a " slump time " for business after having " paid his dues " to NARDEC , wrote CAN activist Priscilla Coates in a huff :
Have not received one really solid referral , C.A.N. included .
I dont know why .
Perhaps summer , " turf " issues , or lack of desire to deal with fundamentalists .
Phil and Annie have called from N.Y. and Annette is trying , but some parents are so cheap they prefer to let their kids " bang the Bible " than pay . [ 58 ]
Ex -CAN executive director Cynthia Kisser acknowledged the existence of NARDEC deprogrammer contributions in a deposition :
Q . Do you know of any donations that have been made to CAN by deprogrammers ?
A . Let me just take a minute to look at some of the people that youve identified as deprogrammers to let me answer that question .
Yes .
Q. Who ?
A. Steve Hassan , Carol Giambalvo , and Randall Burkey . [ 59 ]
Formed in the mid-1980s , by 1987 NARDEC had become institutionalized as a special unit within CAN .
Ronald M. Loomis , CAN president , wrote in a June 26 , 1987 form letter to all CAN affiliates and newsletter subscribers :
We are grateful to those of you who responded to our appeal for contributions with the February meeting .
The number of persons who have become members of the National Resource and Development Council ( NaRDeC ) by pledging $ 1,000 per year for three years continues to grow , but we need that level of commitment from many more persons .
Based on your generous support in 1986 , we determined that we could afford to commit ourselves to the full time salary of an Executive Director for the future .
A letter from our Finance and Development Chair ... together with a pledge card , is [ sic ] enclosed .
It will be a real challenge for us to continue in 1987 what we did in 1986 .
Please do what you can to sustain that effort .
Remember that we cannot expect anyone to support the cult awareness effort unless we provide the first level of support . [ 60 ]
[ Italics ours . ]
Apparently deprogrammers ( renaming themselves " exit counselors " ) understood the message .
Under the NARDEC aegis they began to organize within CAN .
In the Preliminary Program of the Portland , Oregon 1987 annual CAN conference there was scheduled a Wednesday , October 19 special evening meeting for exit counselors ( and added below that announcement : " will not post on hotel meeting sign or brochure . " )
On Saturday , October 22 at the same convention there was also a special NARDEC breakfast . [ 61 ]
NARDEC also had special 7:30 AM breakfast meetings at the 1989 CAN annual conference ( program noted : " NARDEC members only " ) and at the 1990 annual CAN conference NARDEC members met in conjunction with the CAN Advisory Board [ see Document 41 ] .
Referring back to earlier sections of this paper where CAN officials tried to distance themselves on paper and in legal testimonies that CAN in no way encouraged deprogrammings , an examination of real CAN activities belies that claim .
It would appear that " exit counselors , " formerly deprogrammers , were invited ( literally ) to sit at the CAN table .
Of course , not all contributions to CAN and NARDEC were from deprogrammers or persons who favored vigilante actions over educational goals .
CAN donors each received Identification numbers and were listed / enumerated in files .
An inspection of such lists would include , for example , a July 25 , 1988 contribution of $ 2,000 from the Grainger Foundation to a more modest July 21 , 1995 contribution of $ 35 from evangelical Christian ( counter - cult ) sociologist Ronald Enroth ( ID # 912 ) .
However , many were from known deprogrammers ( and their sympathizers ) , such as Carol Giambalvo , Paul Engel , Janja Lalich , and David Clark .
Inspection of NARDEC contributions by month for 1998 - 95 shows a fairly stable pattern : yearly totals averaged between $ 40,000 and $ 54,000 , always strongest in January ( around $ 7,000 for that month ) and then leveling off to less than $ 4,000 per month .
( NARDECs contribution to total CAN revenues was about one - third . )
However , it appears likely that under - the - table deprogrammer referral kick - backs made up a substantial proportion of NARDEC funds .
( NARDEC had its own CAN account number , 4080 , as opposed to the general fund , 4000 , or CANs mail order " bookstore " selling tracts , tapes , and books , 4020 . )
Apparently some deprogrammers did not use this traceable account for " donations . "
Examining monthly NARDEC contributions for the 1990s , for example , they rarely approached the reported monthly total contributions in CAN and never approached the reported annual totals .
Cash receipts for April , 1992 , for instance , show a total that month of one $ 1000 contribution .
October , 1992 shows the same .
In other words , NARDEC fund totals in any given year cannot be explained by cash receipts or recorded individual contributions ( which , as numerous boxes of rather tediously studied files show , were quite meticulously detailed ) .
In fact , many recorded NARDEC contributions were in " nickel - and - dime " modest amounts : $ 30 , $ 50 , or $ 150 .
Some donations to CAN were even split between other funds and NARDEC ; for example , $ 50 donated by an individual in 1993 , $ 30 to go to NARDEC and $ 20 into CANs general fund .
Such are the minutiae of the CAN files .
There were some perennial NARDEC stalwarts who were family relatives of present or previous NRM members ( and some deprogrammers ) .
But NARDEC had a serious problem if it is assumed all monies taken in are reflected in the books eventually shown outside auditors .
There were many donors who welched on their pledges , decreasing overt NARDEC revenues : in 1992 , 59 persons pledged $ 1000 or more , but 26 reneged ; in 1993 , 30 persons pledged the $ 1000 minimum but 14 reneged ; in 1994 23 of 27 persons reneged ; and in 1995 , 38 of 50 persons reneged .
True , towards the waning days of CAN there was a strong , last - ditch resurgence of giving to help .
January 1996 checks ( from a very small , " select " group of persons ) of $ 1000 to NARDEC totaled around $ 10,675 .
But by then CAN was struggling amid many lawsuits , having lost the Jason Scott deprogramming civil suit , and squandered an insurance settlement thereof [ see Document 42 ] on pointless litigation -- much of which it ultimately lost or conceded .
So where did NARDEC make up the difference if recorded dollar totals do not square with meticulous , computerized receipt statements ?
Two separate rolodex lists of NARDEC donors and general contacts in media , law , industry , and social sciences ( marked " Major Gifts and NARDEC : comments to be included when required " ) include a Whos Who of dozens of coercive deprogrammers  names , telephone numbers , and addresses .
We suggest a triangulation of evidence from : ( 1 ) deprogrammers  testimonies ; ( 2 ) former CFF / CAN officials  testimonies ; ( 3 ) the obvious accounting lacunae in CAN financial records ; and ( 4 ) the " cash - only " nature of deprogramming fees .
( Deprogrammers typically didnt take credit cards or provide receipts .
So complained families who felt taken advantage of by expensive , ineffective deprogramming interventions . ) [ see Document 43 ]
Our opinion and conclusion is that systematic records of the kick - backs that went on in CANs offices during its last days were never kept in the first place , or destroyed .
The shoddy bookkeeping of CAN , and the likelihood of white collar crime committed by certain CAN leaders , to which we now turn , are part of the NARDEC story .
Evidence of Mismanagement of CAN Finances and Violation of Fiduciary Responsibility
CAN president Ronald M. Loomis was especially pleased in Spring , 1987 when an executive director search committee recommended Cynthia S. Kisser of Woodstock , Illinois after six months of deliberations and interviews .
He wrote effusively to the CAN affiliates and newsletter subscribers about her business credentials ( aside from her academic credentials ) :
Her professional background includes four years as a business manager with responsibility for general ledger , payroll records , tax reports , monthly billing and company financial matters .
She has supervised staffs , set up computer operations and resolved hardware and software matters ...
She has taught Business Communication for a community college . [ 62 ] [ see Document 44 ]
Yet , problems that had plagued the top levels of CFF - as - it - turned - into - CAN continued .
Recall that Kent E. Vaughn , CFF Board of Directors member 1982 - 84 came to the disturbing conclusion that there was an " inner board " of CAN with an agenda beyond CANs public pronouncements ( see endnote 11 ) .
In 1981 earlier national director of CFFI -IS , John M. Sweeney , Jr. saw economic problems in the boards behavior .
While he resigned for a number of reasons , including CFFs rejection of a deprogrammers ethics code while simultaneously heavily involved in often illegal , coercive , expensive , and often ineffective " rescues , " he was also unhappy that the group had failed to reimburse him on occasion and considered a collection suit against CFF - IS .
However , his final complaint was that something untoward was occurring in CFFs management of money , yet met a stonewall of silence when he called for an inspection of these issues .
He voiced his frustrations :
Why has the CFF - IS Board done all in its power to prevent an audit of the corporate books ?
Why has over $ 20,000 worth of donations been buried in an interest bearing CD account ( did the Board approve this action ? ) or in a checking account ?
Why wasnt this donation money stipulated for use in anti-cult projects ?
Why was money freed up so easily to finance an all expense paid trip to Dallas for the Board for an unnecessary meeting yet legitimate bills could not or would not be paid on time ?
I have records of threatened phone cut - off and late payment notices due to C --- s inefficient method .
To protect my reputation and credit rating the WATS and SPRINT have been disconnected because they are in my name . [ 63 ]
Ironically , CAN had the same troubles during its existence and demise in 1996 .
For example , when CAN executive director Kisser came into office in 1987 , she appears to have made some radical changes in CAN financial management .
In essence she consolidated its finances , with minimal executive office accountability to members .
According to one informant knowledgeable about the group :
... Kisser changed the financial lines of the Cult Awareness Network .
Kisser demanded that all Cult Awareness Network chapters send all of the donations they received , including uncancelled checks , to her at the national office in Illinois .
Kisser then cashed the checks , kept the amount of money that she wanted and then mailed the remaining money to the affiliated chapters as she saw fit . [ 64 ]
Ex-deprogrammer Jonathon Nordquist , having met Kisser at a CAN convention , remembers :
Shortly after , [ Mary ]
Krone told me that once Kisser fully learned how to do her new job , that Krone would no longer be working at the national offices ...
Additionally , I recall an incident that occurred while I was riding in an elevator during the [ CAN ] convention in Pittsburgh .
Also present in the elevator were Mary Krone , Krones son , John , Cynthia Kisser and Rachel Andres .
Mary Krone was talking about the finances of the Cult Awareness Network when Kisser stated to her : " If the cults ever get a hold of our books wed be in trouble . " [ 65 ] [ see Document 45 ]
Having expended its insurance money on fruitless appeals of the Jason Scott / Rick Ross / CAN deprogramming case that awarded Scott over $ 4 million , and wasted funds on other lawsuits , as its income decreased CAN began to default on its phone bills ( all the while continuing to pay director Cynthia Kisser $ 3000 per month plus lesser amounts to CAN staff ) .
There are several implications :
All not - for - profit organizations are required to follow standard ethical and legal protocol particularly with respect to financial management .
Complete detailed records must be consistently maintained , then supported by both internal and external audits to ensure both accuracy and propriety .
The operations and cash flow must conform to generally accepted accounting standards .
A painstakingly extensive review of the allegedly complete court - ordered financial records of CAN confirms blatant impropriety .
CAN was classified as 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) , a not - for - profit , tax exempt organization with the Internal Revenue Service .
To qualify and comply , certain measures of practice and accounting are required ; the organization is accountable by Federal law .
The organizational test is a mandate that specific conditions be met and maintained for tax exempt qualification according to the IRS code .
To qualify for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status the organization must be formed exclusively for literary and scientific purposes ; the manner of operation must be described in detail .
Furthermore , the articles of the organization must appropriately limit the organizations purpose , regulate the allocation of contributions , and foster the best interests of the people .
CANs admitted affiliation with deprogrammers as confirmed in the Scott trial , among other places , appears to conflict with the IRS limited purpose constraint as well as in the express powers clause [ 7. 8.2 ] 3.3.4 ( 02-231999 ) , Express Powers that Cause Failure of Organizational Test . [ 66 ]
An organization does not meet the organizational test if its articles expressly empower it :
To have objectives and to engage in activities which characterize it as an " action organization " ( Reg. 1.501 ( c ) ( 3 ) - 1 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( iii ) ) ;
To carry on any other activities ( unless they are insubstantial ) which are not in furtherance of one or more exempt purposes ( Reg. 1.501 ( c ) ( 3 ) 1( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ) ( a ) ) . [ 67 ]
By affiliation , CAN cast at minimum a shadow on these two IRS provisions .
We would maintain that given the records and documented activity of this organization , CAN acted in multiple violations of its IRS classification .
One initial and standing concern is that of missing or duplicated documents .
The general condition of the financial records is deplorable .
Documents are not in chronological order or in keeping with standard bookkeeping practice , making tracking a monumental feat .
There are substantial gaps and pertinent items , statements , canceled checks , audits , and so forth are missing .
The list is significant .
There are no itemized journals or ledgers of income or expenditures ( standard accrual accounting ) , merely sporadic incomplete lists .
The financial records are highly questionable and are at best professionally sloppy .
Cash flow is abundantly problematic and highly critical .
In mere illustration , a petty cash withdrawal of $ 1,500 was observed .
The established , acceptable norm for an organization of this size would be to maintain a generous $ 300 fund in total .
Of greater concern , a. review of cash receipts reflects numerous and substantial checks issued by CAN ( National ) to CAN itself with no indication or record of who received said funds , nor of the generating purpose .
To illustrate [ see Document 46 ] , a $ 12,000 check issued 3/25/94 by CAN to CAN lists an account category # 4250 for which there is no correlating account description .
The canceled check # 184 is not present among those in that series , nor is it ever listed as an expenditure .
Interestingly , similar documentation and lack of canceled checks occurs with numerous other like entries .
Or another example : on 1 /19/95 two ( 2 ) checks ( #5876 and # 5877 ) were issued to J. Gordon Melton and Anson Shupe , respectively , for $ 600 each [ see Document 47 ] .
Given their extensive study in this field , both men are known critics of CAN and would certainly not be on its payroll ( i.e. , certainly not " anti-cult apologists " ) .
This time period ties in to the Lippmann / Scientology lawsuit against CAN with neither party involved party beyond personal academic interest and neither party deposed by CAN as part of the lawsuit .
( Depositional checks to professionals are rarely made out before depositions are taken . )
Neither scholar when questioned has any knowledge of the existence of these checks .
The checks were then processed as stop payments .
Meltons the same day , Shupes not until April , yet the funds ( $ 1,200 ) were never reentered into the CAN account to offset the would - be stop payments .
Both checks were physically located , reflecting stop payments , yet the bookkeeping does not appropriately correlate .
Uncannily , these particular entries were discovered by Shupe personally while examining financial data in the CAN boxes .
Why were bogus checks issued , who retained the $ 1,200 , and more importantly , how many other orchestrated entries lie within the records of CAN and to whose financial gain ?
Moreover , while not unheard of , not - for - profit CAN maintained a steady and healthy separate account with the Merrill Lynch firm housing an extremely active money market account with no correlating income relationship as well as certificates of deposit averaging $ 40,000 , far exceeding the standard required reserve .
Despite these investments , letters and audits indicate financial distress .
According to records , CAN was unable to pay concurrent Sprint network telephone bills , netting numerous final disconnect notices .
These concerns led to a recommendation issued by Virginia Hulet , CAN Treasurer ( resigned October , 1989 ) asking that all Sprint credit cards be returned .
From whom ?
Phone records indicate substantial use by deprogrammers of CAN phone lines , calling from CANs national office .
We ask again , was this careless mismanagement or diverted attention ?
In 1987 Cynthia Kisser , CANs Executive Director , directed all chapters funds to be generated directly to the National Office .
While there was noted Board objection , this practice was implemented , allowing the National complete control of funds with minimal accountability .
Peat Marwick ( KPMG ) , a respected Certified Public Accounting firm , was procured by CAN to conduct its annual audits .
Auditing correspondence consistently expressed numerous concerns regarding the need for improved accounting principles , further suggesting accrual accounting [ see Document 48 ] .
They cited concern with the lack of internal audits indicating , neglect of Auditing Standards No. 50 as previously posed .
In the face of rising litigation expenses no allotments were made to accommodate this clear necessity appropriately .
Finally on June 1 , 1994 a letter signed by KPMG Peat Marwick expressed serious concern regarding CANs solvency .
In a letter dated June 8 , 1995 KPMG indicated an imbalance between the general ledger and the bank reconciliations that had existed since July , 1994 .
In a final communication KPMG elected to withdraw its affiliation with CAN in the face of growing financial concerns .
[ See Document 49 ]
Countless fringe questions arise when analyzing the CAN boxes : why do CAN records contain an inordinate amount of letters of dispute ( i.e. , a $ 26,228.76 disputed Conference balance with the Crown Plaza Hotel in White Plains , NY , November , 1995 ) ; why were multiple financial accounts simultaneously active ( i.e. , 4/9/96 when Cynthia Kisser requested NBD Bank of Skokie to transfer remaining funds to an account titled Cult Awareness Network Corp aka CAN D.I.P ) ; why would an organization of good intent be faced with fiercely escalating litigation ( i.e. , in 1994 there were 51 lawsuits in various states of settlement as presented to KPMG for completion of  94 audit ) : and finally why did Cynthia Kisser and several staff members continue to receive their salaries ( Kisser $ 1500 every two weeks ) beyond the filing of bankruptcy ?
More importantly , what became of CANs final funds in the midst of dissolution ?
These examples serve only as a small segment of a greater deluge of seeming impropriety currently under scrutiny within the CAN .
financial records .
Two outside veteran auditors when questioned regarding potential innocent explanations for these issues stated that this appears to be a case of " money laundering " or of " looting the assets " ( their words ) .
Again we ask , is this a case of atrocious bookkeeping or instead calculated misappropriation ?
Neither option is acceptable per auditing and IRS protocol .
We have evidence of substantial malfeasance throughout the documents purportedly representing the complete fiscal records of this organization .
The " why " remains yet to be addressed , the leaders and trustees are yet to be held accountable .
This preliminary finding is just that : a highlighted report of what we believe to be a much darker indication than that of poor record - keeping .
A Brownie troop with a naive , inexperienced leader might maintain such records and be accused of poor bookkeeping .
For an organization with the capital , the influence , and the magnitude of CAN , such explanations are inexcusable and suspect .
At the time of this presentation the exploration of CAN documents continues as additional discoveries unfold .
Are these findings the results of gross negligence or of something much more untoward ?
Our final assessment will appear in a book currently in progress .
For better or worse  and many Democrats fear it is for worse  the race goes on .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton defeated Senator Barack Obama in Pennsylvania on Tuesday by enough of a margin to continue a battle that Democrats increasingly believe is undermining their effort to unify the party and prepare for the general election against Senator John McCain .
Despite a huge investment of time and money by Mr. Obama and pressure on Mrs. Clinton by the party establishment to consider folding her campaign , she won her third big state in a row .
Mrs. Clinton showed again that she is a tenacious campaigner with an ability to connect with the blue - collar voters Mr. Obama has found elusive and who could be critical to a Democratic victory in November .
Mrs. Clinton ’s margin was probably not sufficient to fundamentally alter the dynamics of the race , which continued to favor an eventual victory for Mr. Obama .
But it made clear that the contest will go on at least a few weeks , if not more .
And it served to underline the concerns about Mr. Obama ’s strengths as a general election candidate .
Exit polls again highlighted the racial , economic , sex and values divisions within the party .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged President George W. Bush on Monday to boycott the Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies this summer unless China improves human rights .
Clinton , in a statement , cited violent clashes in Tibet and the lack of pressure by China on Sudan to stop “ the genocide in Darfur . ”
“ At this time , and in light of recent events , I believe President Bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in Beijing , absent major changes by the Chinese government , ” the New York senator said .
Bush plans to attend the Summer Olympics ceremonies in Beijing in August and so far has resisted pressure to change his plans in response to a violent crackdown against protesters in Tibet by Chinese authorities .
China has also been accused of refusing to use its influence on the Sudanese government to get it to stop what the United States calls a genocide in the Darfur region .
Clinton has gone a step further than U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California who last week urged Bush to keep the option of boycotting the ceremonies on the table .
“ I encourage the Chinese to take advantage of this moment as an opportunity to live up to universal human aspirations of respect for human rights and unity , ideals that the Olympic games have come to represent , ” Clinton said .
Speaking before Clinton ’s statement was released , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that , “ We have a great deal of concern about human rights in China . ”
“ We have never been afraid to express those views , ” he said .

Ice Sauna :
If you have the means , the latest trend in many European countries is to install an ice sauna in your home .
This particular sauna , dubbed the " Snow Room , " was developed by a company called MNK - and it can keep the temperature at a brisk 10 degrees below zero .
But I must warn you - if you manage to lure a chick this hot into one of these things , keep in mind that penis frostbite will bring a party down real fast .

Fingerprint scanners are being used at two Kent nursery schools to check the identity of parents .
Springfield Lodge Day Nursery , which has sites in Dartford and Swanscombe , is scanning the prints each time parents drop off their children .
Linda Berryman , the owner of the nursery , said the measures were for the " safety and security " of the children .
But the charity Kidscape , which aims to protect children from harm , described the measure as " paranoid and overkill " .
Michelle Elliot , director , said it gave the wrong message to youngsters .
She said in reality of the 11 million children in the UK , on average seven to 10 were abducted and murdered each year .
' No information recorded '
" But we do n't want to give children , particularly young children , the idea that the world is so dangerous that they can't even go to nursery school without being scanned . "
Ms Berryman said parents at the nursery were happy with the heightened security measures .
She said it made life a lot easier for parents when dropping off and picking up so that they were not hanging around waiting for their children .
" There is no actual information recorded , only the information that we 've already got , " she said .

On the 20th consecutive day when gas prices reached a record high , John McCain gave a speech about nuclear proliferation .
Can this campaign be any more out of touch with the issues that matter to American voters ?
McCain ’s speech seemed to have three purposes .
First , McCain wanted to lay out his position on what he views as a foreign policy issue .
Second , he wished to stress that he is different from George W. Bush in that he will talk to the international community .
Third , he wants to pretend that all of the issues that are critical to domestic policy are n’t really happening .
This whole speech was a metaphor for the McCain campaign as he got into his time machine , and took us back to decades past .
Forty - five years ago , President John F. Kennedy asked the American people to imagine what the world would look like if nuclear weapons spread beyond the few powers that then held them to the many other nations that sought them .
“ Stop and think for a moment , ” he said , “ what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands , in the hands of countries large and small , stable and unstable , responsible and irresponsible , scattered throughout the world . ”
If that happened , he warned , “ there would be no rest for anyone . ”
Yet again , McCain tried to link himself to Ronald Reagan .
A quarter of a century ago , President Ronald Reagan declared , “ our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth . ”
That is my dream , too .
It is a distant and difficult goal .
And we must proceed toward it prudently and pragmatically , and with a focused concern for our security and the security of allies who depend on us .
But the Cold War ended almost twenty years ago , and the time has come to take further measures to reduce dramatically the number of nuclear weapons in the world ’s arsenals .
It is time for the United States to show the kind of leadership the world expects from us , in the tradition of American presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind .
Advertisements
McCain played a fear card that was straight out of the Cold War , “ Our highest priority must be to reduce the danger that nuclear weapons will ever be used .
Such weapons , while still important to deter an attack with weapons of mass destruction against us and our allies , represent the most abhorrent and indiscriminate form of warfare known to man .
We do , quite literally , possess the means to destroy all of mankind .
We must seek to do all we can to ensure that nuclear weapons will never again be used . ”
McCain promised to sit down and talk to Russia , China , India , and Pakistan about reducing the stockpiles of nuclear weapons .
What was illuminating was who he did n’t promise to talk to .
He would n’t promise to talk to the truly dangerous nations that are developing nuclear weapons such as Syria , North Korea , and Iran .
This was a completely out of touch speech .
Many sections of it seemed to be straight out of the 1980s .
In a year when food and gas prices are soaring , McCain can campaign like he is still fighting the Cold War , but it will only serve to hurt him in November .

As 11 - year - old Dalton Hatfield set about selling his earthly possessions , his parents thought he was doing his part to help pay for a family vacation .
Instead , he was doing his part to help his favored presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton .
And on Friday , the young fellow made news when he presented a stunned Bill Clinton with a check for $ 440 .
The former president , according an Associated Press story on the occasion , " seemed to nearly come to tears " as he accepted the donation at a fire station in Williamson , W.Va .
( one of the many off - the - beaten - path locales where he has been rallying support for his wife ) .
The Hillary Clinton campaign , understandably , was so taken with the boy 's gesture that today it posted the AP story on its website .
Every little bit helps , after all , when it comes to erasing the $ 20 - million debt that the campaign acknowledged on Sunday .
Killjoys that we are , we checked federal regulations just to make sure everything was on the up - and - up with Hatfield 's contribution .
And we are relieved to report ...
Remember the group that swiftboated John Kerry in the last election ?
Now there is the “ Vets for Freedom ” that is trying to do the same thing to Obama .
And some of the main people behind “ Vets for Freedom ” are also on McCain ’s campaign .
UPDATE : Daily Kos points out that coordination between a 527 group and a campaign is against the law , and it seems clear that McCain has violated this law .

The New York Times has been reporting that contrary to his public statements , John Edwards would consider , if asked , being Barack Obama ’s running mate .
Buried on page 2 of their story about the Edwards endorsement was the following little gem .
“ But privately , he told aides that he would consider the role of vice president , and favored the position of attorney general , which would appeal to his experience of decades spent in courtrooms as a trial lawyer in North Carolina ; and his desire to follow in the footsteps of Robert F. Kennedy , one of his heroes , ” the paper said .
Most of Edwards ’s former staff had landed in the Obama campaign before Edwards even endorsed , so the foundation was already laid for Edwards to play a key role in Team Obama .
I think Edwards would be a fantastic choice for VP .
He has much of Clinton ’s appeal , but not her frosty campaign style or baggage .

An Obama - Edwards ticket would be charisma overload on the campaign trail , both men are amazing campaigners , they even look like a ticket .
On the other hand , if a President Obama is sincere about changing the culture in Washington , then having John Edwards as attorney general would represent a 360 or 180 degree if you like , turn away from the days of Alberto Gonzales .
For his part , all Obama will say is that John Edwards would be on anyone ’s shortlist .
That ’s true , and it may be odd to say , but I think the decision to run with Obama will be up to Edwards .
He will have to decide whether he wants to be in another grueling general election campaign , or if he really prefers attorney general .
Either way , John Edwards is a great addition to the Obama camp .

Jimmy Carter arrived in mid Wales for his speech on Sunday Former US president Jimmy Carter has called for a clear deadline for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
Mr Carter , who now spends much of his time in international diplomacy , also called for increased communication with Iran over fears that the country is planning nuclear proliferation .
The 83 - year - old , speaking at the Hay Festival in Powys , also deplored the situation in Gaza .
He claimed 1.6 m Palestinians were living in a " prison " .
He said many countries were behaving in a " supine " manner as people in Gaza were being systematically denied basic food and sustenance .
Mr Carter , who gave a lecture at the literary festival later on Sunday , was questioned on whether he agreed with US presidential candidate Barak Obama 's promise to withdraw US troops from Iraq within 16 months .
He said he could not speak for Mr Obama but said there should be a three - step process of US withdrawal from Iraq .
The US should say 'we want to be your friend '
Ex-president Jimmy Carter Mr Carter , a fierce critic of the war , said the Americans should notify Iraq 's leaders that they would leave at a certain date .
" I do n't care if it 's one year or five years .... the essence of it is to let the world know that ... we are going to be out , " Mr Carter told journalists .
The next stage he said would be to assure Iraqis that they would have complete control over their political , military and economic affairs , including oil .
Finally , Mr Carter said there was a need " to marshal help from other nations in rebuilding the destruction that we have perpetrated on Iraq unnecessarily " so that the Iraqi people know they can stand on their own .
Peaceful coexistence Mr Carter , whose presidency floundered in the Iranian hostage crisis in the late 1970s , also called for a major diplomatic effort to resolve issues around Iran 's enrichment of nuclear materials .
He said Iran had never violated any nuclear proliferation treaty and any testing of weapons could never be done in secrecy .
Referring back to his time as president he said even in the darkest days of the crisis he had made all efforts to build diplomatic bridges with Iran 's revolutionary government .
He had even approached the heavyweight world boxing champion Muhammad Ali , an Islam convert .
Mr Carter said Iranians had a right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes but he understood the concerns that it raised in Israel .
He added : " The US should say 'we want to be your friend ' " .
Mr Carter said they should normalise trade relations with Iran .
" We want to help with technology to build a peaceful nuclear programme , " he added .
The ex-president , whose Carter Centre has monitored 70 elections around the world , was highly critical of the international failure to recognise the result of the recent Palestinian election won by Hamas .
He said that the US , Israel and other countries have lined up behind Hamas ' opponents Fatah .
One of his central political motivations in Middle East diplomacy had always been to help Israel secure a peaceful co-existence with its neighbours .
The veteran Middle East negotiator pulled off the historical Camp David Accord between President Sadat ( Egypt ) and Begun ( Israel ) and is a winner of the Nobel peace prize .
He said $ 2bn of US aid had gone to the Palestinians in 2007 and this was having the effect of strengthening Fatah .
Mr Carter said the present Palestinian government was a " subterfuge " not based on elections and was appointed , not elected , while large numbers of Hamas supporters remained in Israeli prisons .
But he said his recent book on Palestine had prompted a massive response and he believed that the desire for peace in the Middle East was strengthening on all sides .

What are these ?
The idea of a shorter work week is not a new one to anyone old enough to have lived through the energy shocks of the 1970's .
It should be fairly obvious to anyone interested in conserving oil that reducing the number of daily commutes per week would reduce the overall demand for oil .
There are about 133 million workers in America .
Around 80 % of them get to work by driving alone in a car .
The average commute covers about 16 miles each way .
The notion of our standard work week here in America has remained largely the same since 1938 .
That was the year the Fair Labor Standards
Act was passed , standardizing the eight hour work day and the 40 hour work week .
Each Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday and Friday workers all over the country wake up , get dressed , eat breakfast and go to work .
But the notion that the majority of the workforce should keep these hours is based on nothing more than an idea put forth but the Federal government almost 70 years ago .
To be sure it was an improvement in the lives of many Americans who were at the time forced to work 10 + hours a day , sometimes 6 days of the week .
So a 40 hour work week was seen as an upgrade in the lives of many of U.S. citizens .
8 is a nice round number ; one third of each 24 hour day .
In theory it leaves 8 hours for sleep and 8 hours for other activities like eating , bathing , raising children and enjoying life .
But the notion that we should work for 5 of these days in a row before taking 2 for ourselves is , as best I can tell , rather arbitrary .
This is a guest post by Aaron Newton , who is working with coauthor Sharon Astyk on the forthcoming book , A Nation of Farmers .
Aaron contributes at Groovy Green ; he also blogs at Powering Down .
Aaron is a land planner and garden farmer in suburban North Carolina , seeking ways to transform the current course of human land use development in an effort to prepare for the effects of global oil production peak and its outcome on automotive suburban America .
The math , as I see it , goes as thus ( I welcome a discussion of these numbers , by the way ... ) :
133,000,000 workers X 80 % who drive alone = 106,400,000 single driver commuter cars each day .
106,400,000 X 32 miles round trip = 3,404,800,000 miles driven to work each day
3,404,800,000 / 21 mpg ( average fuel efficiency ) = 162,133,333 gallons of gasoline each day
Each barrel of crude oil produces , on average , 19.5 gallons of gas .
( It is important to note that other products like kerosene and asphalt are produced from that same barrel . )
162,133,333 / 19.5 = 8,314,530 barrels of oil each day .
What this shows is Reason # 1 ; the impact a 4 day work week could have on crude oil imports .
I 'm talking about a reduction ( 5 - 10 % ?
and perhaps even more -- ED by PG ) in the amount of oil we need Monday through Friday simply by rearranging our work week .
No wonder this idea was utilized in the 70's .
But the clear fact that a 4 day work week would save such a precious non-renewable resource is just the first of 16 reasons why I think it 's time to revive the idea of reducing the numbers of days we work each week .
Reason # 2 The 4 Day Work Week would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants .
As you pull out of your driveway on your way to work your automobile has already begun to emit Carbon Monoxide , Carbon Dioxide , Sulphur Dioxide , Nitrogen Oxides , Hydrocarbons , Ozone , particulates , Lead and Chlorofluorcarbons .
Some of these compounds are responsible for the greenhouse effect that is warming our planet and throwing our global climate system into increasing instability .
Others of them contribute to air pollution that causes everything from dramatically rising rates of childhood asthma to cancers , heart disease and respiratory illnesses .
Sometimes I drive to work too , so do n't think the whole thing is your fault .
But it 's true that we 're playing fast and loose with our ecosystem and poisoning ourselves with our autos .
60 - 70 % of urban air pollution is caused by cars .
Taking 20 % of them off the roads during the most heavily traveled time of the day would obviously reduce the overall amount of pollutants produced by our autos .
And this is key , if a worker transitions to a 4 Day Work Week and then spends all day off driving around when he or she would have be at work , then the savings in terms of fuel and pollution will be lost .
This is not a plan to provide everyone with more time to drive around but a plan to bring people back into their homes and their local communities .
It 's an effort to give them more time with family , more time to exercise , more time to write the great American novel or learn to keep bees , or get another degree , or start a garden .
Reason # 3 The 4 Day Work Week would reduce workers exposure to pollutants .
A recent study by the California EPA says " 50 % of a person 's daily exposure to ultra fine particles ( the particles linked to cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses ) can occur during a commute . "
A report by the Clean Air Task Force in 2007 found diesel particle levels were between 4 to 8 times higher in commute vehicles than in the surrounding air .
It makes sense when you think about it .
The pollution coming from the tailpipe of a vehicle is mostly likely to affect you while you 're sitting directly behind it , especially if you 're stuck in slow moving traffic where the concentrations of such particles can build up .
Reason # 4 The 4 Day Work Week would mean less traffic congestion .
Rush hour exists because everyone needs to get to work at about the same time .
Anyone who 's lived in a city of size can tell you that early in the morning and late in the afternoon the roads fill up .
The average 16 mile commutes takes 26 minutes each way .
That 's 52 minutes a day traveling at roughly 35 miles per hour .
Imagine if 1/5 of the cars suddenly disappeared ?
If the work week was staggered so that 1/5 of all workers took a different day off , the U.S. commuter would see a 20 % reduction in rush hour congestion without building a single new road .
Which leads nicely to the next reason :
Reason # 5 The 4 Day Work Week would reduce money spent on new road construction and existing road maintenance .
With 1/ 5 few cars making the commute each day , fewer new road projects would be necessary and existing roads would last longer with less maintenance .
This is not to say that we should n't take advantage of this cost savings to invest in alternative transportation systems .
In fact it 's the opposite .
This could be a gift to the tax payer who would receive new and better options for travel without any rise in taxes .
Reason # 6 The 4 Day Work Week would result in a reduction in personal expenses .
From www.ridetowork.org,
" 2002 annual household private vehicle expense is $ 7,371 .
This is divided into $ 3,665 for vehicle purchases , $ 1,235 for gas and oil and $ 2,471 for insurance and misc . "
If workers used their cars 20 % less often to drive to work , they would see a reduction in the frequency of oil changes , tune ups and the purchase of new tires just to name a few savings .
The above numbers also reflect the price of gasoline in 2002 .
We all know it has increase since then and will continue to increase now that global oil production has peaked .
Remember those 162,133,333 gallons of gas we 're going to save ?
162,133,333 X $ 2.75 per gallon = $ 445,866,665.00
This would save US workers a lot of money !
And because our cars would be driven less frequently , they would n't need to be replaced as often .
That 's not to say that would should n't try to replace inefficient older cars with more efficient new ones , but this could give the auto manufactures time to wake up to the global peak in oil production and make changes in the types of vehicles they offer .
It could also give communities time to respond with planning strategies that favor other types of transportation including walking , biking and mass transit .
Reason # 7 The 4 Day Work Week would mean fewer auto accidents each year .
I do n't have statistics on the number of automobile related deaths and injuries that occur specifically during rush hour but almost every radio station on the dial offers a regular update of car crashes throughout each morning and evening commute .
It seems safe to assume that fewer cars on the road during those periods of time would result in fewer accidents and the injuries that result from them .
Reason # 8 The 4 Day Work Week would mean less time spent in VSC or Voluntary Solitary Confinement
Now some people tell me the time they spend alone in their car is relaxing .
Personally I think if that 's true then what those people are really enjoying is time alone on uncongested roads .
Rush hour on a busy street is not relaxing .
Personal time away from other people can be a positive experience .
But we do n't have to spend our time alone in a metal box burning nonrenewable resources that heat the planet .
If less time was spent commuting each week , people would have more time for themselves to enjoy , even if they wanted to enjoy that time alone .
It seems to me that as a nation we are experiencing an epidemic of disconnect .
Ever see those people early in the morning on their way to work at 6:30 am talking on their cell phones ?
Just who are they talking to ?
Maybe some of them are already working ( before even arriving at work ) but I bet many of them are talking to other friends and family who are , quite possibly , out in traffic too .
How many of you have ever made a cell phone call because you were bored or lonely in your car ?
I have friends who will call me and announce that 's what they 're doing , calling me to get some company .
The car is an insulator that keeps us from interacting and as naturally social creatures this is n't a good practice .
Less time spent in cars can mean more time spent with other human beings living life .
Reason # 9
The 4 Day Work Week would mean a reduction in absenteeism
A recent survey found that 43 % of respondents admitted to playing hooky last year .
That is they stayed home from work even though they were n't sick .
Another day scheduled during the week to address the needs and wants of workers would give people more time to complete all sorts of activities .
It could keep them from taking their own day off .
It could also give people a day to schedule appointments like medical , dental , tax , attorney or other .
A Four Day Work
Week would mean fewer random interruptions when workers must leave the office to take care of these matters .
Even the occasional summer day spent hiking with a child sounds like a good national exercise to me .
Reason # 10 The 4 Day Work Week would increase productivity
Yes I said " increase productivity . "
In 1930 famed cereal maker W.K. Kellog had this to say about his decision to decrease his companies work week from 40 to 30 hours .
The efficiency and morale of our employees is so increased , the accident and insurance rates are so improved , and the unit cost of production is so lowered that we can afford to pay as much for six hours as we formerly paid for eight .
Peak oil and climate change could make for turbulent business waters ahead .
This country needs more business leaders willing to navigate these waters not by burdening their workforce with limitations or restrictions but with a willingness to try new strategies .
Ideas such as this one should be strongly considered by corporate America or maybe it's time for the Federal government to revisit this issue through law .
New ways of working really could benefit both businesses and employees .
It 's important in the time ahead not to simply saddle the workers of America with the rising costs of energy and ecological destruction .
There are lots options concerning the number of hours a 4 Day Work Week could contain .
Employees could work 10 hours a day and keep a 40 hour work week .
Or they could simply eliminate an entire day and drop down to a 32 hour work week .
In between is the idea of working 4 days a week , 9 hours a day .
But regardless of how many hours people work , the important part to remember is that most tasks are going to get accomplished each week just as they did before .
A recent survey by salary.com of over 10,000 American workers revealed that on average , we waste more than 2 hours each day surfing the web or making phone calls to friends .
Might these distractions be activities that workers must be willing to trade for an entire extra day off to spend surfing on the Internet ?
I say that tongue in cheek as there are better ways to spend your new day off but the point is that the inbox is never empty and that important tasks could probably be completed in a shorter work week if time spent at work was all about work .
A shorter work week would sharpen this focus and make the workplace more productive .
Reason # 11 The 4 Day Work
Week would give us more time for family
60 % of Americans say they do not have enough time for family .
To be sure we could change that statement to read , make time for family , because time is after all what you make it .
It 's important to note that we work more hours than any other nation on the planet .
But why ?
Why do we work ?
I think this question is at the heart of support for a shorter work week .
We work so we can support our families right ?
But is more money and the always increasing amount of stuff that money buys really supporting our families ?
We have to pay bills but would your son rather have you at home or have a new flat screen television ?
7 out of 10 teenage pregnancies are conceived at the home of the young girl between the hours of 3 pm and 5 pm .
It is my view that what might be in my daughter 's best interest is n't me working 50 hours a week so I can buy her a sweet sixteen car .
It might be spending more time at home with my daughter talking to her about her future .
A shorter work week would give this nation an opportunity to spend more time at home with our families .
Reason # 12 The 4 Day Work Week would decrease labor costs
Long work hours increase the worker turnover rate which leads to more money spent on acquiring and training new employees .
Employees who have almost as many days to spend on their own as days they spend working will be much happier and more loyal .
These are employees who will work harder and stay longer at any given company .
Reason # 13 The 4 Day Work Week would decrease operational costs
Depending on just how a company chooses to structure its 4 Day Work Week , any number of operational costs could be reduced .
The energy savings from the climate control of unoccupied buildings could be enormous .
Fewer security or maintenance issues could result from having a smaller number of people in the office each day .
A shorter work week could mean more infrequent cleanings and less information technology service calls .
Reason # 14 The 4 Day Work Week would mean a reduction in the cost of childcare
If a two parent household were to switch to a 4 Day Work Week then their childcare costs could be reduced by 40 % .
Childcare ranges in cost depending on the type care and the specific location in which a worker lives .
Estimates range from $ 3,000 to $ 15,000 annually per child .
A family spending $ 5,000 who could reduce the number of days their child is in care from 5 days to 3 could save $ 2,000 a year .
This also means more of the child 's time spent with parents which fosters stronger families .
It is important to note here that childcare that exceeds the normal 8 hour work day is more expensive .
If both parents switched to 10 hour work days their childcare costs might not decrease .
Reason # 15 The 4 Day Work Week would provide time for a transition into the informal economy
There are a lot of reasons why consumer culture is bad for us .
It focuses not on people and their relationships to one another but instead on things , on stuff , on cheap plastic crap from Mal - Wart .
It 's worth pointing out that not only is our habit of consuming mass quantities of junk toxifying our lives and our environment with all sorts of chemicals and pollution , it 's also using up a number of nonrenewable resources at an alarming rate .
It seems reasonable to assume that we can't continue on this ride of infinite growth for a whole lot longer .
The coming era will be one of a decline in the availability of all sorts of resources we take for granted right now .
Learning how to reshape and relocalize our lives will be an immense effort for both communities and the individuals living in them .
Having an extra day each week to begin this process could prove invaluable .
Need time to learn how to cook or garden ?
Have you always wanted to start a new cottage industry business from home ?
Maybe you 'd like to be more activity in volunteer efforts in your community to address peak oil and climate change .
This extra day could be our ticket as a nation to scaling back on our consumption while we reconnect to local life .
Reason # 16 The 4 Day Work Week feels great !
I write this proposal not as an academic making a theoretical suggestion but as a participant in the new 4 Day Work Week movement .
At the beginning of 2007 I renegotiated my contract with my employer and started staying home on Fridays .
I now have more than a two day speed bump on the highway of American employment .
I get to enjoy almost as many days at home each week as I spend working at my job .
And it feels wonderful .
Since making the change I have even taken a new job and was still able to continue with my shorter work week .
25 % of U.S. companies already have some sort of policy towards alternative work schedules .
Telecommuting , cell phones and the Internet are just some of the other tools that can offer more flexibility to the outdated idea that we should all be at the office from 8 to 5 on Monday through Friday .
I can tell you from experience that this feels great .
I am able to spend time on projects that are important to me .
I get to see my young daughter more .
Lately it 's been a Friday bike ride together .
And I have a chance to share my ideas with more time to write proposals like this one .
Changes require action .
Our nation is at a point where we need change .
Not politicians talking about change but an actual change in the way we live our lives .
The 4 Day Work
Week could be a catalyst for a change from a nation that lives to work into a nation that works to live .
Come join me wo n't you ?

Watching American TV is a fascinating , and immensely infuriating experience , but it does explain a lot .
Yanks get a pretty hard time from almost everyone around the world at the moment , mostly for simply being bloody stupid – I feel that this is unfair ( except for the 52 % odd that voted for Bush , they are just stupid ) .
Watch the news on Fox , NBC , CNN and even
Sky news and you realise that what has become known as American stupidity is actually nothing of the sort , but simply the result of a process of mass brainwashing ; they are not stupid , but stupefied .
I remember watching the coverage of Hurricane Katrina ( which had the Revelationists wetting themselves with excitement ) every day until a full week after the event ; which was a true tragedy .
I do n’t think I even need to say anything about Bush ’s handling of the situation , or of the wonderful job his Arabian horse - rearing drinking buddy did for the ‘ folks ’ in trouble , but the way the media handled it was almost as painful to watch as the actual event itself :

“ Coming up on today ’s broadcast ; images from New Orleans that will literally move you ( dramatic pause ) to tears . ”
“ We interviewed this man , whose house was completely destroyed .
Watch now as he becomes so overwhelmed , that he just breaks down ( dramatic pause ) in front of your very eyes . ”
" Here are the EXCLUSIVE , and let me repeat that , EXCLUSIVE images of Oprah inside what has become , and I never thought I ’d say this folks , an American refugee camp .
We had to turn the cameras off because she was too overwhelmed ( dramatic pause ) to carry on . ”

These are just a few examples of the sorts of phrases that were being hurled at the American viewers ; I think you get the idea .
They could n’t film anyone without zooming in on their tears , or at the very least explaining that as soon as the cameras had stopped rolling the person burst into tears .
It felt as if there might as well have just been a constant running line of large , bold text at the bottom of the screen saying :
“ Cry !!!
Cry you bastards !!!
Are you crying yet ?
Come on , cry !!!
If you were a real American you would be sobbing like an injured child by now !!! ”
For my mind though the best part was just before the advert break ( after having just seen some genuinely harrowing images of the flooded city ) :
“ [ Subdued tone , and solemn face ]
My God , it really puts things into to perspective does n’t it …
Up next , is crazy wild - child Paris Hilton really having a baby ? ”
There is a reason why a terrifying number of Americans cannot point out Africa on a world map , think that Tony Blair is married to the Queen , and that we Brits really do drop absolutely everything that we ’re doing at 3 o’clock for a spot of tea and a scone .
It ’s also , more importantly , the very same reason that they think that all Arab and Muslims are basically split into one of two groups :
They either love the west , and want nothing more than to passionately embrace its sweet democracy with all their hearts , or they are an Islamic terrorist who just wants to behead Americans .
The irony is so great that it almost makes you sick to your stomach .
How can a country that is so proud and passionate about freedom that they are willing to whole - heartedly support a war , causing young troops and innocent civilians to die in their thousands , saving some primitive desert - folk from a nasty totalitarian dictator , so that they too can bask in the kind of freedom that the happy Americans enjoy , be so blissfully unaware of just how dictated they themselves are ?
In a country where the news tells you how to feel , is freedom even possible ?
Is all my
information safe ?

WPost 's Enduring Bush Cover-up
In a kind of Watergate in reverse , the Washington Post has rallied once again to defend George W. Bush ’s honesty , with the paper ’s editorial - page editor swatting away the latest swarm of evidence showing how the President took the nation to war in Iraq via a series of lies .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Much as the rival Washington Star in the 1970s let itself be used by Richard Nixon to muddy the Watergate waters – obscuring the mounting evidence of his guilt – now Washington Post editor Fred Hiatt and the newspaper ’s hierarchy have lent themselves to the task of covering up Bush ’s deceptions about the Iraq War .
This pattern started with the Post ’s full - throated endorsement of the false pre-war intelligence on Iraq , continued with its ugly attacks on early war critics like former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , and has carried over to Hiatt ’s latest attempt to discredit the Senate Intelligence Committee ’s critical findings on Bush ’s deceptions .
In his June 9 op - ed , entitled “ ‘ Bush Lied ? ’
If Only It Were That Simple , ” Hiatt seeks to separate Bush ’s pre-war statements about Iraq – both its alleged WMD stockpiles and Saddam Hussein ’s supposed ties to Islamic terrorists – from the historical context : the war fever that Bush created and exploited .
Hiatt argues that it ’s unfair to say Bush lied when there was some intelligence buttressing his public case .
In other words , Hiatt advances the argument , long used by Bush apologists , that the President was deceived by the faulty information just like so many others , both Republican and Democrat .
Hiatt notes that Sen. Jay Rockefeller , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee which issued the June 5 report critical of Bush ’s use of the intelligence , also bought into the false WMD claims in fall 2002 .
Hiatt writes : “ The phony ‘ Bush lied ’ story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure : the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which Bush and Rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically , catastrophically wrong . ”
But Hiatt ’s selective history ignores the real story of how the Iraq War was sold , a case in which all the participants shared in propagating the falsehoods while still benefiting from enough ambiguity so they could point the finger at others .
It was like a modern - day execution with the task divvied up into interlocking parts – strapping down the prisoner , inserting the IV , preparing the chemicals , and releasing them .
That way , each participant can deny full responsibility if it turns out that the prisoner was innocent and the death was wrongful .
In much the same way , by saying Bush did n’t lie – he was just deceived by erroneous intelligence – Hiatt advances the argument that no one is really at fault .
All Are Guilty Yet , in the case of the bloody invasion of Iraq – committed under false pretenses and leading to the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis – the truth is that all the participants are guilty .
The sequence of responsibility went like this : -- Bush and his neoconservative allies long had lusted for a decisive war against Iraq , plotting such an event from Bush ’s very first days in office ; -- The 9/11 attacks and the subsequent victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan created a supportive political environment for a wider war ; -- The neocon - backed Iraqi National Congress flooded the CIA with wave after wave of fabricated intelligence from supposed Iraqi defectors ; -- Neocons in the Pentagon and at the White House created their own ad hoc entities to collect and promote this bogus information ; -- CIA analysts , whose commitment to objectivity had been eroding under political pressure since the 1980s , understood that resistance to the false tales was hopeless and likely a career killer ; -- By summer 2002 , CIA Director George Tenet and other intelligence bureaucrats were making sure the finished analytical products fit with the political desires of the White House ( or as the Downing Street Memo revealed , the U.S. intelligence was being “ fixed ” around the policy ) ; -- By fall 2002 , President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior officials were hyping the alarmist intelligence , stripping the CIA reports of even the fig - leaf caveats that the analysts had tried to put on ; -- The administration worked hand - in - glove with neocon allies in the Washington press corps , including reporters at the New York Times and editorialists at the Washington Post , such as Hiatt , Charles Krauthammer and David Ignatius ; -- The few voices of dissent – in government and in the media – were shouted down and ridiculed along with long - time U.S. allies in France and Germany ; -- Even the administration ’s more moderate voices , the likes of Secretary of State Colin Powell , were recruited into the propaganda operation , helping to further marginalize and silence the remaining skeptics ; -- By the eve of war , Bush was the master of America ’s political domain , with most Washington politicians in his thrall and the U.S. press corps reduced to the role of excited cheerleaders applauding the shock - and - awe bombing .

Who ’s at Fault ?
Though this daisy chain of activists and enablers shared responsibility for the Iraq invasion , that does n’t wash the blood off the hands of the various participants , including Hiatt and other pro-war propagandists .
Nor does it mean that Bush is NOT a liar .
In fact , the overwhelming evidence is that Bush is a willful ( if not pathological ) liar , in that he repeatedly misrepresented evidence that he personally knew to be true .
While it may be impossible to say exactly what Bush believed about Iraq ’s non-existent WMD before the war , it ca n’t be seriously disputed that after the invasion , he rewrote the pre-war history to assert that Saddam Hussein “ chose ” war by not letting the United Nations inspectors in to check for WMD .
“ We gave him [ Saddam Hussein ] a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he would n’t let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power , ” Bush told reporters on July 14 , 2003 – less than four months after the invasion .
Facing no serious challenge from the White House press corps , Bush continued repeating this lie in varied forms as part of his public litany for defending the invasion .
On Jan. 27 , 2004 , for example , Bush said , “ We went to the United Nations , of course , and got an overwhelming resolution – 1441 – unanimous resolution , that said to Saddam , you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs , which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs .
He chose defiance .
It was his choice to make , and he did not let us in . ”
As the months and years went by , Bush ’s lie and its constant retelling took on the color of truth .
In the frequent repetition of this claim , Bush never acknowledged the fact that Hussein did comply with Resolution 1441 by declaring accurately that he had disposed of his WMD stockpiles and by permitting U.N. inspectors to examine any site of their choosing .
Prominent Washington journalists eventually began repeating Bush ’s lie as their own .
In a July 2004 interview , ABC ’s veteran newsman Ted Koppel used it to explain why he – Koppel – thought the invasion of Iraq was justified .
“ It did not make logical sense that Saddam Hussein , whose armies had been defeated once before by the United States and the Coalition , would be prepared to lose control over his country if all he had to do was say , ‘ All right , U.N. , come on in , check it out , ” Koppel told Amy Goodman , host of “ Democracy Now . ”
Of course , Hussein did tell the U.N. to “ come on in , check it out . ”
In fall 2002 , Hussein ’s government allowed teams of U.N. inspectors into Iraq and gave them free rein to examine any site of their choosing .
Then , on Dec. 7 , 2002 , Iraq sent to the United Nations a 12,000 - page declaration explaining how its WMD stockpiles had been eliminated .
At the time , the Bush administration – and much of the Washington press corps – mocked those efforts as proof that the Iraqis were continuing their WMD cover - up .
The U.N. inspections continued into March 2003 when Bush decided to press ahead with war and forced the inspectors to leave .
After the invasion , U.S. weapons inspectors also found no WMD and concluded that the Iraqis had been telling the truth .
The Plame - gate Affair
As the WMD search came up empty in summer 2003 , Bush and his inner circle continued their campaign to punish critics and confuse the public .
The most notorious case was the behind - the - scenes assault on the reputation of former Ambassador Wilson for daring to disclose that Bush had used a false claim in his 2003 State of the Union Address about Iraq obtaining yellowcake uranium from Niger .
As administration officials fanned out to disparage Wilson with friendly journalists , several of the leakers – including Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , White House political adviser Karl Rove and I .
Lewis Libby , Vice President Cheney ’s chief of staff – also divulged that Wilson ’s wife , Valerie Plame , worked for the CIA .
That leak , which surfaced in a Robert Novak column in the Washington Post on July 14 , 2003 , destroyed Plame ’s CIA career and jeopardized foreign nationals who had collaborated with her covert intelligence network .
In September 2003 , upset about this collateral damage , the CIA forwarded a criminal complaint to the Justice Department seeking an investigation into the outing of Plame .
As far as the CIA was concerned , her classified identity was covered by a 1982 law barring willful exposure of CIA officers who had “ served ” abroad in the preceding five years .
But Bush and his inner circle could still breathe easily since the probe was under the control of Attorney General John Ashcroft , considered to be a right - wing Bush ally .
The White House responded to press inquiries disingenuously , claiming Bush took the leak very seriously and would punish anyone involved .
“ The President has set high standards , the highest of standards , for people in his administration , ” press secretary Scott McClellan said on Sept. 29 , 2003 .
“ If anyone in this administration was involved in it , they would no longer be in this administration . ”
A Widening Cover -up Bush announced his determination to get to the bottom of the matter .
“ If there is a leak out of my administration , I want to know who it is , ” Bush said on Sept. 30 , 2003 .
“ I want to know the truth .
If anybody has got any information inside our administration or outside our administration , it would be helpful if they came forward with the information so we can find out whether or not these allegations are true . ”
Yet , even as Bush was professing his curiosity and calling for anyone with information to step forward , he was withholding the fact that he had authorized the declassification of some secrets about the Niger uranium issue and had ordered Cheney to arrange for those secrets to be given to reporters .
In other words , though Bush knew a great deal about how the anti-Wilson scheme got started – since he was involved in starting it – he uttered misleading public statements to conceal the White House role .
Also , since the other conspirators knew that Bush already was in the know , they would have read his comments as a signal to lie , which is what they did .
In early October , press secretary McClellan said he could report that political adviser Karl Rove and National Security Council aide Elliott Abrams were not involved in the Plame leak .
That comment riled Libby , who feared that he was being hung out to dry .
Libby went to his boss , Dick Cheney , and complained that “ they ’re trying to set me up ; they want me to be the sacrificial lamb , ” Libby ’s lawyer Theodore Wells later said .
Cheney scribbled down his feelings in a note to McClellan : “ Not going to protect one staffer + sacrifice the guy the Pres that was asked to stick his head in the meat grinder because of incompetence of others . ”
Cheney initially ascribed Libby ’s role in going after Wilson to Bush ’s orders , but the Vice President apparently thought better of it , crossing out “ the Pres ” and putting the clause in a passive tense .
Cheney has never explained publicly the meaning of his note , but it suggests that it was Bush who sent Libby out on the get - Wilson mission to limit damage from Wilson ’s criticism of Bush ’s false Niger - yellowcake claim .
If the Washington Post were still the newspaper it was in the 1970s , it would be building on this body of evidence to make the case that Bush not only lied to the public but committed serious crimes that harmed U.S. national security .
Instead Hiatt and the Post ’s editorial pages continue to cover up for a President who has abused his powers and misled the American people – a rear - guard protective role that once was assigned to the now - defunct Washington Star .

The Other Boleyn Girl may have been panned by critics , but it seems co-stars Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson have discovered other ways of pulling in audiences .
The stunning duo , attending the Berlin premiere of the film , shared more than just a giggle - as they took a moment to exchange a steamy kiss - while posing for pictures on the red carpet .
Scarlett Johansson ( left ) and Natalie Portman lock lips during the Berlinale Film Festival on Friday
The Hollywood sirens have obviously cultivated a close friendship since playing sisters on screen and were not afraid to show it as Natalie , 26 , leaned in to lock lips with the blonde bombshell .
Scarlett , 23 , looked more than happy to be the object of Natalie 's affections , showing off her cleavage in a 50's inspired fuscia - coloured dress , while the brunette opted for an equally sexy black lace number .
Perhaps Natalie 's bold move came as an attempt to change the public 's perception after recently proclaiming herself as " boring " .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Crude oil prices could rise to as high as $ 170 per barrel in the coming months but are unlikely to hit $ 200 and should ease towards the end of the year , OPEC President Chakib Khelil said in an interview on Thursday .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil holds a news conference at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels June 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Francois Lenoir
“ I forecast prices probably between $ 150 - 170 during this summer .
That will perhaps ease towards the end of the year , ” he told France 24 television , according to a text of the interview released by the station .
The comments came as crude prices neared $ 135 per barrel , after rising about 40 percent this year .
Khelil said he doubted prices would climb as high as $ 200 .
“ I think that the devaluation of the dollar against the euro , if everything goes as I think it will , will be of the order of perhaps 1 - 2 percent and this will probably generate an $ 8 rise in the price of oil , ” he said .
The head of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said it had been clearly established that speculation was impacting markets .
“ It ’s not a question , but a certainty .
The problem is the extent of that speculation on the market , ” he said , adding that the effect of the subprime crisis in the United States had affected oil markets .
Asked what the main factor behind the rise in prices had been , he replied : “ I think it ’s the devaluation of the dollar . ”
“ You can see , every time the dollar strengthens , there is a fall in prices , ” he said .
Khelil reiterated that OPEC , which represents 13 oil producing countries in Asia , Africa and the Middle East and South America , tried to meet the demands of the market , as its statutes required .
“ It ’s very difficult now to find a market .
If you tell me there is someone to whom we have n’t sold oil and who needs it , I ’d see , but right now I put my oil on the market and I do n’t find buyers , ” Khelil , who is also Algeria ’s energy minister said .
Asked whether OPEC could change its stance against increasing supply at its next meeting on September 9 , he said : “ Yes , of course , we will review the situation of the market , based on demand .
If there is real demand on the market , OPEC will take the necessary measures to satisfy that demand . ”

Wicked way of roasting whole garlic heads .
Start with 4 garlic heads - 1 per guest as a light main course .
Cut each head in half but do n't peel .
Pour a large glass olive oil inside an ovenproof dish and place each half garlic head flat in the oil .
Roast the oven for about an hour or until the garlic is soft throughout and nicely browned .
When ready , you 'll be able to lift the top halves of each garlic head like a hat ...

The Bush administation has covered up and ignored dissenting Pentagon war games analysis that suggests an attack on Iran ’s nuclear or military facilities will lead directly to the annihilation of the Navy ’s Fifth Fleet now stationed in the Persian Gulf .
Lt. General Paul Van Riper led a hypothetical Persian Gulf state in the 2002 Millennium Challenge wargames that resulted in the destruction of the Fifth Fleet .
His experience and conclusions regarding the vulnerability of the Fifth Fleet to an assymetrical military conflict and the implications for a war against Iran have been ignored .
Neoconservatives within the Bush administration are currently aggressively promoting a range of military actions against Iran that will culminate in it attacking the US Navy ’s Fifth Fleet with sophisticated cruise anti-ship missiles .
They are ignoring Van Riper ’s experiences in the Millennium Challenge and how it applies to the current nuclear conflict with Iran .
Iran has sufficient quantities of cruise missiles to destroy much or all of the Fifth Fleet which is within range of Iran ’s mobile missile launchers strategically located along its mountainous terrain overlooking the Persian Gulf .
The Bush administration is deliberately downplaying the vulnerability of the Fifth Fleet to Iran ’s advanced missile technology which has been purchased from Russia and China since the late 1990’s .
The most sophisticated of Iran ’s cruise missiles are the ‘ Sunburn ’ and ‘ Yakhonts ’ .
These are missiles against which U.S. military experts conclude modern warships have no effective defense .
By deliberately provoking an Iranian retaliation to U.S. military actions , the neoconservatives will knowingly sacrifice much or all of the Fifth Fleet .
This will culminate in a new Pearl Harbor that will create the right political environment for total war against Iran , and expanded military actions in the Persian Gulf region .
The Fifth Fleet ’s Vulnerability to Iran ’s Anti-Ship Missile Arsenal
The U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet is headquartered in the Gulf State of Bahrain which is responsible for patrolling the Persian Gulf , Arabian Sea , Suez Canal and parts of the Indian Ocean .
The Fifth Fleet currently comprises a carrier group and two helicopter carrier ships .
Its size peaked at five aircraft carrier groups and six helicopter carriers in 2003 during the invasion of Iraq .
Presently , it is led by the USS Enterprise ( CVN - 65 ) , the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier commissioned in 1961 , and on November 2 , began participating in a Naval exercise in the Persian Gulf .
The Fifth Fleet ’s base in Bahrain , is only 150 miles away from the Iranian coast , and would itself be in range of Iran ’s new generation of anti-ship cruise missiles .
Also , any Naval ships in the confined terrain of the Persian Gulf would have difficulty in maneuvering and would be within range of Iran ’s rugged coastline which extends all along the Persian Gulf to the Arabian sea .
Iran began purchasing advanced military technology from Russia soon after the latter pulled out in 2000 from the Gore - Chernomyrdin Protocol , which limited Russia ’s sales of military equipment to Iran .
Russia subsequently began selling Iran military technology that could be used in any military conflict with the U.S.
This included air defense systems and anti-ship cruise missiles in which Russia specialized to offset the U.S. large naval superiority .
The SS - N - 22 or ‘ Sunburn ” has a speed of Mach 2.5 or 1500 miles an hour , uses stealth technology and has a range up to 130 miles .
It contains a conventional warhead of 750 lbs that can destroy most ships .
Of even greater concern is Russia ’s SSN - X - 26 or ‘ Yakhonts ’ cruise missile which has a range of 185 miles which makes all US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf vulnerable to attack .
More importantly the Yakhonts has been specifically developed for use against Carrier groups , and has been sold by Russia on the international arms trade .
Both the Yakhonts and the Sunburn missiles are designed to defeat the Aegis radar defense currently used on U.S. Navy ships by using stealth technology and low ground hugging flying maneuvers .
In their final approaches these missiles take evasive maneuvers to defeat anti-ship missile defenses .
So great is the threat posed by the Sunburn , Yakhonts and other advanced anti-ship missiles being developed by Russia and sold to China , Iran and other countries , that the Pentagon ’s weapons testing office in 2007 moved to halt production on further aircraft carriers until an effective defense was developed .
Iran has purchased sufficient quantities of both the Sunbeam and Yakhonts to destroy much or all of the Fifth Fleet anywhere in the Persian Gulf from its mountainous coastal terrain .
Millennium Challenge Wargames
The “ Millennium Challenge ” was one of the largest wargames ever conducted and wargames involved 13,500 troops spread out at over 17 locations .
The wargames involved heavy usage of computer simulations , extended over a three week period and cost $ 250 million .
Millennium Challenge involved asymmetrical warfare between the U.S military forces , led by General William Kernan , and an unnamed state in the Persian Gulf .
According to General Kernan , the wargames “ would test a series of new war - fighting concepts recently developed by the Pentagon . ”
Using a range of asymmetrical attack strategies using disguised civilian boats for launching attacks , planes in Kamikaze attacks , and Silkworm cruise missiles , much of the Fifth Fleet was sunk .
The games revealed how asymmetrical strategies could exploit the Fifth Fleet ’s vulnerability against anti-ship cruise missiles in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf .
In a controversial decision , the Pentagon decided to simply ‘ refloat ’ the Fifth Fleet to continue the exercise which led to the eventual defeat of the Persian Gulf state .
The sinking of the Fifth Fleet was ignored and the wargames declared a success for the “ new war - fighting concepts ” adopted by Gen. Kernan .
This led to Lt General Paul Van Riper , the commander of the mythical Gulf State , calling the official results “ empty sloganeering ” .
In a later television interview , General Riper declared “ when the concepts that the command was testing failed to live up to their expectations , the command at that point began to script the exercise in order to prove these concepts .
This was my critical complaint . ”
Most significant was General Riper ’s claims of the effectiveness of the older Cruise missile technology , the Silkworm missile which were used to sink an aircraft carrier and two helicopter - carriers loaded with marines in the total of 16 ships sunk .
When asked to confirm Riper ’s claims , General Kernar replied : “ Well , I do n’t know .
To be honest with you .
I have n’t had an opportunity to assess what happened .
But that ’s a possibility …
The specifics of the cruise - missile piece …
I really ca n’t answer that question .
We ’ll have to get back to you ” .
The Millennium Challenge wargames clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of the US Fifth Fleet to Silkworm cruise missile attacks .
This replicated the experience of the British during the 1980 Falklands war where two ships were sunk by three Exocet missiles .
Both the Exocet and Silkworm cruise missiles were an older generation of anti-ship missile technology that were far surpassed by the Sunburn and Yakhonts missiles .
If the Millennium Challenge was a guide to an asymmetrical war with Iran , much of the U.S Fifth Fleet would be destroyed .
It is not surprising Millennium Challenge was eventually scripted so that this embarrassing fact was hidden .
To date , there has been little public awareness of the vulnerability of the US Fifth Fleet while stationed in the Persian Gulf .
It appears that the Bush administration had scripted an outcome to the wargames that would promote its neoconservative agenda for the Middle East .
The Neo-Conservative Strategy to Attack Iran
Neoconservatives share a political philosophy that US dominance of the international system as the world ’s sole superpower needs to be extended indefinitely into the 21st century .
In early 2006 neoconservatives within the Bush administration began vigorously promoting a new war against Iran due to the alleged threat posed by its nuclear development program .
Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear development is lawful and in compliance with the Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Since 2004 , The Bush administration has been citing intelligence data that Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and must under no circumstances be allowed to do this .
Much of Iran ’s nuclear development has occurred in underground facilities built at a depth of 70 feet with hardened concrete overhead that protect them from any known conventional attack .
This led to the Bush administration arguing in early 2006 that tactical nuclear weapons would need to be used to take out Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
This culminated in a fierce debate between leading neo-conservatives such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , with the Joint Chiefs of Staff which remained adamantly opposed .
Seymour Hersh in May 2006 , reported the opposition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . ’
Subsequent efforts by the neo-conservatives to justify a conventional military attack have been handicapped by widespread public skepticism by the threat posed by Iran ’s nuclear program , and Iran ’s compliance with the Nonproliferation Treaty according to Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the IAEA .
ElBaradei cites U.S. military assessments that Iran is a few years away from developing weapons grade nuclear fuel that could be used for nuclear weapons .
The Bush administration , frustrated by the determined opposition both within the U.S bureaucracy , military and the international community to its plans has adopted a three pronged track strategy for its goal of ‘ taking out ’
Iran .
The first strategy is to drive up public perceptions of an international security crisis by warning of a Third World War if Iran ’s nuclear program is not stopped .
In a Press Conference speech on October 17 , President Bush declared : “ if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them [ Iranians ] from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
Bush ’s startling rhetoric was followed soon after by Vice President Cheney on October 23 who warned in a speech that the US and its allies were " prepared to impose serious consequences " on Iran . :
The second strategy has been shift emphasis from removing Iran ’s nuclear facilities , to emphasizing its support for terrorism .
Given widespread military and political opposition to attacks on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , the Bush administration is now depicting Iran as a supporter of terrorism in Iraq . ”
The change in strategy was given a powerful boost by the passage of the Kyle - Lieberman Amendment by the U.S. Senate on September 26 which designated “ the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization ” .
This would enable the Bush administration to authorize strikes against Iranian Revolutionary Guard facilities inside Iran on the basis that they are supporting Iraqi terrorist groups targeting U.S. military forces .
The third and most dangerous strategy used by the Bush administration is to sanction a covert mission that would create the necessary political environment for a war against Iran .
This is arguably best evidenced in the infamous B - 52 ‘ Bent Spear ’ incident on August 30 , 2007 where five ( later changed to six ) nuclear armed cruise missiles were found en route to the Middle East for a covert mission .
The nuclear warheads had adjustable yields of between 5 to 150 kilotons , and would have been ideal for use against Iran ’s underground nuclear facilities or in a false flag operation that would be blamed on Iran .
However , Air Force personnel stood down ‘ illegal ’ orders that most likely came from the White House , and averted what could have been the detonation of one or more nuclear devices in the Persian Gulf region .
Consequences of Iran being Attacked
In an effort to intimidate Iran , the Bush administration has regularly placed two aircraft carrier group formations in the Persian Gulf .
The size and timing of possible U.S. military attacks on Iran ’s nuclear and / or military facilities , will influence the speed and scale of an Iranian response .
Iran ’s response will predictably result in a military escalation that culminates in Iran using its arsenal of anti-ship cruise missiles on the U.S. Fifth Fleet and closing off the Strait of Hormuz to all shipping .
Iran ’s ability to hide and launch cruise missiles from mountainous positions all along the Persian Gulf will make all Fifth Fleet ships in the Persian Gulf vulnerable .
The Fifth Fleet would be trapped and unable to escape to safer waters .
The Millennium Challenge wargames in 2002 witnessed the sinking of most of the Fifth fleet .
If an attack on Iran were to occur before the end of 2007 , it would lead to the destruction of the USS Enterprise with its complement of 5000 personnel on board .
Further losses in terms of support ships and other Fifth Fleet naval forces in the Persian Gulf would be catastrophic .
An Iranian cruise missile attack would replicate losses at Pearl Harbor where the sinking of five ships , destruction of 188 aircraft and deaths of 2,333 quickly led to a declaration of total war against Imperial Japan by the U.S. Congress .
The declaration of total war against Iran by the U.S. Congress would lead to a sustained bombing campaign and eventual military invasion to bring about regime change in Iran .
Military conscription would occur in order to provide personnel for the invasion of Iran , and to support U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan that would come under greater pressure .
Tensions would rapidly escalate with other major powers such as Russia and China who have supplied Iran with sophisticated weapons systems that could be used against U.S. military assets .
The closing of the Strait of Hormuz to all shipping and total war conditions in the U.S. would lead to a collapse of the world economy , and further erosion of civil liberties in a U.S. engaged in total war .
Conclusions
The above scenario is very plausible given the military capacities of Iran ’s anti-ship cruise missiles and the U.S. Navy ’s vulnerability to these while operating in the Persian Gulf .
The Bush administration has hidden from the American public the full extent of the Fifth Fleet ’s vulnerability , and how it could be trapped and destroyed in a full scale conflict with Iran .
This is best evidenced by the controversial decision to downplay the real results of the Millennium Challenge wargames and the dissenting views of Lt. General Van Riper over the lessons to be learned .
This culminated in General Van Riper joining a group of retired generals in calling for the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld .
Neo -conservatives within the Bush administration are fully aware of the vulnerability of the Fifth Fleet , yet have at times tried to place up to three carrier groups in the Persian Gulf which would only augment U.S. losses in any war with Iran .
Yet the Bush administration has still attempted to move forward with plans for nuclear , conventional and / or covert attacks on Iran which would precipitate much of the terrible scenario described above .
A reasonable conclusion to draw is that neoconservatives within the Bush administration are willing to sacrifice much or all of the U.S. Fifth Fleet by militarily provoking Iran to launch its anti-ship cruise missile arsenal in order to justify ‘ total war ’ against Iran , and force regime change .
A new Pearl Harbor can be averted by making accountable Bush administration officials willing to sacrifice the Fifth Fleet in pursuit of a neoconservative agenda .
Yahoo is rolling back security and anti-spam enhancements to its Webmail service because they interfered with users ' ability to retrieve POP e-mail from external accounts .
Yahoo tried for about a week to solve the problem , which arose after it beefed up spam filtering and added SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) capabilities to Yahoo Mail 's POP ( Post Office Protocol ) functionality .
However , whatever caused the problem has proven harder to solve than anticipated , so Yahoo has decided to roll back the anti-spam and SSL features .
The goal is to restore the affected POP retrieval capabilities and add the new features later , once the problem has been properly identified and solved .
Yahoo Mail is a company crown jewel and a key piece of its ambitious plans to boost advertising , increase traffic , attract more developers and better compete by giving its users a " social profile " dashboard to unify and manage their Yahoo services .
A week - long , ultimately unresolved problem affecting Yahoo Mail users hampers the turnaround effort and comes at a bad time , particularly with the upheaval around Microsoft 's acquisition offer and a looming shareholder proxy fight to oust current board members .
The rollback of the SSL and anti-spam features is under way and will take " a few days " to reach all users , wrote Ryan Knight , Yahoo Mail Community Manager , in a blog posting Monday afternoon .
" What this means is that your ability to retrieve from these accounts should be completely restored , however it also means that we will be rolling back the recently added option to use SSL .
If you have added an account that requires SSL , retrieval from that account will no longer be possible , " Knight wrote .
Yahoo Mail user Mike Bradley , a Realtor from Littleton , Colorado , thinks Yahoo waited too long to pull the new features and could have done a better job communicating updates about the situation .
" As soon as there were reports of problems , they should have rolled back immediately instead of waiting a week .
Also , they should have updated the blog more frequently , " he said via e-mail Tuesday afternoon .
" The most frustrating thing is to not know what 's happening , and frequently updated communication could have made for a better interaction with those of us affected . "
Bradley , who uses Yahoo Mail both for work and personal communications , first noticed the POP problems last Wednesday .
" ' Server busy ' error messages lasted two days , then I started getting time out messages for two days , then I started to get mail slowly , but not all my mail , " Bradley said .
He noticed that not all messages were making it to his Yahoo account because he also gets his e-mail on his cell phone .
" That 's still happening today , and this morning I got the ' server busy ' pop -up error message again .
It 's slowly coming back to life but when I retrieve email , nothing appears in my inbox for 5 - 10 minutes after the ' checking e- mail ' message disappears , " said Bradley , an otherwise satisfied Yahoo Mail user since 1995 .
Knight first acknowledged the problem in the Yahoo Mail blog on June 3 , when he informed users that the company 's engineers were already rolling out a fix .
The problem persisted , however , and on June 6 Knight wrote that , despite the fix , outstanding issues remained and that Yahoo would continue seeking a solution .
He also explained the new features whose rollout led to the problems : " Recently we made some changes to how external account retrieval works .
Most notably we added SSL functionality ( enhanced security technology ) , which many users have been clamoring for .
We are also taking steps to improve spam blocking for messages that are being retrieved from these external accounts , by running them through more aggressive filters .
Unfortunately we encountered some unexpected problems that lead to server errors or processes timing out for some users , " he wrote .
On Tuesday afternoon Yahoo spokeswoman Kelley Podboy confirmed that Monday 's blog posting from Knight contained the most recent information available about the issue .
" We are also sending direct e-mail to all users who have recently enabled SSL external accounts to notify them of the change , " Podboy said via e-mail .
Yahoo Mail has two POP - related services , according to Podboy .
One is " POP in , " a free service for retrieving messages from external accounts , which is the one affected .
Another is " POP out , " for downloading messages using a desktop e-mail application , such as Outlook , and accessing them offline .
The latter service is unaffected by the problem and available as a premium feature to Yahoo Mail users who pay US $ 19.99 per year for the service 's " Plus " plan , she said .
Both services are available to users of Yahoo Mail Classic and the New Yahoo Mail .
Another Web giant faced technical problems in recent days : Amazon 's main site had availability and performance problems on Friday and Monday .
Fisker Automotive is n't wasting any time getting its Karma plug - in hybrid on the road .
Five months after pulling the wraps off the car at the Detroit auto show , it 's flogging a test mule in Southern California .
The pictures offer the best evidence yet that Henrik Fisker is serious about getting the $ 80,000 sedan into showrooms by the end of next year , and they 're a shot across the bow of Tesla Motors as the two companies race to bring the first high - performance four - door hybrid to market .
Fisker is n't saying anything about what 's under the hood of the prototype , but we know the company is working with Quantum Technologies on a series parallel drivetrain that will use an electric motor to drive the wheels and an internal combustion engine to charge the lithium - ion batteries .
Autocar says it could be a 1.4 liter Volkswagen engine , but all Henrik Fisker would tell us , through a spokesman , is " the car MAY have a German engine that turns the generator . "
Clearly the company is n't allowing itself to be distracted by its legal fight with Tesla , which has filed a lawsuit claiming Fisker agreed to design Tesla 's WhiteStar sedan , then cribbed from its confidential files to design the Karma .
Fisker calls the suit nonsense .

3 Hidden Costs of High Oil Prices
May 28th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
As a barrel of oil hovers around $ 130 , the news has been bombarding us with the obvious effects of high oil prices .
As most people weep at the pump , some environmentalists are rejoicing .
Gas consumption is down , but there are additional hidden costs to high gas prices that leave even green minded folks with a frown .
1 - Difficult to Extract Oil & High Environmental Impact
High oil prices are making it economically viable to utilize oil that is difficult to extract .
One example of this is just north of the border .
In the U.S. , our single biggest source of foreign oil is from Canada .
Although this may be reassuring from a foreign policy standpoint , much of this oil comes with a steep environmental price tag .
Known as tar sands oil , 2 tons of sand are needed to produce one barrel of oil in a very resource and energy intensive process .
One technique that is used is to mine the sand leaves huge holes in the earth and devastates the ecosystem .
Another technique involves injecting steam underground , requiring large amounts of energy .
Tar sands oil generates 2 - 3 times the greenhouse gas when compared to conventional oil .
“ It is quit alarming from an ecological standpoint , ” said David Fields of Greenpeace Canada .
“ Developing the tar sand will make it impossible for us to effectively tackle climate change .
2 - Difficult to Extract Oil is an Unreliable Supply
There are reasons why many sources of oil were overlooked in the past .
Some are in areas that are populated , making it difficult to obtain permits .
Other oil reserves rely on large amounts of energy , making the operation vulnerable to fluctuating energy costs .
Going back to the Canadian tar sands example , large quantities of natural gas are needed to extract this oil .
In the cool Canadian climate , large amounts of natural gas are also used to heat homes .
If natural gas prices spike or Canadians prioritize conservation of natural gas reserves over short - term profits , this source of oil could dry up .
3 - Oil Companies are More Powerful as Profits Increase
In 2007 , Exxon made nearly $ 1300 a second in profits .
With record high corporate profits , Exxon reported annual earning of $ 40.61 billion .
While Americans are spending at the pump , the power of this company is increasing .
Unfortunately , some of the companies that are rolling in dough are not necessarily ideal corporate citizens .
Exxon has refused to pay court ordered fines for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 to help compensate the fishermen for loss of their livelihood .
The company has also supported groups that question global warming , a practice that has even been criticized by other oil companies .
The political power of oil companies is staggering and is a special interest that is often not in line with what is best for society .
The oil industry has donated $ 180 million to political candidates since 1989 .
89 % of political donations made by Exxon went to republican candidates .
As with all complex situations , there are numerous positive and negative aspects .
What other hidden factors do you find noteworthy ?

Judge rejects Army Corps of Engineers immunity over Katrina Associated Press
Published : Saturday May 3 , 2008

Print This Email This By CAIN BURDEAU NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) 
The Army Corps of Engineers can be held liable for flood damage caused by a " hurricane highway , " a navigation channel that is believed to have funneled Hurricane Katrina 's storm surge into the city , a federal judge ruled Friday .
The Corps of Engineers had argued that it was immune from liability because the channel is part of New Orleans ' flood control system .
The law says the federal government cannot be sued if something goes wrong with a flood control project such as a levee , reservoir or dam .
Judge Stanwood Duval dismissed that argument , saying the Mississippi River - Gulf Outlet , or MRGO , was clearly a ship channel and not a flood control project .
Plaintiffs ' lawyers said Duval 's decision is a victory for homeowners , who have suffered setbacks in their efforts to hold the government legally responsible for storm damage .
They also said it clears the way for a Sept. 8 trial .
The corps " threw everything they had at us , every legal argument they had , their spin on the facts , " said Pierce O'Donnell , one of the lead plaintiffs ' attorneys .
In January , Duval ruled that the corps was entitled to immunity over flood damage from levee breaches elsewhere in New Orleans .
The government had claimed its immunity should extend to the MRGO , but Duval said that channel and the levee system are separate projects with different funding methods and purposes .
" The United States should not be immunized for a tort which occurred from an activity unrelated to a flood control project , " Duval wrote Friday .
" Taken to its logical conclusion , such a policy would yield absurd results . "
Duval heard arguments from lawyers on both sides in March .
Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Justice Department , said he could n't immediately comment on Duval 's ruling because the department was still reviewing it .
Duval issued a similar ruling in February 2007 , when he denied a motion by the government to dismiss the case .
Friday 's ruling was significant because Duval was not swayed by subsequent testimony or by evidence the corps brought to have the case thrown out .
The MRGO suit was filed by five residents whose homes flooded after the August 2005 hurricane .
The suit charges the agency with ignoring repeated warnings that the MRGO turned into a " hurricane highway , " funneling Katrina 's storm surge into St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans and overwhelming levees and flood walls .
The 76 - mile shipping channel was built about 40 years ago as a shortcut to New Orleans .
For years , environmentalists and emergency planners have blasted the channel as a destructive force because it has eroded enormous tracts of wetlands and increased the threat of flooding .
The Corps of Engineers has acknowledged that the channel contributed to the region 's flooding , and the agency is coming up with a plan to plug it .

Sawt al - Iraq reports in Arabic on the statement about US troop withdrawals of Humam Hamoudi .
Hamoudi , a Shiite cleric and member of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , heads the Foreign Relations Committee in the Iraqi parliament .
He met with a number of American officials on Monday , and expressed his conviction that a studied withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq is the foundation of any security agreement with the USA .
He told David Satterfield and Gen. Mark Kimmit of the “ necessity to safeguard the sovereignty of Iraq and to arrive at an agreement that would gain the assent of the Iraqi people and the support of the parliamentary blocks .
The studied withdrawal of foreign forces would be foundational to such an agreement . ”
Hamoudi ’s party , ISCI , has been among the main US allies in Iraq and is the cornerstone of what little power Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has .
If he is talking about the need to build a plan for a deliberate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq into any security agreement , imagine how the groups that distrust the US feel .
Al - Zaman reports in Arabic that families in the destitute al - Ansar quarter of Najaf are complaining about the raw sewage that comes into their district , and saying they believe it is implicated in the recent deaths of 25 persons of cancer in the one square kilometer neighborhood .
On how you wo n’t see most of this on t.v. :
Reuters reports other political violence in Iraq on Tuesday :
Last week I wrote a very popular post about discrimination based on physical appearance and its negative effect on workers ’ salaries .
Continuing to build on that theme , I ’d like to talk today about the Supreme Court ’s ruling on Ledbetter v. Goodyear ( 2007 ) .
Slate Magazine gives a great summary of the circumstances surrounding the Lilly Ledbetter suit against her employer , Goodyear Tire :
“ Ledbetter worked for Goodyear Tire in Atlanta for almost 20 years .
When she retired , she was , according to Ginsburg , “ the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark : Ledbetter was paid $ 3,727 per month ; the lowest paid male area manager received $ 4,286 per month , the highest paid , $ 5,236 . ”
So she filed a suit under Title VII , and a jury awarded her more than $ 3 million in damages .
The jury found it “ more likely than not that [ Goodyear ] paid [ Ledbetter ] a [ n ] unequal salary because of her sex . ”
You see , Ledbetter had n’t just negotiated herself some lame salary .
She was expressly barred by her employer from discussing her salary with her co-workers who were racking up raises and bonuses she did n’t even know about .
She found out about the disparity between her pay and her male colleagues ’ earnings only because someone finally left her an anonymous tip . ”
Title VII , one of several legislative measures passed under the landmark Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , prohibits discrimination based on “ race , color , religion , sex or national origin . ”
Ledbetter had a strong case for pay discrimination .
She was underpaid by a significant amount compared to male co-workers at the same level , even though she was one of the more tenured employees .
She could prove a pattern of harassment by male supervisors , several of whom testified to such at trial , and had an anonymous note informing her of almost 20 years of blatant discrimination and withholding of pay toward her .
However , the Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 that Ledbetter ’s jury verdict should be overturned and her $ 3 million in back pay and damages returned , because she did not file suit within 180 days of the first occurrence of discrimination ( i.e. her very first paycheck ) .
On April 23 , 2008 , the United States Senate decided to veto a bill that would overturn the ruling and let the 180 day statue of limitations period on filing for discrimination stand .
It seems the lawmakers of our country find nothing wrong with pay discrimination based on gender , asserting that women should be able to pick up on it within 6 months of being hired .
Possible reasons for their decision include :
The U.S. Senate blocked a bill that would allow victims of gender discrimination to learn of and prove discrimination in those rare cases in which their employers do n’t cheerfully discuss it with them at the office Christmas party .
And the reasons for blocking it include the fact that women are not smart enough to file timely lawsuits , not smart enough to avoid being manipulated by vile plaintiffs ’ lawyers , not smart enough to know when they are being stiffed , and — per John McCain — not well - trained enough in the first place to merit equal pay .
The real reason this ruling is so ludicrous and essentially a slap in the face to the “ equal pay for equal work ” movement , is that most workers , not just women , have no idea what their co-workers make .
In some offices , like Goodyear , discussing salary is specifically forbidden .
If you do n’t know what your peers are making , how are you supposed to know that you are making less ?
How do you prove a pattern of discrimination if you ’re only allowed to track 5 – 6 months worth of wages ?
I have always been a staunch proponent in keeping your salary to yourself .
On the occasion that I do find out what some of my co-workers make , I usually only feel resentful and underpaid .
But lately , I ’ve been wondering if I should change my stance on that .
The advocates for sharing salary are deeply divided .
Some people advocate complete secrecy , while others propose something as radical and open as writing down everyone ’s salary on a list and posting it up in the office breakroom .
According to our own laws , such as the National Labor Relations
Act , employees are guaranteed the right to know what everyone makes :
The NLRA says employers cannot interfere with , restrain or coerce employees in exercising their rights under NLRA , which protects the employees ’ right to discuss their “ wages , hours , and other terms and conditions of employment ” for their “ mutual aid or protection . ”
Because , really , who benefits from workers not knowing what others in their field make ?
Their employers .
With mid-year performance reviews rolling around , I think I might start doing some research on payscale.com .
Maybe it ’s time for me to negotiate a higher salary .
The Clintons have never understood how to exit the stage gracefully .
Their repertoire has always been deficient in grace and class .
So there was Hillary Clinton cold - bloodedly asserting to USA Today that she was the candidate favored by “ hard - working Americans , white Americans , ” and that her opponent , Barack Obama , the black candidate , just ca n’t cut it with that crowd .
“ There ’s a pattern emerging here , ” said Mrs. Clinton .
There is , indeed .
There was a name for it when the Republicans were using that kind of lousy rhetoric to good effect : it was called the Southern strategy , although it was hardly limited to the South .
Now the Clintons , in their desperation to find some way  any way  back to the White House , have leapt aboard that sorry train .
He ca n’t win !
Do n’t you understand ?
He ’s black !
He ’s black !
The Clintons have been trying to embed that gruesomely destructive message in the brains of white voters and superdelegates for the longest time .
It ’s a grotesque insult to African - Americans , who have given so much support to both Bill and Hillary over the years .
( Representative Charles Rangel of New York , who is black and has been an absolutely unwavering supporter of Senator Clinton ’s White House quest , told The Daily News : “ I ca n’t believe Senator Clinton would say anything that dumb . ” )

‘ Snow Leopard ’ at WWDC
Cory Bohon at TUAW breaks the news :
TUAW has received some information that suggests Apple may be working to seed developers with an early build of Mac OS X 10.6 at this year ’s WWDC .
10.6 will not include any new significant features from 10.5 ; instead , Apple is focusing solely on “ stability and security . ”
We have also learned that OS X 10.6 may go gold master by December 2008 in an effort to start shipping it in January ‘09 at Macworld Expo .
Mac OS X 10.6 will be a milestone release for Apple , as it will leave the PowerPC behind : a fully 64 - bit clean , Intel - only Mac OS X .
I ’ve seen a lot of initial skepticism regarding this report , for obvious reasons : it seems too soon since Leopard shipped for another major Mac OS X release , and too soon to drop support for PowerPC .
But after poking around this morning , I think Bohon ’s report is correct .
Update :
And that includes Apple putting a seed in developers ’ hands next week at WWDC .
Update 2 : I should also add that I ’ve heard nothing about a projected ship date ; TUAW ’s on their own with that January release date .
Given Leopard ’s scheduling slip , I do n’t expect Apple to announce a date publicly at WWDC .
In short , if you ’ve ever wished that Apple would spend more time focusing on making existing parts of the OS work better rather than adding new features , this is going to be the release for you .
Sounds great to me .
A big part of the effort , from what I ’m hearing , is unifying the various branches of OS X at Apple : Mac OS X , iPhone OS , Apple TV , etc .
There ’s no good version number to describe a release like this .
Based on previous Mac OS X version numbers , “ 10.5.5 ” would mean “ the next minor bug - fix update after 10.5.4 ” , but “ 10.6 ” would mean “ major new feature update ” .
This release is neither of those things .
Mac OS X 10.1 is the most analogous fit , historically .
1
But the name of this new release , which I ’ve heard from several sources , fits perfectly : Snow Leopard .
Like Leopard , but cooler , and adapted for a specific environment .
I would n’t be surprised if Steve Jobs does n’t even mention the number 10.6 , and refers to the OS only by name .
I still think it seems too soon by at least a year to drop PowerPC support — especially for G5s , which are still extremely capable machines by today ’s standards — but that ’s the word on the street .
The big unknown is price .
It does n’t sound right to charge $ 129 for an update whose changes are mostly ( completely ? ) architectural .
But it sounds too good to be true that it might be a free update , like 10.1 was .
My gut feeling says something like $ 29 for 10.5 users , but that ’s just my hunch .
The theorem itself was expressed as a commuting hypercube , one of the Niah 's favorite forms .
You could think of a square with four different sets of mathematical objects associated with each of its corners , and a way of mapping one set into another associated with each edge of the square .
If the maps commuted , then going across the top of the square , then down , had exactly the same effect as going down the left edge of
the square , then across : either way , you mapped each element from the top - left set into the same element of the bottom - right set .
A similar kind of result might hold for sets and maps that could naturally be placed at the corners and edges of a cube , or a hypercube of any dimension .
It was also possible for the square faces in these structures to stand for relationships that held between the maps between sets , and for cubes to describe relationships between those relationships , and so on .
That a theorem took this form did n't guarantee its importance ; it was easy to cook up trivial examples of sets and maps that commuted .
The Niah did n't carve trivia into their timeless ceramic , though , and this theorem was no exception .
The seven - dimensional commuting hypercube established a dazzlingly elegant correspondence between seven distinct , major branches of Niah mathematics , intertwining their most important concepts into a uniﬁed whole .
It was a result Joan had never seen before : no mathematician anywhere in the Amalgam , or in any ancestral culture she had studied , had reached the same insight .

We May be Facing a Fall Stock Market Disaster
It has been almost ten full months now since the Fed first lowered interest rates .
If you remember at first there was a lot excitement over the Fed cuts .
The DOW and Nasdaq rallied to new 52 - week highs a few weeks after the first rate cut in September .
The rally and promise of more Fed intervention for the market made many big name commentators extremely optimistic about the market .
But just a few weeks later the market turned lower and has been stuck in a bear market ever since .
The banking problems multiplied and inflation skyrocketed with oil rising almost double in price now from where it was a year ago .
The rate cuts tasted good at first , but are no longer palatable .
When thinking about the financial markets sometimes it is best to take stock of things before trying to look ahead and decide if you need to make changes to your portfolio or figure out where to look for the best investment opportunities .
A lot can be learned about looking at where the market was a year ago and comparing it to today .
A year ago from today the DOW , S&P 500 , and Nasdaq were all climbing higher .
They had experienced a fast and furious correction that took the S&P 500 down over seven percent in February of 2007 .
The financial media blamed that quick correction on " credit worries , " a fast drop in the dollar versus the yen , and a huge correction in the Chinese stock market .
Rumors also circulated that some billion dollar Bear Stearns hedge funds were in trouble .
Over the next few months as the market went higher everyone thought that all of these problems were gone .
Then the financial press started to focus on oil prices that were making new highs and the threat to inflation that they posed .
In July the market peaked as talk intensified that the Fed might actually start to raise interest rates by the end of the year .
Indeed Fed fund futures a year ago were pricing in rates hikes by the end of 2007 .
Fed officials gave repeated speeches and statements that sounded hawkish on interest rates .
At the same time though the drop in real estate prices started to pick up and the value in " subprime " mortgage securities went into collapse .
Rumors abounded that several large hedge funds were in trouble .
The Fed publicly ignored all of this .
At its August FOMC meeting they released a more hawkish statement on inflation to prepare the way to raise rates .
The market dropped hard that day and James Cramer blasted the Federal Reserve and Ben Bernanke on TV for knowing " nothing . "
His statement was one of the most watched moments in financial TV reporting as people watched it millions of times on the Internet .
At that moment he was right .
Within two weeks the market went into a mini-crash and the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate in what looked like a panic move .
The value of " subprime " securities went to zero .
They are still being counted as " level three " assets on the balance sheets of some of the world 's largest banks but in reality they are worthless and have been worthless since last August .
The Fed changed course 180 % degrees in August and began to slash rates in September .
It continued its rate cutting campaign and has lowered rates in the past ten months at the fastest rate than it ever has before in history - faster than it did even during the Great Depression .
Since then we have seen the " credit crisis " worsen .
We have seen the economy slow down , real estate prices continue to drop , inflation explode , and the Fed print about 30 billion dollars and hand that money to JP Morgan so that it could buy Bear Stearns and prevent a potential systemic bank run .
What a roller coaster !
And it ai n't over yet folks .
You can expect to see more volatility and the overall downward bias in the financial markets to continue the rest of the year .
What I want you to do right now though is think about the situation last year and how it compares with today .
Just like in June of 2007 , right now we can look back on this year and see a big correction behind us .
Just like the correction in February of 2007 , this one we saw in the first quarter was linked to credit problems and the unwinding of the real estate bubble .
And just like then we have seen the market rally after that correction and lots of big name experts come out and declare the worst behind us .
For instance Abby Cohen of Goldman Sachs claims that there is going to be a second half economic boom that will make the stock market rise much higher than it is now into the end of the year .
Things are certainly different right now than they were last year .
The US is in a bear market right now whereas last year it was approaching the tail end of a cyclical bull market .
That is a huge difference .
But there is one important similarity that you need to focus on right now .
At this time last year most people were worried about inflation and were expecting the Fed to raise rates by the end of 2007 .
Right now everyone is worried about inflation and the Fed has talked very hawkish about inflation over the past few weeks .
Most of the talking heads are looking for the Fed to raise rates by the end of the year .
This is exactly the same spot we were in this time last year !
But what if the economy does n't pick up steam in the second half of the year and the stock market continues lower ?
What if more banking problems materialize ?
Bank stocks are making new 52 - week lows and have been falling fast this month .
They do not seem to be forecasting an end to the credit crunch .
And really they should n't , because there is no sign of a bottom in real estate and all indicators I follow suggest that we wo n't see one into at least the second half of 2009 .
I think we are likely to see a Fall shock hit the market .
Last year we saw the Fed do a 180 degree turn from talking about inflation to cutting rates like a mad hatter .
This year I believe we will see the Fed abandon its talk of fighting inflation to once again intervening to bail out some bank , patch up the leaky economy , or in response to a stock market mini-crash .
I think the situation right now is like it was a year ago - everyone is worried about inflation , but the bigger problems lurk in the cooked books the banks are carrying .
In fact we are more likely to see more problems emerge and the stock market go lower as that is the primary trend right now .
In essence the Fed is playing a game of poker .
It is bluffing when it says it is fighting inflation .
It has no chips left and has bet everything on the slim chance that the economy has already bottomed .
If something happens to make the Fed intervene again then it will be faced with a choice of fighting inflation by raising rates , which would have the effect of blowing up the banking system , or intervening to save the banking system , the economy , and the stock market , which of course would mean more inflation , a falling dollar , and falling bond prices .
The Fed has proven that if it gets trapped into such a corner it will side to help the banks and the stock market a stable currency be damned .
If this is what we see happen in the Fall then the Fed will lose all of its credibility when it comes to maintaining a stable currency .
What do you need to do ?
You need to do what you should always be doing - keeping your pulse on market trends to figure out the best way to position yourself to make money is .
You can profit from any situation .
Right now we have a bear market and that means using bear market strategies .
I will leave you with one last thought for today .
In the past ten years every time the Fed has gone on a campaign of lowering interest rates it has create a " bubble " .
In 1998 the Fed lowered rates to bailout the Long - Term Capital Management Fund .
When it did so it put excess money into the banking system .
There was a lack of good investments for that money to go into so it flowed into Internet and tech stocks and formed a bubble .
When that bubble burst the Fed lowered rates again to try to make the stock market go back up .
As a result they dropped interest rates to an artificially low point , which created a housing bubble .
We are now suffering through the fallout of the housing bubble - the direct result is a recession , bear stock market , and " credit crisis " from banks who went nuts during the bubble .
Now remember - every time the Fed cuts rates it creates a bubble , because it puts excess money into the economy .
Well , the bubble now is now in commodities and oil .
A direct result is inflation , a falling dollar , and eventually a bear market in bonds .
There are opportunities to profit from this and I believe gold and precious metal stocks along with tactical short selling against he broad market and bonds will be the best way to go .
If the Fed abandons this current inflation fighting talk this Fall I expect we 'll see gold prices skyrocket into the end of the year .
Of course this is looking ahead and that is n't always an easy thing to do when it comes to the stock market .
I can't say with certainty that this is going to happen .
But I do know the technical signs in the market that will appear over the next two months if this is indeed what is going to happen and I know how I will position myself .
The next eight weeks are going to be some of the most important we 've ever seen in the financial markets .
Not because of what will happen during these weeks , but to see how the markets are positioned once they are over .
As any technical signs appear to point us the way I will draw your attention to them and explain to you exactly what they mean so that you can take advantage of anything that may happen too .
From chaos comes opportunity and opportunity is another way to spell profits .

Mr. Swanson ,
In the world of high finance I 'm insignificant .
But I highly respect your " tell it like it really is ! " and expertise tremendously .
Several years ago I was fortunate to come across your article REAL ESTATE BUBBLE IS ABOUT TO BUST !
I quoted you everywhere , and I was laughed at .
Whose laughing now ?
As a semi-retired former weathergirl on NBC back in the 70's and 80's I did n't have 401 K or the like .
Am I well off ?
heck no !
Should I purchase a home now , wait a while longer or just forget about investing anything in the USA ?
I can't tell you how much I and thousands of other women in my shoes would appreciate your advice .
Keep up your generous and honest work .

I 've ridden track bikes on the street before ( because I 'm a dumbass ) , and let me tell you , they are a BITCH to get used to , especially if you 've been spoiled by years and years of being able to stop pedaling and cruise on downhills .
You also need to be way more careful when judging distance , because stopping short can have you skidding along can make you fishtail like mad , and get your ass taken by a car as it passes you by .
A friend of mine rides his on the steeper streets of San Fran , because , like me , he 's a dumbass .
Janet Jackson Album Promotion Scrapped by Record Label
Janet Jackson has n't had much luck with her last few album releases .
Her latest , Discipline , wo n't have much of a has n't had much luck with her last few album releases .
Her latest , Discipline , wo n't have much of a fighting chance since her record label has put an end to promoting the album .
Janet wrote to Perez Hilton about her labels decision :
We started off with Feedback and the label and myself have n't quite seen eye to eye since the single so they 've kind of basically stopped all promotion .
I 'm trying to figure out a way to say this , but just to say it and to be quite honest , they just stopped all promotion whatsoever on the album , so I do n't think you 're going to hear another single off this album . "
Control , Rhythm Nation : 1812 and janet are three of her albums that proved to be huge successes , earning her 19 hit singles .
Currently Janet holds the record for scoring the most # 1's in America from the same album for over three successive years .

Breakpoint - induced Python debugging with IPython
Most of the Python programmers out there will know about IPython .
Most of them will also know about the Python Debugger ( PDB ) .
IPython has an advanced version of PDB ( spectacularly named ‘ ipdb ’ ) which does the same for PDB as IPython does for the normal interactive Python interpreter .
It adds tab completion , color syntax highlighting , etc .
The - pdb switch to IPython gives us access to the debugger automatically in the event of uncaught exceptions :
def ham ( ) : x = 5 raise NotImplemented Error ( ' Use the source , luke ! ' ) ham ( )
We now run this code using ipython - pdb …
[ todsah@jib ] ~ $ ipython - pdb In [ 1 ] : import test.py < type ' exceptions.NotImplementedError '> :
Use the source , luke !
> /home/todsah/test.py( 5 ) ham ( ) 4 x = 5 ----> 5 raise NotImplementedError(' Use the source , luke !' ) 6 ipdb > print x 5
And as you can see we get dropped at a nice ipdb > prompt which allows us to use the additional power of IPython to investigate the problem .
Like most decent debuggers , we can also use PDB to set breakpoints .
In Python , we do that in the code , rather than via external means .
To do this , we import the pdb module and tell it to drop us into the debugger when execution hits the pdb.set_trace ( ) line .
import pdb def ham ( ) : x = 5 pdb.set_trace ( ) ham ( )
We run it , and lo and behold , we get dropped into the pdb debugger :
In [ 1 ] : import test.py > /home/todsah/test.py( 8 ) ham ( ) -> raise NotImplementedError(' Use the source , luke ! ' )
( Pdb ) print x 5
Buuuuut … as you can see from the ( Pdb ) prompt , this is the normal PDB debugger , not IPython ’s enhanced version .
Would n’t it be neat to be able to use IPython ’s debugger for breakpoint - induced debugging too ?
I spent some time looking around on the Interwebz , trying to find out how to do this , and to my surprise I could n’t find anything ?
So I dove into the IPython source and discovered IPython .
Debugger .
Tracer :
from IPython .
Debugger import Tracer ; debug_here = Tracer ( ) def ham ( ) : x = 5 debug_here ( ) raise NotImplemented Error ( ' Use the source , luke ! ' ) ham ( )
Now when we execute this code , we ’re dropped into the IPython enhanced IPDB debugger :
In [ 1 ] : import test > /home/todsah/test.py( 8 ) ham ( ) 7 debug_here ( ) ----> 8 raise NotImplementedError(' Use the source , luke !') 9 ipdb > print x 5
We can use tab completion and all the other goodies IPython offers over standard Python now .
Bishop says vote to refer petition to stop Bush complex at SMU is “ merely procedural ”
Press Contact Information :
Rev. Andrew J , Weaver , Ph.D. Brooklyn , NY

“ The General Conference of the United Methodist Church did receive a petition asking it to block SMU ’s decision to lease land for the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Center .
Its decision was only to refer it to the South Central Jurisdictional Conference .
In no way did it reject the decision already made by the South Central Jurisdiction ’s Mission Council .
Â
The action was merely procedural because the General Conference said the decision belonged at the Jurisdictional level .
Â
The overwhelming nature of the vote was due to the fact that it , along with 11 other petitions , was on a consent calendar ” ¦. ” ( 1 ) . Â Scott J. Jones , Bishop , Kansas Area of the United Methodist Church .
( Press Statement , May 3 , 2008 )
Â
United Methodist Bishop Scott J. Jones of Kansas has been an outspoken advocate for locating the Bush library and partisan institute at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) ( 2 - 3 ) .
He has also told the press that the right of the South Central Jurisdiction ( SCJ ) delegates to vote on the use of their church property at SMU will not be honored , Â although it is clearly stated in church law that a vote is mandated ( 4 - 5 ) .
This appears to continue to be Jones ’ position even after an 844-20 vote on a petition calling for the rejection of the Bush project was referred to the SCJ by the highest authority in the UMC “ “ its General Conference .
Â
If this vote has no moral or legal force and is , “ merely procedural ”  , why did General Conference bother bringing it to a vote in the first place ?
The petition against the Bush project could have been killed in committee , dozens were , but it passed the important Ministry and Higher Education Committee by a vote of 51 to 5 .Â
It could have easily been killed on the floor , but it was not .
Â Instead it was formally referred by a vote of 844-20 to the owners of the SMU property . Â
Bishop Jones told the Dallas Morning News in 2007 that the thousands of fellow United Methodists and SMU alumni who signed a petition ( www.protectSMU.org) objecting to Bush partisan think tank “ would have no influence ”  on him as an SMU trustee .
Â
Moreover , he declared that SMU “ trustees — not the United Methodist Church — have the final say on decisions that SMU makes about the library ” ( 6 ) .
Â
Bishop Jones made this statement despite the fact that the UMC founded and owns SMU , and the trustees are appointed under the authority of the church .
I urge Bishop Jones to reconsider and support the democratic and transparent processes of our church .
Â
I fear our communion will suffer a lingering and unnecessary wound of distrust , hurt , and anger if there is not fairness on this issue .
Â Thousands of United Methodists ( see www.protestSMU.org) believe that Â honoring and “ celebrating ”  a glaringly unrepentant UMC member , President George W. Bush , with a partisan think tank , will damage our credibility as followers of Jesus Christ and bring lasting shame upon the our church and a fine university ( 7 ) .

Outline
Circulating message claims that attached photographs show a Utah townhouse filled with 8 years worth of beer cans .
Brief Analysis
The photographs are genuine .
Century 21 property manager Ryan Froerer took the snapshots back in 2005 after being called to check a townhouse in Ogden Utah .
Example
Got beer ????
A landlord ’s nightmare A SINGLE GUY LIVED IN THIS TOWNHOUSE FOR 8 YEARS IN OGDEN UTAH THE LANDLORD THOUGHT HE WAS THE BEST RENTER BECAUSE HE NEVER CALLED OR COMPLAINED AND WAS NEVER LATE ON A PAYMENT .
THESE PICTURES DON’T EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE . ” CENTURY 21REALTY HAD ALREADY MOVED SOME OF THE CANS OUT , AND THEY HAD CAVED IN THE TUNNELS THAT THE RENTER HAD MADE TO GET TO THE BEDROOM , BATHROOM , AND KITCHEN .
All this , yet you still do not see any dust , scattered clothing , or dirty dishes anywhere .
Other than having a minor drinking problem , he was basically a very clean , organized person .
Add to this , the fact that he was concerned about his health , proven by the fact that he drank “ Light ” beer .
Detailed Analysis
This long circulated message includes several photographs of a townhouse overflowing with empty beer cans and beer boxes .
Although it seems almost unbelievable , the photographs are genuine .
Century 21 property manager Ryan Froerer took the snapshots after being called to check a townhouse in Ogden , Utah .
According to a news article on KSL.com , the realtor who asked Froerer to check the townhouse could not even go in due to the terrible smell .
When Froerer entered , he was confronted with an amazing sight :
Beer cans by the tens of thousands .
Mountains of cans burying the furniture .
The water and heat were shut off , apparently on purpose by the tenant , who evidently drank Coors Light beer exclusively for the eight years he lived there .
There were an estimated 70,000 beer cans in the townhouse .
To accumulate that amount of cans , the resident must have consumed an average of 24 beers a day for the 8 years of his tenancy .
Ironically , the beer drinker was a good tenant in other ways .
He always paid his rent on time and never complained .
KSL.com notes that the former tenant claims to have stopped drinking and has his old job back .
Ryan Froerer emailed the photographs to a few of his friends , who apparently sent the message to their friends and so on .
The email and photographs have now been sent around the world and , well over a decade on , still continue to circulate .

A few days ago the internet was abuzz with shocking headlines because the gentleman behind ' virtual water ' , professor John Anthony Allan of King ’s College London , got an award from a water conservation group , the Stockholm International Water Institute ( SIWI ) for his work on advocating water conservation .
Reading the news clippings about it , you 'd have thought it was a Nobel prize for perpetual motion .
Perpetual motion is a good analogy .
Generally , if you see something too ridiculous to be true , it 's probably not true .
A few weeks ago , for example , a VA Tech grad student got a prize for a ' gravity lamp ' that was just the kind of alcohol - and - magic - fueled hocus - pocus that sets the internet on fire .
It was green energy and cool tech all rolled into one .
Except it did n't exist .
Rather than being able to power a household bulb for hours , even an unsuitably - large one could only power a tiny 0.1 - watt LED for 45 minutes .
It 's just physics .
So a few days ago people were aghast and outraged when they saw a number stating that 34 gallons of ' virtual water ' went into a cup of coffee .
I understand their panic .
That means we only have about 9,588,235,294,117,647 cups of coffee left before all the water is gone .
( 1)
Except water does n't actually disappear .
There is the same amount of water on earth now as millions of years ago .
That 's right , you 're drinking water a Neanderthal peed in .
Water recycles .
I understand that only 2.5 % of all water is available ' fresh ' water but that is why the outrage over coffee and hamburgers is unjustified .
Trees , for example , give off 70 gallons of water per day just in evaporation .
That 's two cups of coffee right there coming back to us .
So water evaporating from trees provides enough water to result in 392 cups of coffee for every man , woman and child on the planet .
Humans use , on average , 50 gallons per day directly , so we'd have to scale that coffee back to just over 390 cups per day .
My diatribe here is not about the water conservation industry .
I am all for clean water .
2 billion people live without proper clean water and even in civilized areas there are 70,000 known chemicals in use that can contaminate water .
I am very much against bad water .
I am also against bad math .
Allan has been writing about the ' virtual water ' concept for a while , notably in 1998 in the article " Virtual Water : A Strategic Resource Global Solutions to Regional Deficits " ( 2 ) published by Ground Water magazine .
It had existed in concept before then , since 1993 , and he even used it farther back himself under the term " embedded water " but he came up with " virtual water " because , as he said , the term embedded water " did not capture the attention of the water managing community . "
( 3 )
So at least we understand motivation .
He used it while doing examinations of the middle east and came up with a basic figure in how much water was contained in something like imported grain .
(4) His feeling was that the ' virtual water ' contained in grain imported into one region of the mid-east was equal to all the water in the Nile so there was trouble brewing , if you 'll pardon the coffee pun .
From there it took on a life of its own .
Since that time , the ' hydropolitics ' of virtual water have been brought up on occasion yet the one place where it should be obvious now , the middle east , still has no signs of it .
There has n't been a war over water even though they fight over almost everything else .
There 's a reason for that .
Real water is what people care about , not pretend water .
' Virtual water ' can be used for shock effect but it 's basically an intangible and , as we shall see , the math is fuzzy .
Even Allan never intended for it to be anything more than conceptual :
The recent publication by Hoekstra and Hung ( 2002 ) , which will be discussed at the Third World Water Forum in Kyoto in March 2003 , shows that some water engineers liked the idea so much that they have devoted months to adding quantitative substance
to the conceptual utility of the idea .
They basically wanted it to be true so they started matching data to the topology .
Yet the concept has spread everywhere , sketchy math or not .
As a comparison of how far it had spread , I did a search to find out how much water it takes to grow an egg .
The most common result I found was 120 gallons of water .
For one egg .
Stephen Colbert 's ' truthiness ' says people are more inclined to believe something outrageous if it is vague and this is a perfect example , because I saw the same figure in dozens of places .
Dr. Jim Arthur of Hi-Line International , an egg producer in Iowa , does n't know where that number comes from .
He says 100 birds lays 80 - 90 eggs per day and use 4 - 5 gallons of water .
He told Elizabeth Grossman when asked ( 5 ) , " The 120 - gallon figure would have to include water for something other than what the hen consumes directly " which is about 1 ounce of water per egg .
So it must include the grain .
Well , birds eat like ... birds .
They do n't eat a lot , about 1 / 2 cup per day for a hen laying those 8 eggs .
A ton of grain is going to feed over 10,660 hens for a day and produce 85,300 eggs ( 6 ) .
That should take 10,236,000 gallons of water at 120 gallons each .
But the 1,000 cubic meters Allan says makes a ton of grain , even using his aggressive virtual water scenario , is only 1 million liters - 263,936 gallons .
Somewhere these egg numbers include not only chickens drinking water , but the grain to feed them , the water the farmer drank , the well the water came from , etc. , et al , until we end up with 40X the amount of water calculated using food for the hens .
In other words , it 's just made up .
So it goes with the odd ' 633 gallons of water to make a hamburger ' claim .
Vegetarians want to believe it , but they also wanted to believe walking to the store causes more global warming than driving your car there if you eat meat .
As long as they did n't use a calculator , they were right and in that instance they were handed an easy - to - remember platitude ( ' a gallon of gas per pound of beef ' ) and ran with it despite it being made up .
Much like saying it takes 1,000 cubic meters of water to produce a ton of grain .
So it goes in this instance but there 's more than math that 's flawed in that reasoning .
There 's also ecology .
Let 's suppose for argument 's sake it does take 34 gallons of water to grow the beans for my coffee .
The bulk of that will be rainwater which , as we we all know , happens in places like Colombia .
The water is not trucked in from some distant land where it is hurting the ecosystem by being gone .
If the water is not used in coffee plants , it will seep into the ground or flow into rivers .
If we 're going to complain about coffee and hamburgers , the Amazon rainforest is one of the top water consumers in the world .
If less coffee and hamburgers actually meant more water for African kids who have none , cutting down the rainforest would easily provide water for the 2 billion people without it .
Yet no one thinks that 's a good idea .
Clean water in places where people live that have no water is really the issue .
We do n't have a water shortage , a resource that needs to be rationed .
There is a lot of water because , as I mentioned above , only 2.5 % of what we have is fresh water .
People who talk about a water crisis or wars over rivers are in the advocacy business .
Like anything else , if a lobbyist , even one guised as a scientist , starts giving you numbers , you need to examine the data carefully .
We have an energy issue when it comes to water , not a mitigation one , because we just need energy to make undrinkable water potable .
Renewable , clean energy will solve a lot of the water issues that remain , either by desalinatization where there is ocean water available or shipping where there is no water at all .
Putting money toward that is a much better strategy than Bono birthday parties .
So drink all the coffee you want without guilt .
Just make sure you pee once in a while and it will all come back around .
Your Neanderthal ancestors did it for you , after all .
Back to this aggressive ' virtual water ' math , we can actually have some fun with it .
Just for kicks I intend to take on the FTC and see if they fold once I get out the calculator .
If there are 34 gallons of water in my cup of coffee I am certain I can prove there are ' five ounces of milk ' in a one ounce slice of Kraft cheese .

A black bear cub was caught on film while rubbing against a tree in Montana .
Though solitary animals , black bear moms and cubs stick together .
Grizzly bears are getting their groove on , and new hidden cameras are giving scientists a window into the secret lives of these dancing bears .
This is no circus act .
Between 2005 and 2007 , Kate Kendall of the U.S. Geological Survey and her colleagues took video footage of black and grizzly bears doing what looks like the go - go at their favorite " rub trees . "
They also got film of bears lumbering beneath stretches of barbed wire used to snag hair samples .
The research is part of a larger study to estimate the population size and distribution of bears in northwestern Montana using genetic analyses of the bears ' hair samples .
Scientists think bears shimmy their backs against trees in a kind of bump - and - grind to scratch hard - to - reach spots and to communicate their presence to other Ursus kin .
" It 's probably primarily a form of chemical communication , " Kendall said .
" Often bears will sniff the trees before and after they rub on them . "
Though Kendall has yet to pinpoint exactly what makes for a bear - loving rub tree , both grizzlies and black bears seem to agree on the specs .
" Multiple bears are using the same trees , including within the same day black bears and grizzly bears , " Kendall told LiveScience .
Evidence also suggested the bear cubs took part in tree - rubbing .
But momma bears avoided rub trees during the mating season between May and June .
By steering clear of rub trees during those months , Kendall says , the female bears who already have cubs can avoid interested males and protect their young .
" Adult males are most likely to attack the cubs of females that they 're interested in breeding with [ during the mating season ] , " Kendall said .

Polling Place Photo ID Restrictions in Indiana Upheld by SCOTUS in Courageous and Historic Dredd Scott - like Decision
But Why Stop at Keeping Black and Elderly Fraudsters from Stealing Elections ?...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/28/2008 , 3:22 pm PT
As the great voting rights advocate , Rush Limbaugh , trumpeted at the beginning of his radio show this morning , today 's 6 to 3 Supreme Court ruling allowing new , modern restrictions regarding which citizens may or may not cast votes at American polling places on Election Day , is " a huge , huge , huge move forward to undercut Democrat efforts to commit voter fraud this fall . "
Fortunately , instead of coming in June as expected , this decision on an Indiana Photo ID restriction case comes just in time to prevent massive voter fraud at the polls in Indiana 's Democratic Primary two weeks from now , when millions of fraudulent Democratic voters were almost certainly plotting to try and show up to vote on electronic voting systems on which it 's impossible to prove one way or another whether they did or did n't vote the way the machines will tell us they did .
With voting systems like those in use across the Hoosier State , and elsewhere around the country , it 's all the more reason to ensure those Democrats can't show up and commit the fraud they were probably planning to engage in on May 6th !
The news is certainly the most important SCOTUS decision pertaining to elections since the triumphant , well - considered , and much - beloved Bush v. Gore decision of 2000 .
Today 's verdict will undoubtedly be heralded and taught at American institutions of learning for decades to come , with the same reverence as that dedicated to landmark Supreme Court decisions like 1857's Dredd Scott v. Sandford ruling , which thankfully found that " people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves , or their descendants --- whether or not they were slaves --- could never be citizens of the United States , and that the United States Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories . "
The Supremes have done it again !
But no such important American political battle like that which was won today is ever fought alone .
Due thanks must go to the long - fought efforts of countable simple citizens around our nation , concerned about the integrity of voting .
We'd be remiss without noting some of the selfless freedom fighters who helped make today 's great news a reality : Courageous , unheralded voices , such as those of " longtime advocate of voter rights " and Bush / Cheney ' 04 Inc. General Counsel Mark F. " Thor " Hearne , tireless Republican " voter fraud " information - wareness man John Fund , and Bush - appointed DoJ Civil Rights Division guardians of the ballot box , like Hans von Spakovsky , Bradley Schlozman and its former Voting Section chief , John " Minorities Die First " Tanner .
Thanks to brave men like them , and Mr. Limbaugh , of course , it 'll be a new day at the polling place this fall !
One in which , if Republicans legislators around the country hurry up and get on the anti-voter fraud ball , they can assure that millions of Democratic - leaning citizens wo n't be fraudulently mistaken for actual voters when they show up at their polling places this November .
But are restrictions that may keep just blacks and the elderly from casting a ballot enough to ensure the true integrity of our vote ?
Should n't we keep fighting to ensure that legitimate voters like you and me do n't have our voices diluted by even more fraudulent groups out there , like gays , communists , and dead people , who every year change the results of election after election through their insidious anti-American efforts , because I say they do ?
Read on for a couple of new ideas .
Clearly , today 's SCOTUS decision is a good start , but it hardly goes far enough to ensure that the right American voices are heard , as our founders intended !
14th Amendment , equal protection , blah , blah , blah , my ass !...
" Anti-voter fraud efforts this fall will be easier , " concerned voting integrity activist , Limbaugh said while sharing today 's great news with his millions of listeners over the publicly - owned airwaves this morning , as he helpfully enlightened them on how " the Democrats shut down the FEC , largely to get away with more voter fraud . "
The Supreme Court , of course , agrees .
Writing for one group of justices in the majority , Justice Stevens argued [ PDF ] that " in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process .
The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter fraud . "
I 'll say !
That is definitely " the first " !
Those naysayers , such as the vote - huggers of the DoJ and at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) , who say such fraud does n't actually occur to any noticeable extent , much less one which could change the result of an election , are just plain wrong .
Even though that opinion seems to be shared with the proponents of Photo ID restriction laws who have been unable to present any substantive evidence to support their case , beyond the fear that concerns about the possibility of such fraud among the electorate is reason enough to impose such restrictions .
Sure , the dissenting SCOTUS opinion points out " the fact that the State has not come across a single instance of in - person voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana ’s history , " but that sort of reasoning only matters if you pay attention to it , and I see no reason to do so .
So the DoJ and EAC , and all the other kinda - gay Constitution Lovers , can take their Marxist facts , terrorist - loving sciences , and troop - hating evidence and stick it where the sun do n't shine ( e.g. , inside a computerized voting machine which counts votes secretly , in such a way that just one person could easily change the results of an entire election without detection ) .
Lest you get the idea that only Democratic - leaning minorities such as Dredd Scott decision - skirting African - Americans are working to defraud the system , the court went on to explain that the easy ride for Democratic - leaning senior citizen criminals is also to be a thing of the past .
" The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that may be placed on a limited number of persons e.g. , elderly persons born out - of - state , who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate , " they wrote , " is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo identification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerks office . "
Hear that you elderly shut-ins , lucky enough to get a ride to the polling place on Election Day ?
You can just get back in your car , drive down to the circuit court clerk 's office over in the county seat , and sign an affidavit almost anytime in the days following an election , in order to prove that you are really you !
It 's easy to ensure your vote gets counted , you slackers !
" Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a nationwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criticized as antiquated and inefficient , " the Supremes found .
Sorry , you well - moneyed forces of Big Democracy !
In case you missed it , that 's " nationwide , " baby !
Thor Hearne and his folks are just getting started with their modernization [ PDF ] of those antiquated and inefficient election procedures , as suggested by that tired old U.S. Constitution , decades of history , and other related , yet quaint and antiquated " laws " and such .
Do n't you Democrats understand the Constitution is a living document , meant to be interpreted liberally ?!
14th Amendment , 14th Shmamendment !
" Because Indiana 's cards are free , the inconvenience of going to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles , gathering required documents , and posing for a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters right to vote , " the wizened Supremes found .
No , it does n't .
And by " most voters , " obviously they mean any number of the 10 to 30 million American citizens ( " roughly 6 – 10 % of voting - age Americans , " as that loser Justice Souter whined in his dissent ) who have gotten away with voting without having a state - issued drivers license or photo ID for far too long !
Most voters !
Get that , fraudsters ?
Most voters will have no problem with this restriction .
So why should we worry about a few million folks like you who do ?
It 's the big numbers that count , not the small ones .
Besides , had just 538 more of you been allowed to vote successfully in Florida in 2000 --- and had officials there wasted their time in counting those votes --- we 'd likely have never had such an important Supreme Court decision in the first place !
So stop your whining , sore losers , because most of us do n't care to hear it !
And it's not as if the Constitution was instituted to protect the interests of the minority over the ruling majority !
If you spent more time going to college and getting an education , and less time living off the government dole , you 'd probably know that by now .
Yeah , I know ... While there may be little --- okay , no actual evidence that Photo ID laws , like the one affirmed for Indiana , would have stopped any particular polling place fraud any time in Indiana history , much less have changed the results of any known election .
I also am well aware that mountains of actual scientific evidence , from several states and academic studies from across the nation , have shown that a single person , with inappropriate access to a single electronic voting machine , could flip an entire election with little probability of detection --- whether he or she has a state - issued Photo ID or not .
But fortunately , no similar cases to adjudicate whether banning such e-voting systems would similarly " reduce risk of fraud " are before the court , thanks to Democrats , and Democratic public advocacy groups across the country like People for the American Way ( PFAW ) and Common Cause , who have gone out of their way to assure the continued use of such voting machines , and to assure all of us that they are perfectly safe to use .
Such groups have long argued , with no actual evidence to prove it , that such voting machines actually help to enfranchise minority voters , despite a similar lack of evidence showing that any such voting system has ever actually recorded a voter 's choice for a candidate or initiative on the ballot during any actual election , accurately , as per their intent
But all of that is likely because those groups just hope to use such voting machines to commit election fraud , now that their voter fraud days are coming to a an end .
The lack of appreciation for that fact , and lack of lawsuits brought to stop their use in American elections , is also , no doubt , seen as a " huge , huge , huge , move forward " for great civil rights advocates such as Rush Limbaugh .
When it comes to polling place ID requirements , however , why stop at today 's decision ?
I 've got a few ideas that democracy 's Republican heroes who have gotten us this far may want to implement and test at the friendly Supreme Court , to really shut the ballot box door , once and for all , on those who would undermine our precious democracy .
If we hope to ensure that only the right people vote , and not the wrong , fraudulent Americans , it 's time to put our laws where our mouths are !
Here are a few ideas ...
Voters must vote with spouses , to prove they 're not gay .
Copy of marriage license may be shown in lieu of actual spouse , for voters 60 or younger .
Divorce will not be a deterrent to voting , unless said divorces were undertaken under CA or NV law ( or from other states to be determined later ... maybe at the polling the place ... on Election Day . )
Voters must name five Fox News anchors to prove they 're not illegal immigrants .
Only Americans would watch Fox News .
And no , just saying the words " Lou Dobbs " wo n't do .
Voters must present current bank statement , showing $ 10,000 or more in savings account , in order to prove voter is not dead .
This one is just common sense .
Since dead voters may be mistaken for old people , voters must prove they are alive by performing 10 push - ups before voting .
This can hardly be seen as onerous , especially since strength is needed to properly fill in the oval and / or push the touch - screen to make voter selections on the " ballot " .
Those are just some suggestions , but I 'm certain the non-partisan voter advocates at places like the ACVR can come up with many more ways to fight for integrity at the ballot box .
Caveat :
The above suggestions are only necessary at the polling place , just like the Photo ID restrictions , since we all know that absentee voter fraud is not a problem at all , and easily defeated by existing ... well , it 's not a problem at all .
And besides , it 's often overwhelmingly Republicans and overseas military members who vote that way , and you do n't hate the troops , do you ?!
I did n't think so .
May God bless America .

Holmgren says his future scenarios will help both policy makers and activists come to terms with the end of the era of growth .
Press Release from Eat The Suburbs :
The Australian co-founder of the permaculture concept David Holmgren has today launched a new global scenario planning website , Future Scenarios : www.FutureScenarios.org .
While the end of growth is so unthinkable to many policy makers and economists that they use the term ‘ negative - growth ’ , Holmgren says we are already entering a generations - long era of ‘ energy descent . ’
We now face less and less available energy each year , coupled with a destabilised climate .
“ The simultaneous onset of climate change and the peaking of global oil supply represent unprecedented challenges for human civilisation .
Each limits the effective options for responses to the other , ” writes Holmgren on www.futurescenarios.org.
Holmgren uses a scenario planning framework to bring to life the likely cultural , political , agricultural and economic implications of peak oil and climate change .
“ Scenario planning allows us to use stories about the future as a reference point for imagining how particular strategies and structures might thrive , fail or be transformed , ” says Holmgren
Future Scenarios depicts four very different futures .
Each is a permutation of mild or destructive climate change , combined with either slow or severe energy declines .
Scenarios range from the relatively benign Green Tech to the near catastrophic Lifeboats scenario .
“ Many futurists are looking at Facebook , robot pets and other i-fads , whereas David has been studying a much bigger picture .
He works from the fundamental resource and environmental constraints , and I ’m convinced that he ’s got his assumptions right where others have them very wrong .
He has followed through with unusual insight , drawing on 30 years of permaculture thinking , which I would say makes him the most important futurist in the world right now , ” said Adam Grubb founder of Energy Bulletin ( www.energybulletin.net.)
“ These are n’t two dimensional nightmarish scenarios designed simply to scare people into environmental action .
They are compellingly fleshed out visions of quite plausible alternative futures which delve into energy , politics , agriculture , cultural and even spiritual trends .
They help us reconcile our own competing fears and hopes for the future , and to consider the best strategies for adapting to a changing world , ” says Grubb .
Holmgren says “ we will need resilience and adaptability in the face of radical change . ”
‘ Energy Descent ’
Holmgren coined the term ‘ energy descent ’ in 2005 as a less negatively loaded way than ‘ decline ’ or ‘ collapse ’ for describing a future defined by constantly diminishing energy production .
“ I chose the word ‘ descent ’ because it implies a long and sustained process through which it is possible to survive and even thrive .
While energy descent does suggest the demise of globalised industrial civilisation , that process will play out over many decades , if not centuries .
For individuals , households , organisations and communities focused on socially and ecologically adaptive design , energy descent is as much an opportunity as an obstacle .
Realistic assessment of the larger forces at work in the world helps empower us to better refine our strategies . ”
About Permaculture
Permaculture is an environmental design framework modelled on the patterns and relationships found in nature , yielding an abundance of food , fibre and energy for provision of local needs .
About David Holmgren
Holmgren co-wrote the first permaculture text Permaculture One in 1976 with Bill Mollison ( published in 1978 ) .
With his 2002 book Permaculture : Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability David re-emerged from the relative shadows as the leading intellectual force of the permaculture movement .
Rob Hopkins , founder of the popular Transition Towns initiatives in the UK , described Principles and Pathways as “ the most important book of the last 15 years . ”
David , his partner Su Dennett , and their son Oliver live at ‘ Melliodora ’ a small permaculture demonstration property in central Victoria , Australia where they are self sufficient in fruit , vegetables and animal products and provide most of their own energy needs .

In a school classroom , mathematician Edward Kasner was talking with some school children about very large numbers .
The class came up with a new number , a 1 with a hundred zeros after it .
One child , Milton Sirotta , the 9 - year - old nephew of Kasner , made up the name ' Googol ' for it , and later it was decided that a ' Googolplex ' should be a 1 followed by a googol zeros .
Written out in long - hand a googol is :
10 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000
The googol achieved a certain level of fame in the UK when it was the answer to the million - pound question on ITV's ' Who wants to be a Millionaire ? ' , in which Major Charles Ingram cheated his way to the top , relying on coughs from a knowledgeable accomplice in the audience to identify the correct answers .
It also provided the name for the well - known search engine Google , which attempts to ' organize the immense , seemingly infinite amount of information available on the web ' .
Just How Big is a Googol ?
It is easy enough to write this number , with a little patience .
But it is very difficult to imagine just how big such a number is .
Some attempt will be made here to give you a feel for it .
Imagine a tiny silver ball , about three millimetres in diameter .
It is made of sugar and is used to decorate cakes with fancy icing .
Get used to the thought of that tiny mirrored sphere , because we 're going to encounter rather a lot of them !
Now imagine a cubical box , which is one metre along each side .
That 's a cubic metre .
It would hold approximately 50 million silver balls .
That 's 50,000,000 .
Let 's up the scale a bit and build a wall around the island of Great Britain .
Now we 'll cover the entire island with silver balls , to a depth of one metre .
( OK , they 'd roll off some of the steeper bits , but do n't worry , the wall around the outside will keep them in ) .
Now we 're talking a seriously big number of balls , 11,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
That 's big enough that there is n't any name for it in normal English .
Mathematicians call it ' eleven quintillion ' .
It 's easier , however , if we just write it like this : 11 x 10 18 .
This means there are 18 zeros after it .
It 's still pretty insignificant compared with a googol .
Try hollowing out the inside of the Earth and filling the entire planet with silver balls .
We get 6 x 10 28 balls .
That 's 6 with 28 zeros after it .
Still way too small .
How about a sphere the size of the Solar System , packed tightly with silver balls : a mere 5 x 10 46 , a 5 with 46 zeros after it .
A sphere the size of the galaxy ?
That 's a total of 2 x 10 70 silver balls .
How about the Universe ?
Well the farthest thing ever seen by humankind is a quasar , which is about 10 billion light years away .
So the observable universe is a sphere with a radius of 10 billion light years .
Fill 'er up !
We can pack in 2 x 1086 silver balls into the universe .
That 's 200 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000,000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 .
So we 've filled the entire observable universe with tightly - packed balls and we 're still nowhere near a Googol .
Even multiplying this number by a trillion , we 're still short .
So how can we reach the big 100 zeros ?
Here 's a way .
Imagine the entire universe full of silver balls .
One second later , remove them all and replace them with another set of identical balls .
Do this every second for 4,000 years .
The total number of silver balls is a googol !
And that 's a load of balls !

Christopher Tarnovsky shows Wired.com the tricks behind smart - card hacking .
Steve Raines / Wired.com SAN DIEGO – Christopher Tarnovsky feels vindicated .
The software engineer and former satellite - TV pirate has been on the hot seat for five years , accused of helping his former employer , a Rupert Murdoch company , sabotage a rival to gain the top spot in the global pay - TV wars .
But two weeks ago a jury in the civil lawsuit against that employer , NDS Group , largely cleared the company – and by extension Tarnovsky – of piracy , finding NDS guilty of only a single incident of stealing satellite signals , for which Dish was awarded $ 1,500 in damages .
" I knew this was going to come , " Tarnovsky says .
" They did n't have any proof or evidence . "
The trial was years in the making , yet raised more questions than it answered .
It came down to testimony between admitted pirates on both sides who accused each other of lying .
Now that it 's over Tarnovsky , who was fired by NDS last year , is eager to tell his side of the story .
Dressed in loose jeans , flip - flops and a T - shirt , Tarnovsky , 37 , spoke with Wired.com by phone and in an air - conditioned lab in Southern California where he 's been running a consultancy since losing his job .
Surrounded by boxes of smart cards and thousands of dollars worth of microscopes and computers used for researching chips , he talked excitedly at lightning speed about his strange journey , which began in a top - secret Pentagon communications center , and ended with him working both sides of a heated electronic war over pay TV .
Satellite - TV hacker Chris Tarnovsky opens his laboratory to Threat Level reporter Kim Zetter , providing a unprecedented peek into the world of smart - card hacking .
Editor : Annaliza Savage , Camera : Steve Raines .
His story sheds new light on the murky , morally ambiguous world of international satellite pirates and those who do battle with them .
The stakes are high : Earnings in the satellite - TV industry reach the billions .
In the first quarter of this year alone , U.S. market leader DirecTV announced revenue of $ 4.6 billion from more than 17 million U.S. subscribers .
Dish Network earned $ 2.8 billion from nearly 14 million subscribers .
Although satellite piracy has greatly diminished from its peak seven to 10 years ago when the events detailed in the civil lawsuit took place , the two companies lost millions in potential revenue , and spent millions more to replace insecure smart cards used in their systems and track down dealers selling pirated smart cards .
Those smart cards are at the center of the controversy over NDS , a British - Israeli company and a majority - owned subsidiary of Murdoch 's News Corp .
The company makes access cards used by pay - TV systems , most prominently DirecTV – itself a former Murdoch company .
Nagrastar , a plaintiff in the case and NDS 's chief competitor , makes access cards used by Dish Network and other runners - up in the market .
According to allegations in the lawsuit , in the late '90s NDS extracted and cracked the proprietary code used in Nagrastar 's cards , a fact that NDS does n't contest .
What happened next , though , is hotly disputed .
Nagrastar says Tarnovsky used the code to create a device for reprogramming Nagrastar cards into pirate cards , and gave the cards to pirates eager to steal Dish Network 's programming .
Tarnovsky was also accused of posting to the internet a detailed road map for hacking Nagrastar 's cards .
Nagrastar says NDS had an obvious motive for these antics :
Their own chip , the so - called P1 or " F Card , " had already been thoroughly cracked by pirates , and the company wanted to level the playing field with its competitors .
NDS denied the allegations at trial .
The company declined to comment for this article or to confirm details of Tarnovsky 's employment other than to say it was pleased that the verdict " ended in a resounding affirmation of NDS and its business ethics and proper conduct . "
Tarnovsky began his pirating career in the '90s while serving in the U.S. Army .
He had a top - secret SCI security clearance working on cryptographic computers in Belgium for NATO headquarters , and spent a year at Ft. Detrick in Maryland providing support to the National Security Agency for satellite transmissions to Europe .
In 1996 , he was stationed in Germany when his colonel sold him a used satellite - TV system , along with two pirated access cards , neither of which worked .
Tarnovsky began posting on online pirate forums , and developed contacts in the community , ultimately learning how to fix the cards to access English - language programs from Sky in the United Kingdom .
After leaving the Army and returning to the States , he got a call from Ron Ereiser , a Canadian pirate who'd heard about him through the grapevine .
Pirates had found a back door in the P1 card and were vigorously exploiting it to get DirecTV content .
But the cards kept failing .
In a game of pirate pingpong , DirecTV periodically deployed electronic countermeasures , or ECMs , in the satellite stream that killed the cards in their set - top boxes .
Ereiser needed someone to fix the cards .
There was serious black - market money on the line .
In Canada , where pirating of U.S. satellite services was n't considered illegal until 2002 , syndicates of dealers did enough business that they could afford to chip in about $ 50,000 to hire a programmer to reverse engineer the latest cards .
Pirate cards would sell for about $ 200 each , with the profit split between the investors and engineers .
Tarnovsky claims Canadian pirate dealers could make $ 400,000 in a weekend ; when Reginald Scullion , a notorious pirate in Canada , was raided in 1998 , authorities seized $ 5.5 million from his bank accounts and safe - deposit boxes , though not all of it was from piracy .
Ereiser , who now works as a consultant to Nagrastar , concedes that the money from piracy was good , but insists that nobody became an overnight millionaire .
" It was lucrative , " he said in a telephone interview .
" But to suggest that millions were being made in a month is an absolute crock . "
DirecTV's countermeasures were a nagging drag on this lucrative trade .
Every time an ECM was deployed , Ereiser and other dealers would be harangued by customers demanding to have the cards fixed and their TV programs restored .
Tarnovsky , who was known online as " Big Gun , " says Ereiser offered him $ 20,000 to fix cards that were killed by ECMs , and he agreed .
Each time NDS created a countermeasure , Tarnovsky would analyze the code and find a way to circumvent the countermeasure .
He did it while working full - time as a software engineer for a semiconductor company in Massachusetts .
" I 'd be at work and I 'd check the IRC ( channel ) to see if they 'd launched their Thursday countermeasure yet , " he says .
" It was like a chess game for me .
I could n't wait for them to do a countermeasure because I would counter it in minutes . "
Tarnovsky suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , which he says helped with the detailed work .
" I think so fast , " he says .
It was n't long before NDS came courting .
Tarnovsky had a contact at the company to whom he'd begun passing information about holes in its software , even supplying patches to fix them .
NDS offered him a job earning $ 65,000 a year .
By the time the company fired him last year , he was earning about $ 245,000 in salary and bonuses and had another $ 100,000 in stock options , he says .
The company set him up in a lab in Southern California equipped with a computer , some DirecTV set - top boxes , sample DirecTV cards and NDS source code .
There was no fancy equipment at first , but his relationship with NDS and the lab grew over the decade he worked with them .
Tarnovsky says the job was a dream come true .
While living in Europe he'd once seen a news report showing an engineer at a French satellite company writing countermeasures , sitting in a lab with smart cards piled around him on his desk .
" I always thought it would be so cool to be that guy , " Tarnovsky says .
" Finally I got the chance . "
Tarnovsky had two roles at NDS – to find holes in its software and work undercover with pirates to discover what they were doing against NDS technology .
To conceal his relationship with NDS from pirates , few people at the company knew his identity .
He used the name " Michael George " and for the first four years was paid through other companies , including , for about five months , HarperCollins , the Murdoch - owned book publisher .
" It was very hush - hush , because we did n't know who could be an inside informant , " he says .
Part of his job was developing ECMs for NDS .
He 'd examine pirate NDS cards to determine how they worked , then send instructions to engineers in Israel to create a kill for them .
" I did n’t actually load the gun and pull the trigger but I got to make the bullet , " Tarnovsky says .
Among the countermeasures he says he created was one known among pirates as the " Black Sunday " kill – an elaborate scheme that destroyed tens of thousands of pirate DirecTV cards a week before Super Bowl Sunday in 2001 .
Instead of being delivered all at once like other measures , the Black Sunday attack code was sent to pirate cards in about five dozen parts over the course of two months , like a tank transported piece by piece to a battlefield to be assembled in the field .
" They never expected us to do this , " Tarnovsky says .
The kill did n't last long before pirates found a way to jump - start the cards .
But it holds an enduring position in pirate lore ; for the first time , they could see a cunning mind at work on the other side .
While Tarnovsky was killing cards , however , he was also helping pirates fix them .
Days before Tarnovsky began working for NDS , the company began phasing in its latest - generation smart card , the P2 , which was thought to be virtually uncrackable .
But word reached the company that two Bulgarian hackers working for Ereiser had cracked the P2 .
On NDS 's instructions , Tarnovsky met with Ereiser undercover in Calgary to get the code .
When he got there , Ereiser offered him $ 20,000 to work for him fighting whatever countermeasures NDS and DirecTV cooked up to thwart their P2 hack .
NDS considered it a great opportunity for Tarnovsky to maintain his pirate identity , but DirecTV insisted on some controls .
Under " Operation Johnny Walker , " as they dubbed it , Tarnovsky gave Ereiser a program to create pirate NDS cards , but encrypted it so no one could copy it .
The program worked only with a dongle attached to Ereiser 's computer and created a limited number of cards that could be killed at any time .
But , according to Nagrastar , Tarnovsky was n't just helping NDS fight piracy by working undercover and creating ECMs , he was also committing piracy against NDS 's competitors to weaken their place in the market .
After NDS engineers in Israel hacked the Nagrastar code in the late '90s , Nagrastar says Tarnovsky created a " stinger " program that turned Nagrastar cards into pirate cards .
He allegedly gave the program to a Canadian named Al Menard in 1999 who sold reprogrammed Nagrastar cards for $ 350 each .
Then in December 2000 , someone anonymously posted code and detailed instructions for hacking Nagrastar 's card to two websites , one of them run by Menard , exposing Dish Network to even more piracy .
It was estimated in court testimony that between 100,000 and 165,000 pirated Nagrastar cards were released to the market in the wake of this posting .
Nagrastar says Menard began sending Tarnovsky cash from the sale of the pirate cards .
At the end of August 2000 , authorities acting on an anonymous tip seized two boxes destined for a mail drop Tarnovsky rented in Texas .
Inside , they found a CD and DVD player with $ 20,000 and $ 20,100 concealed inside .
The boxes were sent from a phony address for " Regency Audio " in Vancouver to C.T. Electronics at Tarnovsky 's address .
A customs form for a third package that was n't seized indicated that it was sent from Menard to Tarnovsky and also contained electronic goods .
Tarnovsky was in Israel at the time , and says he did n't know anything about the packages until he was notified that they 'd been seized .
He thinks they were sent by someone in Nagrastar 's camp who was trying to frame him .
He says Nagrastar 's accusations about the " stinger " program were baseless , and that he never gave Menard any software .
On Feb. 9 , 2001 , U.S. Customs agents appeared at his doorstep .
On advice of a lawyer , he declined to let them search his house without a warrant .
Tarnovsky was never arrested or charged with any crime , but suspicions against him were mounting .
NDS gave Tarnovsky a polygraph test , but asked only two , self - interested questions that never touched on the Nagrastar accusations : Had Tarnovsky sold any modified NDS smart cards , or company secrets , since he'd been working for the company ?
Tarnovsky answered no , and passed the test .
He continued to work for NDS for six years .
But then last year , Nagrastar confronted NDS with a sheriff 's report showing that fingerprints lifted from the seized electronics equipment sent to Tarnovsky 's Texas mail drop belonged to an associate of Menard , raising suspicions again that Tarnovsky might have sold pirate Nagrastar cards without NDS 's knowledge .
NDS fired him .
Tarnovsky says his termination proves he and NDS were n't conspiring against Nagrastar .
Had they been , NDS would have done anything to keep him happy , and quiet .
He says the fact that Nagrastar lost the case shows he was n't pirating on his own either .
" I 've never sold a single Nagra card , ever , " he says .
Although he was angry at NDS for abandoning him , he told Wired.com before the trial ended that he hoped to work for the company again .
" I want to make sure that NDS wins this lawsuit because that will clear my name , " he said at the time .
When it was suggested that someone might view this as motivation for him to lie on NDS 's behalf , he disagreed .
" That 's crazy .
I could go to jail , " he said .
" I would never perjure myself for some company . "
Since NDS fired him he 's been consulting for two semiconductor companies and a manufacturer of dongle tokens , but he misses his life in electronic warfare .
If NDS does n't want him , he says he'd be happy to work for Nagrastar – jumping sides once again .
" I could design a whole entire chip for them like I did for NDS , " he says .
" NDS thinks today that their technology is superior to everybody else 's and it probably is , because they 're 17 years ahead of Nagra technologically .
But Nagra could catch up overnight if they used my services .
" I'm a very valuable asset as far as smart - card technology goes , " he adds .
" I know everything about ( NDS ) as far as their intellectual property models go . "
He offered his services to the company last year , while the lawsuit was pending .
Nagrastar declined .

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature ’s God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
—
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
The history of the present Government of the United States of Amercia is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a candid world .

( CNN ) -- Calling Zimbabwe 's runoff presidential election a " sham , " U.S. President George W. Bush said Saturday that he would push for additional sanctions against the country 's government .
" I am instructing the secretaries of State and Treasury to develop sanctions against this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it , " Bush said in a statement .
Zimbabwe held a runoff Friday after presidential elections March 29 including opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and longtime President Robert Mugabe failed to yield a clear winner .
The runoff vote was condemned internationally and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party accused of using intimidation and violence to force people , particularly in rural areas , to vote for him .
" We will press for strong action by the United Nations , including an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and travel ban on regime officials , " Bush said .
Responding to the threat of further sanctions , Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga said foreign governments needed to " respect " Zimbabwe .
" They should see Zimbabwe as a partner because of what we can offer to the world because of our stability , because of our education , because of our resources , our mineral resources , " he said .
" Sanctions or no sanctions , we will not be told what to do by anybody .
Britain and the U.S. are like bullies and rapists , " he said .
By late Saturday , election officials at polling stations had finished counting and verifying votes , the country 's deputy election commissioner .
Utloile Silaigwana , of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission , said a national results center was still receiving the results at a national center late Saturday night .
Officials told Zimbabwean journalists waiting at the election center 's headquarters for results to return at 7 a.m. local time Sunday .
Accusations of pre-vote murder , intimidation
Tsvangirai , leader of the Opposition Movement for Democratic Change , pulled out of the runoff Tuesday , citing violence and intimidation by Mugabe 's supporters .
His name , however , remained on ballots .
Watch as opposition voters show their broken bones , burns from boiling water and plastic »
Matonga said he would not " dignify the charges with comment " and insisted the voting process was mostly peaceful , except for about 10 pollling stations that MDC members and supporters burned down .
The MDC party charged Saturday that four opposition officials and the wife of one of them were beaten to death this week before Friday 's runoff in " state - sponsored and - perpetrated murders . "
It also charged that a regional Zanu - PF chairman forced rural voters near the town of Karoi in the northern province of Mashonaland West to go to the polling station and vote for Mugabe .
The voters were forced to attend an all - night vigil at the chairman 's home the night before the vote and then go to the polls the next day , the MDC said .
Despite calls from the United Nations to put off the runoff , Mugabe went ahead , essentially making it a one - man vote .
Tsvangirai said Friday that authorities were " threatening anyone that does n't vote or who votes for the MDC with death .
...
The militia are warning that tomorrow they will launch Operation Red Finger that will target anyone who has not voted . "
Each voter was required to dip a finger in red ink , a tactic used in some nations to ensure that there is no repeat voting , and Zanu - PF supporters warned residents in two townships that their fingers would be checked for the red ink .
Mugabe wanted a high turnout to create a sense of legitimacy for his expected victory .
George Charamba , a Mugabe spokesman , said the vote had been " free and fair . "
" I do n't think we should put accent on what a politician who is facing a bleak defeat claims is happening to him , " Charamba said .
" Obviously , it has become very apparent that Morgan Tsvangirai was not going to repeat the fluke victory that he managed in March . "
The first secretary at the South African Embassy in Harare , Willem Geerlings , said people fleeing political violence had camped outside the embassy .
But Charamba denied the reports of pressure .
Asked about images from Zimbabwe showing what is reported to be violence against members of the opposition , he responded , " it 's very , very easy for anyone to stage - manage a demonstration , and a violent one at that . "
Sanctions already in place
In 2003 , President Bush imposed sanctions on specific individuals and businesses in Zimbabwe , saying members of the government and its supporters were undermining democratic institutions there , according to the U.S. Treasury Department .
More than two years later , he expanded the list of sanctions to include immediate family members of Zimbabweans already sanctioned and others who were providing them with financial assistance , the Treasury Department said .
Britain also has financial and travel sanctions against 160 Zimbabweans , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said this week , as he announced that Britain was ready to propose " intensified " sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean regime .
The 14 - nation Southern African Development Community appointed South African President Thabo Mbeki last year to be the mediator in Zimbabwe , but he has faced criticism for not taking a stronger position against the violence .
Mbeki said late Friday that he will take his cue from regional leaders on how to deal with Zimbabwe , according to the national South African Press Association .
Mbeki said that he will be guided by the Development Community and by the heads of state meeting for an African Union summit in Egypt on Monday .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse , Hamilton Wende , Ingrid Formanek and David McKenzie contributed to this report .
All About Zimbabwe • Robert Mugabe • Morgan Tsvangirai
PRINCETON , NJ -- Since Hillary Clinton decided to concede the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama last week , Obama has established a lead over Republican John McCain in general - election polling .
Obama 's gains have come more from women than men , though he has picked up among both groups in recent days .
Obama 's lead among women has now expanded from five percentage points to 13 , while his deficit among men has shrunk from six points to two .
These figures are based on aggregated Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviews with national registered voters conducted May 27 - June 2 ( the week immediately before Obama clinched the nomination on June 3 ) , which showed Obama and McCain tied at 46 % , and June 5 - 9 ( the five days since it was reported that Clinton would suspend her campaign ) , which show Obama ahead , 48 % to 42 % .
Obama clinched the nomination on the evening of June 3 , and the news media reported Clinton would suspend her campaign on the evening of June 4 .
Thus , the data give a clear picture of voter support before and after Clinton 's exit .
While campaigning for president , Clinton demonstrated an especially strong appeal to women .
She led McCain by 52 % to 40 % in her final full week as a candidate , exactly equal to the average since mid-March .
By comparison , Obama held only an average 47 % to 42 % lead over McCain among women during the same time span .
At least for now , he seems to be matching Clinton 's performance among women versus McCain , given his current 13 - point lead among female voters .
One of Clinton 's core groups of supporters during the nomination phase of the campaign was older women .
During the last few days of her active candidacy , Clinton led McCain by 51 % to 41 % among women aged 50 and older , while Obama trailed McCain among this group , 46 % to 43 % .
Since Clinton suspended her campaign , older women 's vote preferences have shifted toward Obama , so that he now enjoys a six - point advantage over McCain .
Obama had always run much better among younger women , in large part because of his strong appeal to younger voters .
But his support has also risen among women aged 18 to 49 in the past few days , further expanding his already formidable 52 % to 40 % lead over McCain to 56 % to 35 % .
Obama has made major gains in the past few days among married women , erasing McCain 's former 52 % to 40 % lead and pulling into a 45 % to 45 % tie .
Meanwhile , the vote preferences among married men ( a solid McCain group ) and unmarried men and women ( solid Obama groups ) have changed little since Clinton decided to end her White House bid .
Obama has also seen his support among non-Hispanic white women increase modestly , though McCain still holds a slim 46 % to 43 % advantage among this group .
Prior to Clinton 's departure , McCain led Obama by 50 % to 41 % among white women .
Interestingly , while white women were a major part of Clinton 's primary constituency , she maintained only a slim ( if any ) advantage in general - election trial heats versus McCain among this group .
In the last week of her campaign , she only tied McCain among white women , at 47 % .
Thus , her strong performance against McCain among all female voters in presidential trial heats was primarily because of strong support from minority women .
Implications
Obama 's recent gains in the polls have been greatly aided by increased support from female voters .
Now that Clinton is no longer campaigning and the focus of voters ' decision - making is a choice between Obama and McCain , female voters may be taking a second look at Obama .
Indeed , his current 13 - point advantage over McCain is essentially the same advantage that Clinton held over McCain throughout her active candidacy .
Obama 's challenge in the general - election campaign will be to bring core Democratic groups that did not strongly support him in the primaries -- women , voters with less formal education , and conservative Democrats -- back into the fold .
He appears to be already doing that among women .
However , it is not clear whether this is just a temporary rally in support for him upon clinching the nomination , or whether he will be able to sustain a high level of support from female voters for the duration of the campaign .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 5,270 registered voters , aged 18 and older , conducted May 27 - June 2 , and 4,390 registered voters , aged 18 and older , conducted June 5 - 9 as part of Gallup 's daily election tracking polling .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,669 female registered voters in the May 27 - June 2 sample and 2,263 female registered voters in the June 5 - 9 sample , the maximum margins of sampling error are ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

( Adds details , Clinton quote )
WASHINGTON , April 4 ( Reuters ) - Democrat Hillary Clinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , have made $ 109 million since leaving the White House , including $ 51 million in speech income for Bill Clinton , according to eight years of tax records released on Friday .
The couple paid taxes of more than $ 33 million and gave more than $ 10 million to charity between 2000 -- their last year in the White House -- and 2007 , tax information released by Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign showed .
Clinton , a New York senator , had been challenged by White House rival Barack Obama to release her tax returns as the two Democrats duel for the right to face Republican John McCain in November ’s election .
Obama made public his returns from 2000 to 2006 last week , renewing their battle over transparency .
Campaign aides to Obama , an Illinois senator , have accused Clinton of being secretive and shielding documents from the public .
Presidential candidates often release their tax returns , although they are not required to do so .
As senators , Obama and Clinton are required only to file disclosure statements that give a wide range of income and provide few details on finances and holdings .
The Clintons ’ tax returns , released late on Friday afternoon , showed their income jumped dramatically from $ 350,000 in 2000 , their final year in the White House , to $ 16 million in 2001 .
Their biggest money - making years were 2004 and 2007 , when they made $ 20 million in each year .
The 2004 income included more than $ 15 million in business income primarily from Bill Clinton ’s speeches .
“ I never thought I ’d say this , but ever since my husband got out of full - time public service , he ’s actually made money , much to both of our amazement , ” Clinton told a labor group in Philadelphia on Tuesday , before the release of the returns .
The Clinton campaign has pushed Obama to release records from his days in the Illinois legislature and his earlier tax returns .
Hillary Clinton ’s public schedules from her time as first lady were released last month .
“ The Clintons have now made public 30 years of tax returns , a record matched by few people in public service .
None of Hillary Clinton ’s presidential opponents have revealed anything close to this amount of personal financial information , ” Clinton spokesman Jay Carson said .
In addition to Bill Clinton ’s lucrative speeches , the couple made about $ 40 million in book income between 2000 and 2007 .
Hillary Clinton made $ 10 million from her book “ Living History ” and $ 190,000 from “ It Takes a Village , ” released in 1996 .
Bill Clinton made more than $ 23 million for his autobiography “ My Life , ” including a $ 15 million advance .
He earned $ 6.3 million for “ Giving , ” released last year .
The couple paid $ 33.7 million in federal taxes since 2000 , which was 31 percent of their adjusted gross income .
The $ 10 million in charitable donations was 9.5 percent of their adjusted gross income .
The campaign said the most recent Internal Revenue Service information showed taxpayers who earned more than $ 10 million a year gave an average of 3.1 percent of their income to charity .
In addition to seven years of tax returns , the Clintons released a summary of their 2007 finances based on estimates by their tax attorney .
The campaign said they will seek an extension beyond the April 15 tax deadline so they can receive information related to partnership income , including from a blind trust .
McCain , an Arizona senator who has clinched the Republican nomination , will release his tax information after the April 15 deadline for filing , a campaign spokesman said .

WHEN Haiti's prime minister resigned last month after a week of food riots , it seemed to confirm a warning that Bob Zoellick , the president of the World Bank , had given ten days before .
He said 100 m people were being pushed into hunger and malnutrition — and 30 - odd countries faced social upheaval unless food policy improved and the rich world got its act together to help .
A month on , policy has not improved , and the rich world 's response has mostly been muddled — yet surprisingly , poor countries have been able to contain the unrest , albeit at heavy cost .
Simon Maxwell , head of Britain 's Overseas Development Institute , a think - tank , says one problem is that donors need a single , simple guide on how and where to help , not a clamour of competing United Nations bureaucracies with different plans .
There are moves in this direction .
The first priority has been to finance the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the world 's largest distributor of food aid .
The WFP asked for $ 750 m this year and has so far got about two - thirds of that .
The UN is also trying to make the international response more coherent .
Ban Ki-moon , its secretary - general , has set up a task - force to co-ordinate what the UN agencies are doing and has called a food summit in early June to work out a plan .
Rich countries are already managing to be fairly incoherent without any UN infighting .
The hope , at least among economists , was that higher prices would induce rich countries to cut state aid to farmers and — says Paul Collier , a development expert at Oxford University — “ lead people to question their pleasant fantasies about GM [ genetically - modified ] food in Europe and biofuels in America . ”
So far , there are few signs of that .
The current American farm bill proposes only modest cuts in ethanol subsidies .
The EU has not changed its biofuels target ( 10 % of all fuel by 2020 ) ; it continues to bully developing countries not to plant GM crops and this week refused permission to grow varieties of GM maize and GM potatoes in Europe .
While donors squabble , poor countries face riots .
But so far , these have had less political impact than many expected .
Around 30 countries have suffered protests but only Haiti has seen its government fall .
In the Middle East , the part of the world most dependent on food imports , there have been demonstrations and strikes in Egypt , Morocco and Jordan .
But all three countries withstood more serious food riots in the late 1970s and 1980s .
In some of the poorest countries , rising food prices have been causing less distress than might have been expected because benefits have also appeared .
In Bangladesh , one of the most vulnerable countries , the rice crop is up 10 % , prices are about four times production costs and wages for landless peasants are soaring .
Bangladesh has a lot of rural poverty .
In countries with millions of urban poor , governments have so far survived demonstrations in part because they are seen to be reacting , whether by issuing ration cards ( Egypt and Pakistan ) or setting up and expanding social - protection programmes ( this is happening almost everywhere , even America ) .
Sometimes , admittedly , reactions are fairly daft .
Thailand proposed an OPEC - style cartel for rice , an idea that went nowhere .
Many food exporters have gone for beggar - thy - neighbour trade restrictions .
Each time one limits or bans food exports , it pushes up world prices — and other governments , equally anxious to keep food inside the country , follow suit .
About 30 countries have imposed some form of trade restraint .
Food importers do n't have the luxury of making such mistakes .
They are buying time by , for example , boosting food subsidies or hiking wages .
In Egypt , bread used to be about a fifth of the world price ; now it is less than a tenth .
Several Arab states have decreed hefty pay rises : 25 % for public - sector workers in Syria , 30 % in Egypt .
These policies are inflationary and expensive .
Oil exporters , or countries like Egypt that benefit from big remittances from them may be able to afford them for a while .
Others are not so lucky .
In Indonesia , where half the population lives on less than $ 2 a day , inflation is 9 % and food prices are soaring ( the price of subsidised rice to the poor was jacked up 60 % in April ) .
The government is planning to fuel subsidies , which would make social protection and subsidised rice more affordable .
The response : more protests .

As far as John McCain is concerned , the Republican presidential nomination is a done deal and the party is united behind him .
But thousands of Republicans -- particularly supporters of Texas Rep. Ron Paul -- are n’t buying that .
In the Pennsylvania primary , more than 215,000 Republicans cast ballots for Paul or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who together captured 27 % of the vote .
And that was tame compared with the uproar last weekend at Nevada ’s Republican Party Convention .
About 600 well - organized Paul supporters overwhelmed McCain ’s forces and engineered a rule change that permitted national convention delegates to be nominated from the floor , wresting the task from party leaders .

That evening , party leaders unexpectedly adjourned the session , saying the proceedings would take too long to finish that night .
But tongues were set wagging about whether the adjournment was a maneuver to save McCain from the embarrassment of being swamped by Paul delegates .
Eric Herzik , a political scientist at the University of Nevada , Reno , said the fracas reflected , among other things , that McCain had “ yet to capture the hearts and minds of Nevada Republicans . ”
All of which suggests there might be some drama at the GOP ’s national convention in September after all .

This attack was from the Bush part of the duo seeking Bush ’s third term :
At Laurel Manor in suburban Livonia , Bush laid out a traditional Republican attack on Democrats and , by extension , Obama , accusing them of seeking to raise taxes , support liberal judges and go wobbly on terrorism and the Iraq war .
“ The Democratic Party has consistently shown they would take America in the wrong direction , ” Bush told the crowd of about 325 .
That ’s a good one .
Bush talking about the taking the country in the “ wrong direction ” when almost 80 % of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction after eight years of Bush .
Makes selling a third term all that much harder .
And , just when you think the GOP attacks on Obama ca n’t get any more bizarre , they do :
The only mention of Obama during the entire event came from Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox , who attempted a joke in which he argued that media outlets had portrayed the presumptive Democratic nominee as Jesus Christ .
“ Apparently Barack Obama was born in a manger , ” Cox said .
“ … Whether there was any room at the inn , I do n’t know . ”
Jesus Christ .
Those Republicans really have no shame .
Can you imagine any Democrat invoking Jesus to mock another candidate ?
It seems very un-Christ like — and I ’d imagine a bad joke like that will spark outrage from James Dobson , Bill Donahue and the rest of the right wing religious types .
Right ?

My brothers and I did n't know Dad had a problem .
We knew he had an insanely large collection of computers and related paraphernalia .
I was living in Washington , DC , and somehow Alex and Andrew , back home in Seattle , had failed to notice that Dad could barely move around his apartment and was navigating from room to room via narrow , oyster - gray corridors formed entirely by PC towers .
But now it all had to go .
His building was being demolished .
Dad had to be out in three months .
Alex and Andrew called me for assistance .
The biggest problem , they told me , was n't just volume .
In ecofriendly Seattle , garbage collectors wo n't take computer hardware — filled as it is with PVC and phthalates .
Dad persisted in holding on to the notion that somewhere out there was a charity desperately in need of a half ton of mid-1990s computers .
It was not the case .
I did what I could to help coordinate .
Alex posted an ad on craigslist for a two - day event : " Huge stash of PC equipment , for free or for a dollar . "
He was in charge of our online strategy because he knows nothing about computers .
He could lure people in with jazzy , noninformational emails .
" Yes , they work , " he wrote to one mark .
" Most of them .
Picture the scene inside the Jawa sandcrawler in Star Wars , with all the obsolete droids . "
Dad 's landlord let them borrow a vacant apartment upstairs , a cramped one - bedroom with dirty carpeting and a sticky kitchenette .
They filled it .
Tupperware bins overflowed with cables .
Scanners , monitors , and printers claimed the corners .
Dad rubber - banded software and drivers to sundry peripherals .
It was an emotional time :
We were trying to transfer stuff from Dad — a nut we know and love — to a bunch of nuts we neither knew nor loved .
One man immediately called his wife in a paroxysm of excitement .
When he told her to bring an additional vehicle for hauling , it seemed our savior had come .
Then she exercised her veto .
Dad took the whole thing pretty well .
He chatted with fellow hoarders about the best places to score unopened Windows 95s , and he hid a few favorite pieces .
He still rents two storage lockers , at $ 127 a month each , for the stuff " too valuable to throw away . "
My brothers probably set aside a few items , too .
Judging by their bedrooms and car trunks , Dad 's behavior might be genetic .
After two days of solid crowds , there was still too much crap .
I phoned every e-waste hauler in Washington state before I found Computer Equipment Resources , out of Carnation .
A guy named Vince met Dad and my brothers on the appointed day .
At first , everyone , including Vince , observed this weird , unspoken protocol that they were to handle the equipment as fragile objects of considerable worth .
By the end of the day , even Dad was hurling monitors into the back of the truck and listening to them crack .
The bill was $ 630 , which my brothers and I split .
Dad is chronically broke , a condition likely not unrelated to his stashing disorder .
He was always a collector .
When I interviewed him for this story , he told me that in the mid-'70s he owned 25 Volkswagen Bugs , which he kept parked on San Francisco streets .
That made me think of Alex 's accumulated Japanese model kits , so I asked my brother how he knew he would never turn into a hoarder like Dad .
" The short answer ?
I do n't , " Alex said .
" But the stuff I collect is actually worth something .
Some of the Super Nintendo games I have are worth , like , 60 bucks . "

Pelicans crash into water to catch fish
A woman required 20 stitches to her face after a pelican crashed into her in the sea off Florida , apparently diving for fish .
The bird , which died in Thursday 's collision , ripped a gash in Debbie Shoemaker 's face as she bathed near the city of St Petersburg .
The city fire chief said he had never heard of a diving pelican hit a person .
Pelicans grow to up to 30 lb ( 13kg ) and can dive from heights of 60 to 70 feet ( 18 to 21 metres ) .
Ms Shoemaker , 50 , returned home on Friday , the Associated Press reports .
Even for Americans -- who are constitutionally convinced that there will always be a second act , and a third , and a do - over after that , and , if necessary , a little public repentance and forgiveness and a Brand New Start -- even for us , the world looks a little terminal right now .
It ’s not just the economy :
We ’ve gone through swoons before .
It ’s that gas at $ 4 a gallon means we ’re running out , at least of the cheap stuff that built our sprawling society .
It ’s that when we try to turn corn into gas , it helps send the price of a loaf of bread shooting upward and helps ignite food riots on three continents .
It ’s that everything is so tied together .
It ’s that , all of a sudden , those grim Club of Rome types who , way back in the 1970s , went on and on about the “ limits to growth ” suddenly seem ... how best to put it , right .
All of a sudden it is n’t morning in America , it ’s dusk on planet Earth .
There ’s a number -- a new number -- that makes this point most powerfully .
It may now be the most important number on Earth : 350 .
As in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
A few weeks ago , NASA ’s chief climatologist , James Hansen , submitted a paper to Science magazine with several coauthors .
The abstract attached to it argued -- and I have never read stronger language in a scientific paper -- that “ if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted , paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm . ”
Hansen cites six irreversible tipping points -- massive sea level rise and huge changes in rainfall patterns , among them -- that we ’ll pass if we do n’t get back down to 350 soon ; and the first of them , judging by last summer ’s insane melt of Arctic ice , may already be behind us .
So it ’s a tough diagnosis .
It ’s like the doctor telling you that your cholesterol is way too high and , if you do n’t bring it down right away , you ’re going to have a stroke .
So you take the pill , you swear off the cheese , and , if you ’re lucky , you get back into the safety zone before the coronary .
It ’s like watching the tachometer edge into the red zone and knowing that you need to take your foot off the gas before you hear that clunk up front .
In this case , though , it ’s worse than that because we ’re not taking the pill and we are stomping on the gas -- hard .
Instead of slowing down , we ’re pouring on the coal , quite literally .
Two weeks ago came the news that atmospheric carbon dioxide had jumped 2.4 parts per million last year -- two decades ago , it was going up barely half that fast .
And suddenly the news arrives that the amount of methane , another potent greenhouse gas accumulating in the atmosphere , has unexpectedly begun to soar as well .
It appears that we ’ve managed to warm the far north enough to start melting huge patches of permafrost , and massive quantities of methane trapped beneath it have begun to bubble forth .
And do n’t forget : China is building more power plants ; India is pioneering the $ 2,500 car ; and Americans are buying TVs the size of windshields , which suck juice ever faster .
Here ’s the thing .
Hansen did n’t just say that if we did n’t act , there was trouble coming .
He did n’t just say that if we did n’t yet know what was best for us , we ’d certainly be better off below 350 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
His phrase was : “ if we wish to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed . ”
A planet with billions of people living near those oh - so - floodable coastlines .
A planet with ever - more vulnerable forests .
( A beetle , encouraged by warmer temperatures , has already managed to kill 10 times more trees than in any previous infestation across the northern reaches of Canada this year .
This means far more carbon heading for the atmosphere and apparently dooms Canada ’s efforts to comply with the Kyoto protocol , which was already in doubt because of its decision to start producing oil for the U.S. from Alberta ’s tar sands . )
We ’re the ones who kicked the warming off ; now the planet is starting to take over the job .
Melt all that Arctic ice , for instance , and suddenly the nice white shield that reflected 80 % of incoming solar radiation back into space has turned to blue water that absorbs 80 % of the sun ’s heat .
Such feedbacks are beyond history , though not in the sense that Francis Fukuyama had in mind .
And we have , at best , a few years to short - circuit them -- to reverse course .
Here ’s the Indian scientist and economist Rajendra Pachauri , who accepted the Nobel Prize on behalf of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year ( and , by the way , got his job when the Bush administration , at the behest of Exxon Mobil , forced out his predecessor ) : “ If there ’s no action before 2012 , that ’s too late .
What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future .
This is the defining moment . ”
In the next two or three years , the nations of the world are supposed to be negotiating a successor treaty to the Kyoto accord ( which , for the record , has never been approved by the United States -- the only industrial nation that has failed to do so ) .
When December 2009 rolls around , heads of state are supposed to converge on Copenhagen to sign a treaty -- a treaty that would go into effect at the last plausible moment to heed the most basic and crucial of limits on atmospheric CO2 .
If we did everything right , Hansen says , we could see carbon emissions start to fall fairly rapidly and the oceans begin to pull some of that CO2 out of the atmosphere .
Before the century was out , we might even be on track back to 350 .
We might stop just short of some of those tipping points , like the Road Runner screeching to a halt at the very edge of the cliff .
More likely , though , we ’re the coyote -- because “ doing everything right ” means that political systems around the world would have to take enormous and painful steps right away .
It means no more new coal - fired power plants anywhere , and plans to quickly close the ones already in operation .
( Coal - fired power plants operating the way they ’re supposed to are , in global warming terms , as dangerous as nuclear plants melting down . )
It means making car factories turn out efficient hybrids next year , just the way U.S. automakers made them turn out tanks in six months at the start of World War II .
It means making trains an absolute priority and planes a taboo .
It means making every decision wisely because we have so little time and so little money , at least relative to the task at hand .
And hardest of all , it means the rich countries of the world sharing resources and technology freely with the poorest ones so that they can develop dignified lives without burning their cheap coal .
It ’s possible .
The United States launched a Marshall Plan once , and could do it again , this time in relation to carbon .
But at a time when the president has , once more , urged drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , it seems unlikely .
At a time when the alluring phrase “ gas tax holiday ” -- which would actually encourage more driving and more energy consumption -- has danced into our vocabulary , it ’s hard to see .
And if it ’s hard to imagine sacrifice here , imagine China , where people produce a quarter as much carbon apiece as Americans do .
Still , as long as it ’s not impossible , we ’ve got a duty to try to push those post - Kyoto negotiations in the direction of reality .
In fact , it ’s about the most obvious duty humans have ever faced .
After all , those talks are our last chance ; you just ca n’t do this one lightbulb at a time .
We do have one thing going for us -- the Web -- which at least allows you to imagine something like a grass - roots global effort .
If the Internet was built for anything , it was built for sharing this number , for making people understand that “ 350 " stands for a kind of safety , a kind of possibility , a kind of future .
Hansen ’s words were well - chosen : “ a planet similar to that on which civilization developed . ”
People will doubtless survive on a non -350 planet , but those who do will be so preoccupied , coping with the endless unintended consequences of an overheated planet , that civilization may not .
Civilization is what grows up in the margins of leisure and security provided by a workable relationship with the natural world .
That margin wo n’t exist , at least not for long , as long as we remain on the wrong side of 350 .
That ’s the limit we face .
Bill McKibben , a scholar in residence at Middlebury College and the author , most recently , of “ The Bill McKibben Reader , ” is the co-founder of Project 350 ( www.350.org), devoted to reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million .

Think back to your earliest memory .
Perhaps images of a birthday party or scenes from a family vacation come to mind .
Now think about your age when that event occurred .
Chances are that earliest recollection extends no further back than your third birthday .
In fact , you can probably come up with only a handful of memories from between the ages of 3 and 7 , although family photo albums or other cues may trigger more .
Psychologists refer to this inability of most adults to remember events from early life , including their birth , as childhood amnesia .
Sigmund Freud first coined the term infantile amnesia , now more broadly referred to as childhood amnesia , as early as 1899 to explain his adult patients ' scarcity of childhood memories [ source : Rapaport ] .
Freud proposed that people use it as a means of repressing traumatic , and often sexual , urgings during that time .
To block those unconscious drives of the id , Freud claimed that humans create screen memories , or revised versions of events , to protect the conscious ego .

More than a century later , researchers have yet to pin down a precise explanation for why childhood amnesia occurs .
Only in the last 20 years have people investigated children's , rather than adults ' , memory capabilities in search of the answer .
This research has brought with it a new batch of questions about the nuances of young children 's memory .
For a long time , the rationale behind childhood amnesia rested on the assumption that the memory - making parts of babies ' brains were undeveloped .
Then , around age 3 , children 's memory capabilities rapidly accelerate to adult levels .
However , psychologists have discovered that children as young as 3 months old and 6 months old can form long - term memories .
The difference comes in which memories stick around .
For instance , it appears that babies are born with more intact implicit , or unconscious , memories .
At the same time the explicit , or episodic , memory that records specific events does not carry information over that three - year gap , explaining why people do not remember their births .
But why does this happen , and what changes take place in those first years ?
And if we can form memories as babies , why do n't we retain them into adulthood ?
On the next page , we 'll take a closer look at a baby 's brain to find out the answer .
Google Web History has been around for about a month now , and what a fantastic tool it is !
Fantastic … until you start combing through your search history and realize you wish you did n’t make some of those search queries after all .
Even more so , you wish Google did n’t catalog every move you made so that your significant other could use it for her personal viewing pleasure .
But I guess we ’d rather have Google catalog it instead of Big Brother … or is Google Big Brother ?
Just kiddin’ !
I installed the Google Toolbar last month on one of my machines and did n’t realize that Google ’s Web History was activated by default .
Angel and I had fun ( or not ) looking through some of the search queries I made over this month - long period .
I had a tough time explaining the motivation behind a few of them .
😉
Some were a little scary and others were downright hilarious , but one point became clear :
If you ’re not careful , Google will know every move you make on the web … the good , the bad , and the ugly .
Here are 7
Google searches that I made last month and wish I could take back :
Funny / Scary – filetype: txt “ windows XP ” +cdkey – No Mr. Gates , it ’s not what it looks like .
Scary –
My home address mapped out in several Google Maps driving direction queries .
Well , now they know where I live … lets hope Bill ca n’t afford to buy Google .
Funny – pamela anderson ’s cup size – Honey , one of my coworkers must have typed that in when I was n’t looking .
Funny – hemroid symptoms – Google now knows more about my ass than I ’m comfortable with .
Scary –
My full name – We all Google our own name right ?
So what if they have my name and address now .
Funny – Kama Sutra – Yeah baby …
I was just studying up for the big game !
Funny – - inurl : ( htm|html|php ) intitle : ” index of ” + ” last modified ” +” parent directory ” + description + size +( mpg|wmv ) “ paris hilton ” – Oh , I ’m a big fan of her music , so I was just looking for her latest music video … I swear .

The security forces are accused of abducting hundreds of people
An HRW report accuses security forces and pro-government militias of abducting and " disappearing " hundreds of people - mostly Tamils - since 2006 .
Sri Lanka 's government says HRW has exaggerated the scale of the problem .
In a separate development , a team of foreign judicial experts has announced its withdrawal from the country .
' Unfair '
HRW says many of the missing are young Tamil men targeted on suspicion of links to Tamil Tiger rebels .
But their conclusions have been flatly rejected by the Sri Lankan government .
Concern has been expressed over the disappearance of aid workers
Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona says there has been a " steady decline in disappearances over the last 12 months " because of new measures taken by the government .
" Unfortunately Human Rights Watch has tended to exaggerate the real situation , " Mr Kohona said .
He said the group 's " unfair " report was based on unsubstantiated claims and " anecdotal evidence " , while the government 's own investigations into disappearances were proceeding quickly .
Tens of thousands have died since separatist Tamil Tiger rebels began fighting the Sri Lankan government more than three decades ago .
HRW said several hundred cases of disappearances had been reported since 2006 , when fighting between the Tamil Tiger rebels and the government intensified .
The rights group said the majority of cases " indicate the involvement of government security forces - army , navy or police " .
The government insists that it does respect human rights
The group said pro-government armed Tamil groups - such as the faction led by renegade rebel commander Col Karuna - had also been implicated in the abductions and disappearances .
While most of the victims were members of Sri Lanka 's ethnic Tamil minority , HRW said , some Muslims and Sinhalese had also been targeted .
These included journalists , aid workers , clergy and teachers , HRW said .
Many of the missing were feared dead .
HRW said the Sri Lankan government 's response to the disappearances had been " grossly inadequate " .
It urged the government to reveal the whereabouts of the missing and prosecute those responsible .
The rights group said the number of disappearances carried out by the Tamil Tigers in government - controlled areas was relatively low .
But it said , the Tigers were responsible for targeted killings , forced child recruitment , bomb attacks on civilians and the repression of basic rights in areas they controlled .
' Lack of respect '
Meanwhile , a team of foreign judicial and forensic experts says it is pulling out of the war - torn island because the government has failed to investigate a series of high - profile cases - including the killing of aid workers .
The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons ( IIGEP ) said a government probe into abuses did not meet even basic minimum standards .
The team comprises experts from Australia , Britain , Canada , India , Japan , France , The Netherlands , the US , the European Union and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights .
The IIGEP said its suggestions had been ignored or rejected by the government , whose correspondence with them was " characterised by a lack of respect and civility " .
" There has been and continues to be a lack of political and institutional will to investigate and inquire into the cases before the ( government ) commission , " an IIGEP statement said .
Correspondents say that the group 's conclusions are a major blow to the Sri Lankan government .
USA Today reports that Bobby Hedlund , the FAA manager currently responsible for overseeing the agency 's Southwest Airlines office , received months of flight training from the airline during 2005 .
This in itself is n't news .
The FAA has had an inspector training program in place for years , saying – rightfully so – that this type of instruction is a way for inspectors to stay abreast of changing technology .
At issue is who paid .
It seems that the training , with an estimated retail value of over $ 15,000 , was provided free of charge to the inspectors by Southwest .
Run that one by The Ethicist and see what he says .
The free training violates the FAA 's rules of conduct , and proves again that some of the agency 's inspectors enjoy an inappropriately close relationship with Southwest .
This first came to light earlier in the year when it was discovered that the FAA turned a blind eye while Southwest operated planes deemed " unsafe . "
After this revelation , the FAA played catch - up by ordering inspections that grounded hundreds of aircraft .
The free - flight fracas was n't the only bad news for the FAA this week .
The Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) says the FAA has in recent years blown off more than 100 recommended safety reviews , covering everything from flight crew training to deicing programs .
A letter to a Senate subcommittee from FAA head Bobby Sturgell admitted that " dozens " of safety reviews had been skipped , blaming the lapses on " inadequate resources . "
The consensus seems to be that the skipped inspections were n't related to crucial safety issues , and that passengers were never at risk .
But it could indicate that there is a more deeply - rooted culture of cronyism at the FAA , and that 's bad news .

“ What ’s important is that the people that I work with are also recognized and that it ’s the Nintendo brand that goes forward and continues to become strong and popular , ” he said by way of comparing Walt Disney ’s role in the larger brand with his .
“ And if people are going to consider the Nintendo brand as being on the same level as the Disney brand , that ’s very flattering and makes me happy to hear , ” he added , through an interpreter .
( He understands spoken English well but does not speak it beyond a few phrases , a twist of considerable amusement to him given that his father taught English . )
Image An image from Wii Fit .
Mario , the mustached Italian plumber he created almost 30 years ago , has become by some measures the planet ’s most recognized fictional character , rivaled only by Mickey Mouse .
As the creator of the Donkey Kong , Mario and Zelda series ( which have collectively sold more than 350 million copies ) and the person who ultimately oversees every Nintendo game , Mr. Miyamoto may be personally responsible for the consumption of more billions of hours of human time than anyone around .
In the Time 100 online poll conducted this spring , Mr. Miyamoto was voted the most influential person in the world .
But it is n’t just traditional gamers who are flocking to Mr. Miyamoto ’s latest creation , the Wii .
Eighteen months ago , just when video games were in danger of disappearing into the niche world of fetishists , Mr. Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata , Nintendo ’s chief executive , practically reinvented the industry .
( Mr. Miyamoto ’s full title is senior managing director and general manager of Nintendo ’s entertainment analysis and development division . )
Their idea was revolutionary in its simplicity : rather than create a new generation of games that would titillate hard - core players , they developed the Wii as an easy - to - use , inexpensive diversion for families ( with a particular appeal to women , an audience generally immune to the pull of traditional video games ) .
So far the Wii has sold more than 25 million units , besting the competition from Sony and Microsoft .
In an effort to build on this success , last week Nintendo released its new Wii Fit system in North America , a device that hopes to make doing yoga in front of a television screen almost as much fun as driving , throwing , jumping or shooting in a traditional game .
Though there were no hard sales figures available as of Tuesday , there were reports of stores across the country selling out of Wii Fit .
If you want to know what the future holds in store , just take a look at what John McCain said recently to the AIPAC conference :
“ Rather than sitting down unconditionally with the Iranian president or supreme leader in the hope that we can talk sense into them , we must create the real - world pressures that will peacefully but decisively change the path they are on .
Essential to this strategy is the UN Security Council , which should impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions .
Should the Security Council continue to delay in this responsibility , the United States must lead like - minded countries in imposing multilateral sanctions outside the UN framework .
I am proud to have been a leader on these issues for years , having coauthored the 1992 Iran - Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act .
Over a year ago I proposed applying sanctions to restrict Iran ’s ability to import refined petroleum products , on which it is highly dependent , and the time has come for an international campaign to do just that .
A severe limit on Iranian imports of gasoline woul d create immediate pressure on Khamenei and Ahmadinejad to change course , and to cease in the pursuit of nuclear weapons . ”
In short , a military blockade that would amount to having Iran in a death - grip , precisely what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did to the Japanese in order to provoke them into attacking .
What the War Party is hoping for is another Pearl Harbor , a rationalization to launch a new world war .
Barack Obama ’s response has been appeasement  not of the Islamic Republic of Iran , but of the Republicans here at home .
Which is why the charge of appeaser , coming from the GOP , will tend to stick .
Senator McCain ’s major talking point before the AIPAC crowd was that Obama voted against the Kyl - Lieberman resolution , which designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , a branch of the Iranian government , as a terrorist organization , giving U.S. forces carte blanche to attack .
The response of the Obama camp was to say that they really had no problem with the fundamental aim of Kyl - Lieberman , just the resolution ’s implication that American troops in Iraq would now be tasked with countering Iranian influence .
In short , Obama ’s answer amounted to yes , the Revolutionary Guard , and the government that directs them , are terrorists , but we should n’t go after them in Iraq .
Or , as Denis McDonough , who heads up the campaign ’s foreign policy shop , put it , “ The debate last fall was about the broader implications and other parts of that amendment , giving the soldiers an additional mission in Iraq . ”
Weasel words , if ever they were spoken .
The fact of the matter is that Obama did n’t vote on Kyl - Lieberman .
He then attacked Hillary Clinton over it , saying it was yet another milestone on our road to war with Iran , and everybody knew it at the time .
AIPAC and its allies in both parties have been agitating for a military confrontation with the Iranians since well before the Iraqi disaster jelled in the public consciousness , and everybody knows that , too .
Does Obama really think he ’s deceiving anyone with a non-response that gives new meaning to the word “ disingenuous ” ?
In an interview with Fox News , Obama countered criticism of his willingness to talk to the Iranians by declaring :
“ Iran is stronger now than when George Bush took office .
And the fact that we have not talked to them means that they have been developing nuclear weapons . ”
Yet it means no such thing , as our own national intelligence estimate [ . pdf ] on the matter states quite plainly .
Iran , like prewar Iraq , abandoned its nuclear weapons program some time ago .
McCain ’s blockade is all about regime - change , and has nothing to do with “ weapons of mass destruction . ”
As Yogi Berra once put it , “ It ’s déjà vu all over again ! ”
Is n’t this the same progression of alleged motivations we saw in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq ?
In Bizarro World , history repeats itself , the first time as farce , the second as tragedy .
McCain is signaling his support for the long - rumored war Bush is said to be planning as his bloody “ legacy ”  a legacy of horror , to be sure , one that will long be remembered as the act of a monster .
What Obama is signaling is nothing .
Seeking to avoid the impression of weakness , he succeeds only in projecting it .
As I write , he has yet to actually deliver his much - awaited speech to the AIPAC conclave , but there is little doubt Obama ’s appeasement of the Lobby will continue .
He shares with John McCain the view that the U.S. government cannot and should not take an attack on Iran “ off the table , ” to repeat the phraseology invariably utilized by politicians and pundits when this subject comes up .
As if the Iranian people , who will suffer enormously in the course of an attack , are mere cards in a deck shuffled by U.S. policymakers .
And you wonder why they hate us .
The idea that Obama is going to save us from World War IV , as the neocons gleefully refer to the impending conflict , is , it turns out , a pipe dream .
The sad fact of the matter was underscored by Jonathan Landay in the McClatchy newspapers :
“ The presumptive Republican nominee for president and the leading contender for the Democratic nomination are exaggerating what ’s known about Iran ’s nuclear program as they duel over how best to deal with Tehran . ”
I do n’t believe , as Landay avers , that the presidential candidates of both major parties have failed to understand the issue because they have n’t “ studied it ” enough .
They ’ve studied it , all right : after all , the McCain campaign is staffed by some of the Lobby ’s crack propagandists and street - fighting ideologues .
Obama has also studied it and knows better than to test the Lobby ’s power this early in the campaign .
That ’s assuming , of course , that he ’ll dare do so at any point , even if and when he makes it to the White House , much less during the struggle to get there .
Our role in the Middle East has long been shaped by the advocates of an Israel - centric foreign policy , whose views subordinate U.S. interests to the political exigencies of dealing with a domestic lobby that acts , in a literal as well as a metaphorical sense , precisely as one would expect the agents of a foreign power to act .
That AIPAC has skillfully skirted the issue of why it should n’t register as such under the terms of the Foreign Agent Registration
Act is a powerful testament to the Lobby ’s unhealthily decisive influence in Washington .
Having successfully squelched , or at least indefinitely delayed , the long - upcoming trial of AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , the group ’s lawyers have scored a major victory in their battle to cover up the true nature of AIPAC as an instrument of Israeli policy , including its policy of spying on its great benefactor , stealing ( and dealing ) America ’s most closely guarded secrets .
The trial of the AIPAC spies , who ferried top - secret intelligence to Israeli embassy personnel via the chief honcho of the Pentagon ’s Iran desk , would have demonstrated in open court what the Lobby ’s most vocal critics have long contended : that it functions as a de facto extension of the Israeli government .
It ’s odd that a case that started out with such spectacular drama  no less than two FBI raids on AIPAC ’s Washington headquarters  should end so quietly .
The Lobby ’s crime is not just that it puts Israel first .
Worse , it represents the more unreasonable factions of that government , or possible future governments  the Likud - rejectionist wing that opposes any settlement of the Palestinian question except by expelling the whole lot of them to Jordan .
That its power is now being effectively challenged by the J Street organization shows just how politically isolated are the traditional Zionist groups , which have long dominated the debate over U.S. policy in the Middle East .
The Lobby ’s main base of support is not in the Jewish community , but in the dispensationalist wing of the “ born again ” Christian evangelical movement , epitomized by the Rev. John Hagee .
The founder of Christians United for Israel has taken Jew - hating to a new level altogether , wedding ultra-Likudnik rhetoric to obvious contempt for the Jewish tradition .
Hagee believes that , come the End Times  after the Final War between God and Satan , one pitting Israel and the U.S. against the Muslims and the Russians , with the Chinese probably thrown in for good measure  the grateful Jews will finally see the light and be converted to Christianity .
The rest will , naturally , burn in Hell .
The question that tantalizes is this : if Bush takes the hint and imposes a military blockade , will Obama get on board , or will he stand up to the War Party ?
I do n’t pretend to know the answer to that question ; I can only hope he will , but I ’m not betting the ranch on it .

When " Fidgety Philip " grows up , the problems of attention deficit disorder can multiply into loss of nearly a month 's work per year .
Long seen as a problem for children , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was first described in 1845 by Dr. Heinrich Hoffman , who wrote " The Story of Fidgety Philip . "
More recently , it has been recognized as continuing into adulthood for some people , and new research seeks to estimate the effect of ADHD on workers .
This lack of ability to concentrate costs the average adult sufferer 22.1 days of " role performance , " per year , including 8.7 extra days absent , according to researchers led by Dr. Ron de Graaf of the Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction .
It might be cost - effective for employers to screen workers for ADHD and provide treatment , the researchers suggest .
" There were many more people than most of us who have done these studies had expected , " that were affected by adult ADHD , said Dr. Ronald C. Kessler of Harvard University , a co-author of the report .
" People do n't come for treatment for this ... it 's kind of one of those hidden things , " he said in a telephone interview .
" It 's an enormous impairment , " Kessler said , citing absences , accidents and low performance on the job .
Kessler said he had worked with workers suffering depression and found that treatment costing $ 1,000 could help prevent $ 4,000 in lost productivity .
" It sure looks like the effect would be as big , if not bigger , for ADHD , " he said .
" We 're looking around for an employer or two who might be willing to give this a try . "
Linda S. Anderson , president of the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Association , said workplace assistance and treatment can be vital , Most people think of ADHD as a children 's problem , but when it continues into adulthood people have a problem coping with the workplace and need assistance , said Anderson , who was not part of the research team .
The new study may underestimate the adult rate of ADHD , she said , noting that many victims may not have jobs .
Those who do often struggle to keep up , but there are treatments available , she said .
The majority of the lost performance was associated with reductions in quantity and quality of work rather than actual absenteeism , the researchers said .
Many employers assume occasional absences are part of the cost of doing business , but the paper noted that , " typically they expect their workers to be working when they are on the job . "
To find that most of the ADHD - related loss occurs on days when the worker is present is both striking and disturbing from an employer perspective , the authors said .
Researchers interviewed 7,075 workers aged 18 to 44 in 10 countries , concluding that an average of 3.5 % had ADHD .
Their findings are published in Tuesday 's online edition of the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine .
In 2006 , a study led by Kessler estimated that 4.4 % of adults aged 18 to 44 in the United States experience ADHD symptoms and some disability .
The new research estimated the U.S. rate at 4.5 % among workers , costing an average of 28.3 days performance .
The highest rate was for France , 6.3 % , but the lost time was lower at 20.1 days .
Other countries studied and ADHD rates among adults , and estimated days lost per affected worker , were Lebanon , 0.9 % , 19.4 days ; Spain , 1.3 % , 1.1 days ; Colombia , 1.9 % , 29.4 days ; Mexico , 2.4 % , 6.1 days ; Italy , 3.4 % , 22.2 days ; Germany , 3.5 % , 13.6 days ; Belgium , 3.7 % , 16.5 days ; Netherlands , 4.9 % , performance improved .
The researchers were unable to explain why the ADHD affected workers in the Netherlands had improved performance rather than the declines seen in every other country studied .
" We periodically find one of those blips , we just do n't know why , " Kessler said .
In a separate study issued earlier this month , researchers led by Kessler reported that major mental disorders cost the U.S. at least $ 193 billion annually in lost earnings alone .
That study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry .
The new international study was supported by the World Health Organization , U.S. National Institute of Mental Health , John D. and Catharine T. MacArthur Foundation , the Pfizer Foundation , U.S. Public Health Service , Fogarty International Center , Pan American Health Organization , Eli Lilly and Company , Ortho- McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. , GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol - Myers Squibb Company .

The Warner Music Group said yesterday that its fourth - quarter profit slipped 58 percent amid a softer international market and a decline in compact disc sales .
Its results , however , topped Wall Street estimates .
The company said earnings for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 5 million , or 3 cents a share , from $ 12 million , or 8 cents a share , in the period a year earlier .
Quarterly results included $ 9 million in revamping and implementation expenses and a $ 12 million benefit for a settlement with Bertelsmann related to Napster .
The earlier period included a $ 13 million gain on a Kazaa online music sharing settlement .
Quarterly revenue climbed 2 percent , to $ 869 million , from $ 854 million in the year - ago period .
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected net income of 2 cents a share on sales of $ 874.8 million .
The California Supreme Court today rejected a bid to freeze last month ’s ruling legalizing gay marriage , paving the way for same - sex couples to begin walking down the aisle as soon as June 17 .
Moving swiftly to remove legal uncertainty , the court turned away a request from gay marriage foes to stay the ruling until after the November election , when voters will consider a ballot measure that would change the state Constitution to again outlaw same - sex weddings .
The secretary of state earlier this week qualified the initiative for the November ballot .
The justices were divided 4 - 3 on whether to rehear their earlier decision , the same split that unfolded when the gay marriage case was decided in May .
Conservative organizations , joined by 11 other states , asked the court to reopen the case , a move opposed by civil rights groups , San Francisco city officials and Attorney General Jerry Brown .
The Supreme Court found California ’s ban on same - sex weddings unconstitutional in a 4 - 3 ruling that reverberated across the country .
Since that time , state officials have created new marriage licenses and announced that they would be prepared to handle gay marriages on June 17 , the day after the Supreme Court ’s ruling becomes final .
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera applauded the court ’s move , saying it would have “ politicized our judiciary ” if the justices had put the ruling on hold until the election .
And civil rights lawyers said gay couples were now poised to take advantage of their newfound legal rights .
“ Lesbian and gay couples in California will be able to marry on an equal basis starting on June 17 , ” said Shannon Minter , legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights .
“ Every day , public support for the freedom to marry is growing . ”
Conservative organizations had argued that the court ’s ruling should not go into effect until after the election because of the uncertainty surrounding same - sex marriages that are expected to take place between now and November .
If voters approve the ballot measure banning gay marriage , it would cast doubt over same - sex marriages , an issue expected to be tied up in the courts .
“ This is a 4 - 3 vote for legal chaos , ” said Glen Lavy , attorney for the Arizona - based Alliance Defense Fund .
Civil rights lawyers have vowed to challenge the ballot measure if it is approved by votersin light of the Supreme Court ’s ruling that same - sex couples should have an equal right to marry .
A Field Poll last week found a majority of Californians narrowly oppose the constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage .
Peter Garrett , the Australian environment minister , said there was absolutely no need to kill whales for scientific purposes .
" In Australia 's view the programmes are in reality commercial whaling operations prohibited by the moratorium , " Mr Garrett said .
" It is no longer sufficient for us merely to oppose whaling under scientific permit .
It 's time for it to stop . "
Crappy , budget - priced Wii games like Rig Racer 2 and Pool Party are n't all bad .
They do n't spell trouble for the Wii .
And in the end , they might end up being a good thing .
A quick glance at the shelves at any game retailer will reveal a host of slapdash B - games , churned out by publishers you 've never heard of to make a quick buck off Wii 's success .
You of course should not buy any of these games .
And you should n't let your friends buy them , either , unless you hate your friends .
But just because Nintendo allows these publishers to crank out garbage games for Wii does n't mean they 're bad people .
In fact , it 's a very healthy attitude to take towards a maturing market , one that could reap dividends for gamers in the long run .
Clubbing The Seal
You can't get a few minutes into a discussion of Wii shovelware without somebody asking , whether facetiously or not , " Whatever happened to the Nintendo Seal Of Quality ? "
Let 's take a moment to define what that even is .
The Nintendo Seal of Quality was a little icon placed on Nintendo - licensed products , starting in the days of the NES .
It was intended to convey that Nintendo had tested the product and that it passed a certain quality standard , but mostly the mark meant that the game or accessory had been officially licensed by Nintendo .
Coming off the Atari 2600 , when most of the games on shelves were produced without Atari 's consent or involvement and were of wildly varying levels of quality , this was seen as an important step to assure consumers that they were getting quality merchandise .
It was n't necessarily supposed to mean that every game would be as fun to play as Super Mario Bros .
It meant that it was an officially licensed product , would n't void your warranty , free from defects in workmanship , etc .
Sure , even back then people laughed at the Seal Of Quality when it was applied to terrible games .
But as a reassurance to customers ( read : Mom and Dad , who did n't know shit from Shinola when it came to making informed gaming purchases ) that they were n't buying an off - brand game , it was a good idea .
Civilization creator Sid Meier recently praised it as one of his top three innovations in gaming .
It 's important to remember that while Nintendo 's competitors might not have copied the seal itself , they did take the idea :
Every major game system since the NES has had a structure whereby third parties can create officially licensed software .
It 's gotten to the point where customers no longer need the extra reassurance .
As such , the Nintendo Seal Of Quality does n't actually exist anymore .
For one thing , it 's now the " Official Nintendo Seal . "
For another , it appears on the back of games , very tiny , not prominently on the front .
Its original purpose is no longer an issue .
What 's odd is that with Wii , Nintendo is actually loosening the restrictions .
Sony goes much farther than Nintendo did :
They have a " concept approval " policy , whereby games still in the design or concept stages have to be sent in to Sony , who has an entire team devoted to reviewing them and can block games from appearing on PlayStation hardware .
One well - known case in point was during the early PSP era , where Sony blocked all PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 ports from appearing on the system unless they had roughly 30 % brand - new , PSP - exclusive content .
Nintendo has no such process .
Here 's what president Reggie Fils - Aime had to say on the subject last year : " In terms of a certification program , we already have a certification program , and publishers need to conform with a number of key aspects in order for the game to be published on our system .
What we do n't do , is we do n't have some sort of filter for quality , because quality is so subjective . "
So basically , the " key aspects " that Nintendo looks for do n't have anything to do with the quality of the gameplay , which means we can assume they 're technical requirements .
And all we really need to do is take a look at the Wii shelves down at the local Gamestop to figure out that Nintendo does n't have any quality controls in place .
Many of the $ 20 Wii games are quick ports of PlayStation 2 software that was only released in Europe – software that Sony's U.S. branch would n't allow to be released .
Glut Busters
But is n't it a terrible thing for all of these quick cash - in games to clog the shelves ?
Surely bad games are never good .
Surely consumers are only hurt by the possibility that they 'll get suckered into buying a crappy game , right ?
And it can't be good for Nintendo , to have their good name smeared ?
Wo n't it give people a bad impression of the Wii and hurt their business ?
Well , Nintendo seems to be doing just fine .
Even if Conspiracy Entertainment did sell out of all of their copies of Ninjabread Man , they 're not exactly eating in to Nintendo 's game sales .
There has n't been any wringing of hands in the mainstream media about these crappy Wii games , or any widespread disappointment with Wii among its install base .
Wii Fit and Smash Bros. are hardly in danger .
Is it a problem for third - party publishers , who do n't have Nintendo's tight integration of hardware and software and have a tougher time competing on store shelves ?
Yes , but that should n't be Nintendo 's problem .
It 's up to software makers to illustrate to consumers why they should invest in higher - priced , higher - quality software over budget knockoffs .
It works in every other industry – why not videogames ?
Another question from the peanut gallery .
" But was n't a glut of cheap , inferior software the cause of the game industry crash of 1983 ? "
Whoa there .
Yes , this is often cited as a major problem of that era .
But to call this the one and only reason for the industry crash is a serious oversimplification .
First of all , what really caused the software glut was irrational overexuberance on the part of buyers and game makers .
They truly believed that demand for videogames was about to explode and that they could just churn out damn near anything and sell it .
There was no controlling central authority to put the brakes on , and a lot of small companies popped up out of nowhere to create Atari games and make a quick buck .
When the games business started to dip in 1983 and consumers stopped buying as many games as they had in previous years , retail buyers basically freaked out .
For all they knew , the videogame fad was over and they were about to go the way of pet rocks and hula hoops .
They canceled orders , they did n't buy all of the games from tiny companies – they were n't even ordering from Atari .
Atari ( then owned by Warner ) and Mattel and Coleco could have weathered the storm and convinced retailers that games were still a going concern .
But they all decided that the videogame system was an obsolete relic , and that what consumers really wanted were personal computers , which were the natural evolution of game consoles .
It does not need saying that we are in absolutely no danger of this happening today .
The videogame industry is not going anywhere .
Might a software glut that outstrips demand hurt the Wii ?
Maybe , but Nintendo can put the brakes on if it needs to .
This is n't the 2600 .
If – and this is a big if – it is shown that games like Rig Racer 2 really are hurting Nintendo , they can put the kill on them .
But at this point , demand for Wii software is n't being met by supply .
Or it certainly was n't over the holidays , when all of these junk games were released .
Third parties have n't been putting out a lot of Wii software , and even as it continues to steamroller PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , they 're still not announcing many major game releases .
To put it another way , third parties created the gap that others stepped in to fill .
And who 's to say that Atari would n't have been able to solve , using better marketing , the game - glut issue ?
As I said , they never even bothered to try :
They jumped right out of the pool the second somebody started peeing in it .
Why It's A Good Thing
It 's important to keep in mind that we 're only talking about the American market when we talk of the " new " phenomenon of $ 20 budget - priced game racks .
In the other two major markets , Europe and Japan , this has long been commonplace .
These Wii shovelware games had to be shoveled from somewhere , and it 's Europe .
Sony does n't allow the PlayStation 2 versions of games like Billy The Wizard in the U.S. , but their friends across the Atlantic have no such compunctions .
And D3 Publisher made its name by selling cheap budget software in Japan , under the Simple 2000 series .
And they seem to be doing fine , too .
As a matter of fact , Japan is a good example of how this kind of free - market stance can end up being good for consumers .
A lot of the early Simple series games were n't good , but eventually they had some hits .
D3 managed to break into a market that had been controlled by the same few publishers ever since the Famicom days .
Could Bold Games or Conspiracy Entertainment bring us the next Oneechanbara ?
How about the next Zombie vs. Ambulance ?
You never know ; they might come up with a game that 's actually worth twenty bones .
And if third parties are too scared of failure to do anything without somebody first lighting the way , what does it mean for us that companies like Bold have proved that there is a market for inexpensive Wii games that are light on features ?
Surely Capcom could come up with some $ 20 game concepts .
Or Electronic Arts .
And why do we think that consumers can't figure it out ?
Why do videogames have to be the one product for which we believe they need to have their hands held ?
I loved He - Man as a kid .
There were all kinds of crappy knock - off action figures in the cereal aisle at the supermarket for $ 1 .
Did anybody buy them for me ?
No .
They knew what the real deal was and paid more for it .
Go into a Walgreens and look by the cash register .
See the giant dump bin of $ 2 DVD movies ?
These do n't stop anybody from buying the films they really want to see at full price at Virgin Megastore across the street .
All Nintendo is doing is opening up the market and exerting less control over what people can make for the Wii .
Plus , think about it .
Nintendo's official line here is that they 're not putting creative restraints on game makers , which is wholly incompatible with their rationale for why they wo n't allow Adults Only - rated games on Wii .
If Nintendo does n't think it 's a problem that awful games like Monster Trux Offroad have the Nintendo logo on them and are associated with their company , why is it an issue if an AO - rated game like Manhunt 2 is released on Wii ?
That same laissez - faire philosophy might actually start applying to games we want to play .
A more hands - off approach to the game market from console makers is good for gamers , even if it lands us a bunch of bad games in the meantime .

The Video , Episode 4 , in which we take a look at five of the Wii 's worst games .
This might sound silly , but hear me out .
There are two different scenarios that would cause you to consider quitting your job to save money .
The first scenario is if you are a man or woman who just works to make extra money , and the other spouse earns the majority of your income .
This scenario also requires that you have young children that need to be cared for .
The second scenario is if your commute is longer than 45 minutes each way to work .
Given the rising gas prices , food costs , and a stock market that has been stagnant , we really need to start looking at the value of our jobs .
Here is the reason why you may want to consider quitting your job if your situation falls into one of these two scenarios .
Spouse working for extra money .
If you ’re making less than 25 % of your household income for an extra job and you are paying for child care because of the extra job , it might not be worth it .
Take your net income after taxes for the month , and then subtract all of the extra costs for having the job such as gas , child care , and extra costs for eating out more during the week .
You ’ll start to see that it is n’t worth it to keep that job .
Now , this scenario does n’t work if you both have full - time careers that make similar salaries .
The long commuter .
Gas is at $ 4.00 a gallon , but it will probably rise to $ 5.00 a gallon .
Paying $ 100 a for a gallon of gas on a Honda Accord is becoming more of a reality .
So , if you have to fill up twice a week , because of your commute to work , you better be making some serious coin .
There ’s no rule of thumb , but if you end up spending $ 200 a week on gas , then you probably live too far away from your job .
Start looking for opportunities closer to home .
If there are none , consider doing a car pool with someone who might live near you .
Websites such as eRideShare can help you find carpool companions .
Home - Based Businesses
I foresee an even larger boom for people starting businesses out of their home .
We ’re going to see more lawyers and CPA ’s do business out of their house as well .
Is this is viable option for you ?
Do you have a service idea that you can perform out of your house ?
Do you have a product you can sell out of your house ?
Think about all of the money you can save each month with NO commute to work .
I bet some people are spending $ 400 a month on gas for EACH car .
An extra $ 400 a month invested in a growth stock mutual fund for the next 30 years will make you a millionaire .
Working from home is becoming a sexier option more and more nowadays .
You can make it happen if you truly work hard to do it .
So , is your job worth it ?
It might not be if you ’re commuting a long distance , paying for child care , and spending more on car maintenance and eating out at night .
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is asking FBI head Robert Mueller to explain why the feds sought records from the Internet Archive , a digital library , using a controversial administrative subpoena known as a National Security Letter , which is intended for a communications service providers .
The Internet Archive , a digital library of the web and media , beat the November 26 NSL with the help of attorneys at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union .
In April , the FBI agreed to withdraw the request for records on a Internet Archive user and lift the gag order that typically attaches to such requests .
The six senators sent Mueller a letter Thursday , asking him to explain what happened and to find out if the FBI reported the incident to an oversight board as a possible violation of federal law .
The Internet Archive 's case is only the third known legal challenge to NSLs , despite the fact that the the FBI issues tens of thousands a year – more than 100,000 such letters were issued in 2004 and 2005 combined .
But despite the lack of legal challenges from recipients at ISPs , telephone companies and credit bureaus , successive scathing reports from the Justice Department 's Inspector General have found illegal letters and a willy - nilly culture within the bureau towards tracking their usage .
The tools are powerful because an FBI agent looking into a possible anti-terrorism case can essentially self - issue the NSL to a credit bureau , ISP or phone company with only the sign - off of the Special Agent in Charge of their office .
Recipients may challenge the order in secret court proceedings , but are almost always barred for life from disclosing to anyone , including business partners and significant others , that they received such a letter .
Senator Russell Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) , the only senator to vote against the USA Patriot Act that eased the usage of NSLs , signed the Thursday letter ( .pdf ) , along with senators John Sununu ( R - New Hampshire ) , Richard Durbin ( D - Illinois ) , Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) , Ken Salazar ( D - Colorado ) and Chuck Hagel ( R - Nebraska ) .
Specifically , they asked Mueller if the FBI actually believed that the Internet Archive was an communications service provider .
If it were , FBI agents could get subscriber records using an NSL under the auspices of the Electronic Communications Protection Act .
But if the Internet Archive is a library , that subpoena would be inapplicable and possibly illegal .
That would mean that the NSL should be reported to the Intelligence Oversight Board as a possible violation of law .
The senators are asking Mueller if the Internet Archive subpoena actually was reported to the board .
That 's a wise question to ask given that Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine has reported that the FBI has been negligent and tardy in reporting possible violations of federal NSL power .
It also makes sense in light of an odd case of a withdrawn NSL to a university that was later used by Mueller to argue for expanded court - free subpoena powers .
The FBI only reported that overreaching subpoena for medical records at the end of 2007 as the Inspector General was sniffing around the case .
THREAT LEVEL has its own sets of questions :
First –
In July 2007 , FBI agents met with the Internet Archive 's lawyers – the Electronic Frontier Foundation – to talk about getting information from the Archive .
Some four months later , a seemingly totally deficient NSL was dropped on the Archive .
It was signed not by the local Special Agent in Charge , but by Art Cummings , a top Justice Department counter - terrorism official .
Knowing that the Internet Archive is represented by lawyers who would jump at the chance to file a constitutional challenge to national security letters , would n't you think the FBI would take the four months between the initial meeting and the issuance of the letter to make sure the NSL complied with the law ?
This seems especially odd given that in September 2007 – two months prior – the NSL statute had been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge because of the gag order – a ruling that is currently under appeal by the feds .
Second , the NSL ( .pdf ) dropped on the Archive is now public , but curiously the boilerplate section of the letter that advises recipients on what kinds of things to search for and what counts as an electronic communication record is blacked out .
The law is n't very clear on what that phrase means , but in other cases , is very specific about what is and is not covered under wiretapping rules .
NSLs are not supposed to be used to get at the contents of a communication , though they can be used to get things like phone records .
Why does the FBI think that list of possible records should be secret ?
Does that list contain items that are actually content – for instance , URLs visited by a person ?
Perhaps not surprisingly , the Center for Democracy and Technology called today for new legislation to regulate National Security Letters , saying the FBI is clearly incapable of policing itself .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Rachel Ray was outed as a terrorist sympathizer and Dunkin Donuts was declared the official coffee of Al Qaeda as Michelle Malkin , super - heroine extraordinaire , protected Americans from the jihadist message hidden within a recent Dunkin Donut commercial .
We should all be thankful that Malkin is out there , patrolling our culture , and protecting us from this filth .
Thanks to Malkin ’s heroically supersensitive ability to be extremely offended ( and to get other people to follow her ) , Dunkin Donuts has finally renounced terrorism and removed this ad from circulation .
Some liberal pansies may ask when a scarf is just a scarf .
But what these liberals do n’t get is that patriotism is not a function of “ loving ” one ’s country ; patriotism is not about wanting to make America a better place ; and patriotism is certainly not about “ independence . ”
And treason does not include things like deceiving a nation to start a war of choice , or looting the government treasury , or allowing our sworn enemy to determine our foreign policy .
What patriots like Michelle Malkin get is that patriotism and treason are not about intentions and actions , but about style .
I know Michelle Malkin is a patriot because she is always on the lookout for traitors ( who all happen to be Democrats . )
She also talks about patriotism a lot , and I ’m sure she wears a flag pin all the time ( even though I could find a picture of her wearing one for this article . )
Rachel Ray is obviously a jihadist because she wore a scarf that looks kind of like a traditional Arab headdress .
That ’s also how you can tell that Arabs hate America – because so many of them wear these keffiyehs .
That ’s why everyone can see how ridiculous it is that presidential candidate ( and super - secret Muslim ) Barack Obama considers himself a patriot .
He said he stopped wearing flag pins because people used them as substitutes for “ true patriotism . ”
What he does n’t get is that patriotism is only about the fashion statements .
And as for those jihadists at Dunkin Donuts who claimed to not know what a keffiyeh was , Malkin has a ready - made response :
Ignorance is no longer an excuse .
In post -9/11 America , vigilance must never go out of style .
We should all be thankful that Dunkin Donuts had the courage to back down after the threats of boycotting spooked it ’s fearless leader .
And we should all be thankful that we live in a glorious liberal democracy where such bullying is possible .
What better way is there to use our freedoms than to boycott those who wear items of clothing that resemble items of clothing from other nations ?
Some may call such fashion - policing xenophobic neo-McCarthyism .
But Malkin knows it is true patriotism .

Digg ’s “ Florida Update ” : Digg Anti-Spam 1 , Linkbaiters 0
If you ’re a n00 b in the SEO world , you may not know about the Florida Update–basically , it was the single day in history when Google rolled out a new algo and thousands of SEOs said to each other , “ Dammit , Google finally got smart . ”
Well , as the latest Digg update rolled out , thousands of SMOs / linkbaiters reacted by saying–angrily , long - windedly , and periphrastically – ” Dammit , Digg finally got smart . ”
( See a concise summary of the new changes at SEL . )
The good news is , we SMOs & linkbaiters still have dozens of other social media traffic sources , which , as long as they stay “ medium size ” , wo n’t roll out anything like Digg ’s Florida Update .
Meanwhile , a lot of the heavy users leaving Digg will juice the membership at alternatives like Mixx and Tweako .

Rand Fishkin & Tropical Give Advice to Startup CEO’s
From Rand ’s advice to CEO ’s : I ’ve also found that personally , it ’s easy to spot someone who ’s just in the business for the money vs. those who really care and want something great for the industry .
It might be the optimism speaking , but I feel that the latter group usually produces the brightest innovations ( and eventually , profit , too ) .
The urge to make a snarky reply is unbearable … Tropical … must … resist … impulse to … scratch itch … hippy jokes … overloading …
Not every CEO needs this , but I ’ve found that in a web - based market , having watched dozens of people navigate ( or try to navigate ) websites has given me an extra edge in empathizing with the user and trying to understand what they need .
No disagreement here .
Increasing usability is often the easiest / fastest / bestest way to quickly juice a site ’s revenue .
I ’m great at telling people when they ’ve done a good job , but awful at criticizing any effort .
In order to overcome , I ’ve started hiring only those folks who have a deep , internal need for perfectionism .
If you are your own harshest critic , it helps me to work around this pervasive flaw .
My nickname around the office is “ H8er ” .
I call it “ my critical eye ” .
Rand , where do you find these people with a deep need for perfectionism ?
I , ahem , have n’t found this trait much in our generation .
It ’s a dictatorship .
When tough decisions come up , they ’re my responsibility .
I ’ve noticed that even with little things , when we take a company vote , dissent and discomfort abound .
If you want to run a company with a pseudo - democracy , take everyone ’s opinion and input , then make the decision .
You need to be able to take the blame when something goes awry , and bowing to internal pressure is no excuse .
I ’m impressed .
Is the “ team building ” and “ consensus ” fad over yet ?
Good .
You ’re CEO for a reason : you have a higher batting average at decision - making .
I can remember dozens of times when I felt like the world was crashing down around me - that I could barely hold up another day .
I think all CEOs probably need to have those experiences a few times before they start to recognize that nothing is as bad as it seems , the sun ’s coming up tomorrow and time heals more than you think it could .
That employee who ’s struggled the last few months may indeed turn things around .
The client who has n’t paid might just need a little extra contact .
The product that ’s not taking off yet could , with a few tiny fixes , soar .
If you ’re living in a dumpster , working on a stolen laptop online with stolen wireless , you ’ve been indicted for embezzlement , and you ’re trying to get a new social networking site off the ground , then , I ’m sorry to tell you , things are indeed as bad as they seem .
Also : employees do n’t generally “ turn around ” .
Underperformers have no place in a company that ’s not publically traded , so ditch them as soon as you know .

But all ended well as I crushed T - bo in the Feats of Strength ceremony .
Meanwhile Tropical SEO is once again bringing you the good stuff –9 new niche social media sites that actually send traffic .
I have to credit Improvetheweb for pointing me to some links where I found ( and tested ) these new sites .
( p.s. those other lists have a TON of abandoned sites in them .
All the more reason to bookmark the Tropical SEO list which I actually try to maintain . )
I have held off on including some sites which are TOO niche ( Firefox only news ? ) .
And as usual I do n’t include any which I ’m not sure have sustainable communities , which are abandoned ( or too new ) , or which do n’t seem to send significant real traffic .
Paraphrasing Jane Copeland , most of these web 2.0 sites are flaming piles of sh*t .
The ones on my list are n’t .

Can You Make ( a LOT ) of Money with Premium Content ?
I ’m hereby naming 2008 the year of premium content .
Yes , I ’m aware that The New York Times is moving away from the premium content model , as are several other traditional general media outlets .
But I ’m actually seeing things move in the other direction .
I think premium ( paid ) content is making a huge comeback , and will be part of the Web for many years to come .
SEOmoz appears to be making more money with their new paid subscription model then they ever did otherwise ( based on their “ financial transparency ” posts in the past ) .
Aaron Wall , ever the forward - thinking - highly - strategic - web - trending thinker , is planning on moving to the premium subscription model for several stated reasons .
While ESPN still barely even offers free content covering the UFC , Sherdog ’s paid membership program is ticking along .
I just renewed my premium Scout.com subscription .
I just have to have every single piece of info about the Cleveland Browns as soon as it comes out .
We just signed a new # 3 punter to the practice squad ?
Yes , I need to know that .
OK , this bullet point was completely subjective .
But it passes my gut check–if I have ever paid for premium content , and there are other people in the world like me , then …
Of course , the paid content model is n’t right for everyone , and for every success story above there ’s another story about a site cancelling their premium content section .
But when paid content works it really works .
Here ’s a handy , no -BS quiz to help you find out if the paid content model could possibly work for you :
Have you built a free readership of at least 10,000 subscribers or daily readers ?
My napkin calculation says that you can reasonably expect ( best case ) 1 % of readers to pay for a premium membership .
Unless you can successfully charge a thousand bucks a month for membership , I ’d guess you need a base of at least 100 members to break even on content production costs .
Are you a recognized authority in your field ?
This is a huge selling point in being able to convince people they should actually pay for your information when other less formal or less expert informational channels are free .
e.g. , Scout.com is n’t just a bunch of bloggers –they have real reporters and NFL insiders whose journalistic integrity I actually trust .
Do you have serve a regular dosage of exclusive content ?
This could be videos , in - depth guides , research , tools , or whatever , but if you do n’t have exclusives , why would n’t a reader go to your free competitor ?
e.g , Scout.com gets plenty of ( usually true ) rumor stories not carried by ESPN , and also has an exclusive “ Ask the Insiders ” forum , etc .
Is your content niche enough ?
If you ’re reporting on world news , you are competing with approximately 1000000 other free sites .
If you ’re reporting on the Cleveland Browns , you ’re competing with approximately five other sites .
If you ’re SEOmoz , you ’re competing with approximately 5 or 10 really good , regularly updated SEO information channels ( along with about a thousand crappy or quasi- crappy blogs like this one ) .
The point is , if you ’re not niche enough , you ’re going run into some heavy problems–a large number of free competitors , a larger hurdle to brand yourself as an “ expert ” , a harder time getting true exclusives , etc .
I ’m sure I ’m missing other bullet points that ought to be here .
Comment and let me know Now , all this being said , I ca n’t say I ’m currently experimenting with the premium content / subscription model–I ’m too busy with my big project right now .
But damn , I wish I was .
Godspeed , SEOmoz .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- A U.S. Marine in Iraq has been removed from duty amid complaints that he was handing out coins with Bible verses at an American checkpoint , the military said Thursday .
A military spokesman said Iraqis in Falluja complained that the Marine was giving the coins , which were printed in Arabic , to people at an entry control point in Falluja .
U.S. military regulations prohibit religious proselytizing .
" This has our full attention , " said Col. James L. Welsh , chief of staff of Multi- National Force , West .
" We deeply value our relationship with the local citizens and share their concerns over this serious incident . "
At least one of the coins is stamped with the words " Where will you spend eternity ? " according to a report published Thursday by McClatchy Newspapers .
The other side of the coin reportedly contains a verse from John 3:16 that reads , " For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish , but have eternal life . "
Several Falluja residents said they were given the coins over a two - day period and complained that U.S. troops , whom they consider foreign occupiers , were acting as Christian missionaries .
" Regulations prohibit members of the coalition force from proselytizing any religion , faith or practices , " said Col. Bill Buckner , a coalition spokesman .
" Our troops are trained on those guidelines before they deploy . "
A military statement said " appropriate action " will be taken if the reports are substantiated .
The reports stoked religious concerns in Iraq just weeks after Iraqi police discovered that a U.S. soldier had used the Quran , Islam 's holy book , for target practice .
The U.S. commander in Baghdad took the unusual step of holding a public ceremony and reading a letter of apology from the soldier , a sniper section leader , to local Iraqi leaders .
Many in attendance were members and leaders of Sunni militias that the U.S. military has courted to help fight al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgents .
Sunnis often face criticism from other Iraqis for cooperating with American troops .
Falluja , also a mostly Sunni city , was the scene of bitter and bloody fighting early in the Iraq war between U.S. troops , al Qaeda in Iraq and Sunni insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein .

This nature article discusses the results of a survey about scientific misconduct , while an editorial makes some comments .
Quote : “ The 2,212 researchers we surveyed observed 201 instances of likely misconduct over a threeyear period .
That ’s 3 incidents per 100 researchers per year .
A conservative extrapolation from our findings to all DHHS - funded researchers predicts that more than 2,300 observations of potential misconduct are made every year . ”
Almost 9 % of the respondents had witnessed some sort of misconduct , and 37 % of those incidents went unreported .
The authors conclude that , besides protecting the whistleblowers better , it is necessary “ to create a zero - tolerance culture ” .
The editor , however , holds the opinion that one also needs to take a look at “ the environment that has allowed misconduct to flourish ” .
In his opinion , there should be the possibility of finding a solution without ruining the career of a scientist , especially in mild cases .
I tend to follow the editor ’s reasoning .
In my opinion , the zero - tolerance culture already exists to a certain extent , because a scientist convicted of , e.g. faking data , can forget about his career .
But the result of such a policy is clear : no - one wants to blow the whistle on a colleague , because they do n’t want to end somebody else ’s career and because they will make themselves very unpopular .
The real problem is the way misconduct is treated at the moment : we want to identify the guilty scientist , and punish him / her .
While this makes sense for the worst cases of fraud , in milder cases one should try and ask the question * why * the misdeed was done .
Take , for example , the way hospitals treat mistakes nowadays : they try to find out how it could happen , and how it can be avoided in the future .
This is very sensible , because it treats the problem in a proactive way : instead of reacting to the incident by punishing somebody , future incidents are reduced by tackling the things that cause them in the first place .
If there is a lot of pressure to produce as much data as possible in a research group , it is tempting to cut a corner once in a while .
Can this not partly be considered the prof ’s fault ?
In a similar way , one should address the working atmosphere in the group in question .
The problem with the academic system is that there is no informal institution to turn to , besides your boss , if you are to witness a case of scientific misconduct .
So we fall back to the old issue : the only person you can contact in case of problems has all the power over you .
At the University of Toronto , a “ Graduate Student Oath ” , similar to the Hippocratic Oath , has been tried as a means to strengthen scientific ethics ( Science ) .
Although this is an interesting idea , I doubt it will change the behaviour of people very much .
There ’s a scene in the award - winning documentary film , The Panama Deception , in which what is purported to be Manuel Noriega ’s desk is shown , littered with drug paraphernalia and pornography , ostensibly demonstrating what a depraved man he was , and why George Bush Senior had to attack his consequently unacceptably misled nation .
Then a U.S. citizen with abundant Latin American experience appears on screen .
He relates how , back in the early ‘ 70s , photographs of that same desk were produced to slander Chile ’s duly - elected Marxist president , Salvador Allende , who was violently deposed by a rightwing coup in which the CIA and major corporations were proven to have been heavily complicit .
Noriega was certainly an unsavory figure , but his true crime , like that of Saddam Hussein , was that he finally became unwilling to abet Washington and Wall Street ’s long - standing , profiteering machinations against his own country and people .
Had both figures remained dutiful pawns , neither would have incurred U.S. wrath , and they ’d have been entirely free to wallow in the personal decadence of their choosing , while retaining their status as “ friend ” .
The Panama Deception goes on to show how hysteria whipped up against Noriega was manipulatively used to completely obscure the Bush administration ’s blatantly imperialist purpose , and to hide the terrible fact that a withering U.S. invasion to supposedly “ get ” one person entailed mass carnage and war crimes about which few U.S. citizens are even remotely aware .
Even though they ’re still the subject of abiding outrage in the rest of the world .
“ What happened in El Chorrillo in 1989 ? ” is a question that will elicit only blank stares throughout the United States .
That a densely - packed barrio was brutally shelled and burned , at a dreadful cost of hundreds if not thousands of innocent Panamanian lives , has been effectively hidden by our imposed , singular fixation on a particular “ strongman , ” who ’d been propagandistically likened to the Devil himself .
Most Americans will never see footage of whole families crushed alive in their cars by U.S. tanks , apartment buildings being torched in savage succession , or weeping survivors crowded around mass graves from which their blackened , shrapnel - riddled loved ones were grimly extracted .
Likewise , we have no realistic image of what ’s actually occurring in George Bush Junior ’s similarly misrepresented war , where authoritative estimates put the overall Iraqi death toll at roughly 1.2 million souls .
Repentant Iraq veterans recently tried to tell us about pervasive atrocities they themselves had committed , but their “ Winter Soldier ” testimony was censored by the mass media .
Meanwhile , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continues to be portrayed in that dark light through which we saw Noriega and Saddam .
He ’s presented as the epitome of evil , and we ’re afforded no countervailing information that might compel us to favor diplomacy over yet another gratuitous , unprovoked conflict in which multitudes of noncombatant men , women , and children would needlessly be killed .
Of course , we ’re conditioned to not even think of potential civilian casualties in the countries we attack .
The only deaths that seem to matter are those of our “ hometown heroes , ” whose sacrifice is always couched in the most glorious terms imaginable , never mind the ugly realities of neo-colonialism being forced on
nation after nation by the objectively miscreant United States .
If only we could appreciate who the “ bad guys ” in this world actually are .
But no , we ’ll evidently continue to send our sons and daughters to kill somebody else ’s kids — and their parents as well — just so American plutocrats and gangster capitalists can will exploitatively derived fortunes to their pampered progeny .
No obscenity — certainly not that which was fraudulently attributed to Noriega and Allende via that contrived black - ops desk — can begin to compare to a criminal American foreign policy that ’s increasingly indistinguishable from Hitler ’s world - dominance ambition .
What have Iranians ever done against us , other than angrily seizing our embassy when we refused to return the hated , deposed Shah to face justice for his copious crimes ?
We ’re the ones who overthrew Iran ’s populist leader Mossadegh in 1953 , replacing him with the Shah ’s brutally repressive regime .
We shot down an Iranian commercial airliner in 1988 , killing all 209 aboard .
We backed Saddam in waging a devastatingly costly war on Iran .
And now , in preparation for a murderous onslaught that many analysts say will certainly be launched before Dubya leaves office , that same old Panamanian wool is being pulled over our eyes once again .
When will we ever learn ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There 's no question about it : A new breed of speculator is pouring money into the oil market .
What 's less certain is whether this new money is responsible for driving up prices or essential to a healthy market .
Many blame record prices on Wall Street investors new to the oil market , saying they 're bidding up gas prices to artificially high levels - and soaking drivers .
As oil nears $ 130 a barrel , some say $ 10 to $ 70 of that price is due to Wall Street speculation .
But that 's not the whole story .
Nearly everyone agrees that speculators have always been essential to a functioning market and that oil prices could be much higher without them .
What 's harder to understand is the effect of new speculators flowing into commodities from big - money funds like university endowments , pensions and indexes .
Some say they 're a good influence .
In addition to limiting demand , they make it easier to sell oil contracts and create a larger market where prices are less susceptible to big swings following individual trades - known as liquidity in financial speak .
This camp says $ 130 oil is justified since demand is rising faster than supply .
Others say big - fund money is making it harder for traditional oil speculators to do their job .
This camp says big funds distort traditional models used to predict prices and think $ 130 oil is a bubble ready to pop .
What is a speculator ?
Traditionally , a futures speculator bets on the direction of commodity prices and then guarantees that commodity at that price to a client .
This removes some of the risk - and greases the wheels of commerce .
Speculators originated in the food market , and were intended to give farmers a set price in the spring to buy seed , according to Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at Cameron Hanover .
For example , a speculator would offer a farmer $ 3.50 in April for a bushel of corn to be delivered and paid for in October - these are called futures contracts .
The speculator hopes that by October corn will sell for $ 4 , and he 'll make money .
The farmer can plant his fields certain that he 's making $ 3.50 a bushel .
Conversely , a speculator might bet the price of corn will fall .
He might offer to sell a bushel to a corn bread maker at $ 3.50 in April for corn to be delivered in October .
If corn falls to $ 3 by October , the speculator comes out on top .
The deal allows the bread maker to make long term business decisions , like how many employees to hire .
Without this transparent marketplace , uncertainty would be priced into the product , resulting in higher costs for everyone .
Although the lines between producer , consumer and speculator have been blurred in recent years , this same dynamic is at work in today 's oil and gas markets .
" We 're trying to get some type of cost certainty , " said Brad Samples , a commodities analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville , Ky .
Summit buys energy for clients who use lots of it .
One client , Samples says , goes through about $ 15 million a year in diesel fuel , and it 's Samples ' job to make sure it gets a good deal at a consistent price .
For Samples , more money in fuel markets means more people willing to sell him a contract .
He does n't think speculators push prices artificially high , arguing that supply and demand support prices .
" All the focus on speculators being the problem misses the point , " he said .
" The point is : supplies are not growing as fast as demand .
You need sharp price growth to bring down demand . "
Making the right bet
When Samples buys a contract , he needs someone to sell it to him , usually a bank .
To manage the financial risk , the bank will go out and sell that contract to someone else - in other words , a speculator .
Sometimes that person might be someone like George Zivic , managing partner at Almanac Capital , a commodity investment firm .
For him , the influx of big - fund money betting oil prices will move in one direction - in this case up - into the commodities market is a challenge .
Before the new money , price movements were more predictable .
For example , in the spring gasoline usually rises in tandem with crude , and Almanac and other related firms would look to make their money by betting on the difference between the two .
This year that has n't happened - oil prices have greatly outpaced gasoline - and that 's made making money in this market more difficult .
He blames some of the schism on big - fund money betting oil prices will only go up .
" When you have directional money , it makes the historical relationships distorted , " he said .
" There 's no short term shortage of oil .
$ 127 a barrel does n't make sense . "
Placing blame
Beutel , from the consultancy Cameron Hanover and a former NYMEX floor trader , goes even further in blaming big - fund money .
" We want to see them out , they have no respect for our markets at all , " he said .
But Beutel does n't blame these funds for wanting to diversify their portfolio by investing in oil .
If anyone is to blame , he says , it 's the Federal Reserve , which has been predictably cutting interest rates since September to shore up credit markets .
When interest rates fall , investors flock to commodities as an inflation hedge .
" The Fed tipped their hand , " he said .
" [ The big funds ] were basically told by [ Fed Chairman Ben ]
Bernanke that this is where the money is . "
And if the money is there , why would n't the big funds take advantage of it ?
" We are following for us what is a prudent strategy to maximize investment returns , said Clark McKinley , a spokesman for CalPERS , California 's pension fund for workers in the public sector .
" Obviously , there 's some unintended consequences . "
Not everyone agrees big - fund money is playing a role in driving up prices , starting with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the government 's own regulatory agency .
Economists at the CFTC have testified that after studying all the numbers on who is trading what , there is no evidence speculators of any kind are significantly driving up the price of crude .
' You ca n't just point the finger at speculators , " said Michael Haigh , head of U.S. commodities research at the investment bank Soci�t� G�n�rale and a former economist at the CFTC .
" Fundamentally , the markets are where they are supposed to be . "
Haigh said that big - money funds are not just dumping their money onto the market - only betting prices will go up .
He and others say these funds are sophisticated investors and take a variety of positions in the market .
Deutsche Bank took a somewhat novel approach in investigating the role of speculative money .
Analysts there looked at the price of commodities that do not trade in a futures market and came to basically the same conclusion .
" The rally in non-exchange traded commodity prices since the end of 2002 has been similar if not greater in magnitude , " the bank 's analysts wrote in a research note .
" We believe this refutes the claim that speculators have been the primary drivers of rising commodity prices during this cycle . "
So what 's to be done ?
Members of Congress , their ears bent by angry motorists paying nearly $ 4 a gallon for gas , are considering increasing the amount of money investors have to put up front in order to buy oil futures .
Some say this may work , as a lot of the investor interest in commodities is due to the fact that they can essentially gamble with a million dollars worth of oil by putting up $ 100,000 or less of their own money .
In the stock market , they 'd need to put up $ 500,000 .
But others say increasing these requirements - known as margin requirements - would merely drive oil trading into less regulated markets where information would be even harder to track .
The motorist organization AAA does n't have an opinion on what Congress should do .
But like many American drivers , they 've certainly noticed that oil prices have shot up $ 50 a barrel since August at the same time that the stock market tanked , while the supply and demand picture for oil remained little changed .
" After Israel invaded Lebanon , Hurricane Katrina , 9/11 , all of these situations , we have n't seen prices rise to these levels , " said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom .
" We have to wonder if the foundation behind these very high prices is nothing more than speculation . "
( Mental Floss ) --
The legend of Jack Daniel reaches all the way back to the moment he was born .
Unfortunately , nobody knows exactly when that was .
Jack Daniel believed the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey .
Some records show that Jasper Newton " Jack " Daniel came into the world on September 5 , 1846 .
His tombstone , however , says 1850 .
Strange , because his mother died in 1847 .
All of this might not normally matter , but Jack 's birth date is important to his overall legend , which proudly proclaims him " the boy distiller . "
So perhaps it 's best we begin when Jack was first introduced to whiskey , which we know was early in life .
Leaving home at a young age , Jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $ 9 .
He ended up at the home of Dan Call , a preacher at a nearby Lutheran church and the owner of a general store .
There , Reverend Call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself .
Jack quickly became determined to learn the craft .
In fact , many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from Call and began pursuing the business full - time at the ripe age of 16 .
If that legend is true , then Jack began selling his own Tennessee whiskey only three years later ; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce , " Established and Registered in 1866 . "
In reality , no documents support that myth .
Jack may have been a teenage moonshiner , but he did n't register his business with the federal government until 1875 .
And by then , Jack would have been the more booze - appropriate age of 29 .
The maker makes his mark
Whatever legends exist , one thing is certain : Jack Daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing .
Even as a youngster , Jack understood that if people remembered him , they would remember his whiskey .
To that end , he decked himself out in a formal knee - length coat , a vest , a tie , and a wide - brim planter 's hat , and was never caught out of " uniform " again .
Jack also established the Jack Daniel 's Silver Cornet Band -- a 10 - member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside .
With uniforms and instruments from the Sears & Roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling , Jack made sure the band played every saloon opening , Fourth of July celebration , and political rally around .
But perhaps Jack 's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey .
From the beginning , Jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs .
Next , he upgraded to round , custom - embossed bottles .
But when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 , Jack realized he 'd stumbled upon something unique .
The new bottles not only stood out from the crowd , but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport .
In addition , the square look reinforced the idea that Jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first .
Whatever effort Jack Daniel put into his marketing , he never let quality slip .
In 1904 , the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the St. Louis World 's Fair .
It came as little surprise when he won .
Lucky No. 7
Perhaps Jack 's greatest coup was the name he gave his high - quality product -- Old No. 7 . Naturally , nobody seems to know why .
The official historian at the Jack Daniel Distillery today says it 's the most oft - asked question on factory tours .
As you might imagine , many theories have been advanced .
Jack had seven girlfriends .
Jack believed the number seven was lucky .
Jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed Jack 's liquor .
Jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and , upon finding it , labeled it " Old No. 7 . "
None of these stories , however , makes as much sense as the less - than - sexy explanation from Jack Daniel biographer Peter Krass .
Simply put , Jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7 .
But when the IRS consolidated districts within Tennessee , they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16 .
Jack did n't want to confuse his loyal consumers , and he certainly did n't want to bend to the government , so he began labeling his bottles " Old No. 7 . "
More than 125 years later , this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out .
Jack without Jill
Jack Daniel never married .
Some say it 's because he was married to his work ; others say it 's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards .
Or perhaps it 's just that he was too busy catering to the greater Lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate Christmas feasts , hosting exquisite costume parties in his second - story ballroom , and donating money to every church in Moore County .
But by all accounts , Jack was quite a ladies ' man .
He was a perfect dance partner , a polite conversationalist , and a fantastic gift - giver .
Unfortunately , he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter ( or even granddaughter ) .
Once , Jack even asked for a woman's hand in marriage , but her father denied him -- partly because Jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date .
When Jack proposed , her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was " a little too old for such a young girl . "
The early bird gets the gangrene
Hard as it might be to believe , in the end , the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early .
As the story goes , one morning in 1906 , Jack arrived at his office before anybody else .
He tried to access the company safe , but had a terrible time remembering the code .
After a few frustrating minutes , he kicked the safe as hard as he could .
He badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp .
The limp only grew worse with time , and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning .
Then came gangrene , then amputation , and then , five years later , death .
It 's not the happiest ending for the story , or the clearest cut , but it is the best , because it adds to the mystery and mystique of Jack Daniel .
As they say , where facts cannot be found , legends fill the empty space and that 's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame .
After all , as Jack himself believed , the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey .

Click to viewAndy Woerner and his crazy rocketeer friends have built a 21 - foot long X - Wing model that can actually fly .
Yes , this is a real X - Wing powered by four solid - fuel rocket engines complete with radio - controlled moving wings .
It blasts off in California next week , and we talked with Andy about the project , and how they expect it will do .
All the details and a full construction gallery after the jump .

[ UPDATE : Check our full video feature of the X - Wing launch here . ]

The X - Wing model is huge .
At 21 feet long and with a wingspan of over 19 feet it is , in fact , big enough to fly a kid in .
However , knowing that it will be powered by solid - fuel rockets , they would n't put a kid , dog , monkey or Gizmodo editor inside , even if it uses three full parachutes to land .
After drawing the plans using CAD software , Andy 's team and his friends at Polecat Aerospace ( with the help of RMS Laser and Aerotech Consumer Aerospace ) used laser cutting to make the pieces out of Baltic Birch wood .
They also used solid aluminum for some parts , like the rods which are the pivot point for the wings .

Why solid aluminum rods ?
For the most impressive part of the project to work , not only does the axis have to be strong enough to support the stress of the launch but also it has to allow the wings to change position from folded to open while in flight — or , in the words of Red Leader , putting them in attack position , the X that gives the Rebel aircraft its name .
The wings , including the root sections and the outer panels are about 8 ' long and weigh 60 pounds a piece , including the motors .
The motion mechanism had to be able to move all four of these simultaneously , while keeping them in position relative to each other .
Additionally , the motion hardware had to be strong enough to keep the wings in position once they were at the extents of their travel .

They used an electric motor from a RC helicopter , reducing its 40,000 revolutions per minute to generate enough torque to move those massive wings .
Still , the wings will take 35 seconds to travel from open to closed .
Hopefully , they will be able to change before the flight ends , so they can get the full effect in the air .
The wings also hold the engines .
Andy told us they are using " four solid rocket motors which are Class M , the kind that produce a red flame " — which as you probably know , it 's also the same color of the X - Wing engines ' glow .

Even with the aluminum rods , however , there 's the possibility of structural damage .
We asked Andy about how he expected the flight to go : " it 's likely we will have a structural failure in the wings , but we are hoping it will hold . "

If it holds , the X - Wing will be fully recoverable .
It wo n't land on its own , but Andy pointed out that they " will use parachute recovery , with three man-rated chutes which will have radio control deployment , " like the wings position control .

When I first learned about the project there was one thing that did n't click for me : why the X - Wing ?
It does n't seem to have the right shape to be a rocket .
Maybe a better option would have been an Y - Wing or A - Wing .
But an X - Wing ?
Well , according to Andy , " it was the one design from Star Wars that made the most sense to try to scale for rocket power . "
And on top of that , it just looks cool .
I completely agree .
The X - Wing will launch next week , on October 6 , and we can only wish the project the best of luck .
Godspeed Andy and friends , godspeed .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards warned the United States on Wednesday it would face a “ tragedy ” if it attacked the Islamic Republic .

“ We advise U.S. officials to be careful not to face another tragedy , ” Mohammad Hejazi , a senior commander of the elite Guards , was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency .
“ Our last word is that if you want to move towards Iran make sure you bring walking sticks and artificial legs because if you came you will not have any legs to return on , ” he said .
Hejazi ’s comments followed market talk of a military strike against the country ’s nuclear sites .
The standoff between the West and Tehran has sparked fears of a military confrontation that would disrupt oil supplies .
Last week a report said Israel had practiced for a possible strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Washington says it is focusing on diplomatic pressure to thwart Iranian nuclear work it suspects is aimed at making bombs but has not ruled out military action if that were to fail .
A senior Iranian official on Tuesday denied market rumors of an Israeli attack on one of Iran ’s nuclear facilities , which Tehran says are part of a peaceful drive to generate electricity .
The New York Times last week quoted U.S. officials as saying Israel had carried out a large military exercise , apparently a rehearsal for a potential bombing of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Many analysts say Iran ’s nuclear sites are too numerous , distant and fortified for Israel to take on alone .
They say the United States could unleash vastly superior firepower if it attacked Iran but that Tehran could strike back against its forces in Iraq and disrupt oil supplies vital to the world economy .
Also on Wednesday , the influential speaker of Iran ’s parliament hit out at the European Union for imposing new sanctions despite diplomatic efforts to end the dispute .
The 27 - nation EU on Monday agreed new punitive measures targeting businesses and individuals the West says are linked to Iran ’s nuclear and ballistic programs , ten days after world powers offered incentives to Tehran in a bid to resolve the row .
“ If you want to negotiate with Iran on the proposed package , why are you following the path of confrontation ... , ” speaker Ali Larijani , Iran ’s former chief nuclear negotiator , said .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana handed Iran an offer on June 14 of economic and other benefits proposed by the United States , Russia , China , Britain , Germany and France to try to convince it to halt uranium enrichment .
Iran has repeatedly ruled out suspending enrichment , which can have both civilian and military uses .
Their refusal to do so has drawn three rounds of limited U.N. sanctions since 2006 .
Iran has put forward its own package of proposals aimed at resolving the row , but diplomats say it ignores global concern about its enrichment program .
With a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels , Hawaii has become the first state to require solar water heaters in new homes , pleasing environmentalists but leading opponents to note the island chain ’s already high home prices .
Republican Gov. Linda
Lingle signed a bill this week that requires the energy - saving systems starting in 2010 .
She said the law was “ another important step in our long - term plan for energy independence in Hawaii . ”
Hawaiian Electric Co. estimates that about 85,000 households , or roughly 20 % of all homes on the islands , already have solar water heating systems .
They come standard in many new homes .
A traditionally powered water heater is the largest consumer of electricity inside a home , accounting for about 25 % to 40 % of the power used .
A solar system costs about $ 6,000 , compared with about $ 700 for an electric or natural gas water heater .

Environmentalists applauded the requirement .
“ At a time when the globe hungers for smart energy solutions , Hawaii is demonstrating how it can be done , ” said Jeff Mikulina , director of the Sierra Club of Hawaii .
But opponents contend that the law is unfair and will drive up home prices in Hawaii , where a modest home can start at $ 600,000 .
State Sen. Gary Hooser , a Democrat who first introduced the measure five years ago , said home buyers would save money in the long run , with electricity bills at least $ 50 lower each month in a state with the highest electricity rates in the nation .

“ I ’m hoping this will start a trend nationwide , ” said Hooser , who plans to meet with lawmakers in other sunny states such as California to push similar laws .
Hawaii relies on imported fossil fuels more than any other state , with about 90 % of its energy coming from foreign countries , according to state data .
The new law prohibits issuing building permits for single - family homes that do not have solar water heaters .
Some exceptions will be allowed , such as forested areas with little sunshine .
In January , Lingle announced the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative partnership , which aims to have at least 70 % of Hawaii ’s energy needs supplied by renewable sources by 2030 .
Although the first global - warming bill that ever made it to a floor vote on Capitol Hill was defeated Friday , the legislation is setting a marker for action in a new Congress .
Last week 's Senate debate also marks the first time a majority of senators – backed by a broad coalition of business , labor , environmental , and religious groups – publicly endorsed a cap on carbon emissions .
" The big change is the sense of inevitability of climate - change legislation , " says Brendan Bell , Washington representative for the Union of Concerned Scientists , a leading nonprofit environmental group .
" This is the beginning of the US crafting its climate - change policy , and a lot of the disagreements and the frustrations were based on the mechanisms of the program and not disputes over the science . "
Both leading presidential contenders favor mandating reductions in greenhouse - gas emissions .
Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona favors a 60 percent reduction by 2050 , with strong incentives for nuclear power .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D ) of Illinois calls for an 80 percent reduction , but balks at shifting to nuclear power until a solution is found to waste disposal .
The Senate bill split the difference :
It proposed reducing greenhouse - gas emissions 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
At the heart of the plan is a system to trade emissions permits to meet the cap and a consumer tax relief fund to ease the impact on American families .
" This is a landmark day , " said Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D ) of California , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee after the 48 - to - 36 vote on Friday .
In addition to the 48 senators voting to move forward on the global - warming bill , six absent senators sent letters expressing support .
Together , the vote and letters mark the first time a majority of the US Senate has endorsed mandatory action on global warming .
" The Clean Air Act took 10 years .
This will not take 10 years , " Senator Boxer said .
" I think people around the world are going to be greatly encouraged by the fact that 54 members of the United States Senate said they want to support a response to global warming – a real mandatory response , " said Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I ) of Connecticut , who , with Sen. John Warner ( R ) of Virginia , is a cosponsor of the bill .
Sixty votes were needed to ensure a final vote on the bill .
Sponsors say negotiations will continue this week with a handful of senators – some who voted for the bill , some who did not – over compromises needed to advance legislation in the next Congress .
Although debate on the floor was truncated by procedural tactics , including reading aloud the text of the nearly 500 - page substitute amendment to the climate bill , lawmakers did get into serious discussions on the substance of the bill last week , Boxer said .
Talks with a key group of senators this week will center on targeting more aid to farmers and manufacturers and moving quickly to allot more money for clean coal technology – key concerns of the four Democrats who did not vote with their caucus on the global - warming bill .
Senate GOP leaders said that they did not hold up the climate bill for " any dilatory reasons , " but because of the magnitude of the bill , said Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R ) of Kentucky in a June 4 briefing .
" This proposes to be the largest restructuring of the American economy since the New Deal . "
" The way Americans tackle problems like this is with technology , not with clamping down on the economy .
We ought to create the technology to solve the problem and then sell it to the Chinese and the Indians , rather than export American jobs to China and India by clamping down our own economy , " he said .
GOP leaders also cite procedural objections to the global - warming bill :
The 1990 Clean Air bill was on the Senate floor for five weeks and had 180 amendments , but Senate majority leader Harry Reid limited amendments on the global - warming bill to only those that he approved .
" Democrats want to avoid the tough votes , " says Don Stewart , a spokesman for Senator McConnell .
On the House side , a bill proposed by Rep. Edward Markey ( D ) of Massachusetts , who chairs the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , would cut carbon emissions 85 percent below 2005 levels by mid-century .
The Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to begin hearings on its own version of a climate bill this month .
In a report released on June 6 , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said that if governments around the world continue with policies in place , CO2 emissions will rise by 130 percent and oil demand by 70 percent by 2050 – an expansion in oil that is about five times today 's production in Saudi Arabia .
To reverse that trend , a " global energy technology revolution " is both necessary and achievable , said Nobuo Tanaka , executive director of the IEA in a statement on June 6 .
" But it will be a tough challenge . "
To meet the goal of a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse - gas emissions by 2050 , the world would need to build 32 new nuclear plants and 17,500 wind turbines each year and fit some 35 coal and 20 gas - fired power plants a year with CO2 capture and storage technology at a cost of $ 1.5 billion each .
The study estimates 3 % of workers have ADHD Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do 22 fewer days of work per year than people who do not have the condition , a study says .
The research , which looked at 7,000 workers in 10 countries , found an average of 3.5 % had ADHD .
Writing in Occupational and Environmental Medicine , the Dutch team said workplace screening should be used to pick up people with the problem .
A UK expert backed the idea , but warned they should not be stigmatised .
It 's important that ADHD is n't stigmatised as many people with the condition can hold down jobs
Professor Philip Asherson , Institute of Psychiatry People who have ADHD find it difficult to concentrate because they may be hyperactive , easily distracted , forgetful or impulsive .
It is commonly thought of as a childhood disorder , often picked up because of problems at school .
However , there are estimates that around two - thirds of those affected in childhood are still experiencing symptoms in adulthood .
More common in men
In the study , employed and self - employed workers aged 18 - 44 were screened for ADHD as part of the World Health Organisation World Mental Health Survey Initiative in Belgium , Colombia , France , Germany , Italy , Lebanon , Mexico , the Netherlands , Spain and the USA .
They were also asked about their performance at work in the last month .
Those results were extrapolated out to give annual figures .
Workers with ADHD were found to take an average of eight days off sick each year .
They also had , on average , 21 days where they did less work than they should have and 13 days where their work was of poorer quality - each of which was deemed to equate to half a day of lost performance .
ADHD was more prevalent in men and workers in developed rather than developing countries .
The study was carried out by a team who are part of a World Health Organization ( WHO ) research consortium at Harvard Medical School .
The team , led by Dr Ron de Graaf , said : " It might be cost - effective from the employer perspective to implement workplace screening programmes and provide treatment for workers with ADHD . "
Professor Philip Asherson , an expert in adult ADHD at London 's Institute of Psychiatry , said the condition did have an impact on people 's timekeeping , their relationship with colleagues and the ability to focus on work .
He added : " ADHD should be included in general health screens , in the same way that people would screen for anxiety and depression .
This is probably best done by GPs or occupational health departments .
" However , it 's important that ADHD is n't stigmatised as many people with the condition can hold down jobs , or may be particularly good at certain tasks . "

What are these ?
" What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War , or the passing of a particular period of post - war history , but the end of history as such : that is , the end point of mankind ’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . "
~ Francis Fukuyama , " The End of History ? " a 1989 essay published in The National Interest
Self - styled " champions of democracy , " Western and Chinese alike , insist that " Communist " China ought to look to democratic Taiwan for guidance on how to reform its political system .
They insist that " Communist " China ought to adopt Taiwanese style democracy as practiced by Taiwan independence fascists Lee Teng - hui and Chen Shiu-bian .
Champions of democracy need to think again .
Democracy is the breeding ground for fascism .
Democracy provides all the necessary conditions for fascism to take root and mature .
Unless for some perverse , indecipherable reason champions of democracy want mainland China , with its 1.3 billion people , to march down the same fascist path as Taiwan ’s Quisling nomenklatura , they had better check their premises and revise their recommendations .
Democracy incorporates a variety of legal constraints against the abuse of power .
In theory , these constraints prevent the dangerous concentration of power in any single branch of government , particularly the executive .
In practice , they merely legitimize state violence against defenseless citizens struggling to lead their own lives and follow their own dreams .
In theory , democracy is government of the people , by the people , and for the people .
In practice , democracy is government of an elective dictator , by an elective dictator , and for an elective dictator .
Fortunately for mankind , Frances Fukuyama and his fellow champions of democracy are wrong .
History has not ended .
Mankind ’s ideological evolution has not reached its end point .
Western liberal democracy is not the final form of human government .
Otherwise mankind would be trapped within a Kafkaesque nightmare world from which there is " No Exit . "
Communism does n’t Work .
Neither does Democracy
" In theory , there is no difference between theory and practice .
In practice , there is . "
~ Yogi Berra
Communism was destined to fail even before it was implemented , because it was based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about human nature .
The assumption was that human beings would behave " unselfishly , " as defined by Marxist - Leninists , if only political leaders with determination held guns to peoples ’ heads and forced them to act " unselfishly . "
Communism failed because human beings ca n’t be psychologically browbeaten or physically coerced into behaving " unselfishly . "
People who want to coerce others into behaving " unselfishly " will themselves behave according to their fundamental human nature .
They will impose their own selfish values of " unselfishness " upon others , and refer to it as " selfless service . "
What champions of democracy do n’t realize , or realize but refuse to admit , is that the same holds true for democracy .
Democracy was also destined to fail even before it was implemented , because it too was based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about human nature .
The assumption was that " democratically elected " officials would miraculously behave " unselfishly " by virtue of " the democratic process . "
Democracy has failed because elected officials do n’t behave unselfishly merely because they promised to do so during their election campaigns .
Elected officials , once in office , will behave according to their fundamental human nature .
They will abuse the powers delegated to them by " the democratic process " to further their own selfish interests , then glorify their despotic behavior as " selfless service . "
Like Warsaw Pact victims of the Communist delusion , champions of democracy are victims of their own delusions about how democracy ought to work in theory , as opposed to how it actually works in practice .
Both Communism and democracy failed miserably as political systems because they are predicated upon wishful thinking about human nature .
Communism and democracy are both predicated on the hypothetical premise that " If pigs had wings , they could fly . "
Unfortunately for both Communists and champions of democracy , pigs do n’t have wings , they can’t fly , and all the wishing in the world wo n’t make them .
The only politico - economic system , or to be more precise , metasystem , grounded in the fundamental reality of human nature , is the spontaneously generated free marketplace .
Democracy , Breeding Ground for Fascism
" Nothing matters more than winning .
Not even what you believe in . "
~ Tagline for The Candidate ( 1972 , directed by Michael Ritchie , written by Jeremy Larner , former speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy )
Remember The Candidate , the biting political satire starring Robert Redford ?
The Internet Movie DataBase summarizes the plot : " Californian lawyer Bill McKay fights for the little man .
His charisma and integrity get him noticed by the Democratic Party machine and he is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent .
It ’s agreed he can handle it his own way , on his own terms .
But once he’s in the race and his prospects begin to improve , the deal starts to change . "
Why does the deal start to change ?
The deal starts to change because democracy is inherently corrupting .
Democracy incorporates certain perverse incentives .
Democracy ’s holiest sacrament is popular elections .
Popular elections compel candidates for political office to resort to populist demagoguery , i.e. , " impassioned appeals to the prejudices and emotions of the populace . "
Popular elections compel candidates to sacrifice reason to passion , substance to image , and principle to expediency .
As the tagline for The Candidate reminds us , under democracy ’s system of popular elections , " Nothing matters more than winning .
Not even what you believe in . "
No wonder Thomas Jefferson , author of the Bill of Rights , complained that " Democracy is nothing more than mob rule . "
No wonder James Madison , Father of the Constitution , concluded that " Democracies have … been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property . "
Austrian School economist Friedrich von Hayek ’s landmark book , The Road to Serfdom , includes a chapter on populism and fascism entitled , " Why the Worst Get on Top . "
The title of the chapter says it all .
Why do the worst get on top ?
The worst get on top because democracy ’s defining institution , popular elections , do not work as advertised .
In theory , democratic elections ensure that only the most farsighted leaders offering the most rational policies get on top .
In practice , democratic elections ensure that only the most shameless demagogues , for whom nothing matters more than winning , who are willing to betray what they believe in , will get on top .
Adolf Hitler , democratically elected Chancellor of Germany understood this better than anyone .
As Der Fhrer himself observed , " I know perfectly well that in the scientific sense there is no such thing as race .
As a politician [ however ]
I need an idea which enables the order which has hitherto existed on a historic basis to be abolished and an entirely new order enforced and given an intellectual basis .
And for this purpose the idea of race serves me well . "
Democracy , an Object Lesson for China
" You can observe a lot just by watching . "
~ Yogi Berra
Self - styled champions of democracy insist that " Communist " China ought to look to democratic Taiwan for guidance on how to reform its political system .
Ironically , many political reformers agree , but not in the sense that champions of democracy mean .
By observing real - life political developments on mainland China during the 50s , 60s , and 70s , and on Taiwan from the 80s till today , political reformers on both mainland China and Taiwan have learned two enormously valuable political lessons :
Lesson One : Communism does n’t work .
This lesson was learned watching desperately as Mao Zedong ’s economically suicidal , coercive egalitarian policies destroyed mainland China ’s economy and society .
Lesson Two : Democracy does n’t work .
This lesson was learned watching incredulously as Lee Teng - hui and Chen Shui- bian ’s economically suicidal , pro-independence policies destroyed Taiwan ’s economy and society .
Taiwan ’s ill - fated experiment in democracy has provided Chinese political reformers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait with an unmistakable lesson .
Taiwan has shown them that democracy is as much a recipe for social , economic , and political disaster as Communism .
These two important lessons will stand the Chinese nation in good stead as the coming century unfolds , because the adoption of Communism and democracy are the two most catastrophic blunders committed by developing nations in the late 20th and early 21st century .
Chinese political reformers , like Yogi Berra , observed a lot just by watching .
Democracy is structurally defective .
The defects of democracy , its ineffectual constraints against the expansion of power , its predisposition to reward fascist demagoguery , are defects in its incentive structure .
Such defects were unwittingly designed into the system from its inception .
Such defects cannot be " fixed " by " reformers " waving brooms in the air and promising to sweep out the cobwebs of the previous administration .
The only solution to the insoluble problems of democracy , is to jettison the system altogether start over with a clean slate .
The mainland region of China tried Communism and discovered it did n’t work .
The Taiwan region of China tried democracy and discovered it does n’t work either .
A future , reunified China has an unprecedented opportunity , one that seldom arises in history , to try a radically different political system that does work , that genuinely ensures human beings ’ natural rights and individual liberty .
That system is known as " market anarchism " or " anarcho - capitalism . "
Ironically , if China were to move boldly forward and adopt such a system , it would actually be returning to its historical roots , to the great Daoist philosopher Laozi ’s " wu wei er zi " ( govern by doing nothing ) .
For an introduction to " anarcho - capitalism , see : Anarcho - capitalism , from Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia .

Do n't blame developing economies for oil hikes
( Xinhua / China Daily )
Updated : 2008-06-09 09:32
The fluctuation of crude oil prices is closely related to the global financial market and the surge in oil prices should not only be ascribed to the rising energy demands of rapidly developing economies , a Chinese energy official has said .
A huge amount of oil trade is conducted in the financial market and oil prices are no longer up to the traditional marginal utility but have become a financial concept under the influence of many factors , said Zhang Guobao , vice - minister of the country 's National Development and Reform Commission .
Zhang dismissed the idea that rising demands in developing countries such as China and India should be blamed for the surge of oil prices .
" This is an incomprehensive idea , because decisive factors for oil prices have run beyond the concept of supply and demand , " Zhang said on Saturday in a speech at the energy ministers ' meeting between India , China , the United States , Japan and South Korea .
He suggested that his counterparts put rising oil prices into the context of the global financial market , which could be affected by a wide range of factors such as the exchange rate fluctuations , geopolitics , political instabilities and natural disasters .
" All these may turn to be reasons for speculation ... and from this way of thinking , an answer to the current record - high oil price could be found , " Zhang said .
Zhang and his counterparts agreed on Saturday to adopt comprehensive measures to deal with the current rocketing crude oil prices .
The measures include improving the investment environment , strengthening energy saving , expanding oil stockpiles for emergency use and developing alternative energy forms , according to a press conference following their one - day meeting .
In a speech in an afternoon session on energy security , Zhang said that to safeguard the global oil market and resolve the issue of surging and fluctuating oil prices , major countries have to boost investment in oil exploitation , preserve global political stability and minimize geopolitical impacts on oil markets .
At the joint press conference , Japanese Economy , Trade and Industry Minister Akira Amari said the current " abnormally high " oil price damages the interests of both the producing and the consuming nations .
US Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said the rise in the crude oil price , which doubled in the past 18 months , was an accumulated consequence , since the international community had not paid enough attention to the market in the past 30 years .
International Energy Agency Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka , who was invited to attend the meeting , stressed the need to keep transparent the oil market , calling for more reliable data and information for the construction of a healthier and better - balanced market .
The five - party energy ministers meeting , initiated by China , was the second of its kind following the first one in Beijing in December 2006 .
The governor of Afghanistan 's Kandahar province says Afghan and NATO - led forces have killed or wounded " hundreds " of insurgents on the outskirts of Kandahar city .
" The Taliban have been cleared totally from Arghandab district , " governor Assadullah Khalid told a news conference .
" They have suffered hundreds of dead and wounded and many of their casualties are Pakistanis . "
He says troops are now searching the area for militants who could be hiding in villagers ' houses .
Earlier on Thursday , NATO and Afghan forces attacked Taliban militants dug in around the district of orchards and farms on the city outskirts for the second day , in one of the biggest battles in Afghanistan in recent years .
The offensive , which NATO said it expected to last until the weekend , is aimed at an estimated 600 Taliban fighters at the Arghandab valley , north - west of Kandahar .
It comes days after the Taliban freed hundreds of their comrades from the main jail in Kandahar city .
NATO had earlier downplayed the number of militants in the area .
" So far our assessment is that if the insurgents are there they have not the numbers and the foothold that they previously claimed and , obviously , they did choose not to fight , " ISAF spokesman General Carlos Branco said .
General Branco says NATO forces used air power only against " positively identified groups of insurgents that targeted one helicopter , which acted in self defence " .
He says only one civilian was killed in the fighting , according to their information , while a second Afghan civilian , two Afghan soldiers , three ISAF civilian workers and NATO television cameraman Jamie Kidston , from New South Wales , had all been wounded .
The forces will " continue to progress steadily , avoiding civilian casualties and potential IED 's left behind , and we do not expect any dramatic changes in the behaviour of the insurgents , " General Branco said .

The surroundings were grim and forbidding , a notorious jail run by Afghanistan 's feared security service for those taken prisoner in the bloody war with the Taliban .
Among the inmates : Shakirullah Yasin Ali ; a small , frail boy , just 14 years old , arrested as he prepared to carry out a suicide bombing against British and American targets .
" If I had succeeded , I would be dead now , I realise that , " he said in a soft , nervous voice .
" But those who were instructing me said that if I believed in serving God it was my duty to fight against the foreigners .
They said God would protect me when the time came . "

It was a suicide bomber like Shakirullah who , on Sunday , claimed the lives of three more British soldiers in Helmand , bringing the total number of UK fatalities in Afghanistan to 100 .
The Independent spoke to Shakirullah , a Pakistani Pashtun , one of the youngest ever suicide bombing suspects , after he was captured in a raid at the town of Khost in Afghanistan .
Sitting cross-legged on the floor of the prison run by Afghan intelligence , the NDS , Shakirullah said : " I do not know what is going to happen to me .
All we were told was the British and the Americans were in Afghanistan and they were killing Muslims .
" All I know is what the mullahs told me and kept telling me , that the British and the Americans were against God , " he said with his head bowed down , his hands twisting a handkerchief .
Shakirullah , one of four children of Noor Ali Khan , a farmer , lived at the village of Tandola in the Pakistani region of South Waziristan .
He said his education was at a madrassa run by two imams , Mullah Saleb and Mullah Azizullah .
About 50 students between 13 and 22 attended the school , where the syllabus consisted of learning the Koran by heart , interspersed with political lectures .
About two months ago , he finished a first course in Koranic studies .
He was then approached by the two mullahs who told him that the time had come for him to serve God in Afghanistan .
" At first , I did not know what I was supposed to be doing , then Mullah Saleb said I would be striking a blow against the foreigners , the British and the Americans , and get justice for all the people being killed .
I was told I must leave at once and they would talk to my family on my behalf .
I wanted to see my mother and father but I was told that was not possible for security reasons .
That upset me but I thought I will be seeing them again as soon as I got back .
They said my family would get well paid for what I was doing . "

On the way to Afghanistan Shakirullah said he was told by a mullah that his mission would involve driving a car bomb .
" I said I did not know how to drive but they said they would teach me , they said I would not have to drive far .
Mullah Saleb said it was too late to stop .
He kept saying that to be a good Muslim I must fulfil my duty .
I was missing my family but I did not know how to go back to my village and I did not know anyone in the area I could run to .
There was nothing I could do except pray I would be all right and my family would be all right . "
Shakirullah says he was driven across the border and taken to a house in the city of Khost .
" There were a few more people there and the leader was a man they called the Doctor , he and Mullah Saleb took me for driving lessons and took me to sermons in the evening .
The Doctor brought the explosives in two bags for the car and he was the one who made the bomb .
I was told I would soon be ready to carry out my mission . "
However , the car being prepared for the bombing , a Toyota Corolla , had stalled a few times while Shakirullah was being taught to drive and , on one occasion , he and the Doctor had been closely questioned by the police .
Forty - eight hours later , the house where they were staying was raided by Afghan and Nato forces .
" I had been told by the mullah that I was ready to go , the time was right .
But then they came during the night , the soldiers , and smashed down the doors .
There were Afghans and foreigners .
A gun was stuck to my face and I thought I was going to be killed .
They dragged us all out and took us to a prison . "
Shakirullah 's attack may have been prevented but not that of the bomber who took the lives of Privates Nathan Cuthbertson , 19 , Charles David Murray , 19 , and Daniel Gamble , 22 .
They had been going to speak to local people when a bomber detonated an explosive vest strapped to his chest .
Last night , their families paid tribute to their loved ones .
Pte Murray 's family said : " David was the best son , brother , grandson , nephew , cousin and friend any of us could hope for .
Although his time with us was short , he lived every second to the full and taught us the meaning of life . "
The parents of Pte Gamble said : " Dan died doing the job he was so proud to do , with the regiment he was proud to be part of .
He was special because he had trained in the Afghan Pashtu language .
He was special to his family and friends – a true hero in every sense . "
Pte Cuthbertson 's company commander , Major Russell Lewis , said he was " a talented , motivated individual .
He always had a smile on his face and relished the challenges faced by the professional soldier . "
British victims of the latest suicide attack
Private Daniel Gamble
Daniel Gamble , 22 , from Uckfield , East Sussex , joined 2nd Battalion , the Parachute Regiment in 2006 and became his platoon 's linguist , working to understand Afghan culture and society .
His parents said he was proud of his job and regiment .
Private Charles Murray
Born in Dumfries and brought up in Carlisle , Charles David Murray followed a family tradition when he joined up .
His father , grandfather and uncle were all in the forces .
Pte Murray , 19 , known as David , was serving as a rifleman .
Private Nathan Cuthbertson
The 19 - year - old from Sunderland had been fast - tracked through the army since joining aged 16 , and within a year of joining 2nd Battalion , the Parachute Regiment , he had passed the infantryassault engineers course , usually reserved for more experienced soldiers .
He was his platoon 's machine gunner .
Traffic analysis works even through the encryption :
The new compression technique , called variable bitrate compression produces different size packets of data for different sounds .
That happens because the sampling rate is kept high for long complex sounds like “ ow ” , but cut down for simple consonants like “ c ” .
This variable method saves on bandwidth , while maintaining sound quality .
VoIP streams are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping .
However , a team from John Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , US , has shown that simply measuring the size of packets without decoding them can identify whole words and phrases with a high rate of accuracy .
Lockheed Martin has tested a prototype reusable launch system by flying a sub - scale flight demonstrator from the site of New Mexico 's proposed Spaceport America .
The successful test flight of the proprietary vehicle took place in December and was only recently disclosed .
A company official said Lockheed Martin is planning more tests using ever - larger vehicles .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems teamed with launch provider UP Aerospace of Highlands Ranch , Colo. , Dec. 19 to conduct a small demonstration launch at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico to evaluate proprietary technology the company currently has under development .
Test a little , fly a little
The winged craft soared skyward from a launch rail to an altitude of roughly 3,001 feet ( 915 meters ) and was recovered shortly after the test flight , said Al Simpson , acting director , Advanced Programs , Human Space Flight for Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. near Denver .
Simpson told SPACE.com in an April 17 telephone interview that the company is spending internal research and development money on the project to develop rapid , responsive , call - up to launch attributes — and at lower cost .
" This is a test a little , fly a little " effort , Simpson said .
" You grow and build up over time .
That way you are buying down risk incrementally — not trying to leap into what I call the big system development right off the bat , " he said .
The self - propelled vehicle flown in December is based on some five years of internal research and development , incubated in a mini- Skunk Works - like environment , Simpson said , referring to the company 's legendary facility in California that is famous for turning out high - tech vehicles in relative secrecy .
" The key here is let 's actually prove it [ rapid , responsive , and lower - cost launch ] — that there is a path here as opposed to making statements in Powerpoint , " he added .
Small checkout and launch crew
While the project has a name , Simpson said the name is under wraps for now .
In addition , the craft 's propulsion system is not being revealed at this time , he said .
The vehicle flown in December is 8 feet ( 2.4 meters ) long with a wingspan of about 6 feet ( 1.8 meters ) , Simpson said .
Processing and checking out the vehicle followed by liftoff was completed in a three - day period , utilizing a small checkout and launch crew , he noted .
" We are planning on additional testing down at Spaceport America this year — as we flush out and explore elements of the technology that we are trying to develop , " Simpson said , citing examples such as avionics and guidance technology .
The approximately one - fifth scale vehicle will be reflown this year , he said , working up to a larger - sized vehicle to be first launched next year .
A development roadmap for the autonomously controlled , pilotless space plane is spread out over a three - to four - year period , Simpson said , leading to the fielding of a larger - scale system , one that lowers the price tag of lofting satellites into Earth orbit .
" The secret test flight last December was a Lockheed Martin research vehicle that UP Aerospace launched using our ground operations equipment , launcher and three man launch crew , " said Jerry Larson , president of UP Aerospace Inc .
" Telemetry systems tracked the vehicle through the entire flight and we recovered and returned the vehicle to Lockheed Martin in just a few hours — a very happy customer , " Larson told SPACE.com in an April 16 e-mail .
Lockheed Martin has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the New Mexico Spaceport Authority ( NMSA ) to conduct future testing at Spaceport America , according to an April 15 NMSA press statement .
Completion of Spaceport America — which New Mexico officials proudly call the first spaceport built to handle commercial space operations — currently is planned for some time in 2010 .
Having the relationship with Lockheed Martin validates the concept behind commercial space activity , " and proves that Spaceport America can deliver on the promise of lower cost , quicker turnaround launch activity , " NMSA Executive Director Steve Landeene said in the April 15 press statement .
According to Landeene , spaceport planning and design work is nearly complete , and the first bid package for construction work is being prepared for release .
Construction on the spaceport , he said , can begin once the NMSA receives their site operator 's license from the Federal Aviation Administration .
Lockheed Martin launch activity will continue in 2008 under the amateur class prior to the Federal Aviation Administration vertical launch site license expected in 2009 , NMSA noted in its press statement .
Lockheed Martin's Simpson said using Spaceport America is ideal for conducting flight activities , proving to be convenient , easy and simple .
" You need something lean and mean — and that 's what they offered , " Simpson added .
Top Michigan Democrats yesterday rebelled against a plan to seat just half of the state ’s delegates , demanding that the national party seat them all – and give a majority to Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The plea to the Democratic National Committee ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee from four prominent pols , including uncommitted Sen.
Carl Levin , comes amid controversy over how to represent Michigan and Florida at the August convention .
The 30 - member rules panel meets tomorrow to decide what to do about the two states , which were stripped of their delegates for moving up their primaries on the calendar against DNC rules .
Party lawyers , in a 38 - page memo to the committee , said it “ legally ” ca n’t restore more than half of the stripped delegates because that ’s an automatic punishment for the calendar violation .
The Michigan Democrats said the rules committee ought to stick to a compromise measure .
Under that plan , Clinton would have 69 pledged delegates and Obama 59 .
But another Michigan DNC member , Clinton backer Joel Ferguson , broke with state leaders and said that plan is “ fatally flawed . ”
Meanwhile , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he expects the nomination to be settled shortly after voting ends next Tuesday and Obama will probably have enough delegates .
He said he , DNC chairman Howard Dean and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to avoid a convention fight and are pushing superdelegates to pick sides now .

Stoner Chic Traces Origin To San Rafael / Snickering high schoolers brought ` 420 ' into lexicon
2000-04-20 04:00:00 PDT
Regional -- Today is April 20 , and the significance of the date could be religious or infamous , depending on whom you ask .
But for many who describe themselves as members of the counterculture , April 20 -- or 4/20 -- is a day to celebrate the pleasures of altered consciousness , loosen the bonds of convention and , in short , slack off and smoke a lot of pot .
This afternoon , as the clock strikes 4:20 p.m. , thousands of people across the United States will be gathered on college campuses , in city parks , private homes and on mountain tops to observe what some refer to as " the stoner 's New Year , " or " Miller Time for hippies . "
In San Francisco , the Fourth Annual 420 Hemp
Fest will kick off at 4 p.m. at Maritime Hall , and in Marin County , revelers plan to gather atop Mount Tamalpais for a ritual smoke - out .
In Ann Arbor , students at the University of Michigan will have their annual Hash Bash , and in Washington , D.C. , legalization activists will kick off a fund - raiser for their yearly Fourth of July smoke - in in front of the White House .
If you 've never heard the term 420 ( that 's " four - twenty , " not " four hundred and twenty " ) used in quite this way , you 're not hip -- but you 're not alone .
The term has eluded the understanding of those in the straight - and - narrow world for nearly 30 years .
And if you do know what 420 refers to , odds are that you have no idea where the term came from .
Ever since 420 became an insider 's catchphrase in the 1970s , theories as to its origin have multiplied like Starbucks outlets , raising it to the level of urban myth .
" It has become a giant urban myth and it's a lot of fun , " said attorney Keith Stroup , executive director of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws , or NORML .
" Folks who smoke have a lot of fun with this code word , and the rest of the country does n't know what the hell we 're talking about . "
Devotees will insist that 420 is the penal code section for marijuana use , or the police radio code for marijuana smoking in progress , or the number of chemical compounds in marijuana , or that April 20 is the date that Jim Morrison died .
Unless it was Jimi Hendrix , or was that Janis Joplin ?
All these theories , and dozens more , are wrong , wrong , wrong .
For the record , 420 of the California penal code refers to obstructing entry on public land .
The number is not a police radio code , and the number of chemical compounds in marijuana is 315 , according to the folks at High Times magazine , who should know .
Morrison died on July 3 , Hendrix on September 18 , and Joplin on October 4 .
According to Steven Hager , editor of High Times , the term 420 originated at San Rafael High School , in 1971 , among a group of about a dozen pot-smoking wiseacres who called themselves the Waldos .
The term 420 was shorthand for the time of day the group would meet , at the campus statue of Louis Pasteur , to smoke pot .
" Waldo Steve , " a member of the group who now owns a business in San Francisco , says the Waldos would salute each other in the school hallway and say " 420 Louis ! "
The term was one of many invented by the group , but it was the one that caught on .
" It was just a joke , but it came to mean all kinds of things , like ' Do you have any ? ' or ' Do I look stoned ? ' " he said .
" Parents and teachers would n't know what we were talking about . "
The term took root , and flourished , and spread beyond San Rafael with the assistance of the Grateful Dead and their dedicated cohort of pot-smoking fans .
The Waldos decided to assert their claim to the history of the term after decades of watching it spread , mutate and be appropriated by commercial interests .
The Waldos contacted Hager , and presented him with evidence of 420's history , primarily a collection of postmarked letters from the early ' 70s with lots of mention of 420 .
They also started a Web site , waldo420.com .
" We have proof , we were the first , " Waldo Steve said .
" I mean , it 's not like we wrote a book or invented anything .
We just came up with a phrase .
But it 's kind of an honor that this emanated from San Rafael . "
What is it with hardline Zionism and its wish to bomb other countries ?
First Iraq , now discussion about Iran , the Jewish establishment ’s embrace of the “ war on terror ” rhetoric highlights a fundamentally anti-democratic , draconian , insecure and racist mindset ( not least because most of the victims of a government ’s over - zealous plans are directed against Muslims . )
And now in Britain :
Three members of a Jewish human - rights organisation have accused the Board of Deputies of misusing its claim to speak for the Jewish community .
Richard Kuper , newly elected chair of Jews for Justice for Palestinians , and two colleagues , Professor Irene Bruegel and Murray Glickman , have complained about a submission to the Home Office last August by the Board and the Community Security Trust on the Counter Terrorism Bill 2007 .
In it , the Board said it agreed with the then head of Scotland Yard ’s anti-terrorist branch , Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , that terror suspects should be detained for up to 56 days before being charged .
Currently it is 28 days .
In a letter to the JC , they questioned why the Board was discussing the subject and complained that in saying it spoke for the Jewish community , it ignored “ very real divisions ”  in it .
Until mainstream Judaism wrestles control of the community away from individuals and groups that do not represent its interests ( and consistent polls show this ) , they should expect to be blamed for disastrous policies hatched in Washington or London .
An artist featured in a new campaign pushed by the Australian music industry to discourage illegal file sharing and change the public 's perception that musicians live like royalty says he was duped into joining an anti-piracy " witch hunt " .
Frenzal Rhomb guitarist Lindsay McDougall , also a radio presenter at Triple J , told the Herald he was furious at being " lumped in with this witch hunt " and that he had been " completely taken out of context and defamed " by the Australian music industry , which funded the video .
He said he was told the 10 - minute film , which is being distributed for free to all high schools in Australia , was about trying to survive as an Australian musician and no one mentioned the video would be used as part of an anti-piracy campaign .
If you ’re following America ’s electoral theater at all , you know that we have a candidate with a preacher problem .
And that the candidate in question has been put in the uncomfortable position of having to repudiate some of said preacher ’s remarks ( while not alienating those voters in the flock who actually , you know , agree with what the Reverend was saying ) .
In case you have n’t been paying attention , the controversial cleric has pronounced God ’s doom upon certain of the nation ’s citizens , and the backlash against him and his favorite for the White House has significantly damaged the candidate ’s chances .
Of course , I ’m talking about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama .
Errr , wait … that ’s not right .
That ’s not who I ’m talking about at all .
No , I ’m talking about the Rev. John Hagee and His Maverickness , John Dubya McCain .
You might recall ( or you might not , since the Fourth Estate has devoted so few column inches to the story ) that Preacher Hagee , a many - jowled man who does little to explode cheap stereotypes about fundamentalist Texans and whose public pronouncements are a living indictment against every academic institution he ever attended , decreed that Hurricane Katrina was a divine smiting against the city of Sodom New Orleans because it was planning to allow a public parade by a bunch of queers .
To be sure , Preacher Hagee believes a great many interesting things ( I mean , come on , he called the Catholic Church â€œâ€ ˜The Great Whore , â€™ an â€˜apostate church , â€™ the â€˜anti- Christ , â€™ and a â€˜false cult systemâ€™â€ ) so in context his New Orleans theory is actually fairly tame .
Besides , he ’s been called to account for the outrage , with the nation ’s top journalistic watchdogs walloping him no less than 8 % as often as it has the Rev. Wright .
A Media Matters for America Nexis search * found that since February 27 , the date that televangelist John Hagee endorsed Sen .
John McCain for president , The New York Times and The Washington Post combined have published more than 12 times as many articles mentioning Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. and Sen. Barack Obama as they have mentioning Hagee and McCain .
The Post published 53 articles during that period that mentioned Wright and Obama , compared with three articles mentioning Hagee and McCain .
The Times published 46 articles since February 27 mentioning Wright and Obama , compared with five articles mentioning Hagee and McCain .
Additionally , during the same period , the Post published 40 editorials or opinion pieces that included Wright and Obama while publishing two editorials or opinion pieces that mentioned McCain and Hagee .
The Times published 22 editorials or opinion pieces that included Wright and Obama , compared with two editorials or opinion pieces that mentioned McCain and Hagee .
Now that ’s fair and balanced !
Still , none of this matters because McCain is having nothing to do with Hagee .
Ummm , hold on .
No , no … that ’s not right , either .
McCain said he was right honored to have the good Reverend ’s endorsement .
Of course , he ’s repudiated Hagee ’s New Orleans remarks .
But he ’s still glad to have the endorsement .
I know what you ’re probably thinking : here comes a “ flip - flopper ” crack .
Nope .
Flip - flopping is when you say / do one thing and them come back later and say / do the opposite .
It hardly counts as flip - flopping when you ’re saying / doing both things at the same time ( and please watch the video ) .
No , that ’s some other kind of advanced forked - tonguery that the noise machines have n’t coined a catchy name for yet ( although “ Double - Talk Express ” does have a certain ring to it ) .
In the meantime , let ’s just call it “ lying . ”
Never mind having his cake and eating it , too – he ’s having my cake and eating it , too .
In any case , at least Hagee has calmed his ass down lately .
What ?
I ’m sorry , hold on a sec …. he said what ?
You have got to be kidding me .
In a sermon given at his San Antonio , Texas Cornerstone megachurch that was telecast and available in up to ninety million homes worldwide , controversial pastor John Hagee , who has endorsed the presidential bid of Arizona Republican Senator John McCain , Jr. , claimed that American public schools provide abortion services .
Hagee stated , “ Your daughter can get an abortion in public school without telling you but she ca n’t get an aspirin without your approval . ”
The pastor also claimed that public school teachers can force their students to study a “ precursor to witchcraft ” and suggests that America has invited “ satan ” and demonic spirits into its public school systems by failing to display the Ten Commandments on classroom walls .
Well , surely the press is going to be all over this one .
Right ?
One of Ronald Reagan ’s nicknames was “ the Teflon President , ” because no matter what he said or did , and no matter how many cookie jars his people got caught looting , nothing ever stuck .
Are we now seeing the ascendance of The Calphalon Candidate ?
McCain flips and flops like a live trout on a hot griddle .
He ’s got a temper like an adolescent with roid rage .
He called his wife – in public , with witnesses ( and brace yourself for some intemperate language , if you would ) – a “ cunt . ”
Since no reporters are willing to ask about this bit of immoderacy , an attendee at an Iowa Town Hall event did .
No normal rabble rouser was the questioner , by the way .
He was a Baptist minister .
And he got tossed from the event for having the temerity to utter such blasphemy in the presence of , you know , adult voters .
I ’m not sure what to say here that is n’t obvious .
Maverick is clearly less the straight shooter than he wants us to believe and the nation ’s press has no interest in holding him to the same standards it holds his opponents to .
Welcome to The McCain Standard .
Had he and Hagee been subjected to the same scrutiny that Obama and Wright have endured how very interesting these past few weeks would have been .
I ’ve been resisting the urge to question why white Christianity is getting a pass while black Christianity gets pummeled .
Why white whack - jobs of the first order can say any goddamned crazy shit that pops into their heads while distinguished military veterans with – and let ’s be honest here – fairly legitimate questions about the plight of blacks in America get demonized like they thought up 9/11 all by themselves .
Of course , now I ’ve gone and done it , I guess , but explain to me , if you will , how I ’m being any less fair to the American press than they ’re being to America .
I have no illusions that our nations reporters , editors and obscenely rich ( and occasionally Australian ) media moguls are going to act in the best interest of the country .
Right now I guess I ’d count it as a victory if they ’d just pretend a little harder .
The number of large babies weighing 10 lb or more at birth has jumped by a fifth .
What is behind this boom in hefty newborns ?
And how has it changed pregnancy and labour ?
Viv Groskop talks to mothers , doctors and midwives
Sarah Ockwell - Smith , 32 , a hypnobirthing teacher from Saffron Walden , Essex , knows all about larger babies .
At 5ft 1in , with a 6ft husband - Ian , 38 , a locksmith - she has given birth to four .
Sebastian , five , was 10 lb ( 4.53 kg ) at birth .
Flynn , four , was 9lb 12oz .
Then they got even bigger .
Rafferty , now three , was 11lb 3 oz and Violet , one , was 11lb .
" When I was pregnant with my first baby I remember a few of the babies from my antenatal class were around 9lb .
I freaked out and said to my midwife , ' My baby is not going to be that big , is it ? '
She laughed and said no , he would be about 8 lb . "
But she actually thinks it is easier to give birth to a heavier baby .
" My two biggest ones were by far the easiest : water births at home with no intervention .
I would be more concerned about having a seven - pounder .
With bigger babies , you have gravity on your side .
And when they 're born , it 's nice to have big , chunky babies .
You 're not so worried about moving them and holding them . "
The average birth weight of babies has been creeping up for the past 30 years .
It is now around 7lb 8 oz for boys , up 2 oz from 1970 , and 7lb 4 oz for girls , an increase of 1.5 oz , but the rise in babies with macrosomia ( excessive birth weight ) is more pronounced .
According to figures from the Office of National Statistics , the number of babies more than 9lb 15 oz increased by 20 % in the decade up to 2003 .
Definitions differ as to what constitutes a large baby .
The previous threshold was 8 lb 8 oz .
Now most health professionals class any baby more than 9lb 15 oz as above average .
Although larger babies do seem to be increasingly common , the heftiest are still rare enough to make the news .
In May 2006 a 12lb 13 oz baby was born in Aberdeenshire .
Then , two months later the television presenter Kirstie Allsopp gave birth to her first child , Bay , at the St John & Elizabeth Hospital in north London .
At 11 lb 11oz , he was the heaviest baby ever born there .
Big babies used to be more common when people had larger families , simply because weight tends to increase with each subsequent baby .
In January 2005 in Brazil , Francisca Ramos dos Santos gave birth to an 18lb " giant baby " .
He was her fifth child .
Last year in Siberia , Tatyana Barabanov had a girl who weighed 17lb 5 oz .
She was a 12th child .
According to the Guinness Book of Records the largest baby ever was born in Canada in 1879 , weighing 23lb , but died 11 hours after birth .
The heaviest surviving baby was born in Italy in 1955 and weighed 22lb 8 oz .
A 21lb baby was born in Cornwall in 1852 and a boy weighing 20lb 2 oz was born in Crewe , Cheshire in 1894 .
Society at large continues to find " sumo babies " hilarious .
They are always an object of fascination .
" I would get old ladies coming up to me in the street and saying to each other , ' Oh my God , have you seen this one , Maureen ?
He was 10 lb 2 oz , ' " says Gina Robinson , 32 , a retail manager from Sheffield .
Her son Charlie is now seven months old .
" The midwife actually took him out of the room when he was born and I heard her say to the other midwives , ' Look at the size of this one . ' "
The mothers of larger babies are used to people wincing and saying " Ouch " when they tell them the baby 's birth weight .
" I really do n't understand why society is so terrified of big babies .
There is almost a freakshow aspect , " says Ockwell - Smith .
" But they do look slightly odd because they are so big .
My friend had a 5 lb baby at the same time as my 10 lb baby and it was really funny seeing them together .
Later , when the 5lb baby could sit up and move , mine was much bigger but could not move . "
My own two babies were small fry compared with the Bay Allsopps of this world ( 8lb 4 oz and 9lb ) but all the same I felt curiously protective towards them because of other people 's reactions .
People laughed at my son when he was tiny because he was such a " bruiser " ( code for " fat baby " ) .
His granny nicknamed him " Beefy " .
An oversensitive new mother , I felt these comments were a tacit judgment on me : I had made these babies fat .
Plus , I was slightly overweight during my pregnancies and I felt guilty about this .
There is a sense that it is not acceptable to call the mother fat - but people betray what they really think of you by labelling the baby .
As the midwife said to a colleague after weighing my 9lb baby : " By the size of the bump , I thought the baby was going to be massive .
But it turned out to be mostly mum . "
The reason babies are getting heavier is obvious , says Mervi Jokinen of the Royal College of Midwives : " It is mostly linked to better diet and living standards in the population .
But big babies have always existed and sometimes it 's very difficult to say if it 's genetic or if it 's diet . "
What is undeniable , however , is that obesity - of the mothers , not the babies - is a major factor .
And with rising obesity rates comes an increase in gestational diabetes , which - unless carefully monitored - can increase the baby 's weight .
This is a form of diabetes that occurs purely in pregnancy , usually diagnosed after 28 weeks .
After pregnancy , it disappears - although it is an indicator that the patient is more likely to develop diabetes later in life .
Last month the Lancet reported that diabetes worldwide is " spiralling upwards " and now affects up to 5 % of pregnancies .
The mothers of larger babies can at least draw some comfort from the idea that their baby 's weight may be genetic or a fluke - not their " fault " .
Reassuringly , Dr Philip Owen , consultant obstetrician at North Glasgow University NHS
Trust ( biggest baby ever delivered : 12lb 1 oz ) , says in some cases the mother 's diet has no bearing on the size of the baby .
" Obese mothers will have a higher incidence of larger babies .
But babies weighing more than 9lb 15 oz are not the preserve of overweight mothers - they 're also seen in ' normal ' mothers too . "
However , as veteran midwife Mary Cronk , who has birthed more than 1,600 babies during the past 40 years ( including one 12lb baby ) , puts it in her no-nonsense way : " We are getting chubbier women these days . "
She would not want women to fear having a larger baby , though : " I think people get their knickers in a twist about big babies .
If the labour progesses , then the baby will be born safely .
After all , you can get problems with six - pounders .
You need vigilance .
There could be an advantage in having a home birth for a large baby .
At least you have one - to - one care .
In hospital you might be left on your own or get a third of a midwife . "
A bigger baby , she adds , is not necessarily a healthier one : " They can be pretty puffy , and they can lose weight quickly . "
But the worry of having a large baby is becoming yet another stress factor in pregnancy .
" I actually felt a bit guilty and embarrassed about having such a large baby , " says Ruth Ainley , 34 , a physiotherapist from St Albans .
Her son James , now two , weighed 10lb 8 oz at birth .
When he was born by emergency C- section after a 28 - hour labour , the surgeon announced , " Well , this one would not have come out any other way . "
" I thought it was a reflection on how much weight I 'd gained and how much I 'd been eating .
I saw a consultant afterwards when I got pregnant the second time [ Jonny , now five months , was 8 lb 3 oz ] and he reassured me that it was perfectly normal .
" I did feel that everyone was going to think that I was a fat pig for producing such a fat baby .
And you think , ' Are people saying that if you had n't eaten so much in pregnancy , then he would n't be so big ? '
But I had n't eaten whatever I wanted - I was careful .
I had it in the back of my mind : I had better not eat too much , in the hope that it was n't going to be a giant child . "
But in fact the size of her baby is hardly surprising : her husband is 6ft 4in .
Weight problems can affect women 's choices in birth - to the extent that some severely overweight women find normal labour impossible .
The rise in obesity , with its attendant complications , is at odds with the NHS 's attempts to make " natural " birth and home birth more appealing .
Maternity units are even having to request specialist equipment to deal with their larger patients .
Last year in a University of Teesside study of 16 maternity units , hospital staff reported that they lacked larger delivery beds , sufficiently large blood pressure cuffs and longer needles for epidurals .
Obese fathers caused problems too : one midwife said that it was embarrassing when they could n't find large enough sterile " pyjamas " for men who wanted to accompany their wives into theatre .
Size remains a hugely contentious and emotional issue .
Who wants to be told they 're overweight when they 're pregnant and can't diet anyway ?
In any case , many pregnant women who have gestational diabetes or large babies - or both - are not obese .
And many obese women give birth to normal weight babies with no problems at all .
The two concerns with larger babies are cephalopelvic disproportion ( when the baby is too large to pass through the mother 's pelvis ) and shoulder dystocia ( when the head comes out but the shoulders get stuck ) .
But neither of these conditions is exclusive to larger babies : they can occur with small ones too .
If you are heavily pregnant with a very large baby , you can't win .
On the one hand you are not allowed an elective Caesarean ( because your birth could be " normal " ) .
But on the other you may be advised against a home birth ( because your birth could be " abnormal " ) .
Despite the increase in numbers of these babies , it makes sense to adopt a " wait - and - see " policy in labour , says Dr Owen : " We can't accurately predict a baby 's weight or the likely influence of the weight on the delivery .
If you overreact you end up doing an awful lot of C - sections .
And a planned C- section is safe but it is not risk - free . "
He says there is no denying that obesity is increasing in the general population - and in some cases this is affecting women 's experience of pregnancy and labour as well as the weight of the baby .
" Generally speaking , the bigger the baby , the longer the labour , " he says , " and the greater the likelihood that you will need assistance with forceps or ventouse , or a C - section . "
Although you can feel unusual for having a larger baby , you do n't get many concessions in hospital , says Hana Downing , 37 , a full - time mother of two from south - east London and pregnant with her third child who is due in July .
Her second baby , Sam , now almost two , was 10lb 9oz : " When I was pregnant with him I looked ridiculous .
Children were pointing at me in the street .
When he came out he looked like a three - month - old baby with a wig on . "
Her first baby , Mya , now three , was also big for her gestational age : she was born at 34 weeks and was already 6 lb 6 oz .
With her third baby , Downing has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes - which she suspects she must have had during her other two pregnancies too .
Despite this , she is expected - as are most women with larger babies - to go into labour naturally and " see what happens " .
This is usually hospital policy because it is so difficult to know the size of a baby before it comes out : palpation ( the midwife feeling the bump ) and ultrasound scans can be wrong by 10 % .
" I want an elective C- section because I do n't want to be rushed into theatre , " says Downing .
" But they 're saying that if we control the blood sugar [ she is currently taking insulin ] , then I may have a perfectly normal - sized baby .
I remain sceptical , having been through this twice . "
Other mothers have felt the opposite pressure .
Ockwell - Smith wanted to have her third child at home but was advised against it .
" My consultant wrote on my notes , ' Home birth not advised because of baby 's size . '
I was told I was selfish and that I was putting both of our lives at risk .
If I had not been so well - informed , I would have felt pressurised to do what they wanted . "
She had her baby safely and easily at home ( all 11 lb 3 oz of him ) .
" He took a long time to come out after his head was out .
I think in hospital I would have had an epidural and been flat on my back : he would have got stuck and been diagnosed as a shoulder dystocia .
At home I could move freely . "
There are other practical problems , says Celia Dunsire , a midwife at West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth , south - west London .
Larger women do not have the freedom of movement that an efficient delivery demands , she explains .
They can not get into a position that is safe for them and for the baby : " A squat position is ideal .
And because you 've got abdomen meeting thigh , you can't squat deep enough . "
There is something very sad about this : it means some women are having to have assisted labours or having emergency C- sections simply because they are too large to bend over in labour .
It is easy to laugh at extremely large pregnant and labouring women - as well as at their gigantic babies .
But in extreme cases the size factor can turn out to be a life - and - death issue .
Last year the report Saving Mothers ' Lives analysed the 295 deaths that occurred due to pregnancy or childbirth between 2003 and 2005 .
( To put this in perspective : the rate of deaths was 13.95 per 100,000 births . )
Half the women who died were overweight or obese and 15 % were extremely obese .
Six of the women had a body mass index of more than 45 , two of more than 60 .
( " Normal " BMI is 20 to 25 . )
The NHS is currently facing a string of lawsuits from 246 families whose children are suffering from Erb's Palsy , an injury that can occur when shoulder dystocia is mishandled .
Some - but not all - of these babies had excessive birth weight .
If the current trend towards obesity in mothers and babies with heavier birth weights continues , then maternity units need to be able to cope with a potential rise in these types of problems .
Despite the possible complications , many mothers still argue that bigger babies are better .
They report feeling more confident in looking after them , less concerned about their growth and relieved that they often sleep through the night at an earlier age .
A University College London study conducted over several decades found that babies weighing more than 8lb performed better in IQ tests throughout their lives .
There are a lot of benefits , says Robinson : " Charlie has always slept well and had good control of his neck from the start .
He never seemed like a tiny fragile baby and I was n't as scared to pick him up as I might have been if he were tinier . "
As Downing says : " Having had one child prematurely , it does make you feel confident when you have a baby who is big , bonny and healthy .
You do n't think , ' Oh my God , he 's a giant . '
He is still a newborn - just a big newborn " .
· This article was amended on Tuesday June 10 2008 .
We were wrong to say in the sub - heading to this article that the number of babies weighing 10 lb or more at birth had jumped by a fifth since 2003 .
As the article made clear , the figures related to the decade up to 2003 .
This has been corrected .
The problem with supernovae is that you never know where they ’re going to happen .
Your only clue is the bright flash in the sky , and then it ’s too late .
But a team of European researchers think they were lucky enough to have spotted the precursor to supernova .
In an article in the February 14th issue of the journal Nature , a team of European researchers describe how they were trying to find evidence of a binary system after one of the objects detonated as a supernova .
In looking back through archived images captured by NASA ’s Chandra X - Ray Observatory , they were lucky enough to find one image that actually contained the system .
The supernova , known as SN 2007on exploded as a Type Ia .
This is the situation where a white dwarf is in orbit around another star .
It ’s possible that the white dwarf feeds off material ejected from the other star until it hits a critical amount of mass – approximately 1.4 times the mass of our Sun .
Or maybe it ’s actually a collision between a white dwarf and another star , or between two white dwarfs .
Whatever the condition , the result is always the same .
The white dwarf detonates suddenly with a very specific amount of energy and characteristic light curve .
Astronomers use these explosions to measure distance in the Universe , since they ’re always exploding with the same amount of energy .
To really figure out what ’s going on , astronomers need more examples of these precursors .
They need to be able to study a potential Type Ia supernova before it actually explodes .
So , the researchers finally have a target they can study .
In the case of SN 2007on , the data gathered by the Chandra X - Ray Telescope strengthens the “ mass stealing ” theory .
X - rays streaming from the system show the kind of fusion you would expect from a white dwarf consuming material from a neighbour .
This is n’t a slam dunk , though .
A higher - quality optical image shows the binary system to be in a slightly different position from where the supernova detonated .
So maybe this system is n’t the precursor after all .
But followup observations from Chandra show that the X - ray source is gone .
Whatever was at that location is n’t there any more .
Perhaps it did indeed vaporize in a supernova explosion .

African penguins pass by a camera system on Robben Island , South Africa .

Ground - breaking technology that will enable biologists to identify and monitor large numbers of endangered animals , from butterflies to whales , without being captured , will be shown to the public for the first time at this year 's Royal Society Summer Science exhibition [ 30 June to 3 July ] .
Scientists at the University of Bristol , working on Robben Island in South Africa , have devised an intelligent , visual surveillance system that can be integrated into wildlife habitats as a non-intrusive means of capturing detailed and reliable data on the population dynamics and social behaviour of endangered species .
The research advances techniques that originated in computer vision and human biometrics in order to help field biology and to better understand and conserve endangered species , in particular , the African penguin ( Spheniscus demersus ) .
The project , called the ' Penguin Recognition Project ' , supported by the Earthwatch , the international environmental charity , and the Leverhulme Trust , has focused on the African penguin because their numbers have declined from more than a million at the start of the last century to fewer than 170,000 today .
The penguin population , on Robben Island , South Africa , is a population of nearly 20,000 and conventional tagging techniques can only monitor a few percent of the population .
The aim of the Penguin Recognition Project is to develop a system capable of doing automatic monitoring and which , more generally , could be the solution to a real - world problem facing many ecologists .
African penguins carry a pattern of black spots on their chests that does not change from season to season during their adult life .
As far as scientists can tell , no two penguins have exactly the same pattern .
The researchers have developed a real - time system that can locate African penguins whose chests are visible within video sequences or still images .
An extraction of the chest spot pattern allows the generation of a unique biometrical identifier for each penguin .
These biometric data can then be used to identify individual , African penguins from video or photographic images by comparison with a population database .
Dr Tilo Burghardt , RCUK Fellow in Exabyte Informatics in the Department of Computer Science at Bristol University , said : " We believe the new technology developed will enable biologists to identify and monitor large numbers of diverse species cheaply , quickly and automatically . "
Peter Barham , Professor of Physics at Bristol University and penguin fanatic , who originated the project added : " Once achieved , these systems will revolutionise the precision , quantity and quality of population data available to ecologists and conservationists .
There will also be an animal welfare benefit since there is no need to expose the animals to the stress of capture , or side - effects of being marked . "
Provided that a good image of a penguin can be extracted , the system can correctly identify the individual with around 98 per cent reliability .
The current limitation of the system , based on one camera , is that some passing penguins are hidden behind others , or the lighting is poor .
The researchers are currently working to overcome these limitations both by combining images from intelligent pan - tilt - zoom cameras , and by using infra-red imaging to provide data both day and night .
The basic image - recognition system has also been trialled with zebras , sharks and , in principle , can be extended to any species with complex surface patterns .

We , the American people , know that your motivation in taking the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney " off the table " is to ensure victory in the 2008 elections .
Further , we know that you hope that - by letting Bush and Cheney run amok between now and the swearing in of the new President - you hope to ensure that the Democrats win " for a generation " .
But please note that your game of " political cycles " cannot work if there is not a functioning country to run .
You have been trapped in a Washington bubble , and have badly misjudged what is really happening .
In fact , history will condemn you for destroying the United States of America .

Word on the street is that John McCain is meeting with potential running mates this coming weekend .
Among them : Mitt Romney … Governor Charlie Crist of Florida … and Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana .
I ’m worried .
Not because I think McCain will have a strong enough ticket to beat Barack Obama .
But because of that third option .
Of all the names being mentioned as McCain ’s potential running mate , Piyush “ Bobby ” Jindal , the 36 - year - old first - term governor of Louisiana , is not only the youngest and least experienced , but also the only one who is not white .
Yet in a year in which Democratic voters have raised few objections to such traditional “ obstacles , ” Jindal may be especially attractive as Republicans seek a way to offset the “ post- racial ” and youthful appeal of Senator Barack Obama .
Jindal , who was born in Baton Rouge to a family that had just arrived there from the Punjab area of India , took office in January after serving three years in the House of Representatives .
In a race with four candidates , Jindal , who was born a Hindu but converted to Roman Catholicism as a teenager , won 54 percent of the vote after campaigning as a social conservative …
Jindal is young .
He ’s relatively popular among Republicans .
And he ’s brown .
The New York Times ‘ William Kristol also thinks Jindal would be a solid Vice - Presidential pick .
I hope that does n’t happen .
For purely selfish reasons .
Do you have any idea how annoying it would be to deal with 293847293 Indian family members and friends talking about how wonderful it is that a desi has a legitimate shot of going to the White House ?
You can bet that many Indians will overlook his positions and just look at his skin color .
As one Indian website writes :
To see Jindal just a heartbeat away from the US Presidency should gladden our hearts .
If he makes it , it will be a jewel in the crown for Indian Americans .
His loyalty will be to his country of adoption , but it will be a dream come true for Indian Americans .
Not a dream .
* So * not a dream .
It ’s not a dream to have another Republican in power who ’s going to further ruin this country … and have it be the most famous Indian person in America .
While many Indians will be proud , I ’d have to argue how he ’s bad for our country every step of the way .
( The analogy is n’t quite the same , but I also would n’t want to be a black man telling other black people to vote against Barack Obama . )
Why am I not supporting Bobby Jindal as Vice - President ?
He voted against expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines .
He ’s completely anti-abortion , even in cases of rape or incest , getting a 100 % rating from the National Right to Life Committee .
He is completely opposed to gay rights , earning a 0 % rating from the Human Rights Campaign .
Church - state separation ?
Forget it .
Americans United for Separation of Church and State give him a 0 % rating .
He thinks “ intelligent design as an alternative to evolution may not be out of place in public schools , ” so we know his support of real science would be minimal .
Rush Limbaugh called him the “ next Ronald Reagan . ”
He once wrote about a friend who was possessed by the devil … meaning he believes someone could actually be possessed by a devil .
A little more on his Intelligent Design position .
In a gubernatorial debate that took place on September 27th of last year , this is what went down :
Baton Rouge Advocate columnist Carl Redman : “ What about intelligent design ?
And the issue really is , it ’s not what ’s on the books , but if this comes up again .
Because this state has wrestled with creationism and spent a lot of time and resources .
I was covering the legislature for a couple years when they wrestled with the abortion issue .
It could come back at any time .
What the governor does is very critical [ in those fields ? ] . ” Jindal [ nodding ] : “ Sure , and let ’s talk about intelligent design .
I ’m a biology major .
That ’s my degree .
The reality is there are a lot of things that we do n’t understand .
There ’s no theory in science that could explain how , contrary to the laws of entropy , you could create order out of chaos .
There ’s no scientific theory that explains how you can create organic life out of inorganic matter .
I think we owe it to our children to teach them the best possible modern scientific facts and theories .
Teach them what different theories are out there for the things that are n’t answerable by science , that are n’t answered by science .
Let them decide for themselves .
I do n’t think we should be scared to do that .
Personally , it certainly makes sense to me that when you look at creation , you would believe in a creator .
Let ’s not be afraid to teach our kids the very best science . ”
According to science advocate Barbara Forrest :
Jindal ’s remarks , which clearly signal his support for teaching ID , are a study in incoherence .
On one hand , this Rhodes scholar wants “ the very best science ” taught to children .
On the other , his assertion that children should be told “ what different theories are out there ” in order to explain what science cannot is an admission that ID is not science .
His inference of a creator from “ looking at creation , ” while legitimate as a personal religious belief , is at odds with his statement that “ our kids ” should be taught “ the very best science . ”
Putting the two together in a public school science class violates not only the standards of responsible science teaching but the U.S. Constitution as well .
It ’s easy to say I ’m dismissing him for simply being a conservative Republican , but it ’s more than that .
Despite his success in Louisiana politics , he ’s an embarrassment to many Indian people .
He does n’t share the values so many of the rest of us do .
The culture I grew up in encouraged a strong education — especially in the sciences .
He throws solid science out the window .
I was taught to respect all people and to stand up for their rights .
As a minority , you hope others will do the same for you .
Yet , he routinely advocates anti-gay , anti-woman policies in favor of socially conservative , irresponsible positions .
Of course , these values along with many others are n’t limited to just the Indian culture .
But how did it happen that the most prominent politician among us had to be the anomaly ?

5 Ferraris for the Tifosi
Featured , Supercars , Ferrari
on 06/08/2008
Filed under :on
06/08/2008
These days the number of Supercar manufacturers are on the rise .
They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes with endless number of turbochargers and superchargers .
Their displacements and power output figures are astonishing but we seem to have gotten used to it .
Around 5 years back , a car producing 800 hp would have left us with wide open jaws and disbelief , but these days entire cars are designed around such amounts of power and after - market tuners are talking of such power .
Supercars today generate ten times more power than an average family car with carbon - fiber and Aluminium as their key ingredients .
Without doubt , Italian supercar supremo Ferrari has always made Supercars that are special and unique .
With a strong racing background , Ferrari entered the world of production cars with the 125 .
And we will save the rest of the introduction for another day and get down talking about 5 Ferraris that define the brand and more than car , are a work of art .
5 which were the best among the lot in their era's .
5 which made use of all the advanced technology available in their days , and 5 which featured in more bedroom posters than Madonna !
Ferrari 250 GTO
Only 39 250's were ever built and is a car collector 's ultimate possession .
Engineered by specialist Giotto Bizzarrini who was also behind the fascinating Lamborghini V12 engine , Bizzarrini was not only responsible for the chassis , but also for the design , which otherwise would be Pininfarina 's task .
He took full responsibility for the car , meticulously sorting out the handling and the aerodynamics making use of Pisa University 's wind tunnel facilities .
The apertures and vents on the front are not for show .
They help in increasing air - velocity to the engine and aid cooling .
Even the cam covers were made of magnesium for the weight reduction purpose .
The 250's styling is talked about even today and so are its interiors .
The wooden steering wheel adds a touch of class , but arises curiosity as well !

Ferrari 250 GTO
This car was very very fast .
The 250 came in 3 - liter and 4 - liter variants , and had a top whack of 185 mph , speeds that were considered phenomenal in the 1950's .
The V12 3 - liter engine produced 295 bhp and was mounted up front .
The GT version of the car spent almost a decade on track dominating races and retired after Ferrari decided to focus on F1 .
Ferrari F50
349 of them were built , and the 349th was brought out on the day when Ferrari turned 50 .
The F50 came in versions with and without a roof with its body built entirely of carbon - fiber .
It was also used to make parts on the interior such as the seats and gear level knob , a clear indication of weight - savings given prime importance , more so when you consider the F50 's kerb weight of just 1,230 kg - A respectable statistic for a supercar .
Sporting stylish 18 - inch magnesium alloy wheels , the F50 was officially only available in five colours , Rosso Corsa , Rosso Barchetta , Giallo Fly , Nero and Argento although Ferrari satisfied clients who needed customization .

Ferrari F50
The car sat on the road with thicker rubber at the rear and thinner ones up - front .
Suspension was an electronic unit , which responded with regard to road conditions .
The mid-ship mounted 4.7 - liter V12 had enough grunt to take the F50 to 60 mph from a complete standstill in under 4 seconds and would run out of steam at a blistering 202 mph .
The F50 'S engine bares close resemblances to a Formula 1 engine .
A dry - sump lubrication unit , aluminium cam heads and titanium forged con-rods being its unique characteristics .
Ferrari F430
The Ferrari Modena 360 was replaced by this and no questions were ever raised on the replacement .
It 's not very hard to get the point behind the F430 .
It was always designed to give Ferrari enthusiasts a track experience on a road car .
The F430 shared design cues with the 360 but the changes stood out , courtesy of Frank Stephenson , who was in charge of Ferrari 's design department , worked in tandem with design expert Pininfarina to deliver a modern car with retro styling elements .
A fine example is the twin air intakes , which was inspired from the 1960's ' shark nose ' F1 cars .

Ferrari F430
The F1 connection does n't terminate cosmetically .
The E - diff ( Electronic differential ) found on the F430 was borrowed from Micheal Schumacher 's F1 car which helped it to shave off 3 seconds from its lap times around the Fiarano circuit compared to the outgoing 360 Modena .
The six - speed manual gearbox was from Ferrari's F1 car , controlled by paddles behind the steering wheel - just like how one would in a F1 car .
The mid-mounted V8 delivered 483 bhp to its rear wheels .
Suspension , both at the front and the rear , was a double wishbone aided with coil springs .
0 - 60 mph came in at roughly about 4 seconds and acceleration continued all the way up to a staggering 196 mph .
Interestingly , the engine is visible through a glass window fixed at the rear .
The F430 was n't better only in terms of acceleration and top speed , but was safer and a lot better in handling too .
It managed all of that weighing only a few kilograms more than the 360 .
The F430 will be the closest Ferrari has ever reached to a production model .
Even then , the keys belonged only to a fortunate few !
Ferrari Enzo
A car that rightly deserves to be featured in every piece of literature written on Supercars .
The Enzo takes the laws of physics and makes a mockery a out of it .
It is by far one of the best Supercars ever built and recently after the entry of the 1000 bhp Bugatti Veyron , experts and journalists still rate it as the best .
' Sport ' , ' Race ' and ' Super ' are the modes the gearbox can be slotted into .
The three words can also be used as adjectives to describe the car as a whole .
Only 399 were ever built making this one very exclusive as well .
This car shares a whole lot in common with a F1 car .
The strong yet light monocoque weighs a mere 92 kg and is made of aluminium and carbon fiber .
The 6.0 V12 all - aluminium engine mounted in the middle of the car develops no less than 660 bhp and 657 Nm of torque pushing the Enzo to 60 mph from a standstill in 3.2 seconds .

Ferrari Enzo
The Enzo 's engine is controlled by Bosch 's complex ECU , the ' Bosch Motronic ME7 ' .
The flappy paddles behind the steering give you complete control over the 6 - speed Semi-Automatic gearbox which can upshift and downshift in a mere 150 milliseconds .
Shift it into sport mode and it'll take a lot lesser - 90 milliseconds !
The Enzo is cushioned by an independent suspension setup both at the rear and the front .
Electronic dampers help in varying the stiffness of the ride .
Another highlight of this car is the advanced steering wheel .
Similar to the one found on F1 cars , the Enzo 's steering wheel has an array of LED 's indicating when to shift .
One can also choose the gearbox setup , switch on or off traction control and control the indicators .
Ferrari Daytona
The Daytona was the last of the V12 Daytona's .
When the prototype was unveiled at the 1968 Paris Salon , it was said to be the fastest car ever built up to that point of time .
There is an interesting tale behind its name .
The name Daytona was coined infact by journalists after Ferarri won the 24 hr Daytona race in 1967 .
As usual , Pininfarina showcased its capability and made this car look as stylish and modern as it can possibly can .
For aerodynamic benefit , the head lamps were placed behind clear plastic covers within the finely shaped nose of the car .
Click to enlarge
Ferrari Daytona
An all - alloy 4.4 liter , four cam V12 dubbed the ' Tipo 251 ' gave out an impressive 352 bhp which could do the 60 mph sprint in 5.4 seconds .
Similar to the Ferarri 250 , this car made use of weber carbs , and dry sump lubrication .
A convertible version was showcased at the 1969 Frankfurt Motor Show , and Ferrari went on to build 150 of them .
When the Daytona production stopped in 1973 , 1,350 numbers were manufactured altogether .
The mid-engined 356 GT4BB was the successor for the Daytona .

Taking an oath to become a sworn virgin should not , sociologists say , be equated with homosexuality , long taboo in rural Albania .
Nor do the women have sex - change operations .
Known in her household as the “ pasha , ” Ms. Keqi said she decided to become the man of the house at age 20 when her father was murdered .
Her four brothers opposed the Communist government of Enver Hoxha , the ruler for 40 years until his death in 1985 , and they were either imprisoned or killed .
Becoming a man , she said , was the only way to support her mother , her four sisters - in - law and their five children .
Ms. Keqi lorded over her large family in her modest house in Tirana , where her nieces served her brandy while she barked out orders .
She said living as a man had allowed her freedom denied other women .
She worked construction jobs and prayed at the mosque with men .
Even today , her nephews and nieces said , they would not dare marry without their “ uncle ’s ” permission .

When she stepped outside the village , she enjoyed being taken for a man .
“ I was totally free as a man because no one knew I was a woman , ” Ms. Keqi said .
“ I could go wherever I wanted to and no one would dare swear at me because I could beat them up .
I was only with men .
I do n’t know how to do women ’s talk .
I am never scared . ”
When she was recently hospitalized for surgery , the other woman in her room was horrified to be sharing close quarters with someone she assumed was male .
Being the man of the house also made her responsible for avenging her father ’s death , she said .
When her father ’s killer , by then 80 , was released from prison five years ago , Ms. Keqi said , her 15 - year - old nephew shot him dead .
Then the man ’s family took revenge and killed her nephew .
“ I always dreamed of avenging my father ’s death , ” she said .
“ Of course , I have regrets ; my nephew was killed .
But if you kill me , I have to kill you . ”

Alfvén Triumphs Again ( and Again )
May 09 , 2011
The lack of news reports in recent months has been due to a very heavy workload in preparing papers , a course and presentations .
This work continues with the upcoming Natural Philosophy Alliance 's 18th annual conference at the University of Maryland , July 6 - 9 , where I will give two papers including the invited John Chappell Memorial Lecture .

Meanwhile I attend scientific meetings and accumulate reports supporting the Electric Universe paradigm .
A science journalist dubbed me “ the boundary rider of science . ”
And it is from that broad perspective that I see our sciences like juggernauts speeding down their blind tunnels of specialization and one can only wait for the inevitable crash .
Modern science attempts to describe our reality using meaningless language ( e.g. " the fabric of space - time " ) and invalid metaphors with the result that ever more forces , unreal dimensions and invisible or virtual matter are invoked .
It seems to me that our salvation lies with engineers who must deal with the real world .
For it was an outstanding and outspoken electrical engineer and physicist , Hannes Alfvén , who gave us an electrical engineer 's practical explanation of many of the mysteries of the universe - known as plasma cosmology .
But in a classic academic ' Catch - 22 , ' because it 's not mainstream students are not given the opportunity to consider it at any university .
Alfvén emphasized the influence upon him of Kristian Birkeland 's earlier research into the electrical nature of the aurora and other phenomena in the solar system .
Birkeland seemed to intuitively sense the real electrical nature of space but was too far ahead of his time .
The theory of electric discharges was still in a very primitive state .
He wrote , “ It seems to be a natural consequence of our point of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying ions of all kinds .
We assume each stellar system in evolution throws off electric corpuscles into space .
It is not unreasonable therefore , to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found not in the solar systems or nebulae , but in ' empty ' space . ”
Birkeland met overwhelming resistance , particularly from Sydney Chapman who was perhaps the most influential scientist in the field of geophysics in the period 1920 - 1960 .
But in 1973 satellites confirmed the existence of electric currents aligned with the magnetic field .
These field - aligned currents are now called " Birkeland currents . "
In 1987 , reflecting his own struggle with orthodoxy , Alfvén wrote tartly , “ Since Chapman considered his theory of magnetic storms and aurora to be one of his most important achievements , he was anxious to suppress any knowledge of Birkeland 's theory .
Being a respected member of the proud English tradition in science , and attending - if not organizing - all important conferences in this field , it was easy for Chapman to do so .
The conferences soon became ritualized .
They were opened by Chapman presenting his theory of magnetic storms , followed by long lectures by his close associates who confirmed what he had said .
If finally there happened to be some time left for discussion , objections were either not answered or dismissed by a reference to an article by Chapman .
To mention Birkeland was like swearing in the church . ”
Many dissident scholars have echoed the comparison of modern institutionalized science with a religious order .
Alfvén 's plasma cosmology is an excellent theory when measured by its successful predictions .
Despite this , “ .. the continuing resistance to Alfvén 's work is based on a widely held opinion that his predictions are not derived from a plausible physical theory ( i.e. , a theory that conforms to the dominant paradigm ) .
If a theory is not acceptable , it does not gain credit by making successful predictions .
This would imply that the role of prediction as a means of evaluating scientific theories has been exaggerated . ” - Stephen G. Brush , Alfvén 's Programme in Solar System Physics , IEEE Transactions On Plasma Science , Vol. 20 , No. 6 , December 1992 , p. 577 .
Now two new reports stand out in relation to Alfvén 's predictions so that ultimately he cannot be ignored .
The first concerns the birth of stars and the second the electric circuit of the Sun. Electric Star Birth

The European Space Agency 's Herschel Space Observatory ( formerly called Far Infrared and Sub-millimetre Telescope or FIRST ) has the largest single mirror , at 3.5 - metres in diameter , ever built for a space telescope .
It is an infrared telescope , named after Sir William Herschel , the discoverer of the infrared spectrum .
The telescope has been giving astronomers an unprecedented look inside the cosmic womb of stars , known as molecular clouds , to find ( surprise , surprise ) that stars are formed in “ an incredible network of filamentary structures , and features indicating a chain of near - simultaneous star - formation events , glittering like strings of pearls deep in our Galaxy . ”
Although described as " incredible " by astronomers , this description precisely matches the decades - old expectations of plasma cosmologists !

“ An incredible network of filamentary structures ” seen in a cloud of cold gas in the constellation of the Southern Cross .
The “ That a dark , cool area such as this would be bustling with activity , was unexpected .
But the images reveal a surprising amount of turmoil : the interstellar material is condensing into continuous and interconnected filaments glowing from the light emitted by new - born stars at various stages of development . ”

The ESA report dated 2 October 2009 .

In an ESA report last month the high - resolution of the Herschel space observatory produced another surprise , “ The filaments are huge , stretching for tens of light years through space and Herschel has shown that newly - born stars are often found in the densest parts of them ...
Such filaments in interstellar clouds have been glimpsed before by other infrared satellites , but they have never been seen clearly enough to have their widths measured .
Now , Herschel has shown that , regardless of the length or density of a filament , the width is always roughly the same .
“ This is a very big surprise , ” says Doris Arzoumanian , Laboratoire AIM Paris - Saclay , CEA / IRFU , the lead author on the paper describing this work .
Together with Philippe André from the same institute and other colleagues , she analysed 90 filaments and found they were all about 0.3 light years across , or about 20,000 times the distance of Earth from the Sun .
This consistency of the widths demands an explanation . ”

So what is the favored conventional explanation ?
What else but " sonic booms " generated by " exploding stars ! "
But where are these exploding stars ?
And explosions should impose some degree of radial curvature on these filaments .
But what we see is more like the tortuous paths of cloud - to - cloud lightning bolts .
For that is what they are , in fact , on a cosmic scale .
The ' father ' of plasma cosmology , Hannes Alfvén , wrote in 1986 , “ That parallel currents attract each other was known already at the times of Ampere .
It is easy to understand that in a plasma , currents should have a tendency to collect to filaments .
In 1934 , it was explicitly stated by Bennett that this should lead to the formation of a pinch .
The problem which led him to the discovery was that the magnetic storm producing medium ( solar wind with present terminology ) was not flowing out uniformly from the Sun .
Hence , it was a problem in cosmic physics which led to the introduction of the pinch effect ...
However , to most astrophysicists it is an unknown phenomenon .
Indeed , important fields of research , e.g. , the treatment of the state in interstellar regions , including the formation of stars , are still based on a neglect of Bennett 's discovery more than half a century ago ... present - day students in astrophysics hear nothing about it . ”
[ Emphasis added ]
The constant width over vast distances is due to the current flowing along the Birkeland filaments , each filament constituting a part of a larger electric circuit .
And in a circuit the current must be the same in the whole filament although the current density can vary in the filament due to the electromagnetic pinch effect .
Therefore the electromagnetic scavenging effect on matter from the molecular cloud , called Marklund convection , is constant along each current filament , which simply explains the consistency of widths of the filaments .
The stars form as plasmoids in the Bennett - pinches , also known in plasma labs on Earth as Z - pinches .
>>
This diagram shows the true nature of the filaments inside the molecular cloud .
The electric field vector ( E ) and helical magnetic field configuration ( B ) are shown .
Inward Marklund convection of ions at velocity , V , across a temperature gradient , ∇T , is a mechanism for rapid filament formation and chemical separation in cosmic plasma so the heavy elements ( " metals " in astrophysics - speak ) are found on - axis and must therefore constitute the core matter of stars , not hydrogen !

In May last year in a similar star - forming cloud , Herschel uncovered an “ impossible star in the act of formation ...
This is because the fierce light emitted by such large stars should blast away their birth clouds before any more mass can accumulate .
But somehow they do form .
Many of these ' impossible ' stars are already known , some containing up to 150 solar masses , but now that Herschel has seen one near the beginning of its life , astronomers can use the data to investigate how it is defying their theories . ”
The answer is simple .
Astrophysicists ' theories bear no relation to reality .
The luminosity of a star is not related to its massiveness because no nuclear fusion is taking place in its heavy element core .
And the massiveness of a star is not related to its size because the photosphere is not a surface in the usual sense but rather an electric discharge phenomenon some distance above the surface of the star .
There are no " impossible stars . "
The light of a star comes from the available electrical energy coursing along the enveloping Birkeland filaments .
As for " sonic booms " caused by the pressure of light from the star , that force is negligible compared to the electromagnetic forces in the enveloping plasma .
And any such collision would serve to further ionise the dust and gas and make it more susceptible to the electromagnetic force .
However , if any reservation remains about the electrical environment of the Sun ( and therefore all stars ) then the following report should dispel that doubt .
Alfvén 's Solar Circuit Confirmed On May 3 , the New Scientist published an important article by Anil Ananthaswamy , " Strange cosmic ray hotspots stalk southern skies . "
Cosmic rays crashing into the Earth over the South Pole appear to be coming from particular locations , rather than being distributed uniformly across the sky .
Similar cosmic ray " hotspots " have been seen in the northern skies too , yet we know of no source close enough to produce this pattern .
“ We do n't know where they are coming from , ” says Stefan Westerhoff of the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Westerhoff and colleagues used the IceCube neutrino observatory at the South Pole to create the most comprehensive map to date of the arrival direction of cosmic rays in the southern skies .
>> IceCube uses neutrino detectors buried at the South Pole .
IceCube detects muons produced by neutrinos striking ice , but it also
detects muons created by cosmic rays hitting Earth 's atmosphere .
These cosmic ray muons can be used to figure out the direction
of the original cosmic ray particle .

[ Click to enlarge ] Between May 2009 and May 2010 , IceCube detected 32 billion cosmic - ray muons , with a median energy of about 20 teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) .
These muons revealed , with extremely high statistical significance , a southern sky with some regions of excess cosmic rays ( " hotspots " ) and others with a deficit of cosmic rays ( " cold " spots ) .
Over the past two years , a similar pattern has been seen over the northern skies by the Milagro observatory in Los Alamos , New Mexico , and the Tibet Air Shower array in Yangbajain .
“ It is interesting that the pattern can be matched between [ these experiments ] , at least qualitatively .
They have very different techniques and systematic effects , ” says cosmic - ray physicist Paul Sommers at Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
“ I regard those hotspots as a good mystery . ”
It 's a mystery because the hotspots must be produced within about 0.03 light years of Earth .
Further out , galactic magnetic fields should deflect the particles so much that the hotspots would be smeared out across the sky .
But no such sources are known to exist .
In the 1920s Irving Langmuir and Harold Mott - Smith showed that in a discharge tube the plasma sets up a thin boundary sheath which separates it from a wall or from a probe and shields it from the electric field .
The electric field in this sheath , or ' double layer ' of separated charge , accelerates charged particles .
In 1958 Alfvén suggested that this phenomenon might be important in space plasmas .
Sources of cosmic rays situated along the Sun 's axes were predicted by Alfvén in 1986 in an IEEE publication and NASA Conference Publication 2469 , " Double Layers in Astrophysics . "
[ Warning : 13 Mb pdf file ] .
He explains , “ Since the time of Langmuir , we know that a double layer is a plasma formation by which a plasma — in the physical meaning of this word — protects itself from the environment .
It is analogous to a cell wall by which a plasma - in the biological meaning of this word - protects itself from the environment .
If an electric discharge is produced between a cathode and an anode there is a double layer , called a cathode sheath , produced near the cathode that accelerates electrons which carry a current through the plasma .
A positive space charge separates the cathode sheath from the plasma .
Similarly , a double layer is set up near the anode , protecting the plasma from this electrode .
Again , a space charge constitutes the border between the double layer and the plasma .
All these double layers carry electric currents . ”
>> Alfvén 's Heliospheric Circuit .
The Sun acts as a unipolar inductor ( A ) producing a current which goes outward along both the axes ( B 2 ) and inward in the equatorial plane along the magnetic field lines ( B 1 ) .
The current must close at large distances ( B 3 ) , either as a homogeneous current layer , or — more likely — as a pinched current .
Analogous to the auroral circuit , there may be double layers ( DLs ) which should be located symmetrically on the Sun 's axes .
Such double layers have not yet been discovered .

In the circuit model , it was noted that every circuit that contains an inductance is intrinsically explosive .
This is true because a conductive circuit will tend to supply all of the inductive energy to any point of interruption of the circuit .
Double layers are known to tend to interrupt current in a plasma .
Hence , the entire energy of a circuit can be released at the point where a double layer forms regardless of the source of the energy of the circuit .
Because of their property of generating cosmic rays , synchrotron radiation , radio noise , and occasionally exploding , Alfvén proposed , “ DL 's may be considered as a new class of celestial objects ...
For example , the heliospheric current system must close at large distances , and it is possible - perhaps likely - that this is done by a network of filamentary currents .
Many such filaments may produce DL's , and some of these may explode . ”
To give an idea of their omnipresence in space , DLs are implicated in the earth 's auroral regions , extragalactic jets , stellar jets , novae and supernovae , X - ray and gamma- ray bursts , X - ray pulsars , double radio sources , solar flares , and the source of cosmic ray acceleration .
It seems that Alfvén 's DLs have been detected in the form of “ cosmic ray hotspots ” generated in Birkeland current filaments “ less than 0.03 light years ” from the Sun .
The hotspots should be found to align with the local interstellar magnetic field .
The median energy of the cosmic rays reported at 20 TeV is within the range expected from a cosmic DL .
POSTSCRIPT : Alfvén did n't go so far as to consider a star as an electrical discharge phenomenon .
But if stars are electrically powered from a galactic circuit then the consequences of this fact alone for science and society are profound .
We have been following a mirage of knowledge that leads into a desert of ignorance .
Our story of the Sun is a myth .
The holy grail of nuclear fusion energy " like the Sun " is a false trail .
In fact our entire cosmology of the big bang , galaxy formation , the formation of the Sun and its family of planets , and the history of the Earth is fiction .
It ignores the most powerful organizing electric force in favour of the feeblest force — gravity .
Most of our ' big ' science , like the costly fusion experiments and space missions , has been misdirected and wasteful .
All sciences must be re-examined from a fresh interdisciplinary perspective based on an interconnected Electric Universe .

And a final word from Alfvén , who took the unprecedented step of predicting in his December 11 , 1970 Nobel prize acceptance speech the eventual crash of astrophysics at the end of its long dark tunnel : “ In conclusion , it seems that astrophysics is too important to be left in the hands of theoretical astrophysicists who have gotten their education from the listed textbooks .
The multibillion dollar space data from astronomical telescopes should be treated by scientists who are familiar with laboratory and magnetospheric physics , circuit theory , and , of course , modern plasma physics .
More than 99 percent of the Universe consists of plasma , and the ratio between electromagnetic and gravitational forces is 1039 . ”

Exposure to air pollution increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis , the blood clots that commonly occur in the leg veins .
And the worse the air pollution , the higher the risk .
Researchers studied 871 D.V.T. patients in the Lombardy region of Italy , comparing them with 1,210 healthy people .
They tested levels of particulate air pollution  dust , soot and other tiny bits of matter suspended in the air  in areas where the patients lived , using monitors at 53 sites over a one - year period .
The study was published May 12 in The Archives of Internal Medicine .
After adjusting for various health factors , the researchers found that for each increase of 10 micrograms per cubic meter in particulate matter , the risk for D.V.T increased by 70 percent .
The effect of air pollution was smaller in women and not apparent at all in those using oral contraceptives or taking hormone therapy .
Oral contraceptives themselves increase the risk for blood clots , but air pollution had no added effect .
To Everyone wondering aloud just what the policies on this kind of thing are ( ie how they can be reported , how the team deal with them , etc ) , this might help :

You may know it as Google , but in bamboo - and - thatch roundhouses deep in the Amazon rainforest the iconic brand goes by another name .
The Surui people , one of the most remote on Earth , call it ragogmakan – " messenger " – and they 're banking on the search engine to save them and their ancestral lands from extinction .
The tribe – whose first contact with the modern world was less than 40 years ago – are replacing their bows and arrows with hi-tech gadgets in their battle for survival .
They have already begun using satnav on their traditional trails through the trees .
And Google Earth has just agreed to provide high - resolution satellite images of their forest home .
The initiative is the brainchild of their chief , Almir Narayamoga Surui , who is leading their struggle against illegal loggers besieging their territory , an isolated 600,000 - acre green oasis in Rondonia , in the wild Brazilian west .
Last year the 34 - year - old Almir visited Google near San Francisco to ask it to help monitor the loggers ' incursions .
He said he also hoped to be able to use the internet firm to " alert the world " .
He added : " We call Google ragogmakan because we hope it will help us get our message out . "

For countless centuries the nomadic people – who call themselves Paiter , meaning simply " we ourselves " – lived far from the outside world , until the official " first contact " with Brazilian authorities on 7 September 1969 , national Independence Day .
" The date that Brazil became independent was the day our independence ended , " Almir says .
" Our people were very , very scared when they first saw white men . "
A warrior people ( Surui , the name bestowed on them by outsiders , means " enemy " ) , they decided to fight .
" We thought we could beat them with bows and arrows , " says Almir .
" But it did n't work . "
The Surui were reduced from 5,000 to just 250 people by massacres and diseases such as chicken pox , measles , tuberculosis and flu , to which they had no immunity .
" The survivors were so weak from disease that they did not have the strength to bury their dead .
So we went to Plan B , a peace plan . "
Did that work ?
" In terms of absolute survival , yes .
Other tribes in Rondonia completely disappeared . "
They got medical help , but lost half their land , and only got the remainder protected after a prominent Surui drew an arrow on a leading Brazilian senator in his office and demanded official demarcation .
The land is still under constant attack .
Almir says that 300 sawmills , employing 4,000 people , surround it and other Indian reserves in the area .
Eleven local chiefs have been killed trying to protect their land , and he himself has a £ 50,000 price on his head .
He cottoned on to cyberspace when first trying out Google Earth and – like almost everyone – immediately searched for where he lived .
He saw clear signs of logging , and realised he could enlist an eye in the sky .
With the help of the US - based Amazon Conservation Team he has been training his people in IT .
They use satnav not to find their way around the jungle they know so well , but to enable them to record the co-ordinates of any logging they find so that they can report it .
And Almir envisages the Surui with solar - powered laptops using Google to download information and to tell the world how their forest is much more valuable if left standing .
WASHINGTON : The Indian - origin head of an electronics firm , who was detained earlier this month for allegedly shipping sensitive missile and space technology equipment to India , will continue to be kept in custody without availability of bail , a US court has ruled .
Judge Deborah Robinson also postponed to May one the " status " hearing of Parthasarathy Sudarshan , the chief of electronic firm Cirrus Inc , and Mythili Gopal , a senior employee of the company , after they appeared before the court yesterday afternoon .
The two along with two other Indian - origin employees of the firm have been accused by the FBI of violating numerous US export control laws and shipping sensitive missile and space technology equipment to India .
The Judge ordered that Sudarshan , who is already in federal custody , will continue to be in detention without availability of bail ; and Gopal , who has pleaded not guilty , will continue under the same terms of her bail application as filed before a court in South Carolina .
The original terms of Gopal 's bail was an execution of bond for $ 25,000 and surrendering her passport .
Sudarshan holds a Sigaporean passport and Gopal holds an Indian passport .
The Justice Department has indicted Cirrus Inc , operating in Singapore , South Carolina and Bangalore , of working as an agent of the Indian government to obtain sensitive missile and weapons technology for its military programs .
The indictment also includes a number of unidentified co-conspirators , including an official of the Indian mission in Washington .
The indictment indicates that the defendants were buying equipment for three Indian government agencies .
The original indictment details the alleged transactions to have taken place between 2003 and 2006 and the Indian Government agencies involved being the departments of Defence and Space .
The defendants have been charged with violating the United States Export Administration Act , which prohibits the export of dual - use technologies , those with both military and non-military uses , without approval from the Commerce Department attesting that the technology will be used only for non-military purposes .

Once again , McCain confuses Sunnis with Shiites John Byrne
Published : Tuesday April 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This LA Times blogger : ' Maybe flash cards would help '
John McCain is n't quite sure of himself on Iraq .
Last month , the Arizona senator got a whisper in his ear from Sen .
Joe Lieberman , after he said that Iran was providing aid to Al Qaeda in Iraq , a Sunni group .
Iran , however , is actually a Shiite nation .
On Fox News Sunday , McCain also got wrong the details of an Iraqi ceasefire .
" His friend , Joe Lieberman , who was also on the trip , had to famously whisper in his ear to correct him , " the LA Times writes today .
" This allowed McCain 's two Democratic rivals for the presidency , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to criticize McCain for his mistake , which came in the area that 's supposed to be in his wheelhouse : national security and foreign policy . "
At today 's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing , McCain seems to have gotten it wrong again , when interviewing Iraq commander Gen. David Petraeus .
MCCAIN : " There are numerous threats to security in Iraq and the future of Iraq .
Do you still view al - Qaeda in Iraq as a major threat ? "
PETRAEUS : " It is a major threat .
Though it is certainly as not as major a threat as it was say , 15 months ago . "
MCCAIN : " Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shias overall ?
PETRAEUS : " No , sir . "
MCCAIN : " Or Sunnis or anybody else then ?
Watch the video on The Huffington Post here .
" McCain may want to work on this obvious weakness in his Iraq fund of knowledge , " the Times blog remarks .
" Maybe flash cards would help . "
During an appearance on Fox News Sunday Apr. 6 , McCain repeated the false claim that Muqtada al - Sadr declared the ceasefire in Basra last week and said he thought the Iraqi army was performing well .
" It was al - Sadr that declared the ceasefire , not Maliki , " said McCain .
" With respect , I dont think Sadr would have declared the ceasefire if he thought he was winning .
Most times in history , military engagements , the winning side doesnt declare the ceasefire .
The second point is , overall , the Iraqi military performed pretty well .
The military is functioning very effectively . "
As the blog , Think Progress notes , " it was members of Prime Minister Nouri al - Malikis government who brokered the ceasefire , to which Sadr agreed .
Experts agree that Sadrs influence was strengthened  rather than diminished  by the Basra battle . "
The Democratic National Committee quickly attacked McCain , noting several mishaps in a press release .
March 17 , 2008 : McCain said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show " As you know , there are al - Qaeda operatives that are taken back into Iran , given training as leaders , and they 're moving back into Iraq . "
[ New York Times , 3/19/08 -- Transcript .
March 18 , 2008 : In Jordan after a trip to Iraq , McCain said a press conference that " ' We continue to be concerned about Iranian [ operatives ] taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back , ' he said in comments after meeting with Jordan 's King Abdullah II on Tuesday afternoon .
Pressed to elaborate , McCain said it is ' common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran ; that 's well known .
And it 's unfortunate . '
A few moments later , Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , standing just behind McCain , stepped forward and whispered in his ear .
McCain then said , ' I 'm sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not al - Qaeda . ' "
[ Washington Post , 3/19/08 ]
March 19 , 2008 : The next day however , in a press release on the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , McCain said " Al Qaeda and Shia extremists -- with support from external powers such as Iran -- are on the run but not defeated . "
[ McCain Presidential Campaign Press Release via Targeted News Service , 3/19/08 ]
November 2007 : McCain Said that Al Qaeda Is Getting " Supplies and Equipment " From Iran .
" Al Qaeda is not defeated , " McCain told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week .
" They 're on the run , but they are not defeated , and they continue to get supplies and equipment through Iran , and they continue to get suicide bombers through Syria . "
[ ABC , This Week with George Stephanopoulos , 11/25/07 ]
April 8 , 2008 : McCain Referred To Al Qaeda As A " Sect Of Shi'ites " MCCAIN :
Do you still view al Qaeda in Iraq as a major threat ?
PETRAEUS : It is still a major threat , though it is certainly not as major a threat as it was say 15 months ago .
MCCAIN : Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shi'ites overall ?

Kage-e ( " shadow pictures " ) -- a popular form of Edo - period woodblock print -- were appreciated by children and adults and commonly used as party gags .
These pictures consist of two parts : a " shadow " image and a " real " image .
The shadow image , which typically bears the shape of a common , easily identifiable object , is viewed first .
The real image , viewed second , reveals the surprising true identity of the shadow .
Here 's a nice example by ukiyoe master Kuniyoshi ( ca. 1852 ) .
It shows what appear to be the silhouettes of goldfish ...
But look again ...
It 's a flying tanuki crushing a hunter under the weight of its mammoth testicles .
Here are a few more kage-e by Hiroshige ( ca. 1842 ) .
The shadows cast on shoji doors belong to men in interesting poses .

You could mistakenly believe , judging by all the press about US cleantech , renewable energy , and green business ventures , that the hub for all things green and innovative is the US .
Far from it .
If Enviu , from which I learned and wrote about Happy Shrimp has their way , Europe will step forward strongly as a leader in fostering , developing , and supporting innovative sustainable ventures .
Enviu , together with 8 other innovation labs from Spain , Denmark , Poland , France , Sweden , Switzerland , Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands is soon to be launching the NEXT Europe Alliance .
The launch is set for the upcoming iFest , the business inspiration fest in Spain where there will be , “ ideas and energy to solve the issues of the near future . ”
Europe ’s top sustainable innovation labs ?
An overview
All of the labs could be the subject of an article each , but aside from the universal thread of a focus on innovation , each one has a different place at the table :
Enviu is a business incubator and sustainability educator , working together with area government and firms , and aims to have a global scope .
Innovation Lab is a company which monitors current and upcoming trends for a range of major companies .
Idélabratoriet focuses on educating professionals how to effectively ideate , and manage what they come up with effectively .
La Fabrique du Futur sums it elegantly when they say ,
The future is everyone ’s affair and does not just concern experts .
We therefore constitute an “ in vivo ” and “ in vitro ” laboratory for the detection of emerging practises initiated by avant - garde people , among whom cultural creatives are in the forefront .
Switzerland ’s Lift Lab combines innovation consulting , workshop centered conferences , and numerous publications .
Again besting us in their command of English , they say , in regards to their blogs , “ Follow this reader - enhanced , transparent and interactive exercise , and feel free to participate and add information and opinions ! ”
Pantopicon and Trendbüro likewise serve to act as an extra brain , a people & resource connector , and an innovation accelerator for businesses .
Each of these lab ’s sites , and the resources they lead to will likely serve as an inspiration to you .
Dig in !
See if you can find who said ,
Our strength rests on a foundation of comprehensive knowledge , a flair for dissemination and a capacity for innovation .
Three building blocks never occurring in isolation .
Readers :
Where else do you see innovation sprouting out there , in terms of sustainable and social ventures ?

Researchers can predict which noun a person is visualizing .
Computers might soon be able to deduce your thoughts just by scanning your brain .
Punchstock
A computer model has been developed that can predict what word you are thinking of .
The model may help to resolve questions about how the brain processes words and language , and might even lead to techniques for decoding people ’s thoughts .
Researchers led by Tom Mitchell of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , ' trained ' a computer model to recognize the patterns of brain activity associated with 60 images , each of which represented a different noun , such as ' celery ' or ' aeroplane ' .
The team started with the assumption that the brain processes words in terms of how they relate to movement and sensory information .
Words such as ' hammer ' , for example , are known to cause movement - related areas of the brain to light up ; on the other hand , the word ' castle ' triggers activity in regions that process spatial information .
Mitchell and his colleagues also knew that different nouns are associated more often with some verbs than with others – the verb ' eat ' , for example , is more likely to be found in conjunction with ' celery ' than with ' aeroplane ' .
The researchers designed the model to try and use these semantic links to work out how the brain would react to particular nouns .
They fed 25 such verbs into the model .
Active association
The team then used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan the brains of 9 volunteers as they looked at images of the nouns .
The researchers then fed the model 58 of the 60 nouns to train it .
For each noun , the model sorted through a trillion - word body of text to find how it was related to the 25 verbs , and how that related to the activation pattern .
After training , the models were put to the test .
Their task was to predict the pattern of activity for the two missing words from the group of 60 , and then to deduce which word was which .
On average , the models came up with the right answer more than three - quarters of the time .
The team then went one step further , this time training the models on 59 of the 60 test words , and then showing them a new brain activity pattern and offering them a choice of 1,001 words to match it .
The models performed well above chance when they were made to rank the 1,001 words according to how well they matched the pattern .
The results are reported in Science1 .
The idea is similar to another ‘ brain - reading ’ technique , reported in Nature earlier this year2 , that can predict what picture a person is seeing from a selection of more than 100 .
The new model is different in that it has to look at the meanings of the words , rather than just lower - level visual features of a picture .

It should n’t be too difficult to get the model to choose accurately between a larger number of words , says John - Dylan Haynes , who also works on models of brain decoding at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin in Germany .
“ This study shows a method that allows one to read out a large number of different thoughts from brain activity , even with only a few calibration measurements , ” he says .

An average English speaker knows 50,000 words , Mitchell says , so the model could in theory be used to select any word a subject chooses to think of .
Even whole sentences might not be too distant a prospect for the model , says Mitchell .
“ Now that we can see individual words , it gives the scaffolding for starting to see what the brain does with multiple words as it assembles them , ” he says .
This gives researchers the chance to understand the “ mental chemistry ” that the brain does when it processes such phrases , Mitchell suggests .
Models such as this one could also be useful in diagnosing disorders of language or helping students pick up a foreign language .
In semantic dementia , for example , people lose the ability to remember the meanings of things - shown a picture of a chihuahua , they can only recall ' dog ' , for example - but little is known about what exactly goes wrong in the brain .
“ We could look at what the neural encoding is for this , ” says Mitchell .

The company Rinspeed has developed a vehicle , “ sQuba ” that travels on both land and water and produces zero emissions .
The car will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show .
sQuba is an electric car , meaning it produces no emissions while driving .
It is powered by three electric motors : one powers the wheels , one powers the propellers in the back , and the third controls water jets the steer the car .
The car can submerge about 30 feet underwater .

US environmental regulatory official forced out after dispute with Dow Chemical
By Naomi Spencer
12 May 2008
A regional US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) administrator in a long - running fight with Dow Chemical over pollution announced her resignation May 1 , after high - ranking federal officials stripped her of her enforcement powers and told her to quit or be fired by June 1 .
The ouster is the latest example of the Bush administration ’s political interference into science and regulation at the EPA on behalf of big business .
The administrator , Mary Gade , headed the EPA ’s Region 5 office in Chicago , which oversees federal enforcement throughout Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , Minnesota , and Wisconsin .
Since she was appointed by Bush to the Midwest office in 2006 , Gade had pressed for clean - up efforts and pursued penalties against Dow for dioxin contamination surrounding its Midland , Michigan plants .
For decades , Dow has dumped dioxin — a highly toxic byproduct of herbicides and chlorinated chemicals — into local rivers , contaminating fish and wildlife and saturating the water and soil within 50 miles of its plants .
Dioxin is known to cause cancer , mutations , and serious skin diseases .
The EPA considers the chemical dangerous to public health and the environment even at very low levels because it bioaccumulates , or builds up in the environment and in the body much faster than it breaks down .
Last July , Gade invoked emergency powers to order
Dow to immediately clean up three so - called “ hotspots ” of dioxin near its factories .
At one test site near a park in Saginaw , Michigan in November , the EPA found dioxin levels of a staggering 1.6 million parts per trillion .
The federal EPA limit for dioxin is 1,000 parts per trillion ; Michigan ’s state Department of Environmental Quality limit is only 90 parts per trillion .
The chemical is measured in trillionths both because of its toxicity and its bioaccumulative property .
In November 2006 , a survey by the University of Michigan identified three areas within a six - mile stretch of the Saginaw - area Tittabawassee River with extremely high dioxin concentrations in the soil .
The levels measured from 69,000 to 87,000 parts per trillion .
The company insisted that the depth of dioxin in the soil — between 6 inches to a foot down — indicated that the contamination occurred at least a century ago and had nothing to do with Dow ’s own dumping .
Michigan ’s average dioxin level statewide is only 7 parts per trillion .
Dow has continually insisted that its dioxin pollution is harmless to people and wildlife .
Company spokesperson John Musser told the Chicago Tribune May 2 , “ There is all this mystique about dioxin .
Just because it ’s there does n’t mean there is an imminent health threat . ”
To the Washington Post on May 3 , Musser claimed company - commissioned research showed that dioxin in soil “ is not a contributor in any meaningful way to levels of contaminants in people ’s bodies .
Both on human health and environmental side , there ’s not an imminent public health threat . ”
Dow sought to cut a deal on the clean up with the EPA late last year that would have extended the deadline until at least 2010 .
According to the May 2 Tribune report , Gade broke off negotiations in January on the grounds that Dow was “ refusing to take action necessary to protect public health and wildlife . ”
In turn , “ Dow responded by appealing to officials in Washington , ” according to “ heavily redacted letters ” obtained by the Tribune through a Freedom of Information Act request .
The Tribune reported that two aides to federal EPA administrator Stephen Johnson gave Gade the ultimatum of quit or be fired .
Gade told the paper on Thursday , “ There ’s no question this is about Dow .
I stand behind what I did and what my staff did .
I ’m proud of what we did . ”
EPA head Johnson has on multiple occasions interfered with the basic mandates of the agency to protect public health since his appointment in 2005 .
In December , Johnson quashed a California initiative that would have imposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions from automobile exhaust .
He has declined to declare such emissions a public health concern despite broad consensus within the EPA on the dangers posed by global warming .
EPA scientists have complained about similar political meddling over the past five years .
A survey of EPA staff scientists by the Union of Concerned Scientists , released April 23 , found that the agency was “ under siege from political pressures . ”
According to the UCS findings , Bush appointees “ have edited scientific documents , manipulated scientific assessments , and generally sought to undermine the science behind dozens of EPA regulations . ”
Of 1,600 respondents , 889 scientists ( 60 percent ) reported that they had personally experienced at least one incident of political interference during the past five years .
A fifth of respondents said their work had been subjected to changes that altered the meaning of the scientific findings , and a fifth of scientists reported experiencing “ selective or incomplete use of data to justify a specific regulatory outcome . ”
Nearly 200 EPA scientists said they had personally experienced “ situations in which scientists have actively objected to , resigned from , or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change scientific findings . ”
More than 40 percent of the respondents said they had seen cases in which “ commercial interests have inappropriately induced the reversal or withdrawal of EPA scientific conclusions or decisions through political intervention . ”
The UCS noted that nearly 100 scientists specifically identified the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) as the primary source of external interference at the EPA .
In 2004 , the agency ’s scientific risk assessment process for toxic chemicals such as dioxin , called the Integrated Risk Information System ( IRIS ) , was put under the authority of the OMB .
The EPA conducted only two risk assessments for all of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 .
In addition , according to an internal government audit , five IRIS assessments were aborted without explanation .
The Rickroll prank ( you know , you show a link pretending it 's something else but it 's really the music video for Rick Astley 's " Never Gonna Give You Up " ) is just " made you look ! " for the web .
Worse :
It 's " sure thing ... not ! " for the web .
That 's why it caught on so damn well , because every idiot can enjoy a good laugh ( " ha ha fooled you that was not the web page you intended to see " ) .
Here 's how it began ( as a kind of funny joke ) , how it took over , and why using it makes you a moron who should be strapped down in front of a loop of " 2 Girls 1 Cup . "
Origins
Rickrolling began last year in 4 chan 's video game forum .
( The 4 chan forum site is the sewer of the Internet , but the worst griefing and fighting happens in its /b/ forum .
The other forums stay somewhat on topic but are still perverse and often baffling . )
Anyway according to the Encyclopedia Dramatica , when Grand Theft Auto IV 's official web site launched , everyone rushed to see it and the site got overloaded .
Back on 4 chan , some people pointed to exclusive videos of the upcoming game , and the frustrated GTA fans clicked the links .
Instead of game footage , they got Rickrolled .
The fad caught on , then spread to other popular forums like Fark and Slashdot , which share some users with 4 chan .
From there it went to the 250 , the bloggers and nerds who think they are the center of the Internet — these people .
Those people spread it to the web at large and now it 's a trend story in the Guardian .
Varieties
Before ( or maybe slightly after ) the Rickroll came the duckroll , which was the same thing with a picture of a duck on wheels instead of " Never Gonna Give You Up . "
The absurdity was funnier , but still rather pointless .
It still was n't impressive to , gasp , send someone to a web page they did not expect .
A more heinous variety of Rickroll is a trick that resizes and animates the victim 's window and pops up messages , making it very hard to close the window without hearing the whole song .
Jesus , never do this .
How is it funny ?
You 're just making someone click things , listen to banal noise , and resize their windows .
You 're replicating the banner ad experience from 2003 .
The problem with Rickrolls is the lack of sufficient setup .
When you link to something , you set up a tiny expectation in me .
That does n't make for much of a fall when I see the punchline .
So the few redeemable Rickrolls must come at the end of a long setup in which a link is discussed at length before it 's given .
Even real - world Rickrolls are disappointing because they ride on the cultural capital of the web 's worst joke .
Alternatives
I was goatseing long before Rickroll .
Goatse , the image of a man stretching his own ass open ( described at length on Wikipedia ) , triggers an actual moment of horror ( though it 's funnier if a first - time victim is n't really bothered ) .
There are other shock sites like meatspin , which humiliates the viewer for watching .
A Rickroll is like poking someone in the chest ; Goatse is sucker - punching them .
Still obviously for teens , college students , and the sort of guy who likes ads by Crispin Porter +
Bogusky .
But lately I 've switched to " happyrolls , " my stupid word for surprising people with good things .
" Ha , you thought I was linking you to a spreadsheet , but it 's a really cute cartoon about history ! "
I know , this is so " pay it forward " or whatever , but it 's not Rick Astley .
Does the quest for optimum e-commerce customer satisfaction have a date with the law of diminishing returns ?
It 's a question raised this morning by notably rosy survey data .
Only one company - online or brick - and - mortar - does a better job of keeping customers smiling than does Amazon.com , according to the University of Michigan 's latest American Customer Satisfaction Index ( free reg. required to download report ) .
No disrespect to 57 Sauce , but top dog Heinz does n't have the same variety of IT , inventory management and direct delivery challenges as an Amazon ... and the ketchup king has been honing its act since 1869 , or 126 years longer than Amazon 's been around .
Amazon may be the best , but it is by no means an aberration , according to ACSI .
Also racking up high scores were newcomers to the survey , Newegg ( 87 ) and Netflix ( 84 ) , as well as a host of e-commerce veterans such as eBay ( 81 ) .
Travel and brokerage outfits did n't ' fare quite so well by comparison .
Survey authors say the ascension to the top of the e-commerce titans comes while their offline counterparts are struggling to keep their heads above water , both in terms of customer satisfaction and financial performance .
From today 's press release :
E-commerce in aggregate rises to a score of 81.6 on the ACSI 's 100 - point scale , a significant 2 % jump from 2006 .
The e-commerce sector now outperforms all other service industries measured by ACSI .
" The improvement in e-commerce is impressive , given the downward trend in the national ACSI , " said Claes Fornell , head of the ACSI at the University of Michigan and author of The Satisfied Customer .
The Index includes more than 200 companies in more than 40 industries and slipped 0.4 % to 74.9 in its second consecutive decline .
" E - commerce is the only sector to improve this quarter , and in fact reaches an all - time high in customer satisfaction while other some industries start to struggle . "
The online retailers surpass their offline counterparts in customer satisfaction by 12 % , according to this measure .
" Against a backdrop of weakening consumer spending and talk about recession , e-commerce will continue to be a bright spot for multichannel companies , " said Larry Freed , an online customer satisfaction expert and president and CEO of ForeSee Results .
" Companies have to excel in their online channel : survival in this economy depends on customer satisfaction , because switching costs are low and an alternative is just a mouse click away . "
However , presuming it 's true that you can't please everyone , might there be a point at which the pursuit becomes unjustifiable from a business perspective ?
I put that question to Freed via e-mail :
Do you foresee any theoretical limit for improvement in ACSI scores for the e-commerce sector ?
There is no true limit short of 100 , but there is a practical limit .
Not a specific number per se , but I do n't believe we have seen a score above 90 in the history of the ACSI .
In addition , we have had many stages of innovation in e-commerce , and with each stage of innovation the standard of performance continues to increase .
With the strong scores we see in the e-commerce sector , I believe surpassing 90 will be a big challenge .
Will top performers such as Amazon - second only to Heinz among all companies surveyed - see their efforts to improve customer satisfaction run into the law of diminishing returns ?
There is a point of diminishing return , where an investment to improve customer satisfaction may not yield a significant enough improvement in financial benefits .
However , if others are making improvements and implementing new innovative capabilities , those that do n't move forward will slip behind and see downward pressure on satisfaction scores .
What surprises you most about this year 's results ?
Good question .
We follow this space very close and work with many e-commerce companies on a daily basis , so I do n't know that there was anything that really surprised me .
However , there were a few results that were notable .
Newegg 's debut was very impressive and while I have been very familiar with their success I think that their score was probably a surprise to many .
In fact , many consumers may not even know Newegg .
They have a very specific audience they serve and do a remarkable job in doing so .
Fidelity also saw a great increase .
Again , I expected them to increase their scores , but their increase was significant .
They have a great focus on the customer experience and the results show that .

Call for EU to build its own army
By Mark Mardell
Europe Editor , BBC News
European soldiers already act under the UN banner in Kosovo An influential Polish member of the European parliament has called for the EU to develop " hard power " and spend more money to build a European army .
Foreign affairs committee chairman Jacek Saryusz - Wolski also wants the European parliament to have the final say on deployments under the EU flag .
The French have said beefing up the EU 's military capability will be a key part of their six - month presidency .
The BBC has been told their plans also include a new EU military headquarters .
Other items on the French list of proposals involve calling upon all EU countries to increase spending on defence to meet a new target of perhaps 6 % of Gross Domestic Product .
More aircraft France 's leadership of the EU will also include a push for the creation of more rapid reaction forces to enable Europe to collectively undertake three simultaneous missions .
They also want more helicopters and aircraft to be made available for missions .
The big problem is finding countries that want to contribute ... troops and helicopters to real missions
Mark Mardell 's blog
The EU will not officially comment until the proposals are unveiled by French President Sarkozy in two weeks ' time .
The head of the German army , Gen Wolfgang Schneiderhan , told the BBC that Europe needs to be able to react to crises .
" Working together with Nato we can improve the ability of both organisations to tackle the threats that face our world , " he said .
The plans are likely to prove controversial in many countries , including Britain , where there is reluctance towards any move to a European army .
In Ireland there are concerns about neutrality , while in Germany there are worries about any policy that could go beyond a peacekeeping role .

An opinion poll for The Independent gives the Conservatives a 21 - point lead over Labour , which should now " seriously consider " dumping Gordon Brown , according to a close ally of Tony Blair .
Labour backbenchers called on cabinet ministers to tell Mr Brown to quit after the party came a humiliating fifth in the Henley by - election , behind the Greens and the BNP .
" Brown 's people said it could n't get any worse – now it has , " said a senior Labour MP .
The Labour jitters will be increased by the latest ComRes poll for The Independent , which would give David Cameron an overall majority of 212 if repeated at a general election .

It is the Tories ' highest rating and the biggest lead for any party since ComRes began polling for this newspaper in 2006 .
The Tories are on 46 per cent ( up two points on last month ) , Labour on 25 per cent ( down five points ) , the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent ( up two points ) and other parties on 9 per cent ( no change ) .
The ComRes findings suggest that Mr Brown may be dragging Labour 's support down .
When voters were asked whether they thought of themselves as being a natural supporter of Labour , the Tories or another party , more people ( 27 per cent ) opted for Labour than the Tories ( 26 per cent ) , with the Liberal Democrats on 11 per cent and " do n't knows " on 14 per cent .
That may encourage Labour critics of Mr Brown to believe the party could recover under a new leader .
" We ca n't just sleepwalk to defeat , " one former minister said .
" A lot of people are saying after Henley that Gordon is a loser and has got to go . "
Lord Levy , Labour 's chief fundraiser under Mr Blair , said it was up to party members to decide whether Mr Brown should stand down .
He told the BBC's Newsnight programme : " I certainly , seeing the polls , would have to say that this is something that needs to be very seriously considered . "
" It 's a bad day when the BNP can beat Labour .
It sticks in my craw , " said Ronnie Campbell , the Labour MP for Blyth Valley .
" I do n't like to back losers .
He [ Mr Brown ] is a loser at the moment . "
David Drew , the Labour MP for Stroud , said : " There 's no point in doing the job when you are not enjoying it ...
He 's got to look at himself .
He 's got to make that decision . "
Mr Brown , on a visit to Manchester on the first anniversary of him becoming Prime Minister , said : " By-elections come and by - elections go .
Of course we have to listen to what people say .
But my main job is to improve our public services , to get the economy moving forward , to make sure that in the health service and education people have the best services that they want and I am going to continue to do that .
And I think people know that we are going through difficult times in the economy .
It 's my job to steer us through these difficult times . "
ComRes says the Tories are ahead of Labour among every age and social group , and in every region except Scotland .
Some 13 per cent of people who identify themselves as Labour voters intend to vote Tory , as do 14 per cent of Liberal Democrat identifiers .
Only 4 per cent of Liberal Democrat identifiers say they will vote Labour , while 7 per cent of Labour identifiers intend to back the Liberal Democrats .
Some 74 per cent of Tory supporters are " absolutely certain " to vote , compared with 58 per cent of Labour supporters and 50 per cent of Liberal Democrats .
ComRes telephoned 1,007 adults in Britain between 25 and 26 June .
Data were weighted by past vote recall .
ComRes is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .

Issue # 110 • March / April , 2008
I received this question in an e-mail from my younger brother , Mike : “ Jack , the other day a friend asked me where in the Constitution does it say you have the right to freedom of travel .
Do you know where I would find that …?
My reply was as follows :
I tell people this again and again , but it falls on deaf ears :
There is no place in the Constitution that says we have the right to travel , the right to privacy , etc .
In fact , the Bill of Rights , which “ mentions ” some , and only some , of our rights , almost was n’t included in the Constitution .
The Democrats , led by Thomas Jefferson , wanted a Bill of Rights included because they were afraid if we did n’t explicitly say we have Natural , God -given , or unalienable ( that ’s the word they used , not inalienable ) rights , it would someday be assumed they did n’t exist .
On the other hand , the Federalists were afraid that if a Bill of Rights was included , it would be assumed that the government could now control them , i.e. , that our rights would be viewed as “ constitutional rights , ” such as Canada , Great Britain , and many other countries have today , which in those countries are thought to exist at the pleasure of the government .
As a safety , so that it would not appear that the enumerated rights were the only ones we have , the Ninth Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights .
What does it say ?
“ The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . ”
What does it mean ?
It means that only “ some ” of our rights are listed .
It was meant to acknowledge that we have many others besides the one listed .
The idea of the government being the wellspring of our rights makes no sense if we read the Declaration of Independence or the Federalist Papers .
Both were written before the Constitution and both assume our rights exist apart from the government .
What ’s happened , of course , is that the worst case scenarios of both the Democrats and the Federalists have come home to roost because , as the years rolled by , any rights not included in the Bill of Rights are often deemed not to exist , while all the rights that are mentioned are now considered gifts from politicians and bureaucrats .
Here ’s the truth : The Constitution was written to limit our government , not to control the people .
So , the real question is not , “ Where in the Constitution does it say we have a right to travel ? ” but “ Where in the Constitution did the People grant to the Federal government the power to take away our right to travel ? ”
Read Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution .
There , the powers granted to the Federal government are plainly spelled out .
Where does it say the government can limit travel ?
It does n’t .
Then read the Tenth Amendment , in the so - called Bill of Rights .
It says , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
That means it is not on me to prove the Constitution has granted me the right to travel ; it means the onus is on the government to prove that there is a phrase or a clause in the Constitution granting it the right to infringe on my right to travel .
It is n’t there .
It ’s a sad commentary on the state of what is supposed to be the freest country that ever existed that there are now millions of Americans who can ask the question your friend asked .
It ’s sad that so many of us think that the rights meant to protect us from the government are now considered to be a gift from the government and not from Nature or God .
Why did n’t the Founding Fathers include a “ right to travel ? ”
It never occurred to them that politicians and bureaucrats would act as if it did n’t exist .
However , though it was n’t explicitly included in the first eight Amendments , it is implicitly included under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments and , with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment , the states cannot violate any of our rights , either .
By the way , you might ask your friend what he thinks Thomas Jefferson , George Washington , George Mason , Benjamin Franklin , or any of the other Founding Fathers , who had just defeated what was then the world ’s greatest superpower in a Revolutionary War to win their freedom and ensure these Natural or God - given rights were in place , would have said if they came back today and the Federal government tried to limit their freedom to travel ?
Better yet , what would they call your friend who now thinks there ’s no right to travel unless it ’s granted by the government ?
The word “ idiot ” comes to mind .
Our soberer readers ( I know we have them ) will remember California Congresswoman Laura Richardson ( D - Speculator ) , who is facing foreclosure proceedings on three homes .
The uproar began with the foreclosure of sale her unoccupied " second home " in Sacramento , which Richardson claimed was an " error " on WaMu 's part , since ( she claimed ) she had worked out a last - minute modification agreement with WaMu the week before the sale .
According to the Daily Breeze , WaMu has filed paperwork to rescind the foreclosure sale , and the man who bought the home is not happy :
The real estate broker who bought Rep. Laura Richardson 's house at a foreclosure sale last month is accusing her of receiving preferential treatment because her lender has issued a notice to rescind the sale .
James
York , owner of Red Rock Mortgage , said he would file a lawsuit against Richardson and her lender , Washington Mutual , by the end of the week , and has every intention of keeping the house .
" I 'm just amazed they 've done this , " York said .
" They never would have done this for anybody else . "
York bought the Sacramento home at a foreclosure auction on May 7 for $ 388,000 .
Richardson had not been making payments on the property for nearly a year , and had also gone into default on her two other houses in Long Beach and San Pedro .
Richardson , D - Long Beach , has said that the auction should never have been held , because she had worked out a loan modification agreement with her lender beforehand and had begun making payments .
How often are modifications or repayment plans offered to owners of vacant investment properties with no or negative equity that have never been listed or rented ?
How often are modifications offered to borrowers with two other properties currently in foreclosure ?
How often are modifications arranged in the week before the scheduled trustee 's sale , following nearly a year of no contact ?
Does WaMu 's policy on modifications make any reference to requiring a " commitment to homeownership " on the borrower 's part ?
How , normally , is that established ?
Does WaMu 's policy on modifications make any reference to establishing that the borrower does not display a " disregard for debt obligations " ?
How , normally , is that established ?
In 2005 , when she was still on the Long Beach City Council , she left one mechanic in a lurch with an unpaid bill , then later had her badly damaged BMW towed to an auto body shop but did n't pay for any work and abandoned the car there , owners of the businesses said this week .
The next day , Richardson began using a city - owned vehicle - putting almost 31,000 miles on it in about a year - and continued driving the car five days after she had left the council to serve in the state Assembly , city records show .
. . .
Labreche said he spent months leaving messages on Richardson 's cell phone voice mail , then he got a collection agency involved , but still the bill went unpaid .
. . .
In December 2005 , Lillegard filed for a mechanic 's lien on Richardson 's car to pay the towing , storage and administrative costs , he said .
Lillegard said the lien was finalized in February 2006 and he sold the car to a junkyard , though a few days later - too late - Richardson sent him money to put toward the bill .
Richardson continues to refuse to authorize WaMu to release any information on her case , although frankly I 'm not sure if I were WaMu I 'd want to talk about it .
This smells terrible , indeed .
Perhaps reporters could simply ask some general questions of WaMu about its foreclosure workout policies .
Like :
If , for instance , we had some evidence that stiffing creditors and getting the taxpayers to subsidize her financial imprudence was , like , a pattern of Richardson 's long before the house payments went into default , would that , like , indicate that her mortgage problems may not have much to do with " extenuating circumstances " ?
WaMu may not be able to read a credit report , but the Press - Telegram ferreted this out :
So in January of 2007 , WaMu gave Richardson a 100 % loan to purchase a second home , when her credit report would have shown recent derogatories related to the car repair bills , plus the payments on two other homes , on a State Assembly salary that I can't quite see being equal to her existing debts , let alone a new house payment .
In other words , she got your basic subprime loan that relied on nothing other than a fervent belief in endless house price appreciation -- in January of 2007 .
Or else she got a loan because she 's a VIP .
I continue to want to know why WaMu is bailing out a deadbeat and a speculator at the expense of a good - faith buyer of a foreclosure property , and wasting operational capacity on a deal like this instead of working with struggling owner - occupants who might actually pay back the modified loan .
I will leave it to the citizens of California to explain why you want this woman anywhere near fiscal , budgetary , or housing policy power .

Professor and author Mark Crispin Miller is here to discuss his latest book Loser Take All : Election Fraud and The Subversion of Democracy , 2000 - 2008 , a subject about which we cannot be too vigilant as we near November in what is arguably the most critical national election in recent history .
Loser Take
All is an anthology by writers that should be very familiar to you : Larisa Alexandrova , Brad Friedman and Robert Kennedy , Jr. among others .
From Amazon :
Loser Taker All : Election Fraud and The Subversion of Democracy , 2000 - 2008 is an indispensable anthology of writings covering the vast election fraud that has been perpetrated by the GOP — with the Democratic Party ’s acquiescence — since 2000 .
Among the subjects treated here are : the myth of George Bush ’s victory in Florida in 2000 , and FOX News ’s key role in propagating it ; Senator Max Cleland ’s dubious defeat in Georgia in 2002 ; Bush ’s “ re-election ” in 2004 , including evidence of systematic fraud outside of Ohio ; startling evidence of fraud committed in the 2006 midterm elections , which the Democrats appear to have won by a far larger margin than officially reported ; and , crucially , evidence that the Republicans will attempt to steal the presidential election in 2008 .
We 're thrilled to have Mark here to talk with you .
As with all chats , we ask that you treat our guest respectfully and keep your questions on topic .
Dang , there has been a spate of early adopter angst lately .
Just read Alex Vanelsas to see a good example .
Today Frederick over at the Last Podcast gets into the act , writing “ I kept wondering if the gap between early adopters and mainstream users is n’t expanding more and more and what that means for services that cater mostly to early adopters . ”
Over the last few days I ’ve seen another misconception : that Twitter is only Silicon Valley people talking to themselves .
Do a search for “ Silicon Valley ” on Tweetscan and you ’ll see a few of those .
That misconception is easy to disprove : just watch Twitter Vision for a few minutes and you ’ll see that very few Twitterers are in Silicon Valley .
There ARE huge differences between early adopters and others .
I was in Alana Taylor ’s Ustream channel the other night and many people there told me they like hanging out there “ because people understand what I ’m talking about here . ”
In other words , when someone says to “ Tweet that ” you do n’t get blank stares , or , worse , derision .
If I get arrogant about the role of early adopters ( some people call them influencers , or “ passionates ” ) it ’s because I ’ve seen they are the ones who drive society .
You really think that guy who I saw the other day on the plane using Windows 2000 and an old version of Lotus Notes is driving society ?
Riiiigggghhhhtttt .
I ’ve seen this discussion happen EVERY TIME there ’s a new technology .
I remember back in 1977 that only nerds could use personal computers .
Very few people ( not even Steve Jobs or Bill Gates ) understood just how big that would become .
I remember the days when email was only used by the nerds who had access to Unix terminals at universities or research labs .
I remember the days when people said “ IM would never be used in enterprises . ”
Today it ’s built into Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange .
Seriously .
They did say that .
I remember the days when the World Wide Web was only for nerds who did physics at places like CERN and weird kids who went to Stanford .
I remember people actively betting against the Web .
Luckily the guy I worked for , Jim Fawcette , saw its promise early in 1994 and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to build one of the first publisher ’s Web sites .
That investment is why I ’m here today .
Today the angst is onto things like Twitter , FriendFeed , etc. Even older Web 2.0 properties like Flickr have n’t really gone mainstream .
Last week we spent some time with Ansel Adams ’ son .
He had never heard of Flickr .
Ansel Adams son !!!
That dude should be the first that photo sharing sites pitch , since he ’s always talking to press about photography and his company does tons of classes for photographers in Yosemite and other places .
Heck , Flickr should figure out how to sponsor the Ansel Adams ’ Gallery .
But they do n’t .
Why not ?
Because convincing late adopters to change their behavior is VERY hard and VERY expensive .
It ’s why Amazon does n’t do TV advertising .
Rather they build a product that early adopters , passionate computer geeks , and influencers like .
How does that affect their business performance ?
Well , compare Best Buy ’s price / earnings ratio to that of Amazon ’s .
According to Google Finance Best Buy ’s is 13.91 and Amazon ’s is 67.03 .
I know which one I ’d rather have .
Early adopters DO matter .
Anyone who says that they do n’t needs to go back to business school .
This is why I follow 20,000 Twitterers .
I want to study what early adopters are doing and thinking .
Twitter is the best place — by far — to do that .
That ’s not to say that business people should forget about the late adopters .
They are going to be the ones you need to see huge profitability and growth .
I guarantee you that most of Ansel Adams ’ business is among late adopters now .
But then his business has been in Yosemite for 102 years and has one of America ’s best - known brands .
If you ’re building a business today you do n’t have those advantages .
Your best option is to follow eBay , Amazon , Google , Flickr , Facebook , etc by talking and understanding early adopters first .
Why ?
They are passionate and want to see something new .
That guy with the Windows 2000 old Dell laptop ?
He is n’t looking for anything new .
He is n’t going to adopt your newfangled service .
But the people on Twitter and FriendFeed and Facebook and MySpace and LinkedIn and Plaxo ?
They have already told you they are willing to try new things .
Therefore they are probably going to be willing to try your new thing too .
We ’ll be talking about this in 20 more years when some newfangled thing comes out , though .
Most people have no clue about the role of early adopters , and / or totally misunderstand early adopters and / or even lie about them , hence the “ only Silicon Valley people are on Twitter ” meme .
While we ’re talking about Twitter , Yuvi , the wonderkid in India , did an analysis of my usage of Twitter that ’s pretty interesting .

May we vent for a minute ?
Much as we love technology , sometimes we get fed up with the companies that provide it .
Maybe it 's the notice saying that important features of our perfectly good money - management software no longer work just because it's a couple of years old .
Maybe it 's the new PC we just bought , so loaded with unwanted junkware that it takes minutes to boot and runs like molasses .
Or maybe it 's the way we 're forced to switch to a certain behind - the - times carrier if we want to buy a certain way - cool phone .
( Oh , and that fairly new operating system we do n't like , do n't want , and ca n't escape ?
Do n't even go there . )
Yeah , we 're fed up , all right .
And we 're not the only ones :
We surveyed readers at PCWorld.com and found that you 've had your fill of such annoying policies and practices as well .
( Be sure to see more on the results of our informal poll . )
Hoping for a little retribution -- or at least some explanations -- we went knocking on the doors of Apple , Intuit , Sony , Symantec , and other perpetrators of bad behavior .
We did n't always receive good answers ( or sometimes any answer - - Apple did n't bother to return our calls ) , but we did put these companies on notice : Annoyed customers frequently turn into ex-customers .
Who got served ?
Here 's our list of some of the most annoying practices ( and practitioners ) , along with suggestions for working around the hassles or avoiding them altogether .
From FreeThoughtPedia
" Well evolution is a theory .
It is also a fact .
And facts and theories are different things , not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty .
Facts are the world 's data .
Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts .
Facts do n't go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them .
Einstein 's theory of gravitation replaced Newton 's in this century , but apples did n't suspend themselves in midair , pending the outcome .
And humans evolved from ape - like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin 's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered .
Moreover , " fact " does n't mean " absolute certainty " ; there is no such animal in an exciting and complex world .
The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world .
Evolutionists make no claim for perpetual truth , though creationists often do ( and then attack us falsely for a style of argument that they themselves favor ) .
In science " fact " can only mean " confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent . "
I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow , but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms .
Evolutionists have been very clear about this distinction of fact and theory from the very beginning , if only because we have always acknowledged how far we are from completely understanding the mechanisms ( theory ) by which evolution ( fact ) occurred .
Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments : establishing the fact of evolution , and proposing a theory - - natural selection -- to explain the mechanism of evolution . "
- Stephen J. Gould [ Harvard University ]
Quick evolution primer
Time
First , having a realistic perception of time is a must .
If you put the entire age of the earth into one hour , that is " 4.6 billion years " , the first 50 minutes would be mostly made up of single celled organisms and the last ten minutes made up of animal life -- humans having only been on this planet for about two seconds .
Geological time scale
Layers of earth are arranged in a time sequence , with the oldest on the bottom and the youngest on the top , unless later processes disturb this arrangement .
The age of the layers can be determined using radiometric dating methods and confirmed by other scientists worldwide thereby providing estimates of the age of organisms contained in each layer .
All across our planet we get sequences of fossils found in certain layers of strata .
The types of fossils that are found in these layers are rarely mixed and consist of less complex organisms in lower , older layers and the more complex organisms in the higher , younger layers .
Through this method of analysis , scientists have illustrated life evolving from less complex to more complex organisms .
Transitional fossils
Scientists have found many transitional fossils that have all been chronologically dated that clearly show within millions of years one species evolving into another .
Many organisms do not fossilize due to carbon decay and potential discoveries may be lost as a result ; however , despite this , there are numerous examples of transitional fossils .
In fact , there are so many reptilian / mammal fossils that paleontologists often argue about what to call them , reptile - like mammals or mammal - like reptiles .
Yet , all are in agreement , it is clear that evolutionary transitions are occurring over the course of millions of years .
Other transitional fossils include whales , horses , birds , hominids , etc .
Vestigial structures
Vestigial structures are structures of an organism that have lost all or almost all of their original function through evolution .
Examples include the wings of ostriches , emus , and other flightless birds , which are remnants of their flying ancestors ' wings .
Also , the eyes of certain cavefish and salamanders are vestigial , as they no longer allow the organism to see , and are remnants of their ancestors ' functional eyes .
Homologies
A homology is a character shared between species that was also present in its common ancestor .
Examples include all tetrapods ( four legged creatures ) , which have a basic pentadactyl limb structure ( or five fingers and toes on each hand and foot ) .
The forelimbs of a bat , whale , human and cat are all constructed from the same bones and are morphologically very similar , despite performing different functions .
Embryonic similarities
Sometimes in ontogeny ( embryonic development ) certain features are observable in an organism but in later embryonic stages they disappear .
Such occurrences can help scientists trace an organism 's past thereby helping to place organisms on a more probable phyletic line ( tree of life ) .
Examples include whales and dolphins which have evolved from land mammals , which do not have legs , but instead possess tiny , remnant leg bones that lie buried deep in their bodies .
During embryonic development , leg extremities first occur , then recede .
Similarly , whale embryos ( like all mammalian embryos ) have hair at one stage , but lose most of it later .
Primatology and animal behavior
In birds and mammals the nervous system grew yet more complex , developing a cortex around it .
With the cortex came other new abilities .
A dog chasing a cat around a corner holds some image in its mind of the cat it can no longer see .
Creatures with a cortex have memory and recognition ; they can pay attention and show intention .
With primates the cortex grew into the larger , more complex neo-cortex , adding yet more features to consciousness .
The most significant of these was the ability to use symbols .
Not only did this ability enable simple reasoning , it also led to a new form of communication symbolic language .
Chimpanzees and gorillas may not be able to speak as we do , but this is not because they lack something in their brains ; they lack a voice .
They have no larynx , or voice - box , and cannot move their tongues as freely as we can .
But they can use other forms of symbolic language .
When taught sign language , such as that used by the deaf , they show a remarkable ability to communicate .
Coco , a gorilla in California , now has a vocabulary of more than a thousand words , and composes sentences in sign language .
The Process of Evolution
Gene flow
Gene flow is the introduction of genetic material ( through reproduction ) from one population of a species to another , thereby changing the composition of the gene pool of the population .
The introduction of new characteristics through gene flow increases the variability of genetic material within the population and makes possible new combinations of traits .
Gene flow usually comes about through migration .
Mutation
According to their evolutionary significance , three kinds of mutations can be distinguished :
beneficial
neutral
deleterious
Ken Miller on Genetic evidence of evolution :
Individuals with genotypes that contain a beneficial mutation will be favored by natural selection since the organism will survive long enough to reproduce and pass its genetic material to its offspring .
However , since almost all conceivable beneficial mutations of a population in a stable environment have already been selected in the recent past , the occurrence of new beneficial mutations is rather rare .
Mutations that do not affect the fitness of the phenotype , so - called neutral mutations , are frequent ..
Finally , deleterious mutations will be selected against and will be eliminated in due time since the mutation may be detrimental to the survival of the organism .
And , if the organism is not capable of surviving long enough to reproduce and pass its genetic material to its offspring , then the likelihood is that this mutation may not be distributed throughout the population .
Genetic drift
Genetic drift is the change in the pool of genes of a small population that takes place strictly by chance .
Genetic drift can result in genetic traits being lost from a population or becoming widespread in a population without respect to the survival or reproductive value of the gene pairs ( alleles ) involved .
A random statistical effect , genetic drift can occur only in small , isolated populations in which the gene pool is small enough that chance events can change its genetic makeup substantially .
In larger populations , any specific allele is carried by so many individuals that it is almost certain to be transmitted by some of them unless it is biologically unfavorable .
Natural selection
Natural selection is the process by which favorable traits that are inheritable become more common in successive generations of a population of reproducing organisms , and unfavorable traits that are inheritable become less common .
An understanding of the nature of populations is of the utmost importance for an understanding of evolution , because all evolution , and particularly selection , takes place within populations .
The concept of natural selection is based on observations of the natural world .
Almost every species produces vastly more offspring than can survive from generation to generation .
All the individuals of a population slightly differ genetically from each other ( variation ) and as they are exposed to the adversity of the environment , some of these organisms may perish and fail to reproduce .
On the other hand , some will survive and reproduce .
These survivors are not a random sample of the population ; their survival was aided by the possession of certain attributes that favored survival .
As a result , the traits that allowed the parents to survive and pass down to their offspring will likely be contained in the population and continuously passed down to new generations of offspring .
Keep in mind that natural selection is only one process of evolution and should not be used to replace the term , " Evolution " .
Instead , evolution consists of multiple processes as described above , which include natural selection , gene flow , genetic drift , and mutations .
The two steps of Evolution
Thus , evolution can be viewed as a two step process :
The origin of genetic variation by mutation or recombination ; followed by changes in the frequencies of alleles ( variants of a gene ) and genotypes , caused chiefly by genetic drift or natural selection .
The Chronology
Many species have been analyzed and observed to change into another within millions of years , dinosaurs to birds , land animals to whales , manatees , and other aquatic mammals .
The same can be said for humans , what we need is to form a chronology of an animal transitioning to another , we need DNA sequencing to match predicted ancestry , we need many fields of science all correlating to point at one answer .
And that is exactly what we have in regards to human evolution , not only would it be perverse to deny all the evidence but evolution via descent with modification is the only scientific model that exists .
Becoming human
The chronological sequence of hominid fossils we have unearthed clearly shows a transitioning from a quadrupedal ( walking on four limbs ) to a bipedal ( walking on two limbs ) creature .
Also , the transition of the last approximately six million years has revealed a transformation from hominids that were adapted to climbing trees .
The brain size in modern hominids compared to early hominids has doubled , the face has become much less protruding , our legs have grown longer , our arms shorter , our fingers less curved ( since we do n't live in trees anymore ) .
Also , we humans have evolutionary baggage ( vestiges ) that we can see today , for example , we have wisdom teeth that most often do not fin in our mouths , why ?
Because early hominids had bigger jaws for chewing thick vegetation .
To correlate with a strictly to mostly vegetarian diet , we have an appendix which is found in herbivore animals and helps digests vegetation , there is many more human vestiges the list goes on and on .
Pretty much every portion of anatomy has and is being observed to have evolved from ape - like creatures who walked the savannas in Africa millions of years ago .
To match the sequence of transitional fossils over millions of years we have the geographic distributing of fossils spangled about in east and southern Africa for the early more ape - like hominids then slowly easing out of Africa and becoming more human - like .
To add to the evidence we have an advancement in tool use to correlate with the fossils , we can see that innovation evolved too , less to more complex tools .
Along with the fossils and tools we have genetics , in our DNA we have genetic markings , with that we can trace someone back to their original location or tribe , with genetic markings we have matched what evolution has predicted , mankind originating in Africa ( The cradle of mankind ) .
Genetic evidence for Evolution
What else do we see today that is evidence for common ancestry ?
Genetic similarities increase when compared to animals that share a closer relationship with us , for example .
Another human
100 % - All humans have the same genes
A chimpanzee 98 % - Chimpanzees are the closest living species to humans .
A mouse 92 % - All mammals are quite similar genetically .
A fruit fly 44 %
Yeast 26 %
Plant 18 %
Not only do we share over a 98 % DNA code with chimpanzees but we also share many homologous non-functional genes with chimps .
Perhaps the Chromosome 2 fusion is the most striking , please watch Ken Miller explain , he does it a lot better than I could .

Windows has put on a lot of weight over the years .
Beginning as a thin veneer for older software code , it has become an obese monolith built on an ancient frame .
Adding features , plugging security holes , fixing bugs , fixing the fixes that never worked properly , all while maintaining compatibility with older software and hardware  is there anything Windows does n’t try to do ?
Painfully visible are the inherent design deficiencies of a foundation that was never intended to support such weight .
Windows seems to move an inch for every time that Mac OS X or Linux laps it .
The best solution to the multiple woes of Windows is starting over .
Completely .
Now .
Vista is the equivalent , at a minimum , of Windows version 12  preceded by 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 3.1 , NT , 95 , NT 4.0 , 98 , 2000 , ME , XP .
After six years of development , the longest interval between versions in the previous 22 - year history of Windows , and long enough to permit Apple to bring out three new versions of Mac OS X , Vista was introduced to consumers in January 2007 .
When I.T. professionals and consumers got a look at Vista , they all had this same question for Microsoft :
That ’s it ?
BANGKOK 
In the strongest remarks yet by a high - ranking American official , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Sunday that Myanmar was guilty of “ criminal neglect ” for blocking large - scale international aid to cyclone victims , and that more Burmese civilians would perish unless the military regime reversed its policy .
But despite the rising anger and frustration with Myanmar ’s military leaders , Mr. Gates said that defense ministers meeting in Singapore over the weekend had unanimously opposed any plan to violate Burmese sovereignty and forcibly provide relief supplies .
As a result , he said , it was probably a matter of days before the Pentagon withdrew four Navy ships carrying supplies that have been “ steaming in circles ” for days in the waters off Myanmar ’s coast , waiting in vain for permission to ferry their cargo to areas hit by the storm .
“ It ’s becoming pretty clear that the regime there is not going to let us help , ” Mr. Gates told reporters in Singapore before he headed to Bangkok on the third leg of a weeklong trip to Asia .
“ I ’d say that unless the regime changes its approach , changes its policy , more people will die . ”
Last month , on the official Android discussion group , David " Lefty " Schlesinger posted a message that questioned the open sourciness of Google 's fledgling mobile platform .
And he was promptly muzzled by Google developer advocate Dan Morrill .
" Now I 'm moderated , " says Lefty , an open source guru with Access , the Japan - based mobile software outfit .
" I can't post anything unless Google approves it first . "
Granted , it was n't the most diplomatic of messages .
It actually quoted from The Reg . And Lefty had been floating such notes for quite awhile .
In the end , he was probably muzzled for reasons that extend beyond his views on software development .
But his story is still a nice metaphor for Google 's relationship with certain parts of the open source community .
Google refers to Android as an open source platform .
But at the moment , it 's not .
The company is privately developing this " complete mobile stack " in tandem with 34 mobile - industry partners , and it wo n't actually open things up until version one debuts on phones sometime later this year .
Lefty , like other hard core open source types , thinks this is a tad disingenuous .
" They want to maintain a facade of being non-evil open source guys , " Lefty tells us .
" But they really want to retain very tight control over this .
They 're being proprietary while maintaining an appearance of open source . "
Morrill did n't respond to our requests for comment .
But last week , during a press conference at the Google I/O developer gathering in San Francisco , when we asked Android product manager Andy Rubin about these claims , he argued that many open source projects start out closed .
And he reiterated that once version one is released , the platform will truly be open .
Or at least , most of it will be open .
He did say that code related to " certain Google - specific services " will remain closed .
Like many developers who turned up at I/O , Lefty also complains that Android uses its very own Java virtual machine .
" So not only have they strayed away from mainstream open source , " he told us .
" They 've strayed away from mainstream Java .
They 're forking projects all over the place . "
But Rubin had an answer for this as well .
Speaking at another Google I/O session , he said that Google chose to build its own Java virtual machine - known as Dalvik - in part because the company wants to open source the thing under the same Apache license as the rest of Android 's user - space code .
Java uses the GPL 2 license .
The Apache license , Rubin said , will allow anyone to modify Android code without giving it back to the community .
" They can add to it .
They can remove from it .
They make it their own , " he said .
" They can rip out all the Google stuff and put in all Yahoo ! stuff . "
From Google 's perspective , this will foster a broader adoption of the platform .
But some argue it will also drive market fragmentation .
You wo n't have one Android .
You 'll have many .
Maybe this is what Google wants : a fragmented operating system market where its cross- platform web apps have a distinct advantage .
But this could make life difficult for smaller developers trying gain their own foothold .
" I see Android and I see all its APIs .
What 's to stop someone from turning off all those APIs ? " one developer asked Rubin at Google I/O. " Nothing , " Rubin replied .
But he did say Google will provide tools that help developers verify the makeup of each vendor 's Android platform .
Lefty also hoisted the fragmentation argument onto the Android discussion group - and it probably hastened his muzzling .
The group is billed as a " Free- wheeling discussion , from ideas about the Android platform to your announcements on other Android resources . "
But the freewheeling only goes so far .
In other words , the Android discussion group is kinda like Android itself : Open but not open .
Of course , it 's Google 's mobile platform .
And it 's Google 's discussion group .
The company can do what it wants .
The question is how successful its platform will be .
Will fragmentation actually stunt adoption ?
We shall see . ®
Update :
If you are interested in Python 3 you might also like my book Porting to Python 3 – An in - depth guide .
In the python - incompatibility project I ’ve added loads of code that works under 2.5 but does not work under Python 3.0 .
I ’ve also added code on how to re-write the code so that it will run under both 2.6 and 3.0 .
Quite a lot of time , the rewritten code will run not only under 2.6 and 3.0 , but also under 2.5 !
This may be surprising , but the reason is that you in 2.x is able to do a lot of bad things that you ca n’t do in 3.0 .
One example is using the keys of a dictionary as a list .
For example , this code is valid in 2.x :
d = {'key1 ' : ' value1 ' , ' key2 ' : ' value2 ' , ' key3 ' : ' value3 ' , } d.values ( ) [ 1 ]
But doing that is a bad idea .
The keys of a dictionary is n’t sorted , so you do n’t know which one you get back .
Of course , if you are going through all the keys , that ’s OK , but that would mean you are doing some sort of basic newbie mistake , like
for i in len ( d.keys ( ) ) : key = d.keys ( ) [ i ]
When you should be doing
for key in d.keys ( ) :
Now , in Python 3 you simply cannot slice the keys of a dictionary , because . keys ( ) does n’t return a list , but a view , which is n’t sliceable .
So , these kinds of bad programming can’t happen in Python 3 .
Or , well , they can , but you need to also explicitly convert keys ( ) to a list , so it ’s unlikely you do it by mistake , which can happen under 2.5 , where one person can start slicing a list without noticing that it comes from a dictionary further up in code that somebody else wrote .
So in 3.0 you have to intentionally create bad code in situations where it could happen by mistake in 2.x .
I like Python 3 . Python 2 rocks .
Python 3 is metal !

Another mass shooting stopped by a carry permit holder :
In the small town of Winnemucca Nevada a man bent on performing a mass shooting at a bar was stopped by an armed CCW permit holder who happened to be in the right place at the right time .
The alleged mass murderer had already killed two victims & had injured two others with gunshot wounds , but while he was reloading he was shot & killed by an armed CCW permit holder who was also at the bar .
Mass murderers stopped by armed citizens seems to be a theme .
In Tennessee , House Speaker Naifeh keeps killing the bill that allows handgun carry permit holders to carry where alcohol is served .

Hospital authorities in India have ordered an independent inquiry after a baby was declared dead , only to make an apparently miraculous return to life .
The baby girl - born in the city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) - was diagnosed as stillborn on Monday night .
But she astonished her distraught family by gurgling as they took her off to the cemetery the next day .
It is thought she revived after the effect of drugs - given to her mother during a complicated labour - wore off .
Hospital authorities say they are now investigating possible negligence by staff who attended the birth .
' Limp at birth ' " We have to fix responsibility , " said Dr Suleiman Merchant , acting dean of Sion Hospital in Mumbai where the child was delivered .
Under such circumstances , it would appear that doctors had no reason to assume that the baby was dead
Dr Suleiman Merchant
" The doctors who were on duty are being questioned and the inquiry will last the entire day . "
Correspondents say that it is not clear when or even if the results of the independent inquiry will be made public .
Dr Merchant said that the 30 - year - old mother of the child - who was seven months pregnant - suffered life threatening convulsions and high blood pressure over the weekend , which required powerful medicines .
He said that that the doctors believed that the baby - who was limp at birth - had no heart beat and no pulse .
She was given a death certificate on Tuesday morning and two hours later her body was handed over to her parents .
But later , when the effect of medicines wore off , Dr Merchant said that the baby " showed attempts to breathe " .
" Under such circumstances , it would appear that doctors had no reason to assume that the baby was dead , " he said .
" There is on the face of it a case of negligence to be answered . "
As the grieving parents made their way to the cemetery , the baby reportedly started gurgling and was rushed back to the hospital .
She is reported still to be in a critical condition and is on a ventilator .
Medical experts say the most likely explanation for what happened is that drugs given to the mother suppressed the baby 's heart beat - which would have grown stronger once the effects of the drugs wore off .

Carrefour Censorship on Google.cn Continues
Three days ago I sent a first email to Google in regards to the Carrefour query censorship we see on Google.cn – searches for 家乐福 ( French hypermarket chain Carrefour ) are turning up no results .
I ’ve also sent follow - up emails to Google press US and Germany and asked employees of the company .
Google press support is keeping quiet on this topic though , making no comment so far ( perhaps they ’re busy or need more time , and are overwhelmed by requests ) .
However , in the meantime one good source told me the censorship is indeed by Google , and not due to some direct technical interception .
If the message is by any chance deceptive , this person may have been deceived too , though .
Until Google gives out an official word on this , it ’s hard to tell for sure .
But here ’s a recap of the scope of this censorship ( note that sometimes , different data centers return slightly different result counts ; also note that some numbers overlap so they ca n’t be added up at all times , e.g. a blog post is a also a web page ) :
Search type Result count estimate for 家乐福 on Google.cn ( Google China ) Result count estimate for 家乐福 on Google.com , Chinese language Web pages 0 7,160,000 Images 0 242,000 News articles 0 10,692 Videos 0 2,397 Blog postings 0 977,110 Books 0 602
I had problems testing some services , like Google Maps .
Google also has services to which there is no direct US counterpart – like Google Dao Hang and Rebang – which are completely censored too for this query .
Other search engines in China show censored results too ( according to some reports , even the Chinese Carrefour homepage was down for days due to being hacked ) .
Variants of the query in question , like writing [ 家乐福 test ] , do not result in the near - blank page but show results ( though they may still return partly censored results due to the ongoing domain censorship , which becomes active when you search for e.g. [ 家乐福 democracy ] ) .
If Google did not do this censorship themselves , then a question that arises is how they feel about their brand being kidnapped by interceptors .
If Google indeed censored this term based on some government instruction , then I ’m curious about the following things , to begin with :
What kind of government instruction was it that demanded Google do this ?
Did Google ’s legal department check the basis for the order , and if so , what did they conclude ?
Did Google ’s search quality team check the censorship and evaluate it , and if so , to what conclusions did they come ?
Google states they ’re doing the China censorship as a compromise to give a better offering to Chinese users .
But it seems only if we have more transparency on the issue can we make up our own minds and evaluate their moves .
Back in 2006 , Google ’s director of research and former director of search quality , Peter Norvig , said :
And sure they [ Chinese ] want to know about democracy and Falun Gong and so on , but really they want to know about their day - to - day information .
And they want to know about things like outbreaks of bird flu and so on .
And so we ’re giving them that and we think that ’s the most important . (...)
Some of the people will want to query about democracy , but most of them just want to know about their pop stars .
Incidentally , not only was [ bird flu ] partly censored in 2006 and still is partly censored in Google today ( to follow - up on the English query of Peter ’s example , though many Chinese queries are censored too ) , but it may also be likely that the current more complete censorship of Carrefour was picked precisely because it was a query of such frequent and recent interest among some Chinese .

Lately I 've stumbled upon some good blog posts about being open and transparent in business .
One of the reasons why I 've always thought blogging was good for businesses ( not all , but many of them ) is that it lets you showcase your knowledge and be seen as an expert by your customers .
Being transparent in business takes this a few steps further and helps establish an even deeper connection with your customers .
According to Court 's Internet Marketing School , being transparent has the following benefits :
Your customers are more knowledgeable about you and your business
You establish a sense of trust upfront by being transparent
Others value your honesty and are drawn to you in the process
Back when I used to work for a sports agency / consultant I always wished we would blog .
Many advertising agencies blog , so why are so many sports marketing agencies and businesses not doing it ?
We had a collection of some of the smartest individuals in the sports business industry but the fear was that blogging about what we do would give away valuable information to competitors .
Now , I do n't really know any business that has a 100 % transparency policy , but even if you do give away something of value , someone else still has to do the work .
But blogging and showing that you can offer good insights and smart thinking can be the best form of PR or business development you can do .
That said , I still understood the hesitation to jump into this , since no other competitor was really doing it , either .
So what if you 're scared that you 're giving away too many things ?
Social media legend Neil Patel said in a recent interview , " And the main key to my success was that I let everything out .
Because sooner or later others are going to know what you know , so might as well be the one to tell them . "
Also , you do n't have to always write about your business .
You can write about notable events in the industry and what you see others doing right / wrong .
If you do n't even want to write the blog , just hire me and I 'll write it for you - as long as we 're transparent about it :)
There are tons of sports blogs , but I 'm still waiting for agencies in the sports business world to catch up with advertising in terms of taking advantage of blogs and social media to position an agency as an expert and spread influence .
The only sports agency ( that I know of ) right now that is really involved with blogging is Dynasty Reps .
Its founder , Darren Heitner , could probably tell you that he owes just about all of his success to blogging , being transparent , and using his blog to build his reputation .
I think there 's a huge opportunity for a sports marketing agency ( or two or three ) to start blogging and generate some buzz in the industry while building a reputation .
Why do you think the sports business world is behind advertising in terms of blogging ?
Is it just that sports marketers and agents are n't around new technology as much as ad agency people ?
Do you think the lack of blogging by sports agencies will change soon ?
I 'd love to hear what you think .

Play Quest for the Crown
Washington 's power elite are no strangers to cloak and dagger politics , but there was consternation yesterday as the media discovered it had been outfoxed by the two most recognisable people in America , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
They managed to disappear in plain sight , dropping off the map to hold secret talks , their first private meeting since becoming rivals for the US presidency .
The entourage of camera crews , bloggers and old - fashioned print journalists that follows Mr Obama around the country , only learnt it had been hoodwinked – that the candidate was not on board the campaign plane – as the engines were warming up for takeoff .
And as the Boeing 757 sped down the runway at Dulles international airport bound for Mr Obama 's home base in Chicago , frantic journalists whipped out their BlackBerrys to file alerts .
The ABC News correspondent Sunlen Miller reported that Mr Obama , who had just headlined a huge rally in Virginia , had given them the slip .
" I sent it as the wheels were going up , " she recounted , describing the dismay of her colleagues .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The intrigue began much earlier in the afternoon , when the California senator Dianne Feinstein , a long - time backer of Mrs Clinton , received a call from her close friend , asking to use her home for a meeting with Mr Obama .
" They just want an opportunity to meet together alone , " she said , revealing that the meeting started about 9 pm .
" I received them .
Put them in the living room , two comfortable chairs facing one another and left , " she said .
There were no staff , note - takers or security , just water for the candidates .
One person from each campaign sat in Ms Feinstein 's study .
" They talked .
I went upstairs and did my work . "
More than an hour passed , after which " they called me when it was over .
I came down and I said , ' Good night everybody .
I hope you had a good meeting ' .
They were laughing , and that was it . "
Ms Feinstein refused to give any further details about the conversation , noting only that " they got along very well " .
The outcome of their tête- à- tête could prove crucial to Mr Obama 's chances of being elected in November .
Notwithstanding speculation about the vice - presidential slot on the Democratic ticket , Mrs Clinton is now in a position to help or harm his candidacy .
After winning 18 million votes , she has emerged as a much more powerful national politician .
" When she began this campaign , she was still the former first lady , the senator married to President Clinton , " commented Michael Berman , a Democratic strategist .
" I think she is now the Clinton . "
But the first thing she needs to do is secure her own future .
To do that , she needs to put her heart and soul into campaigning for Mr Obama in the coming months or be damned for being disloyal .
She cannot risk being blamed for another Democratic loss in November , especially as many now believe , she is biding her time for another run at the presidency in 2012 if Mr Obama loses in November or in 2016 is he is successful .
" She 's extraordinarily important to his campaign , " an anonymous Clinton adviser remarked .
" She can help rally the Democratic base and let him focus on swing voters . "

But nobody except the two candidates knows what actually transpired at their meeting and it is thought unlikely that he has asked her to be his running mate in November .
There are lots of other important roles Mrs Clinton could play whether back in the Senate or in an Obama administration .
She might even prefer a job for life as a liberal justice on the Supreme Court .
As the two politicians discussed their tactics for the months ahead , Washington was being treated to an evening of Where 's Wally meets the Keystone Cops .
Camera crews fanned out across the city to track Mr Obama down .
For a man who promises to restore a modicum of honesty to Washington , he revealed himself an adept practitioner in the arts of deception .
Earlier in the day , Mrs Clinton issued a statement playing down speculation that she was seeking to be Mr Obama 's running mate .
Mr Obama said that he expected them to meet " in a couple of weeks " .
Even as the Secret Service delivered the candidate to Ms Feinstein 's house , the city was awash with rumours .
Mr Obama 's staff encouraged speculation that he was meeting Mrs Clinton at her elegant townhouse on Washington 's Whitehaven Street .
For hours CNN long - range cameras were trained on an SUV parked outside Mrs Clinton 's home .
From time to time someone would appear at the front door prompting a buzz of speculation that the two rivals were about to make a joint statement .
It was only when the plane landed two hours later in Chicago that Mr Obama 's communications director Robert Gibbs revealed that a meeting had already taken place between the two .
By that time Mr Obama was already boarding a private jet to Chicago .
After all the intrigue , he is taking a few days off , going on a date with his wife , Michelle , and planning a bike ride with his two young children .
An internal British Telecom report on a secret trial of an ISP eavesdropping and advertising technology found that the system crashed some unsuspecting users ' browsers , and a small percentage of the 18,000 broadband customers under surveillance believed they 'd been infected with adware .
The January 2007 report ( .pdf ) – published Thursday by the whistle blowing site Wikileaks – demonstrates the hazards broadband customers face when an ISP tampers with raw internet traffic for its own profit .
The leak comes just weeks after U.S. broadband provider Charter
Communications told users it would be testing a technology similar to what 's described in the BT document .
The report documents BT 's partnership with U.K. ad company Phorm , which specializes in building profiles of ISP customers , then serving targeted ads on webpages the user visits .
From late September to early October 2006 , British Telecom secretly partnered with Phorm to let the company monitor and track 18,000 of the BT 's customers .
Phorm installed boxes on BT 's network that redirected web requests through their proxy server .
Those boxes inserted JavaScript code into every web page downloaded by the users .
That script then reported back to Phorm the contents of the web page , which Phorm used to create ad profiles of a user .
Additionally , Phorm purchased advertising space on prominent web sites , showing a default ad for a charity .
But when a user who had previously looked at car sites visited one of those pages , he instead got an advertisement for car insurance .
The users were not informed they were being made guinea pigs for a new revenue system for BT and had no way to opt out of the system , according to the report .
The JavaScript caused flickering problems for some users as the script reported back information about the content of the web page to a Phorm server .
The script also crashed browsers that loaded a website that relied excessively on anchor tags .
Additionally , the rogue JavaScript showed up unexpectedly in user 's posts to some web forums .
Despite these problems , the technical assessment concluded the test was successful and was largely went unnoticed by most users .
The operation of the system does have noticeable side effects , which included web - page tag insertion and navigation bar flutter .
From the postings , no user correctly determined the source of these effects and users did not post that the system was causing poor performance .
However all postings suspected that their machines had a virus , a malware or a spyware infection .
Neither Phorm nor BT returned calls seeking comment on the document .
The U.S. 's fourth largest ISP , Charter Communications , is set to test out technology similar to Phorm's in the coming weeks using a U.S. - based company called NebuAd .
After Charter sent out notice of the test to customers , two influential members of the U.S. House of Representatives asked the company to postpone the test , citing possible violation of privacy laws .
Congressman Ed Markey , who chairs a powerful telecom oversight subcommittee , is planning to meet with company representatives next week , according to a spokeswoman .
Charter 's partner , NebuAd , claims to have have applied for a patent for its technology to let users opt - out of having their web sessions eavesdropped on and categorized , but the only patent applied for under its name is one that replaces ads on third - party websites with ads of their own .
BT 's secret test first came to light when one suspicious user contacted The Register about the problem .
At the time , BT denied any involvement , though the company later admitted it had run a secret test and planned to expand the monitoring technology to its entire network .
The newly released documents confirm a further report in The Register in April about the extent of the secret test .

Crap , these graphics look unbelievable compared to anything we 've seen on a cellphone before .
Seriously , these are DS - quality graphics , easily .
We 're in line at the Moscone Center ( which is actually pretty spare at the moment ) , but it 's early .
The media 's got a ton of MacBook Airs .
Stay tuned for our live coverage of the eventPeople are really filing in .
You 've never heard so many people say the word " iPhone " in your life .
Everybody is crowding up at the closed gates , preparing for the Running of the Media .
We 're in !
The cattle rush of the media was pretty mellow this time around .
Shockingly enough , they 're playing oldies -- not the usual soundtrack of Gnarles Barkley , Coldplay , Gorillaz , etc.
People still funneling in -- this auditorium seats thousands of people , so it takes a little while .
Say , is that Gavin Newsom ?
Oh , and there 's Al Gore .
( See , right in the center there . )
Okay , weird , a bunch of attendees just stood up and started clapping -- we do n't know why , since it was n't Jobs ( or so we think ) .
Announcer : " Turn off all cellphones , iPhones , PDAs ... our program will start in a few minutes .
" Lights are coming down !
Crowd beginning to roar !
Music 's over , and here we go ... lights all the way down , Steve 's on stage !
Roar , applause .
" Thank you very much .
I 'm really glad to be here this morning .
We 've been working hard on some great stuff ... thank you for coming to WWDC 2008 .
We 've got a record 5,200 attendees -- we wish we could have had more , but we sold out ! "
" I 'm sorry for all those folks that could n't be here ... we 're going to have a great week this week .
147 sessions , 85 on the Mac , and 62 on the iPhone ... it 's going to be packed !
169 hands - on labs , 1k Apple engineers , iFund and Intel sessions .
I think it 's going to be one of the best WWDCs ever . " " Let 's get started .
As you know there are three parts to Apple -- the first part is Mac , second part is our music business ( iPod and iTunes ) , and the third part is the iPhone .
I 'm going to take this morning to talk about the iPhone .
"
" To help me , I 'm going to ask Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller to help me with parts of this .
Then , after lunch , Bertrand Serlet will give you a sneak peak at the next version of OS X called Snow Leopard . "
" We 've had a beta going ... 35 % of the Fortune 500 has participated in that beta program .
The top 5 banks , top 5 securities firms , 6 or 7 top airlines , 8 of 10 top pharma , and 8 of 10 top entertainment companies . "
" We've had phenomenal participation from higher education .
Again , gotten fantastic feedback .
We made a video of these customers , I 'd love to show it to you ... "
Video time !
Going over some firms , testimonials style .
Great if you care about the petabytes in the datacenters of Disney , we guess .
Still going ... the Army sure does love the new iPhone software !
Steve 's back on : " That gives you a sense of what we 're doing in the enterprise , all this stuff built into iPhone 2.0 .
Next up is the SDK , to take us where we are there and to show us some really exciting stuff , I 'd like to bring up Scott Forstall . "
Applause .
" With the SDK in iPhone 2.0 we 're opening the same native APIs and tools we use internally ... that means you as a dev can build apps for the iPhone the same way we do .
Let 's start by talking about the APIs .
The APIs and frameworks on the iPhone share extensively with OS X ...
We use the same kernel in the iPhone that forms the basis of OS X ... almost all of them share the same source code line - for - line as OS X . "
He 's going over the bits of Core Services : SQL lite , OpenGL ES , OpenAL .
" We top it all off with Cocoa Touch -- our UI object oriented framework , which makes building an app for our fullscreen touch interface an absolute breeze .
We have a great set of APIs .
On top of this we have a really powerful set of tools .
" Going over debugging and Xcode , instruments -- all the stuff from the March iPhone roadmap event .
Demo time !
" I want to concentrate on how we construct a UI ... " making an app called Nearby Friends .
Accesses the contacts database and Core Location to filter all contacts with contacts within 10 mi .
Building the UI with Interface Builder .
Dragging and dropping interface elements .
Okay , Scott , we love what you 've done here , but we 're yawning .
Then again , the thousands of devs in the audience are probably stoked -- those that have n't used the SDK anyway .
The quick - built app is loaded into the simulator and running .
" Now let me take it one step further ... " he 's going to test a tethered app install .
Looks like he 's done , getting a rousing round of applause .
"
We 've got a great set of APIs and a really powerful set of tools .
This has been out about 3 months ... we asked them , what do they think ?
The response were unbelievably positive .
Let me read you some of their quotes ... " Going over quotes flacking the SDK ...
Disney , InfoWorld .
Okay , we get it , you 're preaching to the choir here !
This is the Apple developer conference , after all .
" Thousands of people are building apps ... we were really amazed with the quality of these apps .
We 've invited a number of these devs up here today . "
Sega 's starting out .
" Sega blew us away with what they accomplished in just two weeks with the first cut of Super Monkey Ball ... "
Ethan Einhorn from Sega is taking the stage .
" Back when we showed you SMB in March , our dev team created four stages from scratch in just two weeks of dev time .
8 weeks later we had 110 stages ... they also gave us all four of the classic monkeys ! "
Chuckles ... aww , they 're playing as Baby .
Forstall : next is eBay .
Ken Sun 's on stage .
Demoing bidding , watching items , searching , My eBay , all the usual stuff , and bidding from the app .
That 's nice , but could n't this have been done over the web ?
Next is Loopt , Sam Altman is going to demo .
Man , these demos are crazy boring .
Throw us a bone here Apple !
Loopt will be free on the App Store at launch .
Next is TypePad , a great mobile blogging app .
